As a result, his mother was injured and eventually died from the injuries.\n[7] He and his family then fled to the village of <inaduible>where they had relatives.\n[8] ln 2002, the family left for the safety of Kenya and the claimant stayed there until he left for the United States in 2015.\n[9] In the United States, he made a claim for asylum which was rejected. He subsequently crossed the border into Canada and initiated a claim for refugee protection.\n[10] The key issues in this case were the claimant\u2019s identity, credibility and internal flight alternative.\n[11] His personal and national identity as a citizen of Somalia has been established by his testimony and the evidence presented at his initial hearing which was subsequently confirmed by the Refugee Appeal Division.\n[12] At his de novo hearing today, the claimant testified as to his identity as a member of the XXXX clan and his Sufi religious background. A witness also appeared on his behalf and confirmed that he knows the claimant to be a member of the XXXX clan and his Sufi religious background.\n[13] I am persuaded, on a balance of probabilities, that he is who he says he is with respect to his clan affiliation and religious background.\n[14] I also find that the claimant\u2019s testimony has been consistent and been delivered in a direct manner with a ring of truth. I find him to be a credible witness.\n[15] The most recent information on country conditions indicate that the Somali authorities have limited ability to provide human rights protection to society. The situation in both Mogadishu and Kismayo, though under the control of the African Union Mission in Somalia, continues to be precarious.\n[16] I have considered the claimant\u2019s profile and the current situation in Somalia and whether he could live in either Mogadishu or Kismayo if he was returned to Somalia. Somalia continues to be a dangerous country, especially for members of the minority clans and those who practice less conventional forms of Islam.\n[17] The claimant is also someone who has been out of the country for some 17 years and would find it difficult to assimilate into the current culture and situation.\n[18] He would, therefore, be viewed with suspicion, especially by certain elements, such as, members of Al-Shabaab.\n[19] Having considered the evidence, including his testimony and that of his witness, the claimant\u2019s profile and the current conditions in Somalia, I find that there is a reasonable chance that he would be harmed were he to be returned to Somalia.\n[20] I, therefore, find that he has satisfied the burden of establishing a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground and I, therefore, conclude that he is a Convention refugee and I accept his claim.\n[21] I will return through Counsel, his original documents.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

Lalonde\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): John Rokakis\nCountry: Iraq\nRPD Number: TB6-07934\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2019-00482\nATIP Pages: 001574-001577\nOn January 15, 2019, the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) heard the claim of XXXX, who claims refugee protection under sections 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA). On that same day, the panel rendered its oral positive decision and reasons for decision. This is the written version of the oral decision and reasons that have been edited for clarity, spelling, grammar and syntax with added references to the documentary evidence and relevant case law where appropriate.\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: This is the claim to refugee status made by Madam XXXX file number TB6-07934.1\n[2] The claimant is a citizen of Iraq. An edited copy for clarity, grammar, and syntax will be sent to the claimant and I may add references to documentary evidence or jurisprudence if appropriate.\nDETERMINATION\n[3] I find the claimant a Convention refugee under Section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act2 for the following reasons.\n[4] The claimant arrived in Canada in 2016. She came from XXXX where she was given a protection document from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).3 The claimant had a previous hearing and during that first session she was given a negative decision. The panel had wondered if there was not a possibility for the claimant to return to Lebanon.\nIdentity\n[5] Firstly, I will deal with the issue of identity. The claimant established her identity by providing her passport, a citizenship certificate, as wells as the certificate from the High Commissioner for Refugees.4 There are other documents which do not need to be mentioned.\n[6] There is no doubt that the claimant is an Iraqi citizen.\n[7] The (UNHCR) certificate indicates that the document was only valid until 20l6. It is not a permanent residency status. The Minister acknowledged this (fact). Exhibit 8 and 9 indicate that the documentary evidence before the Minister at this time does not suggest that the claimant has permanent resident status in Lebanon. At exhibit 8, the Minister indicated that the relevant information related to identity and credibility issues is already before the Board. The Minister has nothing else to add and will not intervene on this claim at this time.\n[8] The (identity) concern has been cleared to the satisfaction of the tribunal. Therefore, the case is against Iraq only.\nALLEGATIONS\n[9] The claimant listed the problems that prompted her to leave Iraq in her Basis of Claim (BOC).5\n[10] In a nutshell, the claimant was residing in XXXX with her family. Her brother was kidnapped by ISIS. Her father paid a hefty ransom. He (her brother) was not released even though the ransom had been paid. The army was able to free her brother. Moreover, through all of this they were bombing. The shop of her father was looted and burnt: everything was destroyed. The whole family had to leave XXXX.\n[11] The claimant\u2019s brother and father came to (the hearing) to provide explanations on their residency in XXXX. The panel found the two witnesses credible. They were candid and testified in a straightforward manner. There were no discrepancies between the answers to all questions asked, or with the written statements and previous statements throughout their testimonies.\n[12] The panel has no reasons to doubt the credibility of all the witnesses and including the testimony of the claimant.\nState protection\n[13] Therefore, it leaves the question: what would happen to the claimant should she return to Iraq. As they testified (the claimant and witnesses), as well as in documentation, they are problems \u2026 (still): the situation is still dangerous in Iraq. Documentary evidence supports the claimant\u2019s allegations that (bombing incidents) are occurring even in this (year) early 2019.\n[14] The US Department of State report on Iraq, country reports on human right practices for 2017 for Iraq outlines the general political situation and human lights climate in Iraq is tense. Violence continued throughout the year (2018) largely fuelled by the action of the Islam State in Iraq and Syria ISIS.\n[15] Although Government forces fought to liberate territory taken earlier by ISIS including XXXX, armed clashes between ISIS and government forces caused civilian death and hardship, and indeed security forces had liberated the territory from ISIS drastically reducing ISIS\u2019s ability to commit abuse and atrocities. However, the most significant human rights issues included allegations of unlawful killings by some members of ISF, and particularly some element also of another group PMF. Disappearance, extortion, elements, and torture is also reported.6\n[16] It shows that ISIS committed the majority of serious abuses and atrocities. ISIS members committed acts of violence on a mass scale including killing through suicide bombings and improvise explosive devices, executions including shooting and public beheading, use of civilians as human shields, as well as use of chemical weapons, and the list goes on to include kidnapping, rape, enslavement, forced marriage, and sexual violence.7\n[17] Such acts were committed against civilians from a wide variety of religious and ethnic backgrounds including Shia, Sunnis, Kurds, Christians, and Yiddish.8\n[18] In this kind of climate, as her brother pointed out, the claimant, a woman, cannot live by herself. Of course, in her culture it would be highly risky should she return to Iraq.\n[19] Therefore, whatever progress had been made around XXXX, it\u2019s still a town which is according to the claimant\u2019s brother, 90 percent is destroyed and is not safe. As well they are also bombing in Baghdad and other places. Reports from other sources do report such incidents.\n[20] Therefore, one cannot expect that State protection (to be available)9 in this kind of climate. Moreover, the claimant, according to her allegations is situated in a position where she would still face more than a mere possibility of being persecuted should she go back to Iraq.\n[21] Lastly, those allegations are the same for the whole family. Her father was accepted as a refugee in XXXX 2014.\n[22] For all these reasons her claim is accepted, as I indicated under Section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n\u2014REASONSCONCLUDED\u2014\n1 This is a De Novo hearing pursuant to the claimant\u2019s appeal, which was granted January 23, 2017.\n2 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27 as amended, sections 96 and 97 (1).\n3 The UNHCR Refugee Protection document confers temporary protection against refoulement to Iraq.\n4 Exhibit 1, Package of information from the referring CBSA\/ CIC, photocopies of passport, citizenship certificate and certificate from the High Commissioner for Refugees.\n5 Exhibit 2, Basis of Claim Form (BOC) \u2013 TB6-07934.\n6 Exhibit 3, National Documentation Package (NDP, Item 2.1.\n7 Ibid.\n8 Ibid.\n9 Canada (Attorney General) v.

        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2019 RLLR 218\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: October 22, 2019\nPanel: David D\u2019Intino\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Clement Osawe\nCountry: Mexico\nRPD Number: TB8-15170\nAssociated RPD Number(s): TB8-15187\nATIP Number: A-2020-00859\nATIP Pages: 003052-003066\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (the principal claimant) and her son XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (minor claimant) are both Mexican citizens and claim refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.1\nDESIGNATED REPRESENTATIVE\n[2] The principal claimant was appointed as the designated representative for the minor claimant. Their claims were heard jointly pursuant to rule 55 of the RPD Rules.\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] The claimants\u2019 allegations are fully set out in the principal claimant\u2019s basis of claim (BOC) form and attached narrative.2 To summarize, the principal claimant alleges that her son faces a serious possibility of persecution or a risk to life or of cruel and unusual punishment or treatment in Mexico on account of his diagnosis of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.\nDETERMINATION\n[4] The principal claimant is neither a Convention refugee under s. 96 nor a person in need of protection under s. 97(1), as she has failed to demonstrate a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground, or a personalized, forward-facing risk to life or of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment on a balance of probabilities.\n[5] The minor claimant is a Convention refugee under s. 96. He has established a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground, as a member of a particular social group, persons with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX\nDETERMINATIVE ISSUES\n[6] The determinative issue for the principal claimant was a nexus to the Convention and generalized risk under s. 97.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[7] The claimants\u2019 personal identities as nationals of Mexico were established on a balance of probabilities by their Mexican passports3 and birth certificates4.\nExclusion 1(F)(B)\n[8] On the first date of the hearing, the principal claimant had not provided a consent or family court from Mexico allowing the minor claimant to leave the country and satisfy me that exclusion under article 1(f)(b) was not an issue.\n[9] On that basis, I granted an adjournment to allow the principal claimant to obtain a consent letter signed by the minor claimant\u2019s father and provide that to the Board.\n[10] Subsequently, on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2019, I received said letter5 from XXXX XXXX XXXX who is XXXX father. This latter satisfied my concerns such that I was able to determine that exclusion under article 1(f)(b) was no longer an issue.\nCredibility\n[11] The principal claimant provided testimony on behalf of her son, who is XXXX XXXX XXXX and has significant XXXX deficits. The principal claimant was a credible witness. Her evidence was straightforward and consistent with that of her narrative. She did not embellish her evidence and her testimony was free from any material omissions or contradictions.\n[12] As such, I make the follow findings of fact:\n\nWhen XXXX was approximately XXXX years of age, the principal claimant began to suspect he had some XXXX difficulties. He was only able to speak about ten words; he was not able to get rid of diapers and would become aggressive when he was in places with many people around;In approximately 2011, the principal claimant enrolled her son in the XXXX program which is an educational program in Mexico City for children with XXXX. He was diagnosed accordingly by the program and was assigned to a therapy center;After a few weeks in the program, XXXX expressed a reluctance to return there and the principal claimant indicates that he regressed to soiling himself. The principal claimant confronted the teachers and the headmaster at the school and was told XXXX was not following the rules and was disrupting classes;As a result, XXXX would come home with scratches or irritation on his body. While the school did not admit that their staff was responsible for these marks, the principal claimant felt that the headmaster was communicating \u201cwith a smirk or a smile\u201d that they were acknowledging responsibility;The principal claimant kept XXXX in the program for a while to see if things improved but when they did not, she removed him from XXXX the following year when he was XXXX years old;When XXXX was XXXX years old, the principal claimant registered him at XXXX XXXX a government funded school for children with disabilities. XXXX remained in that program for one year. There was a ratio of about one teacher for every ten to thirteen children, and the minor claimant was very nervous there. He would be screamed at for not complying with the teachers directions and would start to cry;After removing him from XXXX XXXX the principal claimant did not enroll XXXX in any further programming;The principal claimant does not receive any financial assistance for XXXX from the child\u2019s father. She had worked as a XXXXand aXXXX XXXX until the age of XXXX in Mexico and stopped working when she married. Subsequent to that, she sold XXXX XXXX from home and also worked at a XXXX XXXX or similar business;The principal claimant has been on a waiting list in Mexico for government assistance for her son since 2012. Her application has not yet been decided on. She was able to pay a small amount for the XXXXandXXXX XXXX programs from her own earnings, but was unable to afford more expensive therapies through the Mexico City XXXX XXXX;The principal claimant alleges XXXX is discriminated against by friends and family. For example, her friends don\u2019t allow their children to interact with XXXX out of fear. Her sister and brother-in-law physically abused XXXX when she would leave him in their care to go to work;The principal claimant has two other children, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXand XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX who reside with her spouse, from whom she is separated. Those children \u201ccannot stand\u201d their brother and do not help with his care;Parents and members of the community would keep their distance from the minor claimant or give him odd looks. Children his age would mock him and push him around;The principal claimant fears that if returned to Mexico, XXXX would be physically and XXXX mistreated and could end up \u201cdisappeared\u201d \u2013 Mexican parlance referring to being kidnapped or killed and never found;NEXUS\n[13] I find that the minor claimant has a nexus to the Convention as a member of a particular social group, persons with XXXX XXXX XXXX. Relying on the Supreme Court of Canada decision in Ward6, I find that the minor claimant\u2019s diagnosis on the XXXX XXXX constitutes \u201can innate and unchangeable characteristic\u201d for which the principal claimant alleges he is being persecuted by Mexican society in general. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is classified as a neurodevelopmental disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder version 5 (DSM V) which is published by the American Psychiatric Association.7\n[14] I find that the principal claimant does not have a nexus to the Convention, as she has not alleged a serious possibility of persecution by reason of her race, nationality, ethnicity, political opinion, religion or membership in a particular social group. I likewise find that the NDP for Mexico8 does not support a serious possibility that she would be persecuted as a member of XXXX family nor did she make such allegations.\n[15] The principal claimant did profess a fear of \u201cgeneral instability\u201d in Mexico related to criminal activity. Criminal acts do not generally establish a nexus to a Convention ground.9\n[16] As such I find that her fear is best assessed under s. 97(1) of the IRPA.\nSubjective Fear\n[17] As XXXX is non-verbal, the evidence in this claim was entered by the principal claimant on his behalf. I have already found her evidence to be credible on a balance of probabilities. I likewise find that there is no evidence of action or inaction on the part of the claimants that could be seen as being inconsistent with a professed subjective fear of persecution in Mexico.\n[18] Based on those conclusions I do find that the minor claimant has established a subjective fear of persecution on a Convention ground.\nObjective Basis\nDoes the mistreatment of persons with XXXX in Mexico rise to the level of persecution?\n[19] In order to ground a successful claim under s. 96, the principal claimant must demonstrate a serious possibility of persecution to her son, on the basis of his XXXX diagnosis. Therefore, I must consider now whether the mistreatment of her son specifically, and in the broader sense, the mistreatment of persons with disabilities in Mexico generally, amounts to persecution.\n[20] Persecution is a nebulous concept, in that it does not have a neat and tidy definition. Rather, as a concept it is explained more so by the presence of certain factors in a given scenario, or conversely, by what it is not.\n[21] First, to be considered persecution, the mistreatment suffered or anticipated must be serious.10 I then must examine firstly, what interest of the claimant might be harmed and secondly, to what extent the subsistence, enjoyment, expression or exercise of that interest might be compromised. There must be a link between the serious, compromising of interest with the denial of a core human right.11\n[22] I must also consider whether the conduct being complained of rises to the level of persecution, or where it amounts merely to discrimination \u2013 the distinction being the degree of serious of the harm involved.12 The Court of Appeal has observed that \u201cthe dividing line between persecution and discrimination or harassment is difficult to establish\u201d.13\n[23] A second feature of persecution is that the harm occurs with repetition, persistence or in a systemic way.14 There are however some harms, such as female genital mutilation or death, which imply a degree of permanence such that they cannot be, or are unlikely to be, repeated. It is trite law however, that a claimant need not demonstrate that they have suffered incidents of past persecution to be a successful refugee claimant, as the test is forward-looking.\n[24] Lastly, I must also consider whether acts of discrimination cumulatively amount to persecution against a claimant. Where the RPD considers these incidents individually, but not cumulatively, its commits a reversible error.15\n[25] Turning now to the facts of this case, I must apply the law to the facts to determine whether the treatment XXXX has received in Mexico rises to the level of persecution, such that he has a well-founded fear of same, as contemplated by section 96 of IRPA.\n[26] The first incident concerns his treatment at XXXX XXXX where the principal claimant indicated that XXXX would come home with marks and irritation on his skin and would revert to soiling himself. The agent of persecution in this situation are the instructors and staff at XXXX. The conduct in question is difficult to assess because the minor claimant is unable to express himself due to his XXXX limitations. The principal claimant is effectively deducing what occurred her son based on her observations of his behaviour.\n[27] The principal claimant did not specifically assert that XXXX was mistreated at XXXX because of his diagnosis of XXXX. She in fact was unsure of whether the real cause of this mistreatment was as a result of the staff not having the training or the temperament to deal with the special needs of a child like XXXX XXXX XXXX did not admit to physically disciplining XXXX but rather, retorted that he was disruptive in the classroom or was not obeying the rules.\n[28] I have no reservation in finding that XXXX was physically disciplined at XXXX for some reason and that such treatment was inappropriate and would constitute a criminal offence if committed in Ontario. However, I do not find on a balance of probabilities that such mistreatment occurred by reason of his diagnosis of XXXX.\n[29] The second incident concerns the treatment of the minor claimant at the XXXX program. The principal claimant explained that there would be one teacher for approximately 10-13 children and they would scream at XXXX for not listening to their directions. He would then become upset and would start crying and tell his mother that he wanted to leave.\n[30] The agent of persecution in this instance are the teachers and staff at the XXXX program. Again, due to his XXXX limitations I am unable to hear from XXXX precisely what occurred during this time. In contrast to the incidents at XXXX, the principal claimant in this case was able to observe the yelling at her son by staff at XXXX and thus provide first-hand evidence.\n[31] Compared to the previous incident, the conduct in this case is less severe. The agent of persecution is not the same. While I find that yelling at a child with special needs is repugnant, I do not find that this conduct rises to the level of persecution, as it does not amount to the denial or interference with a core human right.\n[32] The third incident I must consider involved the treatment of XXXX by the principal claimant\u2019s brother-in-law. The principal claimant testified that she would leave XXXX in the care of her sister and brother-in-law for a time while she went to work. She would then start to see bruising on XXXX body, on his cheek and mouth. He would beg his mother not to go. When the principal claimant confronted her sister, the latter claimed to have no seen what happened. The brother-in-law admitted that he \u201coverdid it\u201d and that the child could not clean himself properly and wasted too much toilet paper. The principal claimant stopped having her son cared for by her sister and brother-in-law as a result.\n[33] The agent of persecution in this situation was the principal claimant\u2019s brother-in-law. The degree of harm was most severe in this situation and in my view does rise to a level where one of XXXX core human rights was interfered with \u2013 his right to security of the person.\n[34] Much like in the previous two instances, the principal claimant herself has acknowledged the possibility that her son is being mistreated because those caregivers are ill-equipped to deal with a child with his needs. Certainly, caring for a child with special needs requires a certain type of person, one who is blessed with patience, compassion and understanding. It is conceivable that a person who lacks these qualities when placed in a situation where they are caring for 10-13 other children, would become overwhelmed and frustrated. The fact remains however that whomever cares for this child, they mistreat him in some way. Whether they do so out of frustration or because of his disability, the effect on XXXX is the same.\n[35] Cumulatively assessing these incidents, I find that though they involve three different agents of persecution and three differing degrees of conduct, they form a pattern of discrimination or outright abuse which endangers the minor claimant\u2019s security of the person.\n[36] I therefore find that these past incidents cumulatively amount to persecution on a Convention ground. I will now turn to the NDP to analyze whether there is a serious future possibility of persecution for the minor claimant, should they return to Mexico.\n[37] The National Documentation Package (NDP) for Mexico16 is sparse with regard to its analysis of the situation for persons with disabilities in Mexico. Item 2.1, the U.S. DoS Report on Human Rights Practices for 2018 says the following on this issue:\nThe law prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, sensory, intellectual, and mental disabilities. The government did not effectively enforce the law. The law requires the Ministry of Health to promote the creation of long-term institutions for persons with disabilities in distress, and the Ministry of Social Development must establish specialized institutions to care for, protect, and house poor, neglected, or marginalized persons with disabilities.\nNGOs reported authorities had not implemented programs for community integration. NGOs reported no changes in the mental health system to create community services nor any efforts by authorities to have independent experts monitor human rights violations in psychiatric institutions. Public buildings and facilities often did not comply with the law requiring access for persons with disabilities.\nThe education system provided special education for students with disabilities nationwide. Children with disabilities attended school at a lower rate than those without disabilities.\nAbuses in mental health institutions and care facilities, including those for children, were a problem. Abuses of persons with disabilities included the use of physical and chemical restraints, physical and sexual abuse, trafficking, forced labor, disappearance, and the illegal adoption of institutionalized children.\nInstitutionalized persons with disabilities often lacked adequate medical care and rehabilitation services, privacy, and clothing; they often ate, slept, and bathed in unhygienic conditions. They were vulnerable to abuse from staff members, other patients, or guests at facilities where there was inadequate supervision. Documentation supporting the person\u2019s identity and origin was lacking. Access to justice was limited.\n[38] What I take from this report is that while Mexico has well-intentioned legislation on the books, the actual implementation of those laws is lacking and that has in part, led to inadequate conditions and even exploitation of persons with disabilities in institutionalized settings.\n[39] While these observations from institutional settings do not have an immediate factual nexus to the facts before me, I must consider the forward-facing nature of any risk or serious possibility of persecution to the minor claimant.\n[40] Exhibit 7 is a Response to Information Request (RIR) I asked to be commissioned for this claim. It examines the situation in Mexico for persons with autism and intellectual disabilities.\n[41] The RIR notes that an estimated 1 in every 115 children are on the autism spectrum in Mexico, totalling approximately 400,000 children living with the diagnosis throughout the country17.\n[42] According to the RIR18:\nA 2008 study on autism and special education policy in Mexico reports the following:\nGiven the social stigma associated with disability, the incidence of autism among children within the family can magnify many other challenges Mexican families may encounter \u2026 . Due to the persistence of folk beliefs and misinformation about the sources of disability, families with children with autism report isolation or distance from other members of their extended family, changed behaviors among siblings, and feelings ranging from depression to burnout. [Lack of sufficient] [e]conomic resources are [a] frequently cited cause of familial stress, as parents attempt to secure the necessary funds to find appropriate support services or treatment for their child. (Tuman, et al. Apr. 2008, 4)\nThe Mexican government, in its combined second and third periodic reports to the UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, states the following:\nEducational institutions are taking steps to raise awareness about persons with disabilities as rights holders. From 2014 to 2017, campaigns were conducted to provide information and raise awareness about different types of disability, such as autism [and] Down syndrome \u2026 , and about the Day of Persons with Disabilities, so as to promote harmonious relations and acceptance, eliminate barriers to learning and encourage participation. (Mexico 19 July 2018, para. 55)\nArticles published by CE Noticias Financieras similarly mention there has been activities to raise awareness about autism in Mexico, such as conferences (CE Noticias Financieras 7 Sept. 2018) and the World Day of Autism Awareness (CE Noticias Financieras 2 Apr. 2019).\n[43] The RIR notes that there is a new Mental Health bill under review in Mexico, as well as a new general law which would increase protections for persons with XXXX.19 These laws are currently being examined, in part due to concerns raised by Human Rights organizations that certain provisions could violate the rights of concerned persons, for example, by legalizing involuntary admissions to psychiatric facilities or authorizing non-consensual medical treatment.\n[44] Mexico does have a number of publically and privately funded institutions which assist with the diagnosis, treatment and education of persons with XXXX. The RIR lists among them the Centra Integral de Salud Mental (CISAME); Clinica de Autismo; Autisimex; and Clinica Mexicana de Autismo U Alteraciones del Desarrollo20. With the exception of CISAME \u2013 of which the principal claimant was aware of and indicated that their services were not free \u2013 she was not aware of the existence of these other organizations, most of which are either publically funded or are non-profit organizations.\n[45] I find that there is support in the NDP and the RIR for an objective basis to the principal claimant\u2019s fear, in the sense that inadequate medical care and even outright exploitation of persons in institutionalized settings occurs in Mexico, such that a forward-facing serious possibility of persecution does exist for XXXX.\n[46] XXXX has no cure. XXXX turned XXXXthis XXXX. His challenges persist and he is still non-verbal, possessing a vocabulary of two words. By all accounts he is dependent on his mother for care. I do not have an expert XXXX report before me which could provide a future XXXX for XXXX if he received proper intensive therapy for persons with XXXX. However, I do find that there is likelihood that at some point in his life he could find himself involuntarily admitted to a mental health institution in Mexico.\n[47] In that future hypothetical scenario, there is a serious possibility of persecution on account of his diagnosis, as illustrated in the above quoted portions of the NDP.\nSTATE PROTECTION\n[48] The NDP supports the conclusion that on the one hand, the government of Mexico has appeared to take the care and rights of persons with disabilities serious by passing various pieces of progressive legislation. On the other hand, it\u2019s most recent mental health bills have been criticized for potentially legalizing involuntary admissions to institutions or authorizing non\u00ad consensual medical treatments, both of which would constitute grave violations of the personal integrity of such persons.\n[49] Furthermore, the NDP is quite unequivocal in that despite the passing of legislation designed to protect persons with mental health challenges or disabilities, serious abuses and outright exploitation of those same persons are still occurring in various institutional settings in Mexico.\n[50] Conservative attitudes and inaccurate assumptions about persons with disabilities persist in Mexico, such that in my view, effective state protection would not be forthcoming nor adequate for the minor claimant.\nINTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE\n[51] The claimants resided in Mexico City, the capital of Mexico. The RIR I had commissioned for this claim suggests that Mexico City has the most programming and support for persons like XXXX. If the claimant is experiencing persecution in Mexico City, then it is more likely than not that he would experience that persecution throughout Mexico.\n[52] Furthermore, given that he experienced various degrees of discrimination and abuse from various persons and institutions, I find that Mexican society as a whole is an agent of persecution based on their attitudes, fear and discriminatory behaviour towards XXXX and other children like him.\n[53] As such, I find that there is no location within Mexico that is both safe and reasonable for the minor claimant.\nCONCLUSION ON THE MINOR CLAIMANT\n[54] I find that the minor claimant is a Convention refugee under s. 96, as he has established a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground in Mexico.\n[55] His claim is therefore accepted.\nCONCLUSION ON THE PRINCIPAL CLAIMANT\n[56] The principal claimant did not argue that she was experiencing persecution in Mexico on account of her son.\n[57] I did try to question the principal claimant on whether she fears anything or anyone in Mexico. She indicated that she feared the general insecurity in Mexico. I asked her for some specific incidents that caused her to fear for her safety. She told me that when she was XXXX, she robbed of her watch and the victim of a failed kidnapping attempt as she was getting on a bus. For reference, the principal claimant is now XXXX years of age.\n[58] In 2015, the principal claimant was walking from work at 2:00am and felt that someone was behind her following her. She ran away and then returned home.\n[59] The principal claimant indicated that it was not the same people involved in either event. Aside from some foul language, nothing was said to her that would indicate why she was being robbed for example.\n[60] These two incidents were approximately XXXX years apart. There does not appear to be any common threads between the two incidents or any evidence upon which I can find that the principal claimant was personally targeted.\n[61] Robbery and violence are unfortunately very common in Mexico.\n[62] I find that the principal claimant fears robbery, abduction and general \u201cinsecurity\u201d in Mexico. Under Section 97(1)(b) of the IRPA, a claimant is only a person in need of protection if removal to their country would subject them to a risk to their life, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or danger of torture and it is not a risk that would be faced generally by other individuals in or from that country.\n[63] The s.97(1)(b) exception has been held to exclude generalized risks associated with widespread crime21, organized crime, violence, extortion, police corruption and abuse of authority, human rights violations, general insecurity, terrorism, suicide bombing, political extremism and activities of armed military groups.\n[64] Not everyone facing a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment will be found to be a person in need of protection, because Section 97 (1)(b)(ii) of the IRPA specifically excludes those persons who face a risk that is \u201cfaced generally by other individuals in or from that country.\u201d There is nothing in s.97 (1) (b) (ii) that requires the Board to interpret \u201cgenerally\u201d as applying to all citizens. The word generally is commonly used to mean \u201cprevalent\u201d or \u201cwidespread\u201d22. The risk must not be an indiscriminate or random risk faced by other citizens.\n[65] Absent any evidence from the principal claimant which would establish a personal targeting on these two occasions, I find that it was more likely than not that she was the victim of randomized violence, which is also not forward-facing.\n[66] The principal claimant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection, as she has failed to demonstrate a serious possibility of future persecution on a Convention ground, or a personalized forward-facing risk to life or of cruel and unusual punishment or treatment in Mexico.\n[67] Her claim is therefore rejected.\n(signed) David D\u2019Intino\nOctober 22, 2019\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), SC 2001, c 27, as amended.\n2 Exhibit 2.1\n3 Exhibit 1\n4 Exhibit 4.\n5 Exhibit 8\n6 Ward v.

Gonzalez Ponce, Christian Julien\nCountry: Angola\nRPD Number: TB8-07871\nAssociated RPD Number(s): TB8-07913, TB7-12855\nATIP Number: A-2020-00859\nATIP Pages: 002821-002831\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] This is the decision in the claim of XXXX XXXX XXXX (\u201cthe principal claimant\u201d), XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (\u201cthe associated claimant\u201d) and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (\u201cthe minor claimant\u201d), citizens of Angola, who are claiming refugee protection pursuant to ss. 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.1\n[2] The associated claimant was appointed the designated representative for the minor claimant, her daughter.\n[3] These claims were heard jointly pursuant to Rule 55 of the Refugee Protection Division Rules.2\nALLEGATIONS\n[4] The allegations of the claimants are those contained in their Basis of Claim (BOC) forms, amendments, and further explained in their oral testimony. In summary, they fear that the government will harm them due to the principal claimant\u2019s political activism.\n[5] The principal claimant alleges that he attended political protests in Angola and was part of a small group of people who would get together to express themselves through music or other means.\n[6] One day after work, he went to his father\u2019s store, and after a while some unidentified men came into the business and asked for the principal claimant. They attacked him and his father. He was left for dead, and his father did not survive. The principal claimant fears returning to Angola because these people may harm him. The associated and minor claimants base their claims on that of the principal claimant.\nINTERLOCUTORY ISSUES\n[7] The adult claimants were represented separately because their marriage has broken down and they are not living together.\n[8] There were three sittings of the hearing of this claim. Different interpreters were used. The claimants expressed some dissatisfaction with the interpretation at the second sitting. The panel was able to address the points of interpretation which the claimants were not happy with; however, the testimony was not proceeding efficiently, and it was decided by the panel that it would be more efficient to proceed with a different interpreter. Both counsels were given the opportunity to express their concerns about the interpretation and to review the audio between the second and third sittings, if they wished to do so. No application was ultimately made with regards to disregarding the testimony that was given with the help of any of the interpreters.\nDETERMINATION\n[9] The panel finds that the principal claimant has a political opinion which opposes the Angolan government and, as he cannot safely express that opinion through public protest and wishes to do so, he is a Convention refugee.\n[10] The panel finds that the associated and minor claimants are not Convention refugees or persons in need of protection.\nANALYSIS\n[11] The claimants\u2019 identities as nationals of Angola are adequately established by their testimony and the supporting documentation filed, including a certified copy of the principal claimant\u2019s passport in Exhibit 1, as well as certified copies of the other claimants\u2019 birth certificates. A copy of XXXX national identity card can also be found in Exhibit 1.\n[12] The claimants testified that false Portuguese passports were used to travel to Canada, but that they are not citizens of Portugal.\n[13] The determinative issues in this case are credibility and the principal claimant\u2019s political opinion.\nCredibility\nClaimants have not established attack was based on political opinion\n[14] The principal claimant established through his testimony and other documents on file that he was attacked in Angola. He also established that his father passed away.3 He was unable to establish with sufficient credible evidence that the attack was politically motivated.\n[15] The principal claimant had some difficulty testifying and providing details about his activities with a group he called \u201cReading Books.\u201d He testified that this is not the same group as is mentioned in some of the country conditions documents presented.4 Some members of the group noted in the country conditions documents have been arrested. For clarity, the panel will refer to the principal claimant\u2019s group as his \u201cpolitical discussion group,\u201d as he testified that this was an informal group for discussions on political matters. Some people would make music to express themselves and sometimes they would attend political protests.\n[16] The principal claimant alleged that he had recruited some people to join the group, and he had met them at parties. When he was asked for an example of this, he said he had met someone (\u201cFP\u201d) at a party, but he could not remember the year. The panel asked what made the principal claimant think he could invite FP to the group, and the principal claimant gave a general reply, stating that when he\u2019s talking to people they might discuss soccer and the conversation turns to politics and they will say their opinion. The panel asked if he could remember what it was that convinced him FP was trustworthy, and the principal claimant said no. The principal claimant had trouble explaining what he personally did as part of the political group, apart from attending some mass protests. When the panel attempted to get more information about his specific role, the answers were vague. A negative inference is taken as to the principal claimant\u2019s credibility, and the panel finds that doubt has been cast upon how involved he really was in this political discussion group, and whether he in fact recruited new members.\n[17] The principal claimant testified that no other members of the group were attacked as he was, or had problems that he knew of based on the group. When there were protests, police would use force to contain the crowd, but this was not limited to members of his group.\n[18] The principal claimant presented a brief letter5 from a member of the political discussion group. The letter states that the principal claimant was in the group and was attacked as a consequence. No details are provided. The writer of the letter does not explain how he knows about the attack or how he knows that the principal claimant\u2019s attack was related to the group. The panel did not have the opportunity to question the writer. The fact that the letter was accompanied by a copy of the identity card of the writer is positive, but it does not serve to establish that the attack was politically motivated. On its own, this letter is insufficient to establish a link between the political group and the principal claimant\u2019s attack.\n[19] Similarly, there is a letter from XXXX mother6 on file. It is brief and states that the associated and minor claimants went to live with her in another part of Luanda because they were afraid after the attack on the principal claimant. The letter does not provide insight into who was behind the attack, and the panel was not given the opportunity to question the writer.\n[20] A Canadian medical assessment7 was performed on the principal claimant, which confirms that he has an injured eye.\n[21] The principal claimant testified about the attack, and he could not associate the men with any group, nor did he recognize them. He speculated they were government agents.\n[22] The principal claimant\u2019s testimony about being followed subsequent to the attack was inconsistent. He said that he went into hiding in an area called Bengo. He thought he was being followed, so he took a flash photograph of the people following him so he could show to people and see if they recognized them. When asked where the image is now, the principal claimant said he just meant he used his memory. The panel noted that this is a different answer and that one cannot \u201cshow\u201d memories to people. The principal claimant said he could describe them. The panel asked him if he could still remember any of these people, and he said one was tall, very thin, with a mustache. The principal claimant alleges that no one recognized these people and thus he knew he was being followed. The panel finds the claimant\u2019s testimony on this issue to be vague, evolving, and unconvincing. The panel does not find the principal claimant\u2019s testimony credible regarding the people following him in Bengo.\n[23] The principal claimant has not established with sufficient credible evidence that people were actually following him, and even if they were, that this had anything to do with the attack which took place in Luanda or his political activism.\n[24] Considering all of the above, the panel finds that the claimants have established that the principal claimant was attacked. Who was behind the attack, has not been established with sufficient credible evidence.\nSummary \u2013 Attack on principal claimant\n[25] This claim is based on the principal claimant\u2019s having been attacked by unknown individuals in his father\u2019s store in Luanda. He alleges that he subsequently went into hiding in Bengo and there he believes there were other unknown men following him. At the hearing, he was unable to directly connect his political activities (attending protests and meeting with friends to discuss politics) to his attack. He said that the attackers must have been sent by the authorities because they asked for him by name and nothing was taken from the store. The panel finds that he is speculating, and it is insufficient to establish, on a balance of probabilities, that he was attacked for his political opinion.\n[26] This conclusion is further supported by the fact that none of the other members of his political discussion group have had any similar problems or any other problems that could be attributed to being targeted by anyone because of their political views. The panel is aware of the evidence8 presented by the claimants which indicate that Angolan authorities do break up protests and have arrested some peaceful activists. The panel also considered the objective evidence cited in the following section of these reasons. The preponderance of the evidence does not support the allegation that Angolan state actors targeted persons with similar profiles to the principal claimant, as someone who attended protests as a member of the crowd and who occasionally discussed politics with others. Meetings and protests were broken up, but the panel finds there is insufficient evidence to establish that state actors generally went to people\u2019s homes or places of work to attack them.\n[27] Taking all of the above into consideration, the panel finds that the claimants have not established that the attack upon the principal claimant and his father was perpetrated by people with political motives. Their motives are unknown. Their identities and affiliations are unknown. As such, the panel cannot find that the claimants are Convention refugees or persons in need of protection based on this attack by unknown persons with unknown motivations.\nPolitical Opinion \u2013 Principal Claimant\n[28] The principal claimant testified about some protests he attended, and his political views regarding Angola. While the panel did take some negative inferences as to his credibility as noted above, he was able to express his political views at the hearing. He was also able to testify about attending protests in Luanda and the reactions of police during those protests. In that regard, the panel found him to be forthright and he testified with a sufficient level of detail. The panel accepts that he attended anti-government protests in Angola, and that he has a political opinion that opposes the ruling regime.\n[29] The objective country documentation9 states that 2017 saw nearly five times the level of protest that was seen during the last election year, 2012. Dissidence was suppressed: protesters and journalists were often imprisoned. On August 12, 2017, demonstrations by groups not running for election were banned. Nevertheless, protests continued to grow, with thousands of people protesting throughout the country in June 2017 for free and fair elections, without notable incidents.10\n[30] The constitution and law provide for the right of peaceful assembly, and the government increasingly respected this right.11 Nonpartisan groups intending to criticize the government or government leaders, however, often encountered the presence of police who prevented them from holding the event. Usually authorities claimed the timing or venue requested was problematic or that the proper authorities had not received notification. Police were at times reported to have fired into the crowd during protests or used force to disperse them. The government at times arbitrarily restricted the activities of associations it considered subversive by refusing to grant permits for organized activities.12 It was also reported to have dispersed grassroots anti-government gatherings with violence, subjecting participants and organizers to arrest.13\n[31] On the other hand, authorities generally permitted opposition parties to organize and hold meetings. Individuals reported practicing self-censorship but generally were able to criticize government policies without fear of direct reprisal. Social media was widely used in the larger cities and provided an open forum for discussion.14\n[32] The objective documentation, as well as the country documents presented by the claimants, indicate that sometimes the government of Angola openly represses its people\u2019s ability to express their political opinions. It does not do so in a systematic way; individuals can have open discussions about their political views in person and on social media. Self-censorship occurs, however, and the preponderance of the objective documentation indicates that protesters are often arrested in Angola and peaceful, non-partisan gatherings intended to be critical of government are regularly disrupted by police. It is telling that the Freedom House report15 considers the fact that Angolans are increasingly willing to express their political opinions in private as a significant step forward.\n[33] Having considered all of the above, the panel finds the principal claimant\u2019s testimony about the protests he attended and the police reaction to protesters to be reflected in the documentary evidence and thus, objectively supported. The situation is improving, but the ability to protest without fear of arrest or violence from police is restricted.\n[34] As such, the panel accepts that the principal claimant has a subjective fear of returning to Angola, based on his political opinion. He would be unable to protest peacefully in that country without fear of arrest or violence by police.\n[35] With regards to state protection, the panel notes that the state is the agent of persecution. The government is in control of its territory. Security forces in Angola enjoy impunity for violent acts committed against detainees, activists, and others.16 There is no effective protection against unjustified imprisonment, lengthy pretrial detention, extortion, or torture. Angolan prisons are reported to be overcrowded, unhygienic, lacking in basic necessities, and plagued by sexual abuse. There is clear and convincing evidence before the panel that state protection would not be forthcoming to the principal claimant in his particular circumstances.\n[36] As it relates to internal flight alternatives, there is no area of Angola where the principal claimant could protest peacefully without fear of reprisal. Therefore there is no internal flight alternative available to him in his particular circumstances.\nAssociated and Minor Claimants\n[37] The panel sympathies with the difficult situation that the associated and minor claimants are in. The associated claimant has XXXX XXXX17 and is undergoing XXXX XXXX treatment.18 The minor claimant is in the care of her mother, though the principal claimant is currently still in her life.\n[38] This is a split decision. The principal claimant has a political opinion that puts him at risk of persecution. However, the claimants have not established that it was his political opinion that has lead to the attack on him and his father. They have not established a forward-looking risk, relating to the persons responsible for the attack on the principal claimant, to himself or the associated claimants, nor has any nexus or personalized risk been established for the associated claimants. Therefore, the panel finds that the principal claimant has established his claim but the associated claimants have not.\n[39] In short, the adult claimants are separated and they have not established that the principal claimant\u2019s political opinion will cause the remaining claimants problems in Angola.\n[40] The panel considered whether the associated claimant\u2019s medical conditions might warrant the granting of her claim for protection. The medical information19 provided indicates that she was diagnosed with XXXX XXXX in Angola and eventually received treatment for the condition. Similarly, though she was XXXX with XXXX in Canada, the documentation and submissions of counsel regarding XXXX treatment20 in Angola indicate that she can obtain treatment in Luanda, where she formerly worked and resided.\n[41] The claimants have not advanced allegations that she would be denied treatment in Angola based on a Convention ground. Similarly they have not alleged that she faces a risk based on her medical conditions, which is not caused by the inability of that country to provide adequate health or medical care. Having reviewed the information on file, the panel finds that the claimants have not established a risk to the associated claimant in Angola based on her medical conditions under sections 96 or 97(1) of the IRPA.\n[42] Under these circumstances, the panel finds the associated claimant has not established, on a balance of probabilities, that she or the minor claimant face a risk of harm, that is, a reasonable chance of persecution in regard to s. 96 of the IRPA, or, a likelihood of the harm that is set out in s. 97(1) of the IRPA, should they return to Angola.\nCONCLUSION\n[43] The panel concludes that the principal claimant XXXX XXXX XXXX is a Convention refugee, on the basis of his political opinion.\n[44] Having considered all of the evidence, the panel finds that there is not a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground should the associated and minor claimants return to Angola, or that, on a balance of probabilities, they would be personally subjected to a danger of torture or face a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\n[45] The panel concludes that the associated claimant, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and minor claimant, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, are not Convention refugees or persons in need of protection. Therefore, their claims are rejected.\n(signed) R.

Morgan\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): N\/A\nCountry: China\nRPD Number: TB9-14438\nAssociated RPD Number(s): TB9-14486, TB9-14494, TB9-14495, TB9-14496\nATIP Number: A-2020-00859\nATIP Pages: 002195-002198\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: This is the decision in the refugee claims of XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX XXXX and their claims for refugee protection. This decision is being rendered from the bench, and written reasons may be edited.\nDetermination:\n[2] I find Mr. XXXX and the youngest child XXXX are not Convention refugees, as I find they\u2019re excluded pursuant to Article 1(e) of the Convention relating to the status of refugees because they have permanent residence in Japan.\n[3] Ms XXXX and the older two children I find to be Convention refugees, as I find their country of reference is China and I find they have a nexus to the Convention for the race and religion.\nAllegations:\n[4] You set out a comprehensive history in your Basis of Claim Narrative.\n[5] To summarize your risks, you fear Chinese authorities that\u2019s owing to ill-treatment of Uyghurs in China. You do not articulate a risk in returning to Japan.\nIdentity:\n[6] Your personal identity as nationals of China is established by your passports and your identity as Uyghurs is established by your testimony and by the language of your testimony and by the other identity documents.\n[7] Concerning the status in Japan, the issue is exclusion pursuant to Article 1(e) of the Convention. An Article 1(e) states that the Convention shall not apply to a person who\u2019s recognized by the authorities of the country in which he or she has taken residence as having the rights and obligations which are attached to the possession of nationality of that country.\n[8] I note the Federal Court of Appeal in Zeng set out the test to be taken into account when deciding whether Article 1(e) applies and that is considering all relevant factors to the date of the hearing. Does the claimant have status substantially similar to that of its nationals in a third country.\n[9] And I find for you, sir, and for your youngest son the answer to that question is yes. Okay.\n[10] I note your credible testimony that you all applied for permanent residence and only you and the youngest son were approved. You\u2019re unsure of the reasoning. Think it might have something to do with your work in Japan.\n[11] But concerning Ms XXXX and the older children in Japan, I find their status there is not permanent.\n[12] The documents you provided today which are your Japanese permits indicate that those three permits had to be renewed and could be denied as they\u2019re at the discretion of Japanese authorities. So, I find that 1(e) exclusion not applicable as you do not have status there akin to citizenship.\n[13] So, for you, ma\u2019am, and \u2026 and the two older children I\u2019m assessing your risk in returning to China which I find is your only country of nationality.\n[14] I found you a credible witness also. You testified about the last time you were in China in 2016, how you were questioned repeatedly by authorities and how you fear what is ongoing there now for Uyghurs and that includes Uyghurs being sent to detention camps for no reason other than being Uyghur, and that\u2019s corroborated by much documentary evidence that you provide and that I find in the National Documentation Package.\n[15] I find that treatment of Uyghurs is worsening in China. I note the Department of State report at Item 2.1 of Exhibit 3 indicates that the government significantly intensified its campaign of mass detention of members of Muslim minority groups in Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. That authorities have possibly arbitrarily detained 2 million Uyghurs.\n[16] I find further you would not have the opportunity to openly practice your faith in China, and that Uyghur activities in religious, commercial, and cultural spheres are severely curtailed in China.\n[17] I find the agent of persecution is the State. That it is objectively unreasonable for you to seek State protection, and I find those conditions for Uyghurs exists throughout China, so there\u2019s no internal flight alternative.\n[18] So, for you, Madam, and the two older children I do find what you fear amount \u2026 amounts to persecution starting from the Chinese Government\u2019s appropriation of your Uyghur names and continuing with an ongoing interference with your ability to freely worship.\n[19] I do conclude that you are Convention refugees and I accept your claims.\n[20] I thank you all for appearing today.\n[21] CLAIMANT: Thank you.\n[22] MEMBER: Thank you, Mr. Interpreter. Excellent work. Thank you.\n[23] CLAIMANT: Thank you.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

Rico\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Rebeka Lauks\nCountry: Turkey\nRPD Number: TB8-27274\nAssociated RPD Number(s): TB8-27297, TB8-27337\nATIP Number: A-2020-00859\nATIP Pages: 000810-000814\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: This is the reasons for decision of the Refugee Protection Division in the claim protection filed by XXXX XXXX first name is spelled, XXXXX. last name is spelled, XXXX, XXXX first name is spelled, XXXX last name is spelled, XXXX and\u00b7 first name is spelled, XXXX middle name is spelled XXXX last name is spelled XXXX, under Sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[2] The allegations are fully set out in the Basis of Claim Forms found at Exhibits 2, 3, and 4. In short, the claimants allege a fear of persecution at the hands of the Turkish Government because the principal claimant\u2019s \u2026 because of the principal claimant\u2019s real or perceived political opinion as a diplomat and person affiliated to the Hizmet\/Gulen movement. Which led to his discharge under emergency decree from public service on allegations of terrorism.\n[3] For the following reasons I find that the adult claimants are Convention refugees. However, I also find that the minor claimant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\n[4] I am satisfied that the claimant\u2019s \u2026 I\u2019m satisfied of the claimant\u2019s identities based on their certified true copies of their passports and I am satisfied that the adult claimants are citizens of Turkey and that the girl minor claimant is a citizen of Turkey and the United States. Evidence of which can be found at Exhibit 1.\n[5] I will assess the claim for the minor girl claimant against the United States first before assessing the adult claimant\u2019s claim against Turkey.\n[6] The law states that if a claimant is a national of more than one country the claimant must show that he or she is a Convention refugee with respect to all such countries.\n[7] The girl minor claimant is a citizen of the United States of America as she was born in that country and has right of citizenship by virtue of her birth. She must show that she faces a serious possibility of persecution or, on a balance of probabilities, a danger of torture or a risk to her life or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment throughout the United States of America.\n[8] The principal claimant alleges that he believes that the minor claimant is in danger as he believes that the US has made a secret deal with a high profile US citizen when that person was released from prison in Turkey. He believes that the secret deal is that the US will return Turkish citizens of interest to Turkey. The principal claimant forms this belief based on his past work as a diplomat.\n[9] I find the principal claimant\u2019s testimony to be completely speculative. The principal claimant has no direct knowledge as negotiations for release of a high profile US citizen. He was not present for the negotiations. He\u2019s basing this belief primarily from his own fear of persecution in Turkey.\n[10] I note that the claimant\u2019s counsel advanced no evidence of persecution in the US for the girl minor claimant. I further note that the claimant\u2019s counsel advanced no evidence of an objective basis or well-foundedness of the claim against the United States for the girl minor claimant.\n[11] I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the principal claimant\u2019s belief is not well-founded.\n[12] The US is a democratic country, the rule of law, and respect for basic human rights. There is no objective or concrete evidence beside the principal claimant\u2019s belief that the US would extradite a minor, age approximately nine, to Turkey nor that Turkey would expel the resources required to extradite said minor who has very tenuous links to the Gulen movement.\n[13] While I find that it would be a hardship for the girl minor claimant to return to the United States on her own without her parents, I find that this hardship does not constitute persecution or a need for protection.\n[14] Neither the claimants nor their counsel presented any persuasive objective evidence that the girl minor claimant faced any risk in the United States. As such, the girl minor claimant is not a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection. I must reject her claim for refugee protection.\n[15] I now tum to assess the claims made by the adult claimants. I am satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimants have established their profile as persons who are or perceived to be members of the Hizmet\/Gulen movement.\n[16] The claimants presented a wealth of documentation that the principal claimant \u2026 principal claimant is a \u2026 was a diplomat. That he applied to various courts to resolve the issue with the Turkish Government. That the Turkish Government\u2019s belief in his involvement in the coup attempt is formed by his attendance at Hizmet affiliate education institutions and his previa work \u2026 previous work at the Evidence of which can be found at Exhibit 9.\n[17] Despite my concerns regarding the adult claimant\u2019s delay in claiming in the United States and their abandonment of their claim in the United States, the adult claimant\u2019s have still established, on a balance of probabilities, a profile which the documentary evidence cited below indicates that persons with this profile are persecuted by the Turkish State. As such, I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimants have established their profiles. The adult claimants have established their profiles as persons affiliated to the Hizmet\/Gulen movement and that these profiles place them at a serious risk of persecution if returned to Turkey.\n[18] The persecution of persons with a similar profile of the adult claimants is objectively well\u00ad founded.\n[19] The information in the National Documentation Package found at Exhibit 5 confirms that in July 2016 there was an attempted coup against the Turkish Government. The government blames various sections of the Turkish society who are perceived to be part of the Hizmet\/Gulen movement for this attempted coup, including but not limited to, persons associated with the Hizmet\/Gulen institutions, persons employed at or studied at Hizmet affiliated educational institutions, public servants, the judiciary, government officials, military personnel, bilok(p) users, etcetera. Evidence of which can be found, as I state earlier, at Exhibit 5 Items 1.7, 2.1, and 2.5.\n[20] Counsel also submitted documentary evidence to support that diplomats who have an affiliation to the Hizmet\/Gulen movement are persecuted in Turkey.\n[21] The government considers these persons to be terrorists, as it considers the Hizmet\/Gulen movement to be part of a terrorist organization.\n[22] Under the guise of the emergency decrees and anti-terrorism laws, the Turkish Government subjects these persons to various human right violations including but not limited to arbitrary detention, torture, and extrajudicial killings.\n[23] Despite the public declaration of a repeal of the state of emergency, there is no persuasive evidence before me to indicate that there is a change in the treatment of persons who are or perceived to be part of the Hizmet\/Gulen movement.\n[24] Therefore, based on this country documentary evidence and the credible allegations I find the adult claimants have a well-founded fear of persecution in Turkey by reason of the principal claimant\u2019s real or perceived political opinion.\n[25] As the agent of persecution is the Government of Turkey I find that it would be objectively unreasonable for the adult claimants to seek protection of the Turkish Government.\n[26] I also find that the adult claimants face a serious possibility of persecution throughout Turkey, especially given the country documentation that indicates that the authorities operate similarly throughout Turkey. Therefore, viable internal flight alternatives are not available to the adult claimants.\n[27] I conclude that adult claimants are Convention refugees and I therefore accept their claim. However, based on the analysis outlined above I find that the minor girl claimant is not a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection and I reject her claim for refugee protection.\n[28] We can pull the mics forward again.\n[29] This concludes today\u2019s hearing. We will be going off the record.\n\u2014REASONSCONCLUDED\u2013\n",

They seek refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).\n[2] The panel appointed, XXXX XXXX XXXX, the designated representative of her children, the minor claimants.\nDETERMINATION\n[3] For the following reasons, the panel concludes that the claimants, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX are \u201cConvention refugees\u201d pursuant to section 96 of IRPA.\n[4] For the following reasons, the panel concludes that the claimant, XXXX XXXX XXXX, is neither a \u201cConvention refugee\u201d pursuant to section 96 of IRPA nor a \u201cperson in need of protection\u201d pursuant to subsection 97(1) of IRPA.\n[5] In rendering this decision, the panel considered Guideline 4: \u201cWomen Refugees Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution\u201d; Guideline 9: \u201cProceedings before the IRB Involving Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression\u201d; the \u201cPolicy on the Use of Jurisprudential Guides\u201d and the Jurisprudential Guide TB7-19851.\nTHE CLAIMANTS: XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX AND XXXX XXXX XXXX\nAllegations\n[6] The claimants\u2019 allegations are found in a narrative attached to Ms. XXXX Basis of Claim form (BOC) submitted on March 6, 2018, and an amended narrative dated March 13, 2019. The allegations can be summarized as follow.\nAllegations in the BOC\n[7] Ms. XXXX indicated that her husband\u2019s family practice female genital mutilation (FGM). This tradition is performed on girls who are nine years old. Ms. XXXX indicated that her opposition to FGM has led to her being subjected to verbal, physical and psychological abuse from her in-laws. In particular, she was beaten on six occasions by her sister-in-law, who wanted to forcefully take her eldest daughter, XXXX, to perform FGM.\n[8] Subsequently, Ms. XXXX and her family moved to Ikorodu for safety. However, members of the Badoo cult attacked and killed their pregnant neighbor for ritual purposes. The claimants then decided to flee to the United States for safety, on XXXX XXXX, 2017.\n[9] The claimants entered Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2018.\nAllegations in the amended narrative\n[10] Ms. XXXX added that she had vowed not to circumcise her daughters, after witnessing the death of her brother-in-law (XXXXXXXX)\u2019s daughter, on XXXX XXXX, 2015, of complications from the circumcision procedure.\n[11] On XXXX XXXX XXXX 2016, Mrs. XXXX XXXX, Ms. XXXX sister-in-law visited Ms. XXXX with five family members, to announce that XXXX would be circumcised on her ninth birthday. On XXXX XXXX, 2016, her in-laws came once again to remind Ms. XXXX and her husband that her daughter, XXXX, was to be circumcised. She was informed that no one in the family could escape this process. Ms. XXXX received subsequent visits from her in-laws on XXXX XXXX, 2016, and XXXX XXXX, 2017.\n[12] Ms. XXXX further indicated that Ms. XXXX would subject her to verbal, physical and emotional abuse. Ms. XXXX had to be hospitalized due to injuries sustained from the physical assaults.\n[13] Ms. XXXX added that following the death of her pregnant neighbor, by the hands of members of the Badoo cult on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2017, she was planning to move to another state. However, her sister-in-law works for the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (XXXX), which has been rumored to work with the Badoo cult group. Ms. XXXX believes her sister-in-law to be \u201cwell connected\u201d and have the means to locate her to perform the circumcision ceremony on XXXX.\n[14] Ms. XXXX indicated that, while in the United States, her husband visited them from XXXX XXXX XXXX 2017 and returned to Nigeria on XXXX XXXX, 2018. At that time, her husband informed her that his family is still adamant on circumcising XXXX and were pressuring to have the family return to Nigeria.\n[15] In addition, on XXXX XXXX, 2018, Ms. XXXX indicated that she received he call from her brother-in-law, XXXX XXXX. He informed Ms. XXXX that the in-laws were continuing to pressure her husband to have the claimants return to Nigeria at all costs, and had even called the United States immigration. Upon hearing this news, the claimants left the United States and entered Canada, on XXXX XXXX, 2018.\nAnalysis\nIdentity\n[16] The claimant\u2019s personal and national identities as citizens of Nigeria are established, on a balance of probabilities, by the copies of their respective Nigerian passport.\nCredibility\n[17] The panel found that Ms. XXXX testified in a spontaneous, sincere, detailed and straightforward manner. The panel noted no contradictions, omissions, inconsistencies or implausibility for which the claimants did not provide reasonable explanations.\n[18] At the hearing, Ms. XXXX credibly testified that she first learned that her in-laws practiced FGM when they were preparing the circumcision of her brother-in-law\u2019s daughter, XXXX. She indicated XXXX was circumcised on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2014, and became ill following the procedure. Ms. XXXX rendered a credible and emotional testimony while explaining that XXXX fell ill from an infection shortly after the procedure and passed away XXXX months later on XXXX XXXX, 2015.\n[19] Ms. XXXX then testified on her sister-in-law\u2019s visit on XXXX XXXX XXXX2016. She recounted in detail that she was caring for her son in a bedroom and overheard a conversation between her husband and sister-in-law about circumcision. Ms. XXXX was called to the living room and her sister-in-law advised that XXXX would be circumcised whether Ms. XXXX liked it or no. Ms. XXXX did not respond to her sister-in-law at that time, but later had a discussion with her husband stating her opposition to FGM.\n[20] Ms. XXXX also testified about her sister-in-law\u2019s visit on XXXX XXXX, 2016, and that she was accompanied by six men, whom she believes to be thugs. Ms. XXXX knew these men to be involved in criminal activities, such as harassment and extortion. Ms. XXXX explained that she was threatened during the conversation because she dared to look at her sister-in-law, Ms. XXXX, in the eyes and refused to follow her orders, which is to consent to XXXX circumcision. Her sister\u00ad in-law said that Ms. XXXX would lose her life if she continued to defy her. Ms. XXXX indicated that she was slapped and punched by her sister-in-law and a neighbor had to intervene to stop the assault. The panel finds that Ms. XXXX testified in a credible manner with respect to the incident that transpired on XXXX XXXX, 2016.\n[21] Ms. XXXX explained that the most severe assault occurred on XXXX XXXX, 2017. Ms. XXXX received another visit from three sisters-in law, Ms. XXXX, XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX, and the thugs who accompanied Ms. XXXX. Ms. XXXX testified that another argument ensued regarding XXXX circumcision and she was physically assaulted by Ms. XXXX and Ms. XXXX, while Ms. XXXX was encouraging them to continue to hit Ms. XXXX. Further, Ms. XXXX explained that her husband intervened to stop the fight and, in turn, was attacked and stabbed by the thugs who accompanied Ms. XXXX. Ms. XXXX testified that she sought medical attention on XXXX XXXX, 2017, due to abdominal pain from being kicked in her belly during the fight. The panel finds that Ms. XXXX testimony in this regard to be credible. Her testimony is further corroborated by a medical report respecting her admission to the hospital on XXXX XXXX, 2017, stating that Mr. XXXX was admitted to the hospital on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2017, due to being stab wound in his back, an affidavit from her husband1. The panel also notes that Ms. XXXX has submitted an affidavit from a neighbor who witnessed her being beaten by her in-laws on two occasions: XXXX XXXX, 2016 and XXXX XXXX, 2016, which further supports Ms. XXXX allegations respecting the abuse she endured due to her opposition to FGM2.\n[22] In addition, at the hearing, Ms. XXXX testified that she fears both her daughters, XXXX and XXXX, would be forcefully subjected to FGM if retumed to Nigeria. She indicated that as XXXX is approaching nine years of age, she fears that her in-laws will want to perform the circumcision ritual on her as well. The panel finds that Ms. XXXX testimony was sincere and spontaneous considering that her immediate fear, upon leaving Nigeria, was for her daughter XXXX who was at the time nine years old, the age when circumcision occurs amongst her in-laws.\n[23] Overall, the panel considered Ms. XXXX credible testimony and finds that the claimants have demonstrated, on a balance of probabilities, the essential elements of their allegations.\n[24] In addition, the panel finds that Ms. XXXX allegations are corroborated by the objective documentary evidence on the prevalence of FGM in Nigeria. According the objective documentary evidence, Nigeria is the country with the largest number of instances of FGM in the world3. Approximately, 20 million women and girls have undergone FGM, with the highest prevalence in South East and South West Zones, which is where Ms. XXXX in-laws reside, in Lagos (in the South West)4. Further, the objective documentary evidence indicates the following:\nFGM is most likely to take place in Nigeria during childhood. The major exception is when women in certain ethnic groups undergo FGM during the birth of their first child, because of a belief that it is critical that a baby not touch its mother\u2019s clitoris (Alo & Babatunde, 2011). Many girls are cut as infants (16% of girls aged 0 to 14 undergo FGM before their first birthday), and most women (82%) aged 15 to 49 who have had FGM state that they were cut before the age of five (DHS 2013, pp.352-3).5\n[25] Although the objective documentary evidence indicates that FGM is most likely to occur during infancy, the date suggests a wide age range where girls would be subjected to this practice. In this case, based on an analysis of Ms. XXXX testimony and the objective documentary evidence, the panel concludes that XXXX and XXXX now respectively eleven and seven years old, fit the profile of girls who would be subjected to FGM in Nigeria. The panel reaches this conclusion based on the prevalence of FGM in the South West zone of Nigeria, which includes Lagos state and the prevalence of the practice amongst Ms. XXXX in-laws.\nState Protection\n[26] The panel also considered whether the claimants could avail themselves of the protection of the Nigerian authorities against Ms. XXXX in-laws. In this case, Ms. XXXX testified that she reported the XXXX XXXX, 2017, incident to the police on XXXX XXXX, 2017. However, concerning her in-laws\u2019 persistence on circumcising XXXX, Ms. XXXX was told that the police would not intervene as it was a cultural matter. Ms. XXXX added that the police counseled her to allow her daughter to be circumcising it would be bring peace to her home. The panel finds Ms. XXXX testimony to be credible and is also corroborated by the objective documentary evidence.\n[27] According to the objective documentary evidence, Nigeria has adopted the Violence against Persons Prohibition Act (VAPP), which prohibits FGM.6 However, the VAPP only applies in the Federal Capital Territory of Abuja. Additionally, thirteen states, including Lagos State, has adopted anti-FGM legislation.7 However, the objective documentary evidence also states that the practice of FGM is \u201cwidespread, with low rates of reporting and prosecution\u201d.8 In addition, there is a disparity between the adoption and the implementation of anti-FGM legislation. The objective documentary evidence reveals that the anti-FGM laws are \u201cweak and in most times not even implemented\u201d.9 The objective documentary evidence indicates:\nFederal law criminalizes female circumcision or genital mutilation, but the federal government took no legal action to curb the practice. While 12 states banned FGM\/C, once a state legislature criminalizes FGM\/C, NGOs found they had to convince local authorities that state laws apply in their districts.10\n[28] Further, the objective documentary evidence states the following with respect to the police\u2019s attitude towards FGM:\nHowever, the Australian DFAT reports that it \u201cassesses as credible advice from local sources that it remains extremely difficult for women and girls to obtain protection from FGM\u201d because despite an increase in reports to the police and the NHRC, community support for these practices and the traditional attitude of police help to support them (Australia 9 Mar. 2018, para. 3.49)11.\n[29] In light of the foregoing, the panel concludes that the claimants have rebutted the presumption of state protection. The evidence shows, in a clear and convincing manner, that individuals who fear or oppose FGM cannot obtain adequate state protection.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[30] The panel finds that the claimants do not have a viable internal flight alternative (IFA) in Nigeria. The panel considered whether the claimants could safely relocate to Abuja, Ibadan or Port Harcourt. The panel considered the interests and the capacity of Ms. XXXX in-laws to locate and pursue the family in the proposed IFAs.\n[31] Ms. XXXX testified that her in-laws, and in particular her sister-in-law, Ms. XXXX, has continued to search for the family, in spite of their having left Nigeria. Ms. XXXX testified that she received a phone call from her brother-in-law, XXXX XXXX on XXXX XXXX, 2018. Her brother-in-law is still upset by his daughter\u2019s death, following a circumcision procedure. He advised Ms. XXXX that Ms. XXXX has instructed the family to continue to look for the claimants.\n[32] Further, Ms. XXXX testified that her sister-in-law is a powerful person. She works for the XXXX and is also dating the XXXX of the XXXX local chapter in Lagos. Ms. XXXX believes that her sister-in-law could use XXXX resources, both at the local and national level, to locate them throughout Nigeria, such as handing out a picture of Ms. XXXX to her contacts at the various local chapters to have them search for her. The panel also considered Ms. XXXX testimony that her sister-in-law entertains relationships with criminal elements. These thugs have accompanied her sister-in-law during her visit with Ms. XXXX on XXXX XXXX, 2017. They stabbed her husband, while Ms. XXXX was beaten by her in-laws. In addition, the panel also took into consideration Ms. XXXX testimony that her in-laws have resorted to physical violence against her, which caused her to be hospitalized because of her refusal to submit their daughter XXXX to the circumcision ceremony.\n[33] Considering all the above, the panel finds that the claimants have demonstrated, on a balance of probabilities, that Ms. XXXX in-laws have the interests and the necessary motivation to pursue the claimants in the proposed IFAs. Consequently, the panel finds that the claimants could not live safely in the proposed IFAs.\n[34] Given the panel\u2019s conclusion that the claimants face a serious possibility of persecution in the proposed IFAs, the panel does not need to examine the reasonableness of relocating to the proposed IFAs and the factors outlined in the Jurisprudential Guide TB7-19851. The panel notes that the personal circumstances of the claimants are markedly different from that of the claimant described in TB7-19851. Although the claimants fear non-state actors, their fear is not localised. The panel reaches this conclusion based on Ms. XXXX credible testimony on the interests, motivation and capacity of her in-laws, and in particular her sister-in-law to locate them. This includes threatening and beating Ms. XXXX to the point that she required hospitalization. The panel also rests this conclusion that Ms. XXXX has employed the help of criminals in order to threaten and physical assault Ms. XXXX in order to secure the circumcision of her daughter. The panel also takes the consideration that Ms. XXXX sister-in-law has connections nationwide through her employment which she could use to locate the claimants.\n[35] Consequently, the panel determines that XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX have demonstrated a serious possibility of persecution under section 96 of IRPA, by virtue of their membership in a particular social group being girls who would be subjected to FGM. In addition, the panel concludes that XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX have demonstrated a serious possibility of persecution due to their membership in a particular social group, namely the family of XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX.\nConclusion\n[36] For the foregoing reasons, the panel finds that the claimants, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX are \u201cConvention refugees\u201d pursuant to section 96 of IRPA.\n[37] The panel accepts their refugee claim.\nTHE CLAIMANT: XXXX XXXX XXXX\nAllegations\n[38] Ms. XXXX allegations can be found in a narrative appended to her BOC on March 1st, 2018, and an amended narrative dated March 13, 2019. The allegations can be summarized as follows.\nAllegations in BOC\n[39] Ms. XXXX indicates being physically abused by her late husband. The abuse she endured caused her to be admitted to the hospital for weeks. She indicates that there was a time that her family and children urged her not to resume living with her late husband, but after some months, her late husband and her in-laws convinced her to return to the marital home.\n[40] Her husband passed away three years ago. After his passing, Ms. XXXX in-laws accused her of having killed her husband. The in-laws then stated that she needed to perform a ritual to prove that she was not responsible for her husband\u2019s passing. The ritual involved her shaving her head and drinking the water used to bathe the body of her late husband. Lastly, Ms. XXXX was informed that she was to marry one of her brothers-in-law. Ms. XXXX objected to the ritual and the marriage. Ms. XXXX stated that she was given a deadline by which to abide by her in-laws\u2019 request, or else she would be killed.\n[41] When the threats to her life became too much to bear, Ms. XXXX relocated to her church, where she stayed until she left Nigeria for the United States on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2017. She entered Canada on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018.\nAllegations in amended narrative\n[42] Ms. XXXX specified that her husband died on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2017. She indicated that following her husband\u2019s passing, her sister-in-law, XXXX XXXX, accused her of having caused his death in order to inherit her late husband\u2019s property, and because of the domestic violence she had endured during the course of their marriage.\n[43] She indicated that her in-laws explained to her the ritual she would have to follow and gave her until XXXX XXXX, 2017, to carry out their instruction, or she would be killed. She did not report her in-laws to the authorities because the head of the family, XXXX XXXX, is a high chief and is powerful.\n[44] She indicated she moved out of her marital home on XXXX XXXX, 2017, and stayed at her church in Ikorodu, until she left Nigeria.\nAnalysis\nIdentity\n[45] The claimant has established her identity and Nigerian nationality, on a balance of probabilities, by submitting a copy of her Nigeria passport.\nWell-founded fear of persecution \/ Risk of harm\n[46] The panel finds that Ms. XXXX testified in a sincere and spontaneous manner. However, despite the principal claimant\u2019s subjective fear, the panel finds that there is no objective basis for her fear.\n[47] At the hearing, Ms. XXXX explained that the head of the family, XXXX is a high chief. According to her testimony, the XXXX family, and in particular XXXX, is known everywhere. He is called to villages to perform rituals. For instance, Ms. XXXX testified that when a wife is thought to have killed her husband, he performs rituals to call on the spirit of the dead to go after the wife. In this context, Ms. XXXX states that she fears her in-laws, because they are idol worshippers and has been running away from them for that reason.\n[48] Noting Ms. XXXX testimony that she fears her in-laws because they are idol worshippers, the panel asked her what she believes her in-laws would do to her because of their belief. Ms. XXXX responded that her in-laws requested that she go to the shrine and kneel. She must use her mouth to pick kola nuts. Ms. XXXX further explained that as the ritual proceeds, the in-laws would perform incantations and if a person eats the fruit, their stomach would swell until it bursts.\n[49] Ms. XXXX testified that when she married her husband, they took an oath at the shrine and her face was marked. She indicated that she cannot return to Nigeria and tell her in-laws that she would not perform the rituals they requested because of the oath. She believes that they would kill her because of the oath she made. At the hearing, the panel asked Ms. XXXX why she believes that she would be killed because of the oath she took. She responded that, at the time, her late husband had informed her that once he dies, he would tell his family that she had killed him and that she would later join him. Even in Canada, Ms. XXXX believes that her in-laws are trying different rites to reach her and believes that she is sleeping like \u201csomeone who is dead\u201d.\n[50] Further, the panel asked Ms. XXXX how she believes that she would be harmed if returned to Nigeria. She indicated that her in-laws went to the church where she resided to look for her. They had an argument with the pastor and they threatened to destroy him and to ruin his life. When questioned as to how her in-laws would be able to ruin or destroy the pastor, Ms. XXXX responded that they would use \u201ccharms\u201d or \u201cblack magic\u201d.\n[51] With respect to her allegations that her in-laws would force her to marry her brother-in\u00ad law, Ms. XXXX explained that she informed them of her opposition to the marriage. She explained that her in-laws advised her that she had to perform some rituals if she refused to marry her brother\u00ad in-law. The ritual involved making an oath that she did not kill her husband which includes drinking the bathing water of her deceased husband. As a Christian, Ms. XXXX refuses to perform this ritual. Ms. XXXX added that based on her mother\u2019s in-laws\u2019 culture, her mother would be killed if she persists in her decision not to perform the requested rituals. Ms. XXXX testified that Ms. XXXX was told by XXXX to follow her Christian religion to see if it would come to her rescue in this situation.\n[52] The panel considered Ms. XXXX testimony and notes that she has a genuine belief in the supernatural powers of her in-laws, and in particular, XXXX. However, the panel determines that this fear is not objectively well-founded and does not constitute a personalized risk of harm within the meaning of subsection 97(1)b)(ii) of the IRPA. Further, in the panel\u2019s view, Ms. XXXX has a sincerely held belief that she would be killed by her in-laws due to her refusal to perform their mandated rituals by way of black magic. However, Ms. XXXX has not demonstrated that her fear is objectively well-founded or, on a balance of probabilities, constitute a risk of harm pursuant to subsection 97(1) of IRPA. Otherwise stated, Ms. XXXX has not demonstrated a serious possibility of persecution pursuant to section 96 of IRPA or that she would, on a balance of probabilities, be personally subjected to a risk of torture, to a risk to her life, or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment pursuant to subsection 97(1) of IRPA if returned to Nigeria.\nConclusion\n[53] For the foregoing reasons, the panel determines that XXXX XXXX XXXX, is neither a \u201cConvention refugee\u201d under section 96 of IRPA nor a \u201cperson in need of protection\u201d under subsection 97(1) of IRPA.\n[54] The panel rejects her refugee claim.\nLuna-Martine Jean\nJune 19, 2019\n1 Document 6 \u2013 Exhibit C-11; Document 5 \u2013 Exhibits C-4 and C-8.\n2 Document 5 \u2013 Exhibit C-6.\n3 Document 3 \u2013 National Documentation Package, Nigeria, 30 April 2019, tab 5.2: Nigeria: The Law and FGM, 28 Too Many, June 2018.\n4 Ibid, tab 5.28: Response to Information Request NGA105628.E., Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada, 13 September 2016.\n5 Ibid, tab 5.31: Country Profile: FGM in Nigeria. 28 Too Many.

The claimants left Egypt and had temporary status in Kuwait because of their work. The principal claimant has been detained and questioned by police due to his ethnicity and dark skin colour. Further details are highlighted in their Basis of Claim (BOC) forms.3 The claimants arrived in Canada on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018. The claimants signed the BOCs on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018.4\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution and Risk of Harm\n[3] The claimants provided a detailed narrative and documents supporting the persecution of their family including employment records, police report, death certificates of family members and articles regarding the persecution and marginalization of Nubians in Egypt.5 The objective evidence supports the claimants\u2019 fear of ethnic persecution in Egypt and indicates that the Nubian people in Egypt are an ancient people who live along the border between Sudan and Egypt and they have their own distinct language, customs and culture.6 The Nubian people have been marginalized politically, socially and economically in Egypt.7 There have been deadly clashes between Arab and Nubian tribes and the state has not taken adequate measures to protect Nubians or settle these conflicts.8 Nubians have protested to address the harassment, discrimination and displacement they face in Egypt and have been arrested by Egyptian authorities as a result of the protests.9 The state classified some of the Nubian lands as military zones in 2014 further displacing the Nubians in Egypt.10\n[4] The objective evidence indicates that Egypt\u2019s authoritarian regime is instituting wide- scale repression and punitive litigation \u201cunder the auspices of its many new laws to surveil and stifle individual voices of dissent in civil society;\u201d the authoritarian regime has acted methodically targeting those voicing dissent against the government including detentions and extrajudicial killings.11\n[5] The panel finds that the claimants have established a nexus to race\/ethnicity. Based on the totality of the evidence, the panel finds that the claimants would face more than a mere possibility of persecution if they return to Egypt.\nState Protection and Internal Flight Alternative\n[6] The objective evidence indicates the following regarding state protection in Egypt:\nThe government inconsistently punished or prosecuted officials who committed abuses, whether in the security services or elsewhere in government. In most cases the government did not comprehensively investigate human rights abuses, including most incidents of violence by security forces, contributing to an environment of impunity.12\n[7] The general security context in Egypt is uncertain at this time:\nPresident Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who first took power in a July 2013 coup, continues to govern Egypt in an authoritarian manner, though the election of a new parliament in late 2015 ended a period of rule by executive decree. Serious political opposition is virtually nonexistent, as both liberal and Islamist activists face criminal prosecution and imprisonment. Terrorism persists unabated in the Sinai Peninsula and has also struck the Egyptian mainland, despite the government\u2019s use of aggressive and often abusive tactics to combat it.13\n[8] Further evidence provides a general overview of the fragility of the current regime and lack of operationally effective state protection in Egypt:\nIn the first several months of 2017, Egypt has witnessed a number of events that have challenged the country\u2019s stability and security, economic development, and the rights and freedoms of its citizens. The Egyptian government has continued its repression of public space, even going so far as to physically close the offices of the El Nadeem Center for Rehabilitation of Victims of Violence and Torture in early February. The country is no more stable, with terror groups and the Egyptian state engaged in a war of propaganda narratives.14\n[9] Based on the totality of the evidence, the panel finds that there is no operationally effective state protection available to Nubians who face death threats due to feuds in Egypt from a state that has been complicit in their displacement and marginalization. Further, given the harassment and discrimination of Nubians due to their dark skin colour throughout Egypt, the panel finds that it is not objectively reasonable in their particular circumstances to relocate in Egypt as they would face the same difficulties and harassment throughout Egypt.\nCONCLUSION\n[10] For the foregoing reasons, the panel determines that the claimants are Convention refugees under section 96 of the Act. The Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada therefore accepts their claims.\n(signed) Kerry Cundal\nFebruary 22, 2019\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n2 Exhibit 1.\n3 Exhibits 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4 and 2.5.\n4 Exhibits 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4 and 2.5.\n5 Exhibits 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5 and 4.\n6 Exhibit 4, pp. 76-97.\n7 Exhibit 4, pp. 76-97.\n8 Exhibit 3, National Documentation Package (NDP), June 29, 2018, Item 13.1.\n9 Exhibit 3, NDP, Item 2.1.\n10 Exhibit 3, NDP, Item 2.2.\n11 Exhibit 3, NDP, Item 4.8.\n12 Exhibit 3, NDP, Item 2.1.\n13 Exhibit 3, NDP, Item 2.4.\n14 Exhibit 3, NDP, Item 2.5.\n",

The principal claimant fears gender-based persecution for her daughter, namely female genital mutilation (FGM); her daughter is XXXX years old. The claimants left Egypt on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2017. The claimant was subject to an arranged marriage on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2008. The claimant describes life with her ex-husband as a \u201cliving hell,\u201d including daily beatings and verbal abuse. The claimant was able to escape to Qatar for a time, but was not able to regularize her immigration status in Qatar. The claimant left Qatar in XXXX 2018. The claimant arrived in Canada on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018 and signed her Basis of Claim (BOC) on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018.3 The panel has reviewed and applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline on Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution4 in this decision.\nDETERMINATION\n[3] The panel finds that the claimants are Convention refugees pursuant to section 96 of the Act because they would face a serious possibility of gender-based persecution if they return to Egypt.\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution and Risk of Harm\n[4] The claimants submitted supporting documents, including identity documents and news articles on the prevalence of FGM and violence against women and girls in Egypt.5 The objective evidence supports the claimants\u2019 fear of return to Egypt and indicates that among the most significant human rights abuses in Egypt is violence against women and girls, including sexual violence by military personnel; the evidence further notes that the government did not generally take steps to investigate, prosecute or punish officials who committed human rights abuses.6 The objective evidence also indicates that authorities rarely intervene in domestic violence cases.7 Reports indicate that spousal violence in common in Egypt and there are very few mechanisms in place to protect women and violence against women goes virtually unpunished and there are some reports that authorities are dismissive or abusive to women who report domestic violence.8\n[5] The objective evidence also indicates that the prevalence of FGM in Egypt is high, around 87% and is typically performed between birth and the age of 17.9 The primary reasons for FGM cited are tradition and religion; approximately 90% of the population is Muslim and Islam is the state religion.10 Despite FGM laws, enforcement is still insufficient in Egypt and FGM continues to be carried out by health professionals.11 Finally, Egypt\u2019s human rights crisis continues unabated:\nWomen and girls continued to face inadequate protection from sexual and gender\u00ad based violence, as well as gender discrimination in law and practice. The absence of measures to ensure privacy and protection of women reporting sexual and gender-based violence continued to be a key factor preventing many women and girls from reporting such offences. Many who did report offences faced harassment and retaliation from the perpetrators or their families. In some cases, state officials and members of parliament blamed victims of sexual violence and attributed the incidents to their \u201crevealing clothing\u201d. In March a young student was attacked and sexually assaulted by a mob in Zagazig city, al-Sharkia governorate. Instead of arresting the perpetrators and bringing them to justice, the Security Directorate in al-Sharkia governorate issued a statement mentioning that by \u201cwearing a short dress\u201d the victim had \u201ccaused the mob attack\u201d.12\nState Protection and Internal Flight Alternative\n[6] Based on the totality of the evidence, the panel find that there is not adequate operationally effective state protection available to the claimants in their particular circumstances. Further, the panel finds that it is not objectively reasonable to expect the claimants to relocate in Egypt in their particular circumstances as a young single mother with few resources and the absence of state protection available to them. Accordingly, the panel finds that there is no viable internal flight alternative available to them.\nCONCLUSION\n[7] For the forgoing reasons, the panel finds that the claimants are Convention refugees pursuant to section 96 of the Act and the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada therefore accepts their claims.\n(signed) Kerry Cundal\nJanuary 14, 2019\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n2 Exhibit 1.\n3 Exhibit 2.\n4 Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (IRB) Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 4: Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution, November 13, 1996.\n5 Exhibit 4.\n6 Exhibit 3, National Documentation Package (NDP), Egypt, June 29, 2018, Item 2.1.\n7 Exhibit 3, NDP, Item 2.1.\n8 Exhibit 3, NDP, Item 5.5 Response to Information Request (RIR) EGY104706.E.\n9 Exhibit 3, NDP, Item 5.7.\n10 Exhibit 3, NDP, Item 5.7.\n11 Exhibit 3, NDP, Item 5.7.\n12 Exhibit 3, NDP, Item 2.2.\n\n",

Schmalzbauer\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Jessica Lipes\nCountry: Egypt\nRPD Number: VB8-06403\nAssociated RPD Number(s): VB8-06404, VB8-06405, VB8-6406\nATIP Number: A-2020-00518\nATIP Pages: 003624-003629\n[1] This is the decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) in the claims of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (the \u201cprincipal claimant\u201d) and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (the \u201cassociate claimant\u201d), as citizens of Egypt, and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX (the \u201cminor children\u201d) who are claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (the \u201cAct\u201d or IRPA).1\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] The following is a brief synopsis of the allegations that the adult claimants put forth in the Basis of Claim (BOC) forms.2 The principal claimant had submitted that for his entire life he and his family have been victims of racial discrimination due to their identities as Nubians. The principal claimant detailed in his narrative having been repeated harassed by authorities and arrested, detained and threatened to stop what he was doing in asking for the rights of his people, including land rights. The principal claimant and the associate claimant were married in 2014 but he was unable to acquire residency rights for his wife in Qatar where he had been working for over a decade. The adult claimants had their first child in the United States (U.S.), they had made attempts to remain in the U.S. through immigration channels but returned to Egypt and Qatar in 2015.\n[3] Their second child, was conceived in XXXX. The associate claimant became scared about being forced to circumcise her daughter as is custom. The principal claimant was laid off from his position in Qatar and the family again travelled to the U.S., where their daughter was born.\nDETERMINATION\n[4] The panel finds that the adult claimants are Convention refugees, as they do have a well- founded fear of persecution related to a Convention ground in Egypt.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[5] The panel is satisfied on a balance of probabilities, that the adult claimants are nationals of Egypt, considering the certified copies of their Egyptian passports.3\nCredibility\n[6] The duty of this panel is to find if there is sufficient credible or trustworthy evidence to determine that there is more than a mere possibility that the claimants would be persecuted if they returned to Egypt.\n[7] The principal claimant was questioned as to his political opinions and beliefs and he was genuine and credible as to his political knowledge, and I find that more likely than not that these are deeply held beliefs and concerns and that he has a right to share those opinions and belief. The claimant submitted Facebook posts from 2011 onwards regarding the political situation in Egypt.4 Overall, I accept that the claimants are of Nubian descent and that the principal claimant has been repeatedly targeted for discrimination, including political repression for his identity and political opinion as an Egyptian of Nubian descent.\n[8] According to the World Dictionary of Indigenous and Minority Peoples for Egypt 2017:\nFrustration has mounted for Egypt\u2019s ethnic minority Nubian community, culminating on 2 January 2017 in the first ever arrest of Nubian activists in direct relation to their struggle against the state. Six were charged with gathering illegally, protesting without a permit, and attacking security forces, after being detained by police on their way to protest a new presidential decree concerning land ownership. They sought to voice opposition to Presidential Decrees 355 and 498, issued in August and November, which stipulate the confiscation of 1,100 acres of land and could yield a new wave of forced evictions of Nubians already forcibly uprooted from their historical homeland with the construction of the Aswan High Dam in the 1960s. A sit-in demonstration in late November 2016 succeeded in pressuring the government into negotiations and Nubian activists and civil society organizations threatened to pursue international arbitration, but suspended their campaign to allow the state to resolve the issue.5\n[9] In the U.S. DOS report, that Nubians face discrimination, harassment. It speaks of the political arrests and the resulting protests.6\n[10] Further country condition evidence before the panel further supports his allegations of political repression:\nA February 2017 Reuters article states that \u201c[h]uman rights groups estimate [that] about 40,000 people have been detained for political reasons\u201d since Morsi was deposed Freedom House\u2019s Freedom in the World report for 2017 similarly indicates that civil society organizations \u201cestimate that as many as [40,000] people were being detained for political reasons as of 2016, most of them for real or suspected links to the Muslim Brotherhood\u201d[\u2026]In its 2016 report entitled Egypt: \u2018Officially, You Do Not Exist\u2019: Disappeared and Tortured in the Name of Counter-terrorism, Amnesty International states that a \u201cpattern of abuse\u201d that includes arbitrary arrests, arbitrary detention and enforced disappearances by state agents became \u201cparticularly evident since March 2015[\u2026]According to lawyers involved in their cases, around 90% of those who are subjected to enforced disappearance are subsequently processed through the criminal justice system on charges such as planning or participating in unauthorized protests or attacking members of the security forces.\u201d7\n[11] Currently the situation is devolving for those individuals wanted by authorities for questioning on their political or imputed political opinion given the new Emergency Law.\nWhile the exact details of the Emergency Law and how it will be applied were unclear at the publication date, it is likely that the military will be granted extended powers. DFAT assesses that detentions and arrests are likely to increase as a result of the declaration of a nation-wide state of emergency. Sisi also proposed the establishment of a Supreme Council to combat Terrorism and extremism, which would consider new powers for police and intelligence investigators and allow for the fast-tracking of terrorism cases through the court system.8\n[12] Further evidence submitted by the claimants further supports the increasing repression from the state against Nubian activists.9\n[13] The principal claimant has been active on social media, and according to the International Journal of Not for-Profit Law:\nEgypt\u2019s parliament preliminarily approved the cybercrime draft law on May 14, 2018. The draft \u201cAnti- Cyber and Information Technology Crimes Law\u201d primarily targets the illegal use of private data and other crimes that can take place online, but some of its provisions use broad terminology that could be used to penalize lawful online expression and shutter independent media outlets.10\nConcerns have been raised of the authorities\u2019 capacity and legal ability to target and silence online dissent from the new law.\n[14] The principal claimant, which I accept, was arrested and interrogated due to his political opinions. The principal claimant submitted evidence of his online posts against the political situation which the panel has found to be credible. I do find that the risk of loss of liberty is a serious infringement on the human right to liberty and personal integrity. Given the objective evidence of the situation of similarly situated persons, and the claimants\u2019 evidence of having been previously sought, I find that there is more than a serious possibility of political persecution for the claimant throughout Egypt.\nState Protection\n[15] State protection would not be reasonably forthcoming in this particular case, as the particular agent of harm is the state authorities. The country condition evidence supports that many citizens are deprived of their rights of due process, are arrested without warrants, face harassment and physical and psychological abuse from officials throughout Egypt.11\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[16] The panel finds that there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout Egypt. There is no obligation for the claimants to be in hiding. The state has control of its territories and has used state authorities in order to intimidate the claimant. The principal claimant\u2019s profile is to such a level that it would more likely than not continue to cause the claimant to be persecuted throughout Egypt.\nCONCLUSION\n[17] For the foregoing reasons the panel finds that, principal and associate claimants are Convention refugees as set out in section 96. Therefore, their claims are accepted.\nU.S. Born Minor Children\n[18] The principal claimant acted as the designated representative for the minor children. No evidence was adduced and no submissions were made against the U.S. as a country of persecution or risk.\n[19] I find that no evidence was adduced that the minor claimants would face a serious possibility of harm amounting to persecution, or that they would on a balance of probabilities, face a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or a danger of torture whether under section 96 or section 97(1) of IRPA. Since the minor claimants have adduced no evidence of a risk of return to the U.S., their claims for refugee protection are rejected.\n(signed) J.

I am going to give a decision at this time and there\u2019s no further questions, as I said before, needed from counsel or submissions, and I\u2019m prepared at this time \u2014 and counsel has waived translation, the claimants are both present at this time.\n[2] This decision is being rendered orally in the claims of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX the principal file is TB7-12354, and the adult claimants are present today and the father is the designated representative with respect to the minor child, XXXX XXXX XXXX, and the father is the principal claimant here.\n[3] Now, the gender guidelines at Guideline 4 have been also considered with respect to the female claimant for both Egypt and Libya.\n[4] This decision is being rendered orally today and a written form of these reasons may be edited for syntax, spelling, grammar, references to the applicable case law, legislation and exhibits may also be included.\n[5] I find that the principal claimant is a citizen of Libya and of Egypt. The female claimant is a citizen of Egypt, and the minor child, claimant, is a citizen of Egypt.\n[6] Now, with respect to, and I concluded this based on the certified true copies of their passports which were provided in Exhibit 1, as well as by their testimony and birth certificates provided as well, so therefore on a balance of probabilities I have concluded that the principal claimant has full citizenship, that of Libya and Egypt, the female claimant only of Egypt, and the minor child has the citizenship of Egypt.\n[7] In this case, I find that you are all persons in need of protection, which you have made a claim against \u2014 or, sorry, pursuant to Sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. I have considered the issue of nexus, which is whether you have \u2014 your fear or persecution is linked or connected to the convention grounds. I have found that it is not connected to the convention grounds in your countries of nationality, given that it would be with respect to Ms XXXXin Libya, but she\u2019s not making a claim \u2014 she\u2019s not a citizen of Libya, therefore\u2026 I\u2019ll break this down slower.\n[8] With respect to Libya, let\u2019s start with Libya. The principal claimant fears the militias as they have in the past tried to extort him and have him pay. They know he had a business, a successful business\/store, and they were trying to get money from him. In Libya there is much \u2014 the militias are divided by tribes as well. He has spoken how he was living in his tribal area of Benghazi. They tried to extort him, he was injured in a shelling and lost his leg on that occasion. His family \u2014 he lived there with his wife and child, and they lived there until 2013 when the war became unbearable and when the militias were threatening him. So he fled to Egypt where he had citizenship there as well.\n[9] He also has been in contact with his family members who live in Libya and who tell him that the militias keep asking about him and want to know where he is, and they advise him not to return.\n[10] Because you have another country of citizenship, Mr. XXXX, I am not making any conclusion about your claim against Libya, I am then going to look at your situation in Egypt, and that is where also your wife and child have their citizenship. So I\u2019m not drawing a conclusion with respect to whether you would be at risk in Libya, but just to say that I see that you would, you would face risk there. Part of the reason it the country situation in Libya, and I just want to speak briefly about that situation before I leave the whole topic of Libya.\n[11] If you face the problems with the militias, you would not be able to obtain any type of protection from government or the state to help you. Libya is currently in a state of civil war, there is no unified government or standardized method of delivering any type of security services. There\u2019s an uncertainty with respect to the political and security situation, and this situation leads me to conclude that there would be no state protection for you if you were there with your family, none for your family, and there would not be an internal flight alternative available to you as well.\n[12] Furthermore, if your wife were there she would be at risk of gender-related persecution, as war \u2014 unfortunately, rape is rampant in war, and she would be at risk of that, so of sexual assault.\n[13] The position of the United Nations suggests that internal flight is not reasonably available in Libya, therefore now I look to Egypt.\n[14] The situation with the family in Egypt, according to the allegations in the basis of claim form, which I won\u2019t repeat, basically the principal claimant\u2019s first wife, as he had the two wives, and they were concurrent at one point until he divorced the first wife, that that was legal in Egypt. The problem was despite the first wife agreeing that he could take on the second wife, XXXX XXXX, she later changed her mind and then she had her brothers, there are seven of them, cause false threats and assaults against the principal claimant, threats against his wife, and there was a threat on kidnapping their son, XXXX, in order to retaliate or make the principal claimant suffer for his having scorned her or for having taken a second wife.\n[15] Now, this brings us to the issue. So this is where there\u2019s no nexus to the convention definition, I believe. This is where what you fear, what your whole family fears, is not \u2014 I believe it\u2019s a personal life risk, but it is not a nexus because there\u2019s no convention ground that will, in my opinion, cover this.\n[16] However, on a balance of probabilities, which is the threshold I have to use, I find that there is, on a balance of probabilities, a personalized risk to your lives in Egypt. There\u2019s also no state protection, in my opinion, given that your ex-wife\u2019s brother worked in XXXX XXXX department in Egypt. If he were merely a government employee perhaps it wouldn\u2019t be the same. But given that you\u2019ve provided evidence by way of your testimony and your belief that he is an XXXX XXXX XXXX and the documentary material is clear with respect to the human rights situation deteriorating in Egypt where many human rights groups have spoken out against how the government in Egypt has, on many occasions, basically \u2014 it is respecting the human rights of the citizens.\n[17] The authorities in Egypt arbitrarily restrict the rights to freedom of expression, association, peaceful assembly, any opposition to them is basically taken in for questioning and they will not tolerate anyone being in any type of opposition to the government or expressing it in anyway.\n[18] But apart from that, the question is on the street level, would the police protect you? You\u2019ve testified how this brother, how police officers were even present at the assault when you were stabbed, Mr. XXXX. Now, that\u2019s not to say all the police are corrupt or would do that, but given the fact that the documentary material speaks about that there\u2019s a very high level of corruption in Egypt and that this brother who is one of the persons who has been threatening your family, given that he is also in the XXXX XXXX and the documentary material makes it clear, in my opinion, that a person who has those types of connections, with the corruption that is rampant in Egypt, can accomplish harming you if you were to try to go elsewhere.\n[19] So I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s an internal flight alternative for you and your family and I don\u2019t believe that the state will adequately and effectively protect the three of you if you were to try to get help against them. You did file a report against them and the report, which is in evidence, didn\u2019t go anywhere. If anything, the other family filed counter-charges against you, for which you\u2019ve testified that you were then having to appear in court.\n[20] The documentary material also speaks about prolonged detention for people in Egypt, sometimes without charges or without a trial, and how the Egyptian authorities have misused many of their powers against their own citizens, according to many human rights groups throughout the world.\n[21] So for all of these reasons, I find on a balance of probabilities that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX, that you are all persons in need of protection under Section 97(1) because your life is at risk in Egypt. Therefore, these three claims are now allowed.\n[22] Thank you.\n[23] CLAIMANTS: Thank you.\n[24] MEMBER: Do you understand? Have a good day. Thank you, counsel.\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 UPON RECESSING \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 UPON RESUMING \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n[25] MEMBER: We\u2019re back on the record. I just wanted to comment and say with respect to credibility, I had my concerns with respect to certain omissions, and I considered them a lot throughout the hearing, and I found your explanations reasonable for why these omissions occurred. You did mention them, they were mentioned as attacks in the basis of claim form. The only thing is that they were not \u2014 you did not provide the dates specifically. But you did mention them. I understand and I found your explanations reasonable for you, Ms XXXX, because they were very painful to talk about and to put down and for you, sir, because you didn\u2019t have the proof, you only had the proof of one, and you did mention it and it is in your evidence.\n[26] So overall \u2014 and I found that this doctor\u2019s letter explaining that you have XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX helps me to understand why you kind of would not answer my questions. I don\u2019t believe you were trying to be evasive.\n[27] So, for all of these reasons, I have accepted your credibility, and therefore your allegations. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve also accepted you as persons in need of protection.\n[28] This hearing is now concluded. Thank you and good day to all.\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 DECISION CONCLUDED \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n",

        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2019 RLLR 208\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: January 24, 2019\nPanel: P. Roche\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Talia Joundi\nCountry: Yemen\nRPD Number: TB8-10588\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2020-00518\nATIP Pages: 003240-003246\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] This is the decision in the claim of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX who claims to be a citizen of Yemen and is claiming refugee protection under section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).1\nEXPEDITED DETERMINATION\n[2] Paragraph 170(f) of the IRPA2 provides that the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) may allow a claim for refugee protection without a hearing, unless the Minister has notified the RPD of the Minister\u2019s intention to intervene within the time limit set out in the Refugee Protection Division Rules.3 Further, subsection 162(2) of IRPA4 directs each division to deal with all proceedings before it as informally and quickly as the circumstances and the considerations of fairness and natural justice permit.\n[3] The claimant\u2019s claim was identified as one that could be processed through the RPD\u2019s expedited process for Yemeni claims. The RPD received the claimant\u2019s signed Certificate of Readiness for the expedited process on December 20, 2018.\n[4] Having carefully considered the evidence in this case, the panel finds that this claim meets the criteria for expedited determination. This claim has been therefore decided without a hearing, according to the Policy on the Expedited Processing of Refugee Claims by the Refugee Protection Division.5\n[5] The panel considered the Chairperson\u2019s Guidelines on Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution.6\n[6] The panel has also taken into consideration the Chairperson\u2019s Guidelines on Civilian Non-Combatants Fearing Persecution In civil War Situations.7\nDETERMINATION\n[7] The panel finds that the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of IRPA, for reasons of imputed political opinion.\nALLEGATIONS\n[8] The claimant\u2019s complete allegations are set out in her Basis of Claim form (BOC)8 and need not be repeated here in detail. To summarize briefly, the claimant alleges a fear of persecution due to the fact that she will be targeted by all groups and militias involved in the conflict, due to her gender. She further alleges that she would be targeted by the Houthi-Saleh militia because her father is from south Yemen and as such are viewed as being pro-government. Due to the ongoing conflict in that country, the claimant believes that as a single woman there is no place for her to live in safety nor is there any state protection.\nIDENTITY\n[9] The panel is satisfied with the claimant\u2019s personal identity and Yemeni citizenship, based on a certified true copy of her Yemen passport.9\nCREDIBILITY\n[10] With respect to the issue of credibility, the panel has reviewed the claimant\u2019s BOC10, her intake forms11 and supporting documentation.12 The panel finds, based on the evidence before it, that the claimant only had temporary student status in Egypt. The panel has also reviewed country conditions documentation contained in the National Documentation Package (NDP) for Yemen13.\n[11] The claimant\u2019s evidence is not internally inconsistent, inherently implausible or contradicted by documentary evidence on country conditions in Yemen. Moreover, her allegations are corroborated by personal documents14 that the panel does not have sufficient reason to discount. The panel therefore finds the claimant\u2019s evidence credible and that the allegations in this case are probably true.\n[12] The panel finds that the claimant does have a subjective fear of persecution, should she return to Yemen.\nOBJECTIVE BASIS\n[13] The NDP indicates that the war in Yemen continues unabated.15 Civilian authorities did not maintain effective control over the security forces. Houthi-Saleh rebels controlled most of the security apparatus and state institutions. Competing family, tribal, party and sectarian influences also reduced government authority.16 Non-state actors, including tribal militias, reportedly committed significant abuses and few actions led to prosecution.17\n[14] The documentary evidence confirms that all parties to the continuing conflict committed war crimes and other serious violations with inadequate accountability measures in place to ensure justice and reparation to victims.\n[15] The Saudi Arabia-led coalition, supporting the internationally recognized Yemeni government, continued to bomb civilian infrastructure and carried out indiscriminate attacks, killing and injuring civilians.\n[16] The Houthi-Saleh forces indiscriminately shelled civilian residential areas in Ta\u2019iz city. The Yemeni government, Houthi-Saleh forces and Yemeni forces aligned with the United Arab Emirates and engaged in illegal detention practices including enforced disappearance and torture and other ill-treatment.18\n[17] In regards to gender, the documentary evidence states the following;\nSocietal discrimination severely restricts the freedom of movement of women, although restrictions vary by location \u2026 \u2018Social discrimination severely restricted women\u2019s freedom of movement. Women in general did not enjoy full freedom of movement, although restrictions varied by location. Some observers reported increased restrictions on women in conservative locations, such as Sa\u2019ada. Oxfam reported that men at checkpoints increasingly insisted on adherence to the \u201cmahram\u201d system, the cultural obligation of women to be accompanied by male relatives in public, in areas controlled by radical Islamic groups, such as AQAP. The report also noted that female respondents ranked the key factor limiting women\u2019s freedom of movement as the lack of cultural acceptance, followed by lack of security.19\n[18] Escalating conflict and forced movement of populations continue to create risks and instances of sexual and gender-based violence (GBV), including sexual exploitation and abuse. Focus group discussions have shown that women report psychological distress due to violence, fear for family members and fear of arrest or detention, whilst men report distress due to loss of livelihoods, restricted mobility and being forced to perform \u201cwomen-specific roles\u201d. These kinds of stress can contribute to increased levels of domestic violence, placing more women at risk.20\n[19] The law states that authorities should execute a man if convicted of killing a woman. The penal code, however, allows leniency for persons guilty of committing an \u201chonor\u201d killing or violently assaulting or killing a woman for perceived \u201cimmodest\u201d or \u201cdefiant\u201d behavior. The law does not address other types of gender-based abuse, such as beatings, forced isolation, imprisonment, and early and forced marriage.\n[20] The law provides women with protection against domestic violence, except spousal rape, under the general rubric of protecting persons against violence, but authorities did not enforce this provision effectively. Victims rarely reported domestic abuse to police and criminal proceedings in cases of domestic abuse were rare.21\n[21] Violence against women has increased 63 percent since the conflict escalated, according to UNFPA [United Nations Population Fund]. Forced marriage rates, including child marriage, have increased. Yemen has no minimum age of marriage. Women in Yemen face severe discrimination in law and practice. They cannot marry without the permission of their male guardian and do not have equal rights to divorce, inheritance or child custody. Lack of legal protection leaves them exposed to domestic and sexual violence.22\nState protection and internal flight alternative\n[22] The panel finds that the claimant has rebutted the presumption of state protection in this case. The state of Yemen is currently in crisis and as such is not able to provide effective state protection to the claimant. As previously noted above, with respect to Yemeni state institutions (regarding the year 2017):\nCivilian authorities did not maintain effective control over the security forces. Houthi-Saleh rebels controlled most of the security apparatus and state institutions. Competing family, tribal, party, and sectarian influences also reduced government authority. \u2026\nThe Hadi government took steps to investigate, prosecute and punish officials who committed human rights abuses; however, impunity was persistent and pervasive. Houthi-Saleh influence over government institutions severely reduced the Hadi government\u2019s capacity to conduct investigations.23\n[23] The panel finds that given the current country conditions there is no viable internal flight alternative for the claimant in Yemen, as there is no place where the claimant can access adequate state protection in Yemen.\nCONCLUSION\n[24] For the above reasons, the panel finds that the claimant is a person in need of protection and accepts her claim.\n(signed) P.

She is claiming refugee protection under section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).\n[2] According to her account, the claimant fears for her life should she return to Egypt because of death threats received from her mother and her paternal uncle, who wish to restore the family honour.\n[3] Throughout the hearing and its analysis, the panel took into account and applied Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 4: Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution (November 1996)1 and Guideline 8: Procedures With Respect to Vulnerable Persons Appearing Before the IRB.2\nDETERMINATION\n[4] In response to a request from the claimant\u2019s counsel, the panel found that the claimant was a vulnerable person within the meaning of the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 8. No particular procedural accommodations were requested other than applying the Guideline requirements. The panel notes that only women were present in the hearing room and that the panel took care to adopt an informal approach.\n[5] The panel determines that the claimant is a \u201cConvention refugee\u201d for the reasons set out below.\nALLEGATIONS\n[6] The claimant\u2019s full allegations can be found in her response to question 2 of her Basis of Claim Form and the attached appendices.3 Here is a brief summary.\n[7] The claimant comes from a traditional Muslim family that she describes as very conservative. She states that, when she was eight or nine years old, her mother forced her to submit to female genital mutilation.\n[8] The claimant was married, in a marriage arranged by her family, in 2013. However, in 2017, her husband decided to divorce her, despite her mother\u2019s entreaties that he remain married to the claimant.\n[9] After her divorce, the claimant realized that she was pregnant and decided to return to Cairo to find a solution to secure some of her investments.\n[10] On XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018, the claimant had to make an emergency visit to a physician, who had to terminate her pregnancy. A few days later, the claimant went to the United States for four months. She returned to Cairo believing that she would be able to carry on with her life as usual.\n[11] On XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018, a neighbour who had seen the claimant\u2019s physician and learned that she had had to terminate a pregnancy called her family\u2019s home to find out how she was doing.\n[12] After learning this, the claimant\u2019 s mother and uncle beat her violently and forcibly confined her from that moment on in the family home. The claimant\u2019s uncle threatened to inflict more serious injuries on her for having, in his opinion, dishonoured the family, implying that she deserved to die.\n[13] On XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018, a friend of the claimant\u2019s helped her escape from her home.\n[14] During the night of XXXX XXXXtoXXXX XXXX XXXX 2018, the claimant took a flight to the United States.\n[15] Upon arriving in the United States, she claimed asylum and was detained by the American authorities.\n[16] The claimant was successful in her credible fear interview and was in a state of shock; she was not released until XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018.\n[17] On XXXX XXXX XXXX 2019, the claimant arrived in Canada illegally and signed this claim for refugee protection on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2019.\n[18] She alleges that no state protection is available to her in Egypt and that she has no internal flight alternative (IFA) because of her family\u2019s connections with the police.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[19] The claimant\u2019s identity and the country of reference were established on the basis of her testimony and the documents filed, including a copy of her Egyptian passport contained in the record.4\nSection 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act\n[20] The panel examined whether this claim could meet the criteria of section 96 of the IRPA. The claimant fears being killed because of her family members\u2019 religious and cultural beliefs, according to which she dishonoured her family by becoming pregnant out of wedlock. Her fear is therefore connected to her status as a woman from a Muslim family.\n[21] There is a nexus to one of the five Convention grounds, namely, membership in a particular social group, that of women in Egypt, as well as religion, because of her failure to comply with certain Islamic religious precepts.\nCredibility and serious possibility of persecution\n[22] The panel finds that the claimant testified in a credible manner throughout the hearing. The panel did not identify any major, determinative contradictions or any omissions regarding the important elements of the reasons she fears being persecuted should she return to Egypt.\n[23] The claimant was able to explain the events she alleged and respond to the panel\u2019s various concerns. Throughout the hearing, the claimant was very emotional and was visibly quite troubled by the situation and her experiences since leaving Egypt.\n[24] Despite the many events described in her account and the panel\u2019s deconstructed approach to asking questions, the claimant was able to respond to the panel\u2019 s questions in a satisfactory manner. She also had no trouble explaining certain inconsistencies arising from the written version of her account.\n[25] The claimant filed various documents in support of her allegations.\n[26] The first is a sworn statement from the friend who supported her and helped her escape from her family home on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018, after she had been forcibly confined there for about a week.5\n[27] The next is a statement from another old friend of the claimant\u2019s, in whom she had confided about the domestic abuse she had suffered at the hands of her mother and uncle for several years.6 She also produced a statement from her brother describing the moment when he and the claimant\u2019s parents had returned to the family home and discovered that the claimant had fled.7 He also confirmed the history of family violence to which the claimant\u2019s mother and uncle had subjected her for years.\n[28] The panel did not identify any credibility issues with these documents, which were submitted along with identity documents for each of the authors. In the circumstances, the panel grants each of them the appropriate probative value.\n[29] The objective evidence supports the claimant\u2019s allegations that women are victims of violence when they defy religious precepts that are often imposed by their families and sanctioned by society at large. First, according to the sources consulted, it appears that the simple fact of not wearing a veil, when one is from a Muslim family and in society in general, may lead to daily harassment.8 Some sources indicate that \u201cviolence against women seems to be socially legitimized and surrounded by a [UN English version] \u2018culture of silence\u2019.\u201d9\n[30] Honour crimes, as defined by United Nations expert groups, remain relatively socially accepted in Egypt and are seemingly still a common practice within the most traditional families.10\n[31] For these reasons, the panel gives credence to the claimant\u2019s allegations and concludes that, if she were to return to Egypt, she would face a serious possibility of being persecuted by her mother or her uncle for disobeying certain Islamic religious precepts.\nState protection and internal flight alternative\n[32] The panel concludes that the claimant has rebutted the presumption and would not have access to adequate state protection in Egypt, in light of the objective documentation on the country.\n[33] The documentary evidence indicates not only that there is no particular prohibition condemning domestic violence against women, but also that, while domestic violence may fall under certain provisions of the penal code relating to bodily harm, various procedural impediments render such provisions ineffective for all practical purposes.\n[34] In practice, it appears that prosecutions are extremely rare and that it is even fairly complicated to file a complaint with the police as a basis for prosecution.11\n[35] Thus, impunity surrounding violence against women is an ongoing issue,12 to the point that Foreign Affairs states that a woman who wants to report a harassment incident to police \u201cis required by law to catch her attacker and bring him and two other witnesses to the police\u201d (Foreign Affairs 27 Jan. 2014). The same source quotes a representative from HarassMap as saying that women \u201cregularly \u2018have to fight with the police to actually make the report, in the street, and at the police station'\u201d.13\n[36] Moreover, with respect to honour crimes, it is indicated that the provisions of the penal code do not protect victims:\nThough the Penal Code is the primary law for the prosecution of perpetrators of violence against women including \u201chonour killings\u201d, in practice it often serves as a means to mitigate punishment. As noted above, Article 17 of the Penal Code provides broad judicial discretion to reduce sentencing in circumstances where leniency is \u201cnecessitated\u201d. Judges have found \u201chonour killings\u201d to be \u201cjustified\u201d on the basis that the victim allegedly violated prevailing social values or brought shame to the family. Article 237 of the Penal Code specifically enables judges to lower the sentencing in murders prompted by adultery.14\n[37] The panel also examined the question of whether a reasonable IFA exists for the claimant in Egypt. The objective evidence does not show that the situation for people in the same circumstances as the claimant is different in other parts of the country.\n[38] Furthermore, the claimant stated that her father is ex-military, her uncle is a former government secret intelligence officer, two of her mother\u2019s cousins are ex-military, and some of their children are former police officers and two are presently working as police officers. The claimant managed to obtain a copy of an identity document belonging to her father establishing that he was formerly a member of the military.15\n[39] The documentary evidence clearly indicates that corruption and nepotism are problems within the national police service16 and that corruption is an ongoing problem among law enforcement officials. A document entitled \u201cFighting corruption or protecting the regime? Egypt\u2019s Administrative Control Authority\u201d written in February 2019 contains the following passage:\nBut state corruption hardly ended with Mubarak\u2019s ouster. Fraudulent self-enrichment by high level and lower-level officials alike remains widespread across the vast bureaucracy. Many Egyptians say they have to pay a bribe to receive government services. Donors continue to point to corruption as an obstacle to foreign investment and economic development. Transparency International said of the situation in 2018, \u201cvery few improvements exist on the ground\u201d and \u201cserious corruption issues are currently challenging the country.\u201d17\n[40] In the circumstances, the panel concludes on a balance of probabilities that, if the claimant were to return to her country, her agents of persecution would have an interest in locating her anywhere in the country and would have the capacity to do so. Accordingly, no IFA is available to her.\nConclusion\n[41] In light of the foregoing, and after reviewing all the evidence, the panel determines that the claimant has discharged her burden of establishing that she would face a \u201cserious possibility\u201d of persecution on a Convention ground if she were to return to Haiti. The panel concludes that she would not have access to state protection in Egypt or to a viable IFA.\n[42] For these reasons, the refugee protection claim is allowed.\n(signed) Camille Th\u00e9berge M\u00e9nard\nOctober 25, 2019\n1 Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 4: Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution.

In 2011, the claimant made contact with someone through a social media App, wherein they engaged in a sexual relationship. Immediately afterwards, four of his partner\u2019s friend came into the room and physically assaulted him and threated to inform his family unless he paid extortion. He was able to escape and in an ensuing confrontation, the police intervened and the claimant, along with his abusers, were detained overnight. The claimant was subject to an anal exam to \u201cprove\u201d that he was not homosexual. The claimant escaped Egypt by finding employment in Saudi Arabia. The claimant returned to Egypt in 2018. Shortly thereafter, he met someone on social media, they had sex and then his sexual partner took out a knife and threatened the claimant. Eventually, the claimant fled to Canada wherein he made his claim for refugee protection on or about XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018.\nDETERMINATION\n[5] The panel finds that the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the Act.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[6] The claimant\u2019s identity as a national of Egypt is established by his sworn statement in his Basis of Claim form and the certified copy of the Egyptian passport on file.7\nNexus\n[7] In rendering this decision, the panel has considered the claimant\u2019s sexual orientation as a gay male. Accordingly, the panel finds there is a nexus between the claimant\u2019s sexual orientation and his fear of returning to Egypt since he has membership in a particular social group.\nCredibility\n[8] The Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (the \u201cBoard\u201d) presumes claimants are telling the truth, which is a rebuttable presumption. The panel is allowing this claim primarily on facts that are self-evident. Additionally, the claimant provided corroborative documents to establish country conditions relating to people fearing SOGIE-related persecution.8 Additionally, the claimant provided numerous documents to substantiate his sexual orientation.9\nObjective Basis\n[9] It is apparent from the country condition documents that the government of Egypt has an extremely poor human rights record, and as per the United States (U.S.) Department of State (DOS) report for Egypt for 2017:\nThe most significant human rights issues included arbitrary or unlawful killings by the government or its agents; major terrorist attacks; disappearances; torture; harsh or potentially life-threatening prison conditions; arbitrary arrest and detention; including the use of military courts to try civilians; political prisoners and detainees; unlawful interference in privacy; limits on freedom of expression, including criminal \u201cdefamation of religion\u201d laws; restrictions on the press, internet, and academic freedom; and restrictions on freedoms of assembly and association, including government control over registration and financing of NGOs. LGBTI persons faced arrests, imprisonment, and degrading treatment. The government did not effectively respond to violence against women, and there were reports of child labor.\nThe government inconsistently punished or prosecuted officials who committed abuses, whether in the security services or elsewhere in government. In most cases the government did not comprehensively investigate human rights abuses, including most incidents of violence by security forces, contributing to an environment of impunity.\nAttacks by terrorist organizations caused arbitrary and unlawful deprivation of life. Terrorist groups conducted deadly attacks on government, civilian, and security targets throughout the country, including places of worship and public transportation. Authorities investigated terrorist attacks.10\n[l0] Furthermore, elsewhere in the document, the U.S. DOS report indicates \u201cthat the government did not consistently implement the law effectively, and officials sometimes engaged in corrupt practices with impunity.\u201d11\n[11] A Board document, Egypt. State-Sponsored Homophobia,12 states that \u201csexual relations between consenting adult persons of the same sex in private are not prohibited in Egyptian law. However, as recorded the Law on the Combating of Prostitution, and the law against debauchery have been used liberally to imprison gay men in recent years.\u201d Offenses include detention of not less than six months to a maximum of five years.\n[12] Another Board document, Egypt. Dignity Debased,13 includes first-hand accounts of undignified and debased treatment of accused by security officials. The documents states that since 2013 there have been increased arrests and harassment of people perceived to be gay or transgender.\n[13] The panel finds the risk of persecution for the claimant in Egypt well founded due to his sexual orientation.\nState Protection\n[14] As the agents of persecution that would target the claimant are the government authorities of his country conducting inherently persecutory acts, the panel does not find it would be reasonable for the claimant to seek state protection from persecution in his country of nationality.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[15] It would be unreasonable to assess an internal flight alternative anywhere in Egypt given the lack of adequate security protection in that country.\nCONCLUSION\n[16] The panel finds the claimant is a Convention refugee and accepts his application for protection.\n(signed) DOUGLAS CRYER\nJANUARY 21, 2019\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n2 Policy on the Expedited Processing of Refugee Claims by the Refugee Protection Division, effective date September 18, 2015.\n3 Exhibit 2.\n4 Exhibit 1.\n5 Exhibit 3, National Documentation Package (NDP), Egypt, June 29, 2018.\n6 Exhibit 2.\n7 Exhibit 2 and Exhibit 1 \u2013 Certified copy of Passport.\n8 Exhibit 4.\n9 Exhibit 5.\n10 Exhibit 3, NDP, Item 2.1.\n11 Exhibit 3, NDP, Item 2.1.\n12 Exhibit 3, NDP, Item 6.1.\n13 Exhibit 3, NDP, Item 6.2.\n",

The panel also finds that the principal claimant and the male claimant are not persons in need of protection pursuant to section 97(1) of the IRPA.\n[3] The panel finds that the daughter is a Convention refugee as she does have a well-founded fear of persecution on a Convention ground in Egypt. Its reasons are as follows:\nALLEGATIONS\n[4] The claimants\u2019 complete allegations are set out in the Basis of Claim Form (BOC)2 and need not be repeated here in detail.\n[5] To summarize briefly, the principal claimant is a woman born in XXXX. She is a long- time resident of Saudi Arabia. She came to Canada with her two minor children. She came because she feared female genital mutilation and\/or forced marriage being imposed on her minor daughter, the associated claimant. She feared this might happen at the hands of her in-laws, who she describes as a very conservative, powerful and influential family in Egypt. She describes her mother in law and her four children as fanatic Sunni Muslims. The in-laws, upon learning that the daughter had reached puberty, demanded that she undergo Female genital mutilations (FGM) so that she could marry after the procedure. The principal claimant underwent FGM as a child. The claimant also fears that her minor children might be abducted as there is a problem in Egypt with human organs sold on the black market.\n[6] In Egypt, the principal claimant still has her mother, and three brothers and a sister, all residing in Cairo.\n[7] The claimants also allege fear of risk to their lives, risk of torture or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment at the hands of the same agent of harm.\n[8] The claimants allege that neither state protection nor safe and reasonable internal flight alternatives are available in their country of nationality.\nChairperson\u2019s Guidelines\n[9] In coming to this determination, the panel has considered the Chairperson\u2019s Guidelines on Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution3 and in particular, Part D, which addresses special problems faced by women in demonstrating that their claims are trustworthy and credible at determination hearings. Sorne of the factors noted include cross\u00ad cultural misunderstandings and violence-related trauma. The panel has considered these guidelines while assessing questions regarding subjective fear in the claim of the female claimants. Reasons for drawing on these guidelines include objective country conditions evidence and how they relate to the claimant herself at the time of the hearing. The panel has also considered Guideline 3: Child Refugee Claimants: Procedural and Evidentiary Issues4 in coming to a decision in the claims of the minors.\nANALYSIS\n[10] The main issues are credibility and subjective fear and Internal Flight Alternative (IFA).\nDESIGNATED REPRESENTATIVE\n[11] The principal claimant was appointed as Designated Representative for the two associated claimants, who are both minors.\nIdentity\n[12] The claimants\u2019 identities and citizenship have been established by the testimony and supporting documentation filed and entered in these proceedings. The passports are on file,5 along with other documents.\nNexus\n[13] For the claimants to be Convention refugees, the fear of persecution must be \u201cby reason of\u2019 one of the five grounds enumerated in the Convention refugee definition. In other words they must have a well- founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion.\n[14] The panel finds that the harm feared by the daughter is by reason of membership in particular social group as females fearing female genital mutilation and\/or forced marriage. For the mother, the nexus is membership in a particular social group as a female seeking to prevent FGM and\/or forced marriage of her minor daughter. The panel finds that the harm feared by the son is also by reason of one of the five grounds enumerated in the Convention refugee definition, namely membership in a particular social group, in this case, family member of his mother and sister, whose nexus is gender-based.\nCredibility\n[15] When credibility is assessed there are two principles that are followed. Firstly, when a claimant swears to the truthfulness of certain facts there is a presumption that what he is saying is true unless there is reason to doubt it.6 Secondly, when assessing credibility the panel is entitled to rely on rationality and common sense.7 The determination as to whether a claimant\u2019s evidence is credible is made on a balance of probabilities.\n[16] The panel accepts that the principal claimant has undergone FGM and that she is opposed to her minor daughter being submitted to it. The panel accepts that the claimants are unable to return to Saudi Arabia to live and work. This matters as it means that their claims must be assessed in the context of Egypt only. The evidence on the possibility of return to Saudi Arabia was inconsistent as the husband, in his testimony, said the principal claimant\u2019s work position has been \u201csaudified\u201d. This is not what the principal claimant said, as she testified that her husband\u2019s position had been \u201csaudified\u201d and that, as a result, her own status in Saudi Arabia was in peril. Either way, the panel accepts that the claimants cannot return to Saudi Arabia to live and work.\n[17] The principal claimant\u2019s evidence on the year of the fateful trip to Egypt and resulting kidnapping in Cairo was inconsistent. She orally confirmed her oral testimony that the year of the trip was 2017. When it was put to her that her BOC says it was in 2016, her explanation was that she had noticed it when completing the BOC and had told the BOC interpreter to correct it. When asked why, then, she affirmed a non-corrected BOC of which she said she knew the contents, the claimant said that it was because the BOC interpreter told her he had corrected the error. The claimant also suggested that the panel ask the BOC interpreter about the matter. It is the claimant\u2019s responsibility to establish the elements of her claim, not the panel\u2019s. The claimant offered to get proof from the BOC interpreter that he had made this mistake, but she failed to do so. This is in spite of the resumption in the hearing being set after this initial testimony was taken. The panel draws a negative inference, finding that this is a material inconsistency which is not reasonably explained. This matters as the claimant repeatedly stated that the problems with her in-laws began around the end of 2016 or early 2017, when her daughter had her first menstrual period. The panel draws a negative inference and finds she would have gotten the year right if it had happened as alleged.\n[18] This inconsistency relating to the year of the trip to Egypt also matters as the claimant, when asked why, if she knew, as alleged, by the XXXX of 2017, that her in-laws intended to forcibly perform FGM on the daughter and marry her off, why she decided to go to Egypt a few months later with her daughter. The principal claimant\u2019s explanation was that she needed to process the renewal of her work visa. She also said that her mother was ill and she needed to go see her. The panel finds this is insufficient explanation for a lack of subjective fear demonstrated by the claimant\u2019s re-availment to Egypt, the daughter\u2019s in the XXXX of 2017 and\/or the XXXX following her first menstrual period. This is all the more damaging to the claims given that the claimant had a US visa issued in XXXX 2016 which she could have used to travel to the USA instead of going to Egypt in the summer.\n[19] The fact that the claimant did travel to the USA in XXXX 2016, on her US visa issued in XXXX 2016, is damaging to the claim as, if the panel accepts, for the sake of analysis, that the threat to perform FGM on the daughter was made in the XXXX of 2016, then it begs the question of why the claimant failed to make an asylum claim in the USA and why she returned to Saudi Arabia, to then travel later that summer, or the following summer, to Egypt. Either way, even if the panel were to accept that, in fact, the abduction of the daughter took place in XXXX 2016 and not 2017, the principal claimant\u2019s behavior is problematic and raises significant credibility and subjective fear issues. The panel finds that the inconsistency in the timing of the abduction of the daughter, be it in 2016 or 2017, is problematic either way. That is the case because the claimant chose to return to Egypt with her daughter after learning of her in-laws\u2019 intentions against her daughter. It is also because, if the claimant learned this in early 2016, it leaves the question of why she herself failed to make an asylum claim in the USA when there in XXXX 2016. As seen in these Reasons, the claimant\u2019s explanation for this failure to claim in the USA was problematic. This is significant as the claimant alleges that her own life is at risk as a result of her in-laws\u2019 intentions.\n[20] The panel finds that the claimant has not established that her in-laws have the ongoing motivation and capacity to harm her or her daughter or her son. The reason for this is that the claimants spent 4-5 days after threats uttered against them, after the principal claimant went to the police right after picking up her daughter from her sister in law XXXX home, where the daughter was being forcibly prepared for FGM. This gives the agents of persecution plenty of reason to want to harm or re-abduct the daughter, and to carry out their threats against the principal claimant. Instead, the in-laws did not harm the claimants, who remained in the claimants\u2019 family home for four to five days. The principal claimant confirmed that the in-laws knew where she was at his time. During that time, there was no physical interference, no reported physical contact at all, and the claimants were able to leave Egypt for Saudi Arabia in a normal fashion without their exit or freedom of movement being otherwise impeded. In addition, the principal claimant was able to go about dealing with the paperwork required to renew her work permit in Saudi Arabia without being impeded. Presumably, that required her physical presence. The panel finds that, if the agents of persecution were intent on harming the claimants, they would have done so. That is because they knew their location during these four to five days. The claimant alleges that, during those four or five days, her in-laws went to her family home, saying to her: \u201cwho do you think you are?\u201d They also allegedly threatened her by saying that they can reach her at any point in any way. The panel finds that this was an empty threat, which the in-laws did not act on in spite of the opportunity to do so. The panel accepts that the in-laws harbor ill will towards the claimant, but the panel finds that does not mean that they will act on it. This is all the more so given that the claimant had gotten her way, by securing her daughter, taking her away from her aunt Iman\u2019s home, and committing the affront of reporting the matter to the police. Surely this would warrant more than empty threats from someone intent on carrying out the threat and\/or imposing FGM on the daughter and\/or killing the principal claimant for her opposition to such things being perpetrated on her daughter.\n[21] The panel finds that the claimant has not established that her in-laws have the power or influence which she attributes to them. She testified that she knows they have influence because they do not let her out of her sight. She also testified that, according to tradition, they have all the habits and influence. This is insufficient credible and trustworthy evidence. It is too vague, and insufficiently grounded in any kind of specific, clear evidence of power or influence which is separate from the claimant\u2019s belief t in its existence. This weakness of the claimant\u2019s evidence exists in spite of repeated questions by the panel bearing on the power and reach and influence of the in-laws. The panel further notes that neither the claimant\u2019s sister nor her husband, in their letters of support in exhibit 4, mention any of this when referring to the in-laws. The sister says that the claimants were chased everywhere by the in-laws. The panel does not take this as evidence of the in-law\u2019s influence or presence throughout Egypt. The claimant alleged that, during the trip to Egypt when her daughter was abducted, she went to XXXX XXXX XXXX, where her in-laws targeted her by telephone. She also alleged that she then went to Cairo, where she was targeted. This, in fact, raises yet more credibility questions regarding why she later went to Cairo, where she knew her in-laws reside. The husband\u2019s relatives appear to have lost interest and have retreated into excommunicating those family members whose behavior or values they reject, such as the husband\u2019s. The panel notes that, in spite of the husband\u2019s family alleged influence, there is insufficient credible and trustworthy evidence that they have threatened him since breaking off contact with him. This is yet another indication, in the panel\u2019s mind, that his family do not have the motivation and\/or capacity to pursue the claimants, given that this ex\u00ad communication directly relates to the claimants.\n[22] The panel finds that the claimant has not established that her in-laws or their clan are present throughout Egypt and\/or in XXXX XXXX XXXX. When asked, she said they are present in Assouan, Cairo and perhaps, the Sinai. The panel notes that this is unclear evidence pertaining to the Sinai. The panel finds that the claimant has not established on a balance of probabilities that her in-laws are anywhere except Assouan and Cairo. This matters to the question of the geographical reach of the in-laws, which in turn relates to the question of IFA in XXXX XXXX XXXX. It also matters as it relates to the influence of the in-laws. The claimant has not established that the in-laws have influence outside of Cairo and Assouan.\n[23] The claimant failed to establish with sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence that her in-laws have the power and influence in Egyptian society that she alleges. When asked, her answers were vague and circular. The husband\u2019s testimony that his family are a well-established and well-connected, wealthy family with influence is insufficient. That is because, though asked more than once, he failed to provide any specific indication of his family\u2019s influence. This credibility finding matters as it relates to a lack of sufficient evidence which is material to the question of IFA.\n[24] The claimant referred to the registry where she would have to register if she moved to the proposed IFA. The panel accepts the existence of this registry, but does not see how it matters given that the claimant has not established that the agents of harm have the motivation and capacity to seek and\/or obtain her personal information through the registry.\n[25] Counsel in his questions tried to establish that the possibility of the husband having ongoing communication with the claimants were in the proposed IFA would pose a risk of serious possibility of persecution to the claimants in the IFA. This, in counsel\u2019s view, would be as a result of his own past wavering position on the question of FGM as it applies to his daughter. Counsel also tried to make the case that the future would yield foreseeable pressure on the husband from the in-laws, implying that the husband would waiver and that this would result in a serious possibility of persecution for the claimants. The panel finds that the counsel has not made out his case in either of these assertions. That is because his views are not supported by sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence. When one looks at what the claimant knows and has experienced, her evidence is different and does not support counsel\u2019s point. That is because the claimant clearly stated more than once in testimony that her husband now shares her position regarding FGM as it applies to the daughter. The claimant clearly stated that there is no flexibility in regard to FGM and the daughter, i.e. that it cannot happen. The claimant said this in the context not of her own personal will, but rather in the context of the couple she forms with her husband. What counsel is suggesting amounts to speculation and, as such, does not merit much weight.\nINTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE (IFA)\n[26] The following possible IFA was put to the claimant: XXXX XXXX XXXX.\nFirst prong: no serious possibility of persecution or no personalised risk under subsection 97(1).\n[27] The panel finds that the proposed IFA, on a balance of probabilities, does not pose a serious possibility of persecution in the IFA as defined in section 96 of IRPA and\/or a risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or a danger of torture in the IFA \u2013 as per subsection 97(1) of IRPA for the claimants. The persecution and\/or risk to life envisaged in this section relates to the threats of FGM and\/or early or forced marriage on the daughter. This analysis is done on a balance of probabilities. Once the IFA has been identified, the onus of proof that the IFA is not viable is on the claimants. As seen in the above credibility analysis, the claimants have not established that the agents of persecution have the motivation or capacity to track them in the proposed IFA. The agents of persecution had the opportunity to persecute the claimants in Cairo and did not do so. This was in spite of their continued contact at the time with the claimants. In addition, the husband is now a staunch ally of the claimants in regards to their fear of persecution. The claimant described her husband in these terms and he testified accordingly providing evidence which supported the principal claimant\u2019s testimony in this regard. Furthermore, the husband\u2019s relationship with his own family of origin has evolved as they have excommunicated him as a result of his staunch support of the principal claimant against his own family\u2019s wishes. For these reasons, it is not credible that the in-laws would locate the claimants in XXXX XXXX XXXX as there is insufficient credible and trustworthy evidence that they would seek to do so or know how to do so.\n[28] The principal claimant alleges that, as someone who would oppose any FGM or forcible marriage on her daughter, she herself would be face a serious possibility of persecution. As for the forward-looking risk of FGM for the daughter in the IFA, the country conditions documents speak to a diminishing risk and rate of FGM for her generation.8 Furthermore, there is insufficient credible evidence that anyone other than her father\u2019s family would seek to impose it on the daughter. As that allegation is resolved by an IFA, the principal claimant\u2019s claim on this ground fails. The same can be said for the risk of forced marriage being imposed on the daughter. There is insufficient credible and trustworthy evidence that the possibility of persecution comes from anyone other than her father\u2019s family. As is the case for FGM, that possibility is undermined by the panel\u2019s finding of an IFA, and its earlier finding of lack of motivation and capacity of the in-laws to locate and harm the claimants in the IFA. In either case, be it FGM or forced marriage, the daughter is shielded in effect from societal risk by her parents\u2019 staunch resolve to prevent that from happening to her. There is insufficient credible and trustworthy evidence that there is a serious possibility of persecution for the principal claimant in the IFA. This also impacts any related possibility of persecution for the son based on his membership in the family.\nSecond prong: IFA is objectively reasonable, in all the circumstances:\n[29] Having considered the conditions in geographic area and all the circumstances of this case, including those particular to the claimants, the panel finds that it is objectively reasonable for the claimants to seek refuge in the proposed IFA for the following reason. Once the IFA has been identified, it is up to the claimants to establish that it is not a viable solution. The claimants have failed to establish that the proposed IFA is not objectively reasonable, in all the circumstances.\nRESIDUAL CLAIMS OF THE PRINCIPAL CLAIMANT AND SON\n[30] Although significant and repeated discrimination may amount to persecution, whether or not it rises to the level of persecution depends on the particular circumstances of the case. Persecution is defined as the systematic or sustained or repeated violations of one\u2019s fundamental human rights. When considering whether the principal claimant faces cumulative discrimination amounting to persecution resulting from sexual harassment of women in Egypt, the panel finds that the claimant had an insufficient explanation for why she took the repeated prolonged trips to Egypt if the sexual harassment was problematic for her. This is important as each time she returned to Egypt, she was essentially exposing herself to a risk which she has not alleged as existing in Saudi Arabia, her country of residence at the time. The panel notes that the claimant said she would go to Egypt to visit her family and to renew her Saudi work permit. The trip the claimant took to XXXX XXXX XXXX appears to serve neither of those goals, thus undermining the reasoning that the only reason for her return to Egypt was to see family and renew her work visa. The claimant has also failed to establish why renewing her work permit and seeing her family necessitated lengthy such frequent trips to Egypt. Her passports bear stamps that document trips to Egypt occurring more than once a year on average.9 Given the weak evidence from her in regards to sexual harassment in Egypt, this is inconsistent with a finding that she chose out of necessity to put up with the sexual harassment each time she returned to Egypt.\n[31] The panel also notes that the claimant failed to reasonably explain why she failed to claim asylum when in the US prior to the trip to Egypt when her daughter was abducted. Absent further credible and trustworthy evidence, the claimant\u2019s explanation of anti-Muslim sentiment in the US as a result of the voting in of Mr. Trump as US president cannot stand as a reasonable explanation for her failure to seek asylum in the US at this time on the grounds of sexual harassment in Egypt. That is because, at that time, the US presidential elections had not been held and Mr. Trump was not the anticipated candidate and\/or winner of it. The claimant\u2019s lack of subjective fear of the sexual harassment she faced in Egypt also came out of her failure to follow counsel\u2019s lead when questioned on her statement that she had to stay home 24\/7 as a result of sexual harassment. Her testimony that she thought of making an asylum claim in the US based on her female gender is undermined by her explanation that the problems did not start until 2017, before which her daughter had not yet reached puberty. Her evidence, when seen as a whole, is insufficient to sustain a positive determination based on a risk of sexual harassment as it applies to her.\n[32] The panel accepts that, as a general rule, women suffer discrimination or harassment in Egypt. In some cases this discrimination or harassment can amount to persecution. The documentary evidence lists the following factors among women: education, wealth, age, marital status, rural versus urban residence, and the specific geographic area of Egypt where the person resides. These factors are described as impacting, among other things: early or forced marriage, exposure to FGM and pro-FGM attitudes, access to education, age at first birth, whether it is a home birth, and access to employment.10 There is also information that the \u201crelative level of participation of women in household decision-making is positively correlated to their age and level of education and wealth\u201d.11 The panel finds that this objective evidence supports a finding that not all women in Egypt face discrimination amounting to persecution, as not all women are equally affected. That is in spite of widespread sexual harassment in the country.\n[33] It was up to the claimant to establish that the sexual harassment and\/or other discrimination she faces as a woman in Egypt, when seen cumulatively, rises to the level of persecution in her particular case. She failed to do so. This failure on the part of the claimant is all the more significant given that, as she had lost her long-time status in Saudi Arabia, she was well aware that she faced returning to reside and work in Egypt. This failure on the part of the claimant to establish a case is also all the more significant given that, during the many years she spent residing in Saudi Arabia, she returned regularly to Egypt where she visited family. Her contacts with her family and, presumably, others in Egypt, during these trips, would have given her information and knowledge on the question of sexual harassment and\/or discrimination against women beyond her own experiences during those numerous trips. The claimant\u2019s testimony that, as a woman, she had to stay indoors in Egypt \u201c24\/7\u201d is insufficient given her insufficient explanations for her lack of subjective fear in the face of this and the previously mentioned credibility issues arising out of her evidence in regard to this aspect of her claim. She failed to establish how the social context of Egypt vis a vis women impaired or nullified her enjoyment of her fundamental human rights, or how the institutionalized attitudes that discriminate against women would impact her in such a way that it would amount to persecution. It is worth noting in this regard that she was able, without male support, to turn to the police in Egypt. She also managed to change her husband\u2019s position regarding his own family and the physical integrity of their daughter. These are positive indicators of the claimant\u2019s ability to function as a woman in Egyptian society, even when going against the tide. The panel finds the claimant, as a female, faces discrimination and not persecution in Egypt.\nRESIDUAL CLAIM OF DAUGHTER\n[34] The panel finds that the evidence pertaining to the daughter on the possibility of sexual harassment and\/or discrimination amounting to persecution in Egypt is quite different from her mother\u2019s. The daughter did not testify. As a result, there are no credibility problems stemming from her testimony. As she is a minor, there is no requirement for her to demonstrate subjective fear. The weakness of the advocacy of her claim by her Designated Representative should not count against her. The life choices of the mother in regard to her own allegations of sexual harassment amounting to persecution should not count against her daughter. The panel has considered that, as a minor, the proper approach is to assess her evidence from a child-centered perspective. The panel is mindful that what does not amount to persecution for an adult may well constitute persecution for a minor. The panel appreciates that \u201cchildren have distinct rights, are in need of special protection, and can be persecuted in ways that would not amount to persecution of an adult\u201d. \u201cPhysical violence and the sexual harassment of women remains widespread in Egypt, despite harassment being made a criminal offence in June 2014.\u201d12 The daughter is XXXX years old. She is young enough for a return to Egypt to impact on her development. When one looks at the objective basis for the daughter\u2019s residual claim of discrimination amounting to persecution resulting from cumulative sexual harassment of females in Egypt, the panel finds that her case is made out. The objective country conditions evidence describe wide-ranging, country-wide sexual harassment of women.13 \u201cSexual harassment and violence in public places is an ongoing problem for women in Egypt\u201d.14 As a XXXX-year old female having reached puberty, the daughter would be impacted by this state of affairs. Given her young age, it is reasonable to conclude that, in her case, it would reach the threshold of persecution. In the specific case of the daughter when faced with this, there is no state protection as \u201c[t]here do not appear to be any mechanisms in place to ensure implementation of the legal framework relevant to sexual harassment\u201d.15 There is no available IFA. The daughter therefore faces a serious possibility of persecution throughout Egypt.\n[35] Turning to the son, his claim has not been established and fails for this reason. The residual claim of risk of organ harvesting to children is not covered by s. 96 or s. 97 of IRPA. It is an opportunistic crime, which exists as a generalized risk for large segments of the Egyptian population. There is insufficient credible and trustworthy evidence that the risk of this happening to the son is higher or different than for large segments of the population, or that it is a risk to children because they are children.\nCONCLUSION\n[36] Having considered all of the evidence, the panel determines that there is not a serious possibility that the principal claimant or her son would be persecuted in their country of nationality for any of the five grounds enumerated in the Refugee Convention. The panel also finds that the claimants are not persons in need of protection pursuant to section 97(1) of the IRPA.\n[37] The principal claimant and her son have an IFA.\n[38] The panel concludes that the principal claimant and her son are not Convention refugees or persons in need of protection and the panel therefore rejects their claims.\n[39] Having considered all of the evidence, the panel determines that there is a serious possibility that the daughter would be persecuted in her country of nationality for one of the five grounds enumerated in the Refugee Convention. She does not have an IFA. The panel concludes that the daughter is a Convention refugee. The panel accepts her claim.\n(signed) MIRYAM MOLGAT\nApril 11, 2019\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n2 Exhibit 2.\n3 Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (IRB) Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 4: Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution, November 1996.\n4 Guideline 3: Child Refugee Claimants: Procedural and Evidentiary Issues: Guidelines issued by the Chairperson pursuant to Section 65(3) of the Immigration Act, September 30, 1996.\n5 Exhibit 1.\n6 Maldonado v.

The claimant is a Christian. The claimant received threats by Muslim extremists calling her \u201cinfidel\u201d and \u201cenemy of Allah\u201d because she was hosting Bible studies in her home for women. The claimant also faced harassment because she refuses to wear a hijab, including being pushed to the ground. The claimant left Egypt on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018 and arrived in Canada on the same day. Further details are highlighted in her Basis of Claim (BOC) forms.3 The claimant signed her BOC on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018.4 The panel has reviewed and applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline on Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution5 in this decision.\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution and Risk of Harm\n[3] The claimant provided a detailed narrative and documents supporting her Christian religion.6 The objective evidence supports the claimant\u2019s fear of religious persecution by Muslim extremists in Egypt. The evidence indicates that there has been an increase in sectarian violence against Christians.7 The evidence indicates that there have been violent attacks against Christians by Muslim extremists throughout Egypt including in Cairo and in Alexandria.8 The panel finds that the claimant has established a nexus to religion because of her Christian faith and that she would face more than a mere possibility of persecution if she returns to Egypt.\nState Protection\n[4] The objective evidence indicates the following regarding state protection in Egypt:\nThe government inconsistently punished or prosecuted officials who committed abuses, whether in the security services or elsewhere in government. In most cases the government did not comprehensively investigate human rights abuses, including most incidents of violence by security forces, contributing to an environment of impunity.9\n[5] A Human Rights Watch report dated March 13, 2017 indicates that Christians who have been targeted by Muslim extremists report that Egyptian security forces are \u201capathetic\u201d in their response to assist Christians.10 Further reports indicate that:\nThe authorities continued to violate the right to freedom of religion by discriminating against Christians. In August, security forces prevented dozens of Coptic Christians from praying in a house in Alforn village in Minya governorate, citing reasons of security. There was continued impunity for sectarian attacks on Christian communities, and the authorities continued to rely on customary reconciliation and settlements agreed by local authorities and religious leaders. Amid this impunity, violence by non-state actors against Christians increased significantly.11\n[6] The general security context in Egypt is uncertain at this time:\nPresident Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who first took power in a July 2013 coup, continues to govern Egypt in an authoritarian manner, though the election of a new parliament in late 2015 ended a period of rule by executive decree. Serious political opposition is virtually nonexistent, as both liberal and Islamist activists face criminal prosecution and imprisonment. Terrorism persists unabated in the Sinai Peninsula and has also struck the Egyptian mainland, despite the government\u2019s use of aggressive and often abusive tactics to combat it.12\n[7] Further evidence provides a general overview of the fragility of the current regime and lack of operationally effective state protection in Egypt:\nIn the first several months of 2017, Egypt has witnessed a number of events that have challenged the country\u2019s stability and security, economic development, and the rights and freedoms of its citizens. The Egyptian government has continued its repercussion of public space, even going so far as to physically close the offices of the El Nadeem Center for Rehabilitation of Victims of Violence and Torture in early February. The country is no more stable, with terror groups and the Egyptian state engaged in a war of propaganda narratives. The Islamic State\u2019s affiliate in mainland Egypt has targeted churches on Palm Sunday and announced its \u201demir\u201d in Islamic State media. The Islamic State\u2019s Wilayat Sinai also is increasingly targeting the Christian population as it continues to claim control over urban areas in North Sinai even as Egypt\u2019s army and tribal militias commit violence against unarmed residents of Sinai. A year ahead of scheduled elections, human rights lawyer and rumored presidential candidate Khaled Ali has been detained by security forces and smeared in pro-regime media as fomenting dissent.13\n[8] Based on the totality of the evidence, the panel finds that there is no operationally effective state protection available to the claimant in Egypt at this time.\nInternal Flight Alternative (IFA)\n[9] In Rasaratnam v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), the Court of Appeal held that, with respect to the burden of proof, once the issue of an internal flight alternative was raised, the onus is on the claimant to show that she does not have an IFA.14 The burden placed on a claimant is fairly high in order to show that the IFA is unreasonable. In the Federal Court of Appeal decision of Ranganathan v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) in 2001, it was stated that the test is to show that the IFA is unreasonable.15 That test requires nothing less than the existence of conditions that would jeopardize the life and safety of the claimants in relocating to a safe area. Actual and concrete evidence of adverse conditions is required. The panel must be satisfied on a balance of probabilities that (1) the claimant would not be subject personally to a danger of torture, or to a risk of life or a risk of cruel and unusual punishment or face a serious possibility of persecution in the proposed IFA and (2) that conditions in that part of the country are such that it would be objectively reasonable, in all the circumstances, including those particular to the claimant, for her to seek refuge there.\n[10] The objective evidence provides examples of targeting of Christians with impunity in Cairo and Alexandria. For example, in December 2016, an Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS)\u00ad affiliated suicide bomber killed 29 people in an attack against a Christian church, Saints Peter and Paul Church in Cairo.16 Reports of bombings at Christian churches also occurred in Alexandria in April 2017 during Palm Sunday at St. Mark\u2019s Cathedral.17 The same report indicates that \u201cMuslims opposed to church construction or renovation, even when legally authorized, continued to commit violence against churches and Christian-owned properties in various locales.\u201d18 Given the general insecurity in Egypt and the successful violent attacks against Christians in Cairo and Alexandria by Muslim extremists, the panel finds that there is no viable internal flight alternative available to the claimant in her particular circumstances as she would not be free to worship or practice her Christian faith without fear of violent attacks perpetrated with impunity by Muslim extremists.\nCONCLUSION\n[11] For the foregoing reasons, the panel determines that the claimant is a Convention refugee under section 96 of the Act. The Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada therefore accepts her claim.\n(signed) KERRY CUNDAL\nJanuary 15, 2019\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n2 Exhibit 1.\n3 Exhibit 2.\n4 Exhibit 2.\n5 Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (IRB) Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 4: Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution, Ottawa, Canada, March 1993, updated November 1996.\n6 Exhibits 1 and 2.\n7 Exhibit 3, National Documentation Package (NDP), June 29, 2018, Item 1.7.\n8 Exhibit 3, NDP, Item 1.7.\n9 Exhibit 3, NDP, Item 2.1.\n10 Exhibit 3, NDP, Item 12.5.\n11 Exhibit 3, NDP, Item 2.2.\n12 Exhibit 3, NDP, Item 2.4.\n13 Exhibit 3, NDP, Item 2.5.\n14 Rasaratnam v.

Schmalzbauer\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Ruth Williams\nCountry: Egypt\nRPD Number: VB8-00857\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2020-00518\nATIP Pages: 002780-002786\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] This is the decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) in the claim of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (the \u201cprincipal claimant\u201d) and his spouse, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (the \u201cassociate claimant\u201d), as citizens of Egypt, who are claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (the \u201cAct\u201d).1\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] The following is a brief synopsis of the allegations that the claimants put forth in the Basis of Claim (BOC) forms.2 The claimants fear political persecution due to their religion, as Coptic Christians. The claimants submit that they have since 2011, enduring increasing harassment, discrimination and violence due to their religious identity. The claimants had lived in a city known for its Christian population.\n[3] The claimants were both professionals in XXXX. They had owned and operated a local XXXX. In precipitating their decision to leave Egypt and seek safety for their three children and themselves, the XXXX and the principal claimant was attacked by religious extremists. He was first threatened in the XXXX, then the XXXX was attacked and damaged, and a threatening letter was left, against his children being kidnapped.\n[4] They fled the local area and made their arrangements to leave Egypt and come to Canada and seek protection.\nDetermination\n[5] The panel finds that the claimants are Convention refugees, as they do have a well- founded fear of persecution related to a Convention ground in Egypt.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[6] The panel is satisfied on a balance of probabilities in the claimants\u2019 identities as nationals of Egypt, considering the certified copies of their Egyptian passports.3\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution\n[7] The duty of this panel is to find if there is sufficient credible or trustworthy evidence to determine that there is more than a mere possibility that the claimants would be persecuted if they returned to Egypt. The claimants submit that they fear persecution due to their faith and identities, as Coptic Christians.\n[8] The claimants testified in a very detailed, genuine and credible manner throughout their testimony. Both were able to reasonably convey their personal and professional circumstance in Egypt. They supported their testimony and allegations by presenting their business documents. They also submitted letters and pictures of support in documenting the events that precipitated their claim in Canada.4 The testimony before this panel was detailed and genuine as to their circumstances in Egypt, including the numerous attacks and threats against them and their minor children. Although they had travelled to Canada previously, without making a claim; I am satisfied in their explanation that they had a professional and comfortable life and at the time of previous travels it was less of a risk to continue to live in Egypt, however, their change in circumstances and the threats against them have increased, resulting in them leaving their lives behind and seeking protection. I take no negative inference against not previously seeking protection when in Canada. Overall, I accept the claimant\u2019s allegations as presented.\n[9] The objective evidence reports that approximately 90 percent of Egypt\u2019s population is Sunni Muslim and approximately ten percent is recognized as Christian.5 Approximately ten percent of Christians belong to the Coptic Orthodox Church, while other Christian communities constitute less than two percent of the population.\n[10] Egypt\u2019s constitution describes freedom of belief as absolute and it provides adherents of Islam, Christianity and Judaism the right to practice their religion freely.6 However, the country condition evidence reports that sectarian attacks against Christians continue, including church bombings committed by the Islamic State (IS), forced displacement, physical assaults, arson attacks and blocking of church construction.7 A Response to Information Request (RIR) before me lists numerous and serious attacks committed against Coptic Christians in 2016 and 2017.8 There is evidence that high level officials, such as the President, are making efforts to promote religious freedoms. For example, President Sisi has pledged to respect freedom of belief and has made visits to Coptic Christian masses.\n[11] Increased attacks by IS in February 2017 lead to the largest wave of collective displacement in Egypt since the June 1967 war. Furthermore, two bombings in April 2017 led to President Sisi declaring a three-month state of emergency in the country.9 Additionally, the United States (U.S.) Department of State Report (DOS) indicates that lethal sectarian violence continued over the year, and included mob violence and vigilantism, for example, in May 2017, there was a terrorist attack on a bus carrying Coptic Christians.10 However, despite these efforts, there are still reports of secular violence.\n[12] For example, the 2017 U.S. DOS International Religious Freedom Report states that religious minorities continue to face significant threats of sectarian violence.11 The report outlines violence targeted toward Christians specifically because of their religion. Furthermore, authorities fail to protect minority victims and demand that charges be dropped in the spirit of reconciliation.12 Furthermore, there are numerous reports of Christian churches being targeted as well as the protest of building new churches. There have been cases of churches being burned down and vandalized, as well as Christian homes being similarly targeted.13\n[13] The same report states that:\nISIS claimed responsibility for multiple other attacks, including suicide bombings against two churches during Palm Sunday services, attacks against passengers on a bus carrying Christian pilgrims, and a spate of attacks on individual Christians in northern Sinai and elsewhere. An assailant killed a Coptic Orthodox priest in Cairo and injured another; a court sentenced the assailant to death for murder. According to press reports, three noncommissioned officers and a security guard allegedly tortured and killed a Christian police conscript. His family reported in a videotaped interview that he was \u201ctortured and killed for his faith.\u201d \u2026\nOn April 9, twin suicide bombings at Coptic Orthodox churches killed 45 people during Palm Sunday services. One struck St. Mark\u2019s Cathedral, the seat of the Coptic Orthodox Bishop of Alexandria, where Coptic Orthodox Pope Tawadros II was leading the service. The attacker detonated a bomb at the gate of the church compound after being refused entry by security. The other attack occurred in the city of Tanta in the Nile delta, where a suicide bomber detonated himself among the front pews of the church. ISIS claimed responsibility for the attacks and warned Muslims to avoid Christian gatherings in Egypt. \u2026\nTerrorists affiliated with ISIS carried out a series of attacks against Christians in northern Sinai after having issued videos and other public statements calling on pious Muslims to kill them. On January 30, masked assailants shot Coptic Christian Wael Milad in his shop, according to press reports. Eyewitnesses told media outlets that on February 11 an attacker shot Christian veterinarian Bahgat William in the head, neck, and stomach as he was leaving his clinic. Attackers killed Adel Showky on the same day in al-Arish\u2019s Samaran neighborhood, according to press reports. On February 16, two assailants on a motorbike gunned down Coptic Christian schoolteacher Gamal Tawfiq as he was walking through a crowded marketplace between his home and school, according to press reports. On February 22, the corpses of two local Christians, Saad Hanna and his son Medhat, were found on the roadside in al-Arish. Saad\u2019s body showed gunshot wounds; Medhat\u2019s showed signs of having been burned alive, according to press reports. Following these attacks and additional threats, hundreds of Christians fled Sinai during the first several months of the year for other parts of Egypt, according to press and church sources. According to an international NGO, several families told human rights activists they wanted to return to their homes, but were skeptical that this would be possible. Subsequently on May 6, gunmen shot and killed Nabeel Saber Ayoub, a Copt who had fled al-Arish with his family but returned briefly to complete school paperwork for his son and to check on his house and barber shop, according to press reports. Violent attacks against individual Christians were not limited to northern Sinai.14\n[14] The claimants\u2019 situation, which I accept, is in line with the objective evidence, of targeting of violence, kidnapping and harassment, followed by reconciliation efforts rather than protective efforts by authorities.\n[15] I find that the claimants\u2019 as Coptic Christians would more likely continue to be targeted for their religion and are subject to murders, kidnappings, physical assaults, bomb attacks, disappearances and forced displacement. As such, I find there is more than a mere possibility that claimants would be persecuted due to their religion if they return to Egypt.\nState Protection\n[16] I do acknowledge the efforts of the state to recognize and promote religious tolerance in Egypt, as the 2017 U.S. Commission of International Religious Freedom report indicates that since 2014, President Sisi has made significant strides to address religious freedom concerns. However, despite notable progress, the number of violent attacks targeting Christians increased. Furthermore, discriminatory laws and policies remain in place and continue to negatively impact Christians, including blasphemy laws and limits on conversion from Islam. Further the evidence before me is that the government frequently failed to prevent, investigate or prosecute crimes targeting members of religious minorities, which fosters a climate of impunity. As in the situation of the claimants, in reporting the issues to police, they were advised to reconcile or leave things, in order to keep the peace. I find that given the objective evidence of increasing violence directed towards Christians in Egypt, that is unabated despite the state\u2019s efforts and given the claimants own experiences of violence without authorities being willing or able to protect or even assist them, I find that the claimants would not have access to adequate operationally effective state protection in returning to Egypt.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[17] The panel finds that there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout Egypt. Although, the country condition information before me indicates that larger urban centres are safer for religious minorities. The United Kingdom Home Office states that:\nCities, such as Cairo and Alexandria, have large, socio-economically and culturally diverse populations which co-exist, for the most part, peaceably. Many people move to different parts of Egypt for social and economic reasons.15\n[18] The claimants lived in what was once a religiously diverse city with a high Christian populace, the situation in Egypt, is that extremists, are targeting persons of the Christian faith, the claimants as having more than many, as owning a local pharmacy, would continue to come under attack as there is almost no evidence before me that even living in a urban center with a large Christian population, can protection one from the violence throughout Egypt. Therefore, I find that claimants would face similar persecution for their Christian faith, throughout Egypt.\nCONCLUSION\n[19] For the foregoing reasons the panel finds that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX are Convention refugees as set out in section 96. Therefore, their claims are accepted.\n(signed) J.

Jurmain\nCountry: Egypt\nRPD Number: VB8-06140\nAssociated RPD Number(s): VB9-02524, VB9-02525, VB9-02526, VB9-02527\nATIP Number: A-2020-00518\nATIP Pages: 002362-002367\nReasons for Decision\n[1] This is the decision of the Refugee Protection Division in the claim of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, as the principal claimant; XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, as the associate claimant; and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXandXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX as the minor claimants.\n[2] The claimants are citizens of Egypt who claiming refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[3] In rendering my decision I have applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guidelines to this claim.\n[4] The claimants are a family of five. The principal claimant is the father. The associate claimant is his wife and the minor claimants are their three daughters.\n[5] The principal and associate claimant began living in Kuwait in 2003. They lived in Kuwait without issue until 2016, returning to Egypt periodically to visit family and friends. During those visits, the principal claimant\u2019s family would continually exert pressure on the claimant to have female circumcision or FGM performed on their daughters.\n[6] The claimants managed to delay the procedure and put off the family; however, in 2016 the principal claimant\u2019s mother and elder brother told the claimants that the procedure would be performed during their next visit. For this reason the claimants stopped visiting the family and only visited the associate claimant\u2019s family during their visit in 2016 and 2018.\n[7] While living in Kuwait, the principal claimant began to express his dissatisfaction with the Egyptian government and President Sisi. He would meet with friends in cafes and restaurants to discuss his views and also made anti-government posts on social media.\n[8] In a return trip to Egypt in XXXX 2016, he was stopped at the airport and interrogated for two hours about his opinions and social media comments. During his time in Egypt he was visited by authorities on other occasions. He managed to leave the country without issue with the help of a friend at the airport.\n[9] The family returned to Egypt in 2018. The principal claimant\u2019s brother found out they were in the country and called the claimant, insisting that the procedure would be done. The claimant agreed as a way to hold off the family but fled the country instead. The remaining claimants joined him in Canada at a later date.\n[10] The claimant\u2019s brother has sent several recent text messages to the principal claimant through WhatsApp telling him that the procedure must be performed.\n[11] The claimants fear that FGM will be forcefully performed on their daughters if they return. They both adamantly oppose the procedure. The principal claimant also continues to post on social media and fears he will be detained by authorities if he returns.\n[12] I find that the claimants are Convention refugees pursuant to section 96 of the Act for the reasons that follow.\n[13] The claimants\u2019 identities today have been established through the certified copies of their passports that I have on file.\n[14] In terms of credibility, there is a presumption of truth applied to all refugee claimants unless there is a reason to doubt their allegation testimony. In this case, the testimony of the claimants raised no significant credibility concerns. There were no material inconsistencies between the claimants\u2019 testimonies and the documentary evidence or their BOC narrative and both claimants testified in a genuine and straightforward manner and there were no hesitations in their responses.\n[15] I do think the principal claimant was speculating with respect to whether his name is on a wanted list; however, I find that this does not detract from my overall assessment of their credibility.\n[16] I find that their allegations are largely consistent with the country condition evidence described below.\n[17] Their testimony has also been sufficiently supported by documentary evidence, including copies of the messages from the principal claimant\u2019s brother as well as social media posts made by the claimant since arriving in Canada.\n[18] I do not have copies of the posts he made in Kuwait prior to 2016 but I accept that this could have been potentially an oversight and, in any event, I do not draw a negative inference given the reliability of the testimony and the other evidence before me.\n[19] I find that the claimants are reliable witnesses who genuinely fear returning to Egypt for the reasons they\u2019ve given. Based on the nature of their fears, these allegations have links to the Convention refugee grounds of political opinion and also membership in particular social group regarding the minor claimants who are female and face gender-related violence, while their parents are members of a particular group, namely close family members of those daughters.\n[20] Having accepted their allegations, I must determine whether their fear is objectively well- founded and in this case I do find that the country documentation establishes the objective risk to the claimants.\n[21] The objective evidence before me supports the claimants\u2019 allegations. Egypt has an extremely poor human rights record. According to Amnesty International, authorities use torture and other ill-treatment and enforce disappearance against hundreds of people. The crackdown on civil society escalated with non-governmental organization staff being subject to additional interrogation and travel bans.\n[22] Arbitrary arrests and detentions followed by grossly unfair trials of government critics, youthful protestors, journalists and human rights defenders were routine.\n[23] With respect to the social media activity of the principal claimant, I have a report before me, and this is 11.2 of the NDP, Freedom on the Net report, which states that internet freedom has been declining dramatically. The government has blocked dozens of critical new sites. Security forces have detained individuals for criticizing the government and mocking the president on social media.\n[24] For example, a human rights lawyer was given a ten year sentence for a Facebook page that allegedly incited terrorism which is a term that is being used and applied to non-violent criticism of the government. Others have been arrested or sentenced for having Facebook pages that express legitimate opposition to their polices.\n[25] This is also confirmed by document 2.1 which is the United States Department of State report which indicates that the government continually restricts and obstructs access to the internet and censors online content. There were credible reports that the government monitored private online communication without appropriate legal authority. Individuals were prosecuted and accused of posting insulting material.\n[26] The evidence before me also corroborates the claimants\u2019 fear of female circumcision for their daughters. The documentation shows that FGM exists in a high proportion of the female population of Egypt. According to document 2.1, FGM is illegal but remains a serious problem. 70% of girls between ages 15 and 19 have undergone FGM. According to international and local observers the government did not effectively enforce the FGM law.\n[27] According to item 5.7 of the National Documentation Package the number is 87% among all women aged 15 to 49 have undergone FGM and this is in a population of approximately 95 million people which the report suggests make Egypt the country with the greatest number of women and girls who have experienced FGM of any country in the world.\n[28] The practice is deeply entrenched in society with more than half the population believing the practice should continue.\n[29] Therefore, based on the evidence before me, I find that that the claimants have established with sufficient, reliable evidence that they would face a serious possibility of persecution if they return to Egypt.\n[30] In terms of state protection, as the state is the agent of harm in this case with respect to the persecution of individuals expressing anti-government views, and further that despite the changes in the government\u2019s approach to FGM, the state is often ineffective in implementing the law in practice, I find that state protection would not be forthcoming to the claimants in this case.\n[31] With respect to an internal flight alternative, the persecution of individuals expressing anti-government views occurs throughout the country. Similarly, with respect to any internal flight alternative that would address the fear of FGM, the evidence before is that the principal claimant\u2019s family has known through other family members and neighbours when the claimants return to Egypt and remained in Cairo. This is the internal flight alternative that I initially proposed to the claimant; however, based on the evidence, I find that the claimants would still face a serious possibility of persecution if they relocated to Cairo as the family would locate them and continue exerting pressure to have the procedure performed.\nConclusion\n[32] I find that the claimants are Convention refugees pursuant to section 96 of Act and the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada therefore accepts their claims.\n\u2014 PROCEEDINGS CONCLUDED\n",

You both spent most of your lives in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (Saudi Arabia), but your status their was contingent upon your father, whose status itself was temporary. In Egypt, you fear persecution at the hands of Muslim extremists as a result of your religious identity as Coptic Christians. Fearing return to Egypt, you each filed claims for refugee protection.\nDETERMINATION\n[5] I find that you are \u201cConvention refugees\u201d as you have established a serious possibility of persecution should you return to Egypt based on the grounds in section 96.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[6] I find that your respective identities as nationals of Egypt are established by the documents provided: your passports1 and your birth certificates.2\n[7] You have also established your identity as Coptic Christians by providing your birth certificates, baptism certificates and a supporting letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX of Egypt XXXX XXXX XXXX.3\nNexus\n[8] I find that you have each established a nexus to section 96 by reason of religion.\nCredibility\n[9] Based on the documents in the file, I have noted no serious credibility issues. In particular, the evidence establishes the allegations as set out above, namely that you are each of the Coptic Christian faith. After reviewing the documents, I have no reasons to doubt their authenticity.\nObjective basis of future risk\n[10] The fact that you face this risk is corroborated by the following documents contained in the National Documentation Package (NDP) for Egypt, March 29, 2019 version. Briefly, abuses of Coptic Christians were increasing even before the fall of the Mubarak regime. Christian properties, including homes, businesses, and churches, have been destroyed and Christians have been the primary targets of violent sectarian attacks. Christians have been arrested and detained; they have also faced harassment, rape, mental and physical abuse and pressure to convert to Islam; police officers have been involved in the persecution of Christians. The state has not adequately protected Christians, and has failed to prosecute perpetrators.4\nState protection\n[11] I find that adequate state protection would not be reasonably forthcoming in this particular case. The objective evidence indicates that the Egyptian authorities not only fail to protect Coptic Christians, but they themselves engage in violence against them, and perpetrators of attacks against Christians commit abuses in a climate of impunity.5 I find that your evidence, when considered in conjunction with the objective evidence, is a clear and convincing rebuttal of the presumption of state protection.\nInternal flight alternative\n[11] I have considered whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for you. On the evidence before me, I find that there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout Egypt. The evidence does not suggest that the religiously-motivated violence is restricted to a particular area of Egypt, or that individuals in your situation could find safety elsewhere.6 As such, I find that there is no viable internal flight alternative in Egypt for you.\nCONCLUSION\n[12] Having considered the evidence, I find there is a serious possibility that you would each be persecuted upon return to Egypt because of your Coptic Christian identities. I conclude that you are \u201cConvention refugees\u201d. Accordingly, I accept your claims.\n(signed) ETHAN MCMONAGLE\nMay 31, 2019\n1 Document 1 \u2013 Package of information from the referring Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) \/ Immigration, Refugee and Citizenship Canada (IRCC).\n2 Document 4 \u2013 Personal Documents\n3 Ibid.\n4 Document 3 \u2013 National Documentation Package, Egypt, (CND \u2013 Egypt) 29 March 2019, tab 12.8: Response to information request EGY105805.E., Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada. 20 June 2017; Tab 12.1: Egypt.

Briefly, the claimant alleges that they was born in Egypt and lived periodically in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. They is a citizen of Egypt and no other country. They considers themself to be transgender non-binary or third gender. They experienced ongoing discrimination and harassment throughout their life in Egypt as a result of their sexuality, even having been prescribed medication as a teenager to increase testosterone and \u2018correct\u2019 their problematic sexuality. They came to Canada as a student in XXXX 2013. In XXXX 2016, the claimant\u2019s family exerted pressure on them to marry. The cumulative effect of the claimant\u2019s negative experiences surrounding their sexuality caused the claimant to seek crisis intervention and medical attention on numerous occasions. The claimant made their claim for refugee protection on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018.\nDETERMINATION\n[6] I find that you are a Convention refugee as you have established a serious possibility of persecution should you return to Egypt based on the grounds in section 96.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[7] I find that your identity as a national of Egypt is established by the documents provided, mainly your passport.\nNexus\n[8] I find that you have established a nexus to section 96 by reason of member of a particular social group, by way of your sexual orientation and gender identity and expression.\nCredibility\n[9] Based on the documents in the file, I have noted no serious credibility issues. I note that this file is very well documented, including numerous medical and therapy reports, supporting letters and an Ontario driver\u2019s licence wherein your gender is marked \u2018X.\u20191 After reviewing the documents, I have no reasons to doubt their authenticity.\nObjective basis of future risk\n[10] The fact that you face this risk is corroborated by the following document, contained in the National Documentation Package (NDP) for Egypt, June 29, 2018 version, tab 2.1. In particular, it notes that:\nWhile the law does not explicitly criminalize consensual same-sex sexual activity, it allows police to arrest LGBTI persons on charges such as \u201cdebauchery,\u201d \u201cprostitution,\u201d and \u201cviolating the teachings of religion\u201d and provides for prison sentences if convicted of up to 10 years.\n[11] The report further notes that LGBTI individuals in Egypt have experienced arrest and harassment and in this particular case, this harm clearly amounts to persecution.\nState protection and Internal Flight Alternative\n[12] Given the foregoing reference to country conditions in Egypt, coupled with your particular profile, I find that neither adequate state protection nor a viable internal flight alternative exists in Egypt for you.\nCONCLUSION\n[13] Based on the analysis above, I conclude that you are a Convention refugee.

She had been a victim of domestic violence in Egypt. After years of violence in her country of origin, she and her children obtained recently the protection of Canada. She is now in the process of divorcing her husband, but he threatened to harm you if you were to return to Egypt in order to force her to go back there. You fear to be harmed by this man who was also violent with his children. You fear of being subjected to his violence if you were to go back to Egypt.\nDETERMINATION\n[5] I find that you are a \u201cConvention refugee\u201d as you have established a serious possibility of persecution should you return to Egypt based on the grounds in section 96.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[6] I find that your identity as a national of Egypt is established by the documents provided: namely your passport.\nNexus\n[7] I find that you have established a nexus to section 96 by reason of member of a particular social group as you fear persecution because you have members of your family who were submitted to domestic violence; consequently, they were granted the protection of Canada.\nCredibility\n[8] Based on the documents in the file, I have noted no serious credibility issues. In particular, the evidence establishes the allegations as set out above: a testimony of your daughter who explains the risk you face in Egypt because she has started the procedures to divorce her violent husband (C-1); a XXXX report for your grandson XXXX which explains the problem that he is experiencing and confirms that his father has been violent with the family (C-2); the narrative of your daughter which describes in details the violence that she and her children, especially XXXX, were subjected to at the hands of her husband and father of the children (C-3). After reviewing the documents, I have no reasons to doubt their authenticity.\nObjective Basis of Future Risk\n[9] Based on the credibility of your allegations, and the documentary evidence set out below, I find that you have established a future risk that you will be subjected to the following harm: Violence such as beating, injuries, possibly death.\n[10] The fact that you face this risk is corroborated by the following documents: NDP for Egypt \u2013 March 29, 2019 Version: on the fact that violence against women is widespread (tab 1.4); on the fact that domestic violence is prevalent and commonly accepted (tab 1.8); Amnesty International published a thorough analysis on the violence against women in Egypt (tab 5.6). The report states that women in Egypt have been facing endemic violence since the uprising of 2011.\nState Protection\n[11] I find that adequate state protection would not be reasonably forthcoming in this particular case. According to the evidence I have, the police are also reportedly reluctant to investigate cases of violence against women, particularly where it is domestic (tab 1.4). Also, another source states that domestic violence remains unpunished because of shortcomings in the Egyptian Penal Code (tab 1.4). The government has put in place a few years ago the National Strategy to Combat Violence against Women but the results are limited because there is no monitoring mechanisms (tab 2.3). Finally, the Amnesty Internal report quoted above indicates that successive governments have failed to put in place adequate protection to women from this endemic violence (tab 5.6).\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[12] I have considered whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for you. On the evidence before me, I find that there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout Egypt. The evidence I have is that the person you fear is well connected and has influence. Also, the evidence I have is that this man was violent with his children; this demonstrates to me that he can harm vulnerable persons such as you. You do not have any support in Egypt, you would be left by yourself without protection.\nCONCLUSION\n[13] Based on the analysis above, I conclude that you are a \u201cConvention refugee\u201d. Accordingly, I accept your claim.\n(signed) Julie Morin\nSeptember 20, 2019\n",

This individual, considered to be a Muslim extremist, had already harassed her in the past.\n[8] The same day, the principal claimant tried unsuccessfully to lodge a complaint with the police. When the police officer refused to record the complaint and the principal claimant insisted, the officer threatened to detain and accuse him and his daughter of being disrespectful to a police officer.\n[9] The following night, XXXX and the principal claimant started receiving a number of threatening phone calls from her aggressor.\n[10] Frightened, the principal claimant and his family decided to seek shelter in Alexandria.\n[11] On XXXX XXXX 2017, XXXX was informed by a friend that her aggressor was looking for her.\n[12] On XXXX XXXX 2017, the principal claimant was informed by his in-laws that his daughter\u2019s aggressor had come after them. As a result, they joined the rest of the family in Alexandria.\n[13] On XXXX XXXX 2017, all the claimants left Egypt for Canada.\n[14] They that should they return to Egypt, they will fall victim to XXXX aggressor and his accomplice who will want to seek revenge over the family\u2019s refusal to convert XXXX to Islam and marry her to her aggressor.\nDETERMINATION\n[15] I find that the claimants are \u201cConvention refugees\u201d as they have established a serious possibility of persecution should they return to Egypt based on the grounds in section 96.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[16] I find that the identity of the claimants as nationals of Egypt is established by the documents provided, namely their passport.\nNexus\n[17] I find that the claimants have established a nexus to section 96 by reason of their religion.\nCredibility\n[18] Based on the documents in the file, I have noted no serious credibility issues.\n[19] The claimants submitted documentary evidence in support of their claims. With respect to the evidence submitted by the principal applicants, Exhibits P-6 to P-12 and P-28 corroborate the allegations of the claimants with respect to their religious faith. Exhibits P-21 and P-22 corroborate the allegations of the principal claimant with respect to his marital status and the composition of his family. Exhibits P-13 to P-19 and P-28 corroborate the allegations of the principal claimant and his wife regarding their educational and professional background.\n[20] With respect to the evidence submitted by the in-laws, Exhibit P-6 and P-9 corroborate their allegations with respect to their religious faith. Exhibits P-21 and P-22 corroborate their allegations with respect to their marital status and the composition of their family.\n[21] After reviewing the documents, I have no reasons to doubt neither their authenticity, nor the truthfulness of their content.\nObjective Basis of Future risR\n[22] Despite some positive elements in the objective evidence, I find, based on the credibility of the allegations of the claimants, and the documentary evidence set out below, that as Christian Copts, they have established a future risk that they would be subjected to the following harm should they return to Egypt: societal and institutional intimidation and discrimination on the basis of their religious beliefs, forced displacement and physical assault, as well as prosecution for blasphemy, proselytizing, and denigration of Islam.\n[23] The fact that the claimants face this risk is corroborated by the documents found at tabs 1.7, 2.1, 2.2, 12.1, 12.6, 12.8 of the National Documentation Package for Egypt \u2013 March 29, 2019 Version.\nNature of the Harm\n[24] This harm clearly amounts to persecution.\nState Protection\n[25] I find that there is clear and convincing evidence before me that the state is unable or unwilling to provide the claimants with adequate protection.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[26] I have considered whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for the claimants. On the evidence before me, I find that there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout Egypt. I come to that conclusion considering that, according to the above-cited documentary evidence, Coptic Christians are presently exposed to a constant risk of persecution wherever they may be located.\nCONCLUSION\n[27] Based on the analysis above, I conclude that the claimants are \u201cConvention refugees\u201d. Accordingly, I accept their claims.\n(signed) Fran\u00e7ois Ramsay\nSeptember 17, 2019\n",

        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2019 RLLR 195\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: March 27, 2019\nPanel: Ludmila Pergat\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Razgar Hasan\nCountry: Egypt\nRPD Number: MB7-09759\nAssociated RPD Number(s): MB7-09787\nATIP Number: A-2020-00518\nATIP Pages: 001563-001571\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is a XXXX-year-old female and a national of Egypt.\n[2] Her sister, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX-years old, was born in Abu Dhabi, UAE. Her parents returned to Egypt the following year. Children of foreigners born in Dubai don\u2019t have the rights of local citizenship and automatically assume the nationality of the father. Foreign children are automatically considered nationals; however, they must renounce the citizenship of their parents, who are Egyptian. The UAE does not permit dual nationality.\n[3] Given that XXXX has not renounced her Egyptian citizenship, she is an Egyptian national.\n[4] Both Claimants allege to have a well-founded fear of persecution on the grounds being members of a particular social group, that of women.\nIDENTITY\n[5] The Claimant\u2019s identities were established by a copy of their Egyptian passports submitted by Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC). Based on the passports provided by CIC and the written testimony of the Claimants, in the narrative of their BOC, the Tribunal is satisfied that, on a balance of probabilities, the Claimants have established their identities.\nDETERMINATION\n[6] The Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB) determines that the Claimants, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXand XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, are \u201cConvention refugees\u201d as defined in section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act and \u201cpersons in need of protection\u201d as defined in section 97(1)[8] of that law.\nALLEGATIONS\n[7] The principal Claimant, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, makes the following allegations in the narrative of her Basis of Claim Form (BOC).\n[8] Her grandfather was an Imam of the Mosque in Alexandria. Her father is a very conservative Muslim man. He is a project manager and makes a good living. The principal Claimant attended a private school in the UAE since 2007. The family moved to the UAE with them. Her father is very strict, made her wear a hijab since she was twelve and made her memorize the Quran. The Claimant came to Canada in 2016 to attend University to study engineering, which she did not want to do, nor was she successful in the studies, but did so to stay away from her domineering father.\n[9] The Claimant visited Egypt in XXXX 2015 when their maternal grandmother passed away. During that visit she was sexually assaulted on the street. She said that someone put his hand on her breast and exposed himself to her. She did not go to the police. She returned to Canada with her mother and sister.\n[10] The principal Claimant has been seen by a XXXX since then, and suffers from several disorders such as XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. She is being treated with several medications and is seeing a XXXX at Carleton University which she presently attends. At present her education is being paid for by her older brother since her father stopped paying all expenses when she stopped studying Engineering. Her father wanted her to return to Egypt for one month. She learned from close relatives and friends that he intends to force her to marry her cousin. The principal Claimant told her father that she refuses to return to Egypt. Her father was furious and said that he would cut her off financially, which he did in 2017. He also said that he would do anything in his power to have her return to Egypt.\n[11] The principal Claimant fears returning to Egypt. She would have to live with her father and marry her cousin, in the marriage arranged by her father.\n[12] The Claimant XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, the principal Claimant\u2019s younger sister, testified that she will be harmed by her father and his family because she stands by her sister. Her younger years mirror that of her sister where it concerns her father, his expectations of his daughters and rigid upbringing. She was also assaulted, in her case, by a taxi driver when she returned for her grandmother\u2019s funeral. Since her coming to Canada to study, after her visit to Egypt for her grandmother\u2019s funeral, her father has tried to have her convince her sister, the principal Claimant, to return to Egypt. When she refused, he became very angry and told her that he would no longer support the younger Claimant financially. He told the younger sister that he learned from his friends that she has registered to study psychology instead of engineering, removed her hijab and smoked cigarettes. He insisted that they return to Egypt.\n[13] Both Claimants are being followed by a XXXX for their issues arising from past abuses by their father and the pressures to conform to his strict expectations.\n[14] Both Claimants feared returning to Egypt to their father. They knew that they would face arranged marriages, be locked in his home and made to wear the hijab again.\n[15] They claimed refugee protection in Canada in August 2017.\nANALYSIS\n[16] In analyzing this claim, the Tribunal considered the Chairperson\u2019s Guidelines for Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender Related Persecution. The Tribunal is cognizant that female refugee claimants may have difficulties in demonstrating that their claims are credible. As such, the Tribunal has considered and applied these guidelines during the hearing, as well as in assessing the weight given to both the oral and documentary evidence before the Tribunal.\n[17] The testimony of both Claimants\u2019 was very difficult and emotional, however, spontaneous and straightforward. The principal Claimant\u2019s highly emotional state was supported by medical reports submitted by her family physician1 and her XXXX.2 The XXXX report3 states that the Claimant suffers from both XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXandXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Her sister is severely affected by her older sister\u2019s (principal Claimant) fragile state.\n[18] The Tribunal took into account the Claimants\u2019 conditions medical and fragile conditions during the hearing, applying the principles of the Chairperson\u2019s Guidelines for women refugee claimants. The Tribunal did consider that both Claimants are educated young women and have lived away from their father for many years. However, in this particular case, the Tribunal believes that the strict upbringing that they had from a very conservative father, who supported them financially all their lives, caused serious and permanent fear of being forced to live a life that they did not experience in the past few years living as Western women, able to make their own choices and decisions. They are Muslim women and embrace their faith but fear the life of a Muslim woman in an ultra-Muslim society in Egypt.\n[19] The central element of this claim is whether the two Claimants had their human rights violated by their father. Is there is serious possibility that their basic human rights will be violated by their father and\/or other relatives should they return to Egypt?\n[20] The Tribunal believes that, based on the Claimants\u2019 narratives in their BOCs and their testimony at the hearing, the Claimants face not only a serious possibility but the probability of having these rights violated.\n[21] XXXX father has already arranged a marriage for her with her cousin, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The Tribunal believes that the principal Claimant would have no option but to marry her cousin should she return to Egypt. The Claimant has spent all of her life in school studying. She has lived a life of never having to work or think about supporting herself. Consequently, given that her father has cut off her financial support, if she were to return to Egypt, she would have to return to her father and be forced into the marriage with her cousin.\n[22] The expectation of their father was that they get the best education that he can afford and that they return to Egypt to marriages arranged by him.\n[23] In Vidhani v. M.C.I.,4 the Court held that \u201cwomen who are forced into marriages against their will have had a basic human right violated.\u201d\n[24] The Tribunal believes that in this particular case and under these particular circumstances, the Claimant\u2019s basic human rights are being and will further be violated.\n[25] Based on the younger Claimant\u2019s narrative in her BOC and her testimony at the hearing, the Tribunal believes that she will also have her basic human rights violated by being forced into an arranged marriage by her father.\n[26] The Tribunal also believes that both Claimants were sexually assaulted when they returned to Egypt for their grandmother\u2019s funeral in 2015 and that experience left them terrified of returning to Egypt.\n[27] Considering that the evidence submitted in the BOC form is deemed true as sworn evidence and is not contradicted by any other evidence submitted in this case, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, the Claimants have established, on a balance of probabilities, the credibility of their allegations as well as the existence of a subjective fear.\nState Protection\n[28] Egypt was considered in 2014 by more than 300 gender experts to be \u201cthe worst country in the Arab world to be a woman\u201d5 and there is no evidence to the effect that the situation has in any way improved since.\n[29] Violence against women is reported as being socially legitimized, it is surrounded by a culture of silence, largely imposed by the family. Moreover, according to Amnesty International, Egyptian law does not provide the victims with adequate protection. Protection mechanisms are very few and are considered to be essentially ineffective. This is in part due to the existence of provisions within the Penal Code that excuse acts of violence that have been committed in good faith in accordance with Sharia Law; the requirements imposed on individual victims of assault to have to produce multiple witnesses \u2013 a very difficult condition to meet for women victims of violence given the societal attitude toward women and violence; and the reported often dismissive or abusive attitude of officials who receive the complaints.\n[30] In that context, given also the reported reluctance of women to report violence because of shame, fear of retaliation against them and their children and community pressure, violence against women virtually goes unpunished allowing the offenders to act in almost total impunity.6\n[31] Violence, including sexual and domestic violence, against women is universal and irrelevant when determining whether rape and other gender-specific crimes constitute forms of persecution. The real issues are whether the violence, experienced or feared, is a serious violation of a fundamental human right for a Convention ground and in what circumstances can the risk of that violence be said to result from a failure of State protection.\n[32] Based on the declarations of the Claimants, the Tribunal is of the opinion, that they have established, on a balance of probabilities, that there is an objective basis to their claims and that there is clear and convincing evidence that the state of Egypt is unable and unwilling to protect them for the following reasons.\n[33] The Claimants are perceived, based on their actions, to oppose Islam. They are two young women who have spent most of their young lives and all of their adult lives pursuing an education in Dubia, UAE, and Canada. They have gone against the strict rules by which Muslim women in Egypt must abide and what their father believes in and insists upon. They put aside their core traditions such the wearing of the hijab and adopted western accepted practices such as smoking, which are against the Muslim values. These actions subjected them not only to their father\u2019s wrath, their relatives and friends but also to the religious faction and government that perceives them as infidels and will not protect them.\n[34] The Tribunal believes that in this particular case, under these particular circumstances, the Claimants have established that they will not be safe anywhere Egypt.\n[35] In light of all of the above, the Tribunal finds that the Claimants have established, on a balance of probabilities, that there is an objective basis to their claims. The Tribunal further finds that the Claimants have rebutted the presumption of State protection; they have established, on a balance of probabilities, that there is clear and convincing evidence that the state is both unable and unwilling to protect them.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[36] The Tribunal finds that there is no relevant Internal Flight Alternative (IFA) in Egypt for individuals such as the Claimants.\n[37] As single women with no means of financial support and no man to protect them, they would be targeted by those who adhere faithfully to the Muslim belief and would condemn them for being infidels. As they testified, they would be seen as prostitutes and could be the victims of honour killings. The Tribunal\u2019s conclusion is based on the fact that the risk of persecution emanates not only from their father and his extended family in Egypt but also from State agents, notably the clerics and religious police. That State authority extends to the whole country.\n[38] The Tribunal is of the opinion that the Claimants would be at risk of serious human rights violations and persecution in all parts of the country.\nCONCLUSION\n[39] After having considered both oral and written testimony submitted, the Tribunal believes that the Claimants have discharged their burden of proof.\n[40] Based upon the above analysis, the Tribunal determines that principal Claimant, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXand her sister XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX are \u201cConvention refugees\u201d, as defined in section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act and \u201cpersons in need of protection\u201d as defined in section 97(1)[8] of that law.\n(signed) LUDMILA PERGAT\nMarch 27, 2019\n1 Document 4, item C-10.\n2 Document 4, item C-11.\n3 Ibid, note 2.\n4 Vidhani v.

Her daughter, XXXX XXXX XXXX, and son, XXXX XXXX XXXX, are citizens of the United States Of America (US), according to their passports submitted as evidence. They are all claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[2] I appointed XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX as designated representative for the associate minor child claimants, XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXIn rendering my reasons, I have considered and applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guidelines on Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution.\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] The principal claimant had three children with her husband in Egypt. She first came to the US with that husband. The male claimant was born there in 2001.\n[4] The principal claimant divorced her husband in 2001 and then married a Christian man, who was a permanent resident of the US, but her permanent residency was refused in the US. Her family found out about her marriage to a Christian and swore to kill her for an act against Islam. She divorced her second husband in 2009.\n[5] She made a refugee claim in the US in 2008, but it was denied in 2011 and lived illegally in the US, until she came to Canada.\n[6] She had the female child claimant with another man outside of marriage in 2010. Her family in Egypt learned to the child born outside marriage and threatened her with death for another offence against Islam.\n[7] Fearing deportation, the principal claimant came to Canada with her US daughter and made a refugee claim in 2017. The US male child claimant came into Canada later and made a refugee claim.\nDETERMINATION\n[8] I find that the principal claimant is a \u201cConvention refugee\u201d as she established a serious possibility of persecution for religion and membership in a particular social group in Egypt as a woman victim of conjugal or family violence without adequate state protection in Egypt.\n[9] I find that the US associate claimants have not satisfied the burden of establishing a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground, or that, on a balance of probabilities, they would personally be subjected to a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or a danger of torture upon return to their country, the US.\nANALYSIS\nUS Child claimants\n[10] The principal claimant in her own basis of claim form (BOC) and those of her children did not indicate that her US children faced a risk of serious harm in the US.\n[11] Their most recent counsel of record stated in the hearing that he did not intend to make any submissions for the US child claimants, regarding the US, and the principal claimant testified that these claimants did not face a serious harm in the US.\n[12] In the National Documentation Package (NDP) for the US, dated March 29, 2019, does not indicate that the child claimants, in their particular circumstances, would face a risk of serious harm in the US, or that there is a serious possibility of persecution for the child claimants in the US, or that there is a probability of risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment for the child claimants there. I do not consider that the separation of the family is sufficient to be understood as a serious harm or persecution for the child claimants, in particular since the laws of nationality and the control of borders are laws of general application, and have not been shown to be contrary to international standards of justice. Also, the documentation package for the US does not indicate that the child claimants would not be protected, if they needed protection in the US, as US citizens.\nCredibility \u2013 principal claimant\n[13] I found the principal claimant generally credible regarding the main elements of her claim and of the claim for her US children.\n[14] She submitted credible and probative evidence regarding her religion as a Muslim previously in Egypt, of her marriages and relationships with her previous husbands or partners, the fact that some of them were Christian, and the birth of her children, including her daughter who was born while her mother, the principal claimant, was not married (C-1 to C-10 and C-17 to C- 18).\n[15] She submitted country condition information for Egypt regarding the mistreatment of Christians and women without adequate state protection. (C-11 to C-16).\n[16] The NDP for Egypt, dated March 29, 2019 indicates that women face practical widespread legal, social and economic discrimination in Egypt and that domestic violence (that may be considered family violence) is widespread and considered socially acceptable in Egypt (NDP, tab 1.4, section 2.3 and tab 5.6) and state protection is often ineffective and police are reluctant to investigate cases of violence against women (NDP, tab 1.4, section 2.4 and tab 5.5).\n[17] While there may be no legal impediment to internal movement, for even single women in Egypt who relocate for a variety of reasons (NDP, tab 1.4, section 2.4 and tab 5.5), the claimant is also a woman who has demonstrated that she is not a fully practicing Muslim and would likely encounter hostility or violence in a new residential area in Egypt.\n[18] Regarding women\u2019s choice not to wear the hijab in public in Egypt, the NDP mentions harassment against women not wearing the hijab in Egypt and the perception that they are not Muslim (NDP, tab 5.1). The claimant, who does not wear a hijab as Muslim, would encounter other problems compounded by the fact of her past relations with Christian men and her daughter born outside marriage.\n[19] The NDP indicates that there have been recent terrorist attacks against Christians, Christian institutions, churches, and that State protection for Christians and their institutions is inadequate (NDP, tabs 12.1, 12, 5, 12.8, 12.14 and 12.16). Consequently, the claimant as a perceived apostate or Christian would face an increased risk of violence.\n[20] While religious conversion from Islam to Christianity or leaving Islam is not technically illegal in Egypt, the State can bring criminal charges against persons for apostasy, apostasy is forbidden by the Sharia and the State can prosecute persons for apostasy under the penal code for \u201cdenigrating religions\u201d (NDP, tab 1.7, section 5.4.1).\nState Protection\n[21] I find that there is clear and convincing evidence before me that the state is unable or unwilling to provide the principal claimant in Egypt with adequate protection, for the reasons stated above.\nInternal flight alternative\n[22] I have considered whether a viable Internal Flight Alternative (IFA) exists for the principal claimant. On the evidence before me, I find that there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout Egypt for the principal claimant.\n[22] She has demonstrated in her testimony and evidence that she is not a practicing Muslim, has married Christian men and shows the will to continue this open behaviour as well as not wearing the hijab and not willing to conceal or hide the fact that she has married Christians and had a child outside marriage. Consequently, I conclude that if she were not targeted by her immediate family, that she would have serious difficulty from orthodox Muslims and would have serious problems as a single woman to be able to live on her own in an IFA.\nCONCLUSION\n[24] Based on the analysis above, I conclude that the principal claimant is a \u201cConvention refugee\u201d and I accept her claim.\n[25] For the reasons above, I conclude that the US child claimants are not \u201cConvention refugees\u201d under section 96 of IRPA or \u201cpersons in need of protection\u201d within the meaning of section 97 (l)(a) or (b) of IRPA. Their claims are rejected.\n(signed) Jeffrey Brian Gullickson\nAugust 2, 2019\n",

Your religious identity was established by the supporting documents you have provided in exhibit 5.\nNexus\n[9] I find that you have established a nexus to section 96 by reason of religion.\nCredibility\n[10] You have provided a narrative that is consistent with country conditions. Your profile as a Coptic Christian was also well documented. Where fear is due to cumulative acts of discrimination or harassment, the issue of delay cannot be used to impugn subjective fear solely.1 This delay in departure does not undermine your overall credibility.\n[11] When considering the totality of the evidence I find that your written evidence is supported by reliable corroborating documents, and find that you have a credible subjective fear.\nObjectively well-founded\n[12] Your fear of persecution is based on being Coptic Christian. You have experienced persecution and discrimination amounting to persecution as Coptic Christian, and this is supported by the documentary evidence in the National Documentation Package (NDP) for Egypt.\n[13] Christians represent five to ten percent of the Egyptian population, and of those 90 percent are Coptic. The Coptic Christian community have continued to experience discrimination and intimidation because of their religious beliefs, particularly in areas where there are many Muslim Brotherhood supporters. They continue to be the target of sectarian violence.\n[14] While there is evidence that violence has decreased following the incidents that shook the Coptic community in 2013; discrimination and violence remain a problem. There are reports of large numbers of assaults on Coptic Christians as well as prosecutions for proselytizing, blasphemy and denigration of religion.\nState protection\n[15] I find that adequate state protection would not be reasonably forthcoming in this particular case based on country conditions. It is noted in the NDP that the police and authorities do not intervene to protect Coptic Christians who are victims of criminal acts. Where a Coptic Christian victim wants to go forward with prosecution of a violent crime, the reliable documentary evidence suggests that crimes committed against Coptic Christians are dealt with slowly which fosters an atmosphere of impunity overall. This is also consistent with the claimant\u2019s experiences.\nInternal flight alternative (IFA)\n[16] I have considered whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for you. On the evidence before me, I find that there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout Egypt. Coptic Christians are exposed to risk of persecution in all areas of the country, and given your profile, Coptic Christians who are active in their religious community, it would be unreasonable for you to seek refuge in any part of the country.\nCONCLUSION\n[17] Based on the analysis above, I conclude that you are a Convention refugee. Accordingly, I accept your claim.\n(signed) K. KHAMSI\nNovember 21, 2019\n1 Shah, Mahmood Ali v. M.C.l. (F.C., no. IMM-4425-02), Blanchard, September 30, 2003, 2003 FC 1121.\n",

Is claiming refugee protection pursuant to Sections 96 and 97(1) of Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[2] In rendering my reasons I have considered and applied the Chairperson\u2019s guidelines on women refugee claimants fearing gender related persecution.\nDetermination:\n[3] I find the claimant is a Convention refugee as she has established a well-founded fear of persecution based on the Convention ground, namely, her membership in a particular social group because of her religion.\nIdentity:\n[4] The claimant\u2019s identity as a national of Egypt has been established by her testimony and the supporting documentation filed, namely, a copy of her passport. She also confirmed today at the hearing that she has no permanent resident or citizenship status in any country other than Egypt.\nNexus:\n[5] I find that you have each established a nexus to Section 96 by reason of religion.\nAllegations:\n[6] In the claimant\u2019s Basis of Claim Form she indicates that she fears persecution if she were to return to Egypt because of her religion as she is a Coptic Orthodox Christian.\n[7] She also stated that she lived in Egypt her entire life.\n[8] The claimant alleges that she is a Coptic Christian from Cairo, Egypt. She was harassed, pressured, and threatened to be killed by an ex-co-worker to convert to Islam. Because of that she was pressured to move to different locations to avoid her persecutor.\n[9] She divorced her husband who converted to Islam before the definitive divorce certificate that was issued in June 2016.\n[10] In mid-documents 2018 she was attacked by two women that forced her into a microbus, hitting her and tried to force her to announce her Islam.\n[11] On a few occasions she went to visit her father in Kuwait to escape temporarily leave the persecution. However, there was no option for her to stay permanently in Kuwait.\n[12] She fears harm because of her religion and gender should the \u2026 should she return to Egypt.\n[13] The claimant arrived in Canada on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2019 and applied for asylum on April 5, 2019.\nAnalysis:\nCredibility:\n[14] I find the claimant to be credible witness testifying in a straightforward manner. There were minor inconsistencies between your testimony and the documents before me or between your oral and written testimonies.\n[15] Coptic Christians is a religious minority in Egypt.\n[16] I have considered the claimant\u2019s testimony and the documentary evidence in support of her allegations. Like the certificate of baptism and her national identity card at Exhibit 5.\n[17] I asked how you would be identified in your country. Either outside or by your documentation, you indicated you wear a cross as a pendant and you don\u2019t wear a scarf over your hair and wear \u2026 wear some clothes.\n[18] You said that you were practicing Christian in your country attending church twice a week and have been baptized twice.\n[19] On a balance of probabilities, I find it is reasonable that you would be identified as a Christian in your home country through your appearance and actions, as well as through your identification documents.\n[20] The claimant testified as to the personal difficulties. She has suffered aggression, violence, and persecution prior to coming to Canada. This occurred on the street, in your workplace, and with your ex\u00ad husband that converted to Islam.\n[21] The claimant went to the police but they refused to take report because she did not know the complete information of her persecutor.\n[22] I have considered the claimant\u2019s testimony and also the objective evidence regarding the treatment of Coptic Christians in Egypt today.\n[23] A response of \u2026 to information request in the National Documentation Package for Egypt outlines widespread societal violence against Coptic Christians in Egypt. According to the RIR attacks against Coptic Christian\u2019s homes and buildings, as well as physical assaults against Coptic persons in Alexandria are a regular occurrence. The same RIR also outlines similar attacks throughout the country including numerous attacks by terrorist groups directed at Coptic Christians.\n[24] The United States Department of State international religious freedom report for Egypt reports that Coptic Christians throughout Egypt face societal discrimination in their daily lives.\n[25] A report by the United States Religious Freedom Commission states that human rights groups reported more than 120 sectarian attacks including mob attacks against Christians and churches. And the Jack of effective prosecution of perpetrators remained a serious concern.\n[26] A series of attacks in 2017 by affiliates of the terrorist group the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, ISIS, targeted houses of worship including attacks against churches and Christians that resulted in almost 100 deaths and hundreds of injuries.\n[27] Sources indicate that the Christian minority is victim of aggression, violation, kidnapping, and extortion. This is coherent with your allegations of violence and aggressions which you have claimed to have suffered in your country.\n[28] In consideration of the ensemble of the evidence I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant has established a well-founded fear of persecution if she has to return to Egypt for reasons of her religion.\nState Protection:\n[29] I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant has rebutted the presumption of State protection with clear and convincing evidence that the Egyptian State would be unwilling or unable to provide her with adequate protection.\n[30] I have considered whether or not State protection would be adequate for the claimant in Egypt at this time.\n[31] According to the objective evidence the Egyptian authorities have not only been tolerant of violence and discrimination against the Christian minority, they have been engaged in acts of violence as well.\n[32] There are reports indicated \u2026 indicating that there have been a certain number of arrests for violence committed against the Christianity minority. However, they are very limited.\n[33] I note the objective evidence confirms that the authorities tolerate violence and they are slow to act if they do act at all to protect members of religious minorities from discrimination and violence.\n[34] A report by the United States Religious Freedom Commission finds that authorities in Egypt routinely pressured Christians to drop charges against Muslims.\n[35] A Human Rights Watch report describes the response by authorities to violence against Christians in Egypt as indifferent.\n[36] Therefore, on a balance of probabilities, based on the claimant\u2019s credible allegations and the documentary evidence before me I find that State protection would not be adequate for her at this time in Egypt.\nInternal Flight Alternative:\n[37] I have also considered whether or not an internal flight alternative would be available to the claimant. The objective evidence indicates that the situation for Christians is difficult in all areas of Egypt. That Christian\u2019s persecution is widespread throughout Egypt.\n[38] Therefore, I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant faces a serious possibility of persecution throughout Egypt and as a consequence there is no viable internal flight alternative for her anywhere in the country.\nConclusion:\n[39] I find that there is more than a mere possibility that the claimant would be persecuted upon her return to Egypt based on her religion. Therefore, her claim is accepted. The claimant is recognized as a Convention refugee.\n[40] COUNSEL: Thank you, Member. \u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014-\n",

You have acted on both of these attractions and have had several sexual relationships with women in Egypt. You have also travelled extensively but did not consider making asylum claims in other countries since you were not aware that this was an option. However, you have not had any open same sex relationships since you fear having them in a repressive country like Egypt. You fear that you would be arrested by police and also suffer societal disapproval in this predominantly Muslim society. You came to Toronto on a visit in 2018 and intended to return to Egypt until you received legal advice and guidance that fear of state sanctions because of your sexual orientation was a possible ground for refugee protection.\nDETERMINATION\n[6] I find that you are a Convention refugee as you have established a serious possibility of persecution should you return to Egypt based on the grounds in section 96.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[7] I find that your identity as a national of Egypt is established by the documents provided, your national ID card and passport.\nNexus\n[8] I find that you have established a nexus to section 96 by reason of sexual orientation.\nCredibility\n[9] Based on the documents in the file, I have noted no serious credibility issues. In particular, the evidence establishes the allegations as set out above. I read your long, very detailed narrative and some psychological reports that were in the file. After reviewing the documents, I have no reasons to doubt their authenticity.\nObjective basis of future risk\n[10] Based on the credibility of your allegations, and the documentary evidence set out below, I find that you have established a future risk that you will be subjected to the following harm. Although same sex relationships are not explicitly forbidden in Egypt, the documentary materials state that the authorities often use the language \u201cdebauchery\u201d in legislation to apply to members of the LGBTQ communities, and this raises a strong possibility that openly gay persons could be liable to criminal prosecution and to persecution by authorities.\n[11] The fact that you face this risk is corroborated by the following documents: National Documentation Package (NDP) for Egypt \u2013 March 29, 2019 items, 5.1 and 6.1.\nNature of the harm\n[12] This harm clearly amounts to persecution.\nState protection\n[13] I find that adequate state protection would not be reasonably forthcoming in this particular case. The agent of persecution is the state.\nInternal flight alternative\n[14] I have considered whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for you. On the evidence before me, I find that there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout Egypt. The agent of persecution is the state.\n[15] On the evidence before me, I find that it is not objectively reasonable, in all the circumstances, including those particular to you, for you to seek refuge in Egypt for the following reasons. The agent of persecution is the state.\nCONCLUSION\n[16] Based on the analysis above, I conclude that you are a Convention refugee. Accordingly, I accept your claim.\n(signed) HARVEY SAVAGE\nApril 24, 2019\n",

Gueller\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Amro Hayek\nCountry: Egypt\nRPD Number: TB9-04856\nAssociated RPD Number(s): TB9-04866, TB9-04887, TB9-04888\nATIP Number: A-2020-00518\nATIP Pages: 000890-000897\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] The principal claimant, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and the minors XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX are citizens from Egypt. The associate claimant, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, is a citizen of Jordan. The claimants are seeking refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (the Act)1.\n[2] In rendering my reasons, I have considered and applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guidelines on Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution.\nDETERMINATION\n[3] I find all the claimants to be Convention Refugees as they have established a well- founded fear of persecution based on a Convention ground, namely they are convention refugees based on the convention ground of religion.\nIDENTITY\n[4] The principal claimant\u2019s identity and the two minors as nationals of Egypt and the associate claimant identity as a national of Jordan, are established through their testimony and the supporting documentation filed, namely their passports.2\nPRINCIPAL CLAIMANT ALLEGATIONS\n[5] The principal claimant alleges he cannot return to Egypt because he would be persecuted by his family and the authorities because he has converted from Islam to Christianity.\nANALYSIS\nCredibility\n[6] The determinative issue in this claim is credibility. Both claimants testified in a straightforward and consistent manner. Their oral testimony was consistent with the Basis of Claim form (BOC)3. I find the claimants to be credible witnesses on a balance of probabilities.\n[7] The principal claimant has established his identity as a Christian convert by providing documentary evidence in support of his allegations.4\n\nBaptism certificatePhotographs of his BaptismRecommendation Letter from his church \u201cFamily Rescue International Ministries\u201dTranslation of the telephone chat about his conversion between his wife and her sister[8] The principal claimant testified that he attended Christian school when he was a child and living in Syria, so he was able to be in contact with Christian teachers and friends. After moving with his family to Saudi Arabia, he was told by his parents that he had to forget what he learned about Christianity.\n[9] He stated that his parents had a car accident, where his mother passed away and his father lost both legs, and that was a breakthrough moment in his life about religion and being more conscious that he wanted to know more about Christianity. He had many unanswered questions about Islam and he approached Muslim clerics for explanations because he felt a lack of spiritual fulfillment. The claimant alleges that since his mother passed away, he questioned his religion and the Islamic principles to which he had to adhere to.\n[10] The principal claimant stated that he had a temporary working visa in Saudi Arabia and in XXXX 2018, he decided to quit his job and come to Canada to join his wife, because she was studying in Canada.\n[11] Upon his arrival to Canada, he felt confident to start inquiring about Christianity and through a co-worker he found the church where he is attending now.\n[12] His wife testified that the principal claimant told her about his intention to convert to Christianity in January 2019. Because she did not know how to convince him not to do it, she called her and his family asking for help. She stated that the reaction of both families was the same, to threaten him that they will kill him if he converts to Christianity. Also, that her family, specifically told her that she had to divorce him and return to Jordan, leaving the children with him, otherwise, she would also face being killed if she returns to Jordan.\n[13] The associate claimant stated that she and the principal claimant came to an agreement that she understands he could practice his faith and be able to continue their life together.\n[14] The principal claimant also testified that even though he would be able to obtain citizenship for his wife in Egypt, because he has converted to Christianity, his whole family will be persecuted there, by religious extremists and the state.\n[15] After reviewing all of the evidence, I find the claimant\u2019s evidence to be consistent. I have no reason to doubt the truthfulness of the claimant\u2019s account. As such, I find the claimant to be credible with respect to his material allegations: specifically, that he is a Christian convert Egyptian citizen who will be targeted by Muslims and radicals because of his conversion to Christianity.\nMINORS\n[16] The principal claimant alleged and testified that in Egypt or Jordan, his children would be abused and discriminated against for having a father that is a Christian convert and that they would face harassment and persecution.\n[17] The NDP documentary evidence shows that \u201cMedia sources report on the case of a father who had converted to Christianity from Islam who faced mistreatment when attempting to leave the country with his daughter (Compass Direct News 22 Apr. 2011; Porte Ouvertes 30 mars 2011). The father wanted to bring the daughter out of the country as it was not possible to change his ID card (ibid.; Compass Direct News 22 Apr. 2011). According to news agency Compass Direct News, the two had to obtain a court order granting them permission to leave the country (ibid.)\u201d5\n[18] I have considered the impact that the principal\u2019s claimant conversion to Christianity will have into the minors\u2019 life if they were to return to Egypt. Therefore, I find, on a balance of probabilities, that also the minors will be facing harassment and discrimination if they were to return to Egypt.\n[19] In addition, the minors will not be able to obtain Jordanian citizenship through their mother, as according to the NDP:\n\u201cIn Jordan, a child born to a Jordanian mother and a non-Jordanian father is considered a noncitizen in the eyes of the state. In violation of international human rights law, which obliges Jordan not to discriminate against women, Jordanian law allows only fathers to pass citizenship to their children. It does not allow Jordanian women to even confer automatic long-term residency on their children. Despite government promises to grant these individuals key economic and social rights, non-citizen children of Jordanian women continue to face legal restrictions that trap many of them at the margins of Jordanian society.\u201d6\n[20] Therefore, I find, that the minors do not have access to any other citizenship than Egypt, where they will be facing harassment by the authorities and neighbors, on a balance of probabilities.\nLikelihood of Harm \u2013 serious possibility and objective evidence\n[21] I find that the claimant has established that he and his children have a serious possibility of persecution should they return to Egypt due to his identity as a Christian convert.\n[22] The International Religious Freedom Report for 20157 for Egypt discusses the current level of religious tolerance in Egypt. Specifically, with respect to Christian converts. It states:\n\u201cLethal sectarian violence continued over the year, and included the killing of a convert to Christianity by her Muslim family and the targeting of Christians in North Sinai based on their religious identity. The construction of churches continued to be met with societal resistance, including acts of violence. Such violence occurred in connection with construction of a new church approved by the president in El- \u2018Our, the village from which came a majority of the 20 Egyptian Copts killed in Libya in February. In many cases, individuals charged with denigration of religion also faced societal violence or threats of violence, according to Christian leaders.\u201d\n[23] A Response to Information Request (RIR)8 issued by the Board on November 27, 2013 entitled: Egypt: Whether people who have converted from Islam to Christianity, particularly those converts who have been arrested, are able to obtain passports and leave the country (April 2010-November 2013) states:\n\u201cMuslim converts to Christianity are regularly harassed by government officials who view their actions as a social offence against Islam tantamount to treason\u201d (Associate Professor 8 Nov. 2013). Similarly, in correspondence sent to the Research Directorate, a board member of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Canada stated that authorities will attempt to dissuade someone from converting from Islam to Christianity and may arbitrarily imprison the person alongside \u201cdangerous criminals\u201d if they insist on converting (Coptic Orthodox Church of Canada 13 Nov. 2013).\n[24] I find that adequate state protection will not be available to the principal and minor claimants if they were to return to Egypt. Objective evidence indicates that the authorities not only fail to protect Coptic Christians and Christian converts, but themselves engage in violence against such persons, while perpetrators of attacks against Christians commit abuses in a climate of impunity.9 I find that the claimant\u2019s evidence, when considered together with the objective evidence, is a clear and convincing rebuttal of the presumption of state protection.\n[25] Having considered the claimant\u2019s evidence as well as the objective evidence contained in the NDP and counsel\u2019s package of disclosure10, I find there is a serious possibility that the principal and minor claimants would be persecuted upon return to Egypt because of the principal claimant\u2019s conversion to Christianity. The principal claimant has a well-founded fear of persecution in Egypt by reason of being a Christian convert and the minors because they will be harassed by having a Christian father.\nIFA\n[26] The evidence does not suggest that the religiously-motivated violence is restricted to a particular area of Egypt, or that individuals in the claimant\u2019s situation could find safety elsewhere11. The NDP documentary evidence states that Christians are being persecuted in Egypt as converting to Christianity from Islam is considered an offence, and the person will have \u201cdifficulty dealing with officials and neighbors \u2026 The Associate Professor added that \u201cMuslim converts ta Christianity are regularly harassed by government officials who view their actions as a social offence against Islam\u201d.12\n[27] As such, I find that the claimants cannot avail themselves of a viable internal flight alternative.\nCONCLUSION\n[28] For the reasons set out above, I find the principal claimant and the minors are Convention refugees and I accept their claim.\n(signed) PAULINA GUELLER\nOctober 22, 2019\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27, as amended, sections 96 and 97(1).\n2 Exhibit 1\n3 Exhibit 2\n4 Exhibit 6\n5 NDP Egypt 12.7\n6 NDP Jordan 3.9\n7 Exhibit 3, item 12.1.\n8 Exhibit 3, 12.7 Egypt: Whether people who have converted from Islam to Christianity, particularly those converts who have been arrested, are able to obtain passports and leave the country (April 2010- November 2013)\n9 Exhibit 3, Item 12.8, Egypt: Situation and treatment of Christians; availability of state protection.\n10 Exhibit 5\n11 Exhibit 3, Item 12.5: Sectarian Attacks Amid Political Crisis.\n12 NDP Egypt 12.7\n",

I find that he\u2019s established a serious possibility of persecution based upon the Convention ground of religion or alternatively political opinion or even particular social group, and that is a atheist in Egypt.\n[4] The claimant\u2019s allegations are set out in Exhibit 2 and what he says is basically that over time he grew to dislike Islam. He just decided to not agree with a lot of tenets. He was exposed to other people who are Christians and \u2026 and they sort of opened his eyes to other possibilities and \u2026 and also as a \u2026 as a scientist and as an engineering student he became to understand more about science and how science is may be in conflict with Islam, and so he became more and more an atheist.\n[5] He alleges that in the last two years of university between 2016 and 2018 he was debating \u2026 really just having discussions with colleagues who are Muslim in university about the \u2026 the meaning of Islam and atheism and all sorts of other political issues such as women\u2019s rights and gay rights, and how Islam is just not really compliant with I guess the more understanding of what these human rights, how they should be \u2026 be respected.\n[6] And he alleges that eventually he\u2019s \u2026 he came to the attention of the Muslim Brotherhood who asked him to come and \u2026 and pray with them so they can talk to him about these things. And he sort of avoided them for a while, but eventually he started getting threats by February 2018 from the leader of the Muslim Brotherhood in the area, the imam, and he \u2026 and he complied because they threatened his life if he wasn\u2019t going to meet with them.\n[7] So, he met about three or four times with the imam and the more they talked to him the more he, in fact, really disliked Islam and decided it was a violent religion. And eventually he had a blow out with the imam and he (inaudible) on him.\n[8] Nothing really happened though after that. Allegedly, the most that happened was then a relative of the imam who was a police officer called him and threatened him to change his ways, and the claimant basically told him that he will, and sort of avoided the police officer.\n[9] And a few months afterwards he basically left the country with the help of his dad and his dad\u2019s friend Mr. XXXX(ph) who is actually here today.\n[10] And the claimant then fears returning to Egypt because they mistreat atheists, and he fears either being killed by the Muslim Brotherhood or the government itself.\n[11] Now, in terms of his identity, the claimant\u2019s identity as an Egyptian is established by his \u2026 by his testimony and the supporting documentation, namely, the passport and the identity card which also confirms that he was designated as birth \u2026 at birth as a Muslim which is something that, according to the NDP, is known, that Egypt designates people by religion from their birth according to their parents. And so we know that the government designates him as a Muslim man. That all (inaudible) in Exhibit 1, the originals of the Minister.\n[12] In terms of credibility, I found the claimant to be a credible witness and I believe what he\u2019s alleged in support of his claim. He testified in a straightforward manner and there\u2019s really no relevant inconsistencies or contradictions between his testimony and the other evidence before me.\n[13] I accept his testimony and \u2026 and explanations for why he would even hangout with the Muslim Brotherhood, which is a known terrorist listed entity in \u2026 in Egypt, and that he was afraid that if he wasn\u2019t going to comply after trying to avoid them for months, they would eventually just going to kill him.\n[14] So, I accept his evidence in that regard. I don\u2019t \u2026 you know, I find that I accept he was afraid, more afraid to not meet with them because it would appear that they were really trying to reconvert him back to Islam and he wanted to just play along while he was trying finish his schooling, given that there\u2019s only a few months left.\n[15] I also accept counsel\u2019s submission that in the context of this case the \u2026 the omission of the imam\u2019s name is really \u2026 should not be held as a determinative issue for credibility.\n[16] Ultimately, it\u2019s clear that the claimant did not really suffer actual past persecution though. This is more of a future persecution case because ultimately nothing happened and there\u2019s no evidence that any type of blasphemy case was actually launched against the claimant.\n[17] While he appears to have used Mr. XXXX to get out of Egypt, there\u2019s really nothing unusual about that and the person \u2026 and it appears there have been no bribes paid or anything of that sort because Mr. XXXX basically accompanies all sorts of people outside of Egypt including his own family, and just because he\u2019s a friend in the \u2026 in the airport.\n[18] There\u2019s really no evidence to indicate that the Government of Egypt is currently looking for the claimant or that the Muslim Brotherhood is even looking to do anything else to the claimant except just report him to the \u2026 the police relative of the imam.\n[19] Really, the issue is what will happen to the claimant in the future, and I find looking at the objective documentation in the NDP, I find that it is sufficient to establish that he would face a serious risk of persecution based on either being perceived as an atheist or his political opinions over his lack of religion which is sufficient for a religious nexus.\n[20] The \u2026 the International Religious Freedom report from the US DOS for Egypt that\u2019s Item 12.9 contains numerous citations for individuals who have been arrested for blasphemy or denigration of religion for basically being atheist, and a lot of it it\u2019s got to do with social media presence which generates a paper trail, and these people get arrested and go to jail and they get mistreated in jail as well.\n[21] There\u2019s also a report about even two potential atheist individuals who were arrested, not because of any public blasphemy but rather because they themselves were exchanging private messages about atheism, and that was enough even for them to get arrested just for that, so, private conduct.\n[22] And that really appears to be only \u2026 it\u2019s not even a complaint by the Muslim Brotherhood. It\u2019s really just a \u2026 was a complaint of a restaurant owner who simply just reported these two people, these two employee cooks to the authorities who then actually acted on that complaint and arrested them.\n[23] And all of that really indicates that, you know, serious persecution on a forward-looking basis for really just texting each other.\n[24] So, all of that is really, in my view, a serious possibility of persecution against the claimant if \u2026 as his being \u2026 as he is an atheist as I accept that he is, a serious possibility of it. And I find that that is sufficient to establish not only a credible fear but also a serious risk of persecution that amounts to persecution.\n[25] There\u2019s also the fear of the Muslim Brotherhood as well and the Muslim Brotherhood is a terrorist organization. And while I find that there may be State protection against the Muslim Brotherhood in the \u2026 in theory, Item 2.1 of the NDP does indicate that the government does act fairly quickly and fairly violently against any Muslim Brotherhood that (inaudible) attacked.\n[26] I find that in the case of the claimant that State protection would not be forthcoming. Would actually get him into more trouble because while it may be true that he could have reported the Muslim Brotherhood people that he met in university they would have been arrested, I would find, and probably executed, the problem is \u2026 that I accept his evidence that he also would have a serious possibility that he also would have been arrested for blasphemy and then he would have himself been sent to jail on blasphemy charges potentially or \u2026 or denigrating religion, given his atheistic views that he was publicly expounding to other people.\n[27] And so I find that State protection would not be forthcoming in his case and it\u2019s also not reasonable for him to seek State protection given that he is an atheist. He would be a vulnerable minority which is also targeted by the government at the same time as the Muslim Brotherhood. So, I find that he\u2019s rebutted the presumption of State protection.\n[28] That leaves the question of internal flight alternative, and I find that because the fear is also from the government and the government is known to be an agent of persecution against atheistic people through the courts and through the police, and there\u2019s no evidence that anywhere in Egypt is a \u2026 is safe for the claimant from the government and from this type of persecution.\n[29] I find that \u2026 that renders any IFA including Giza or Alexandria to be not \u2026 not viable under the first prong of the test. There\u2019s therefore no need to \u2026 to speak to the second prong of the test.\n[30] Accordingly, I find that \u2026 I find that the claimant has met all the \u2026 the elements of the Convention refugee definition. I also found that his \u2026 his witness Mr. XXXX was also credible in his own right.\n[31] I find \u2026 therefore find him to be a Convention refugee under the \u2026 the Convention ground of religion or the alternative political opinion or the alternative as a particular social group and I therefore accept his claim.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

Gueller\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Namita Dass\nCountry: Egypt\nRPD Number: TB9-01279\nAssociated RPD Number(s): TB9-01335\nATIP Number: A-2020-00518\nATIP Pages: 000838-000848\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] The principal claimant, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, is a citizen from Egypt. The associate claimant, XXXX XXXX (a.k.a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX), is a citizen of Iran. Both are claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97of the Immigration Protection Act (the Act).\n[2] In rendering my reasons, I have considered and applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guidelines on Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution related to the associate claimant\u2019s claim.\nDETERMINATION\n[3] I find both claimants to be Convention Refugees as they have established a well-founded fear of persecution based on a Convention ground, namely they are convention refugees based on the convention ground of religion.\nIDENTITY\n[4] The principal claimant\u2019s identity as a national of Egypt and the associate claimant\u2019s identity as a national of Iran are established, on a balance of probabilities, through their testimony and the supporting documentation filed, namely their passport.\nPRINCIPAL CLAIMANT ALLEGATIONS\n[5] The principal claimant alleges he cannot return to Egypt because he would be persecuted by the Salafists as he is a Muslim Sunni married to the Associate claimant, who belongs to a different religion, as she is a Muslim Shia.\nANALYSIS\nCredibility\n[6] The determinative issue in this claim is credibility. I find the principal claimant to be a credible witness on a balance of probabilities.\n[7] The principal claimant testified in a straightforward and credible manner. His oral testimony was consistent with his Basis of Claim form (BOC) and he provided documentary evidence in support of his allegations:\n\nBirth, divorce and Marriage certificateUniversity degreeLetter from his employerAffidavit from Maspero Youth Foundation For Development and Human Rights [8] The claimant testified that he married his wife in Kuwait and despite having different religions they lived without complications. Both claimants had temporary work visas in Kuwait.\n[9] The claimants have a Canadian born son. The principal claimant stated that they came to Canada in XXXX 2017 for tourism and the associate claimant was pregnant. She had some medical complications and was advised not to travel. Consequently, their son was born in Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2017. After that, both claimants returned to Kuwait.\n[10] In XXXX 2018 they went to Iran to visit his wife\u2019s family. They were detained at Shiraz Airport and both were questioned about his Egyptian nationality, his religion and whether he was spreading his religion into Iran. He also testified that they were monitored in Iran and were called to report to the police station to be interrogated about his activities in Iran. After the last interrogation at the police station, he left Iran the following day.\n[11] He testified that he had a temporary work visa in Kuwait. In September 2018, his employment was terminated and he was not able to stay because his visa expired with the termination of his employment. Consequently, they returned to Egypt to look for jobs.\n[12] He testified that upon returning to Egypt, The Salafists, an extremist Muslim group in Egypt, started to threaten him because he was married to a woman that is from Iran and Shia. He also testified that he went to the police to report the incidents, however the police did not want to issue a report and he was told by the police to divorce his wife and amend things with the Salafists. The claimant testified that after living two months in Cairo, he moved to 6th of October City, to escape the harassment and persecution.\n[13] The claimant testified that after one week of living in 6th of October City, the Salafists appeared outside his home shouting that he was a disbeliever and threating him, asking him to come outside. He called the police for protection, however, when the police arrived the claimant was the one that was detained by the police. After he was taken to the police station, his wife called a friend for help. Their friend was able to hide her and their son in Alexandria.\n[14] The claimant stated that he remained in detention at the police station and was released the following morning. He went back to his home and could not find his wife and son and became terrified thinking that his family could have been killed by the extremists. Because he was found by the extremists despite having moving to 6th of October City, he realized that they would be able to find him everywhere, because they are a group with connections over the whole country. He started to look for help, and a friend referred him to the Youth Foundation For Development and Human Rights, where he was advised to leave Egypt as soon as possible and go to Canada because his son has a Canadian passport and they had valid Canadian visas.\n[15] The claimant also testified that he would not have been able to move to Iran, his wife\u2019s country of nationality, because he will be persecuted for his nationality and religion. In addition, a man cannot obtain Iranian nationality through his Iranian wife.\n[16] He testified that they left Egypt on XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and arrived in Canada the same day.\n[17] I also note, that the documentary evidence in the NDP concerning the treatment of different groups of Muslims in Egypt is that:\n\u201cthe predominant school of Islam practiced in Egypt is Sunni. While Egypt also has a number of smaller Muslim groups, including Ahmadis, Quranists and Shi\u2019a, these communities have faced marginalization, discrimination and persecution due to widespread misunderstandings about their faith, with their practitioners frequently cast as threats to national stability and Sunni beliefs. Given the prominent role that powerful religious bodies such as AlAzhar continue to play in Egyptian society, as well as the strong support they command from many members of the country \u2018s security forces and judiciary, non-Sunni Muslim groups still face a range of restrictions in their ability to freely practice and express their faith\u201d\n\u2026\n\u201cAnother instance where blasphemy charges have been used was the case of Amr Abdalla, a Shi\u2019a activist who was arrested in November 2013 at the Imam Hussein mosque as he attempted to commemorate Ashura and subsequently detained in Gamalia police station, when a blasphemy misdemeanor was filed against him. In February 2014, he received a five-year prison sentence for religious blasphemy. The judge argued that while freedom of belief is constitutionally guaranteed, if is not absolute as it should not lead to ideas. thoughts or beliefs that \u2018oppose the rules and foundation of religion, revealed law or morals. \u201d\n\u2026\n\u201cHate speech against Shi\u2019a is widespread. Its sources vary from prominent religious institutions, such as the Ministry of Endowment and Al-Azhar, to the country\u2019s media. The latter has regularly showcased articles promoting hatred against the community, including accusations that Shi\u2019a are \u2018traitors\u2019 and promoting foreign agendas.\u201d\n[18] According to information in the NDP, Shia Muslims and their supporters are being persecuted, marginalized and harassed in Egypt. On a balance of probabilities, I accept the claimant\u2019s allegations that he can be personally persecuted for being married to a Shia woman. In addition, the NDP also states that interfaith marriages are not accepted by extremists, like the Salafists, and the majority of the Sunni Muslim community; and are not permitted under the Sharia law, unless the woman converts to be a Sunni Muslim.\n[19] For all these reasons, considering the claimant\u2019s credible allegations and documentary evidence before me, I find, on a balance of probabilities, the claimant faces more than a mere possibility of persecution if he returns to Egypt because of his interfaith marriage.\nState protection\n[20] The claimant stated that he was harassed during his time in Cairo, and despite moving to 6th of October City, the Salafist were able to find him. Moreover, when the Salafist came to his home to harass him, despite calling the police for protection, he was the one that was detained because of the Salafist\u2019s allegations.\n[21] I find that the claimant has provided clear and convincing evidence to rebut the presumption of state protection.\n[22] The information in the NDP is that Shia supporters do not find protection from the authorities or the judicial system:\n\u201cAnother instance where blasphemy charges have been used was the case of Amr Abdalla, a Shi\u2019a activist who was arrested in November 2013 at the Imam Hussein mosque as he attempted to commemorate Ashura and subsequently detained in Gamalia police station, when a blasphemy misdemeanor was filed against him. ln February 2014, he received a five-year prison sentence for religious blasphemy. The judge argued that while freedom of belief is constitutionally guaranteed, it is not absolute as it should not lead to ideas, thoughts or beliefs that \u2018oppose the rules and foundation of religion, revealed law or morals\u2019. The judge in his reasoning stated that the defendant was guilty of \u2018propagating thought and belief that contravenes that which the overwhelming majority of Egyptians and Egyptian society belong to and believe.\u201997\nln the same manner, possession of Shi\u2019a publications has been used to indict Shi\u2019a believers of religious blasphemy. In May 2015, \u201c\u2018Mahmoud Dahroug, a dentist from the Dakahlia governorate, received a reduced sentence of six months in prison for \u2018religion blasphemy\u2019 for the possession of publications that contained Shi\u2019a doctrines. While a number of violations took place during the arrest and interrogation, he was charged with blasphemy and accused of carrying publications that threatened national security.\u201d 981\n\u2026\n\u201cRather than protecting Shi\u2019a worshippers, security forces have continued to cooperate with groups who actively incite against them: in September 2017, for instance, a leading anti-Shi\u2019a agitator pledged to report Shi\u2019a visiting the Imam Hussein Mosque to security forces to prevent them practicing their rituals. This is despite the face that members of the Coalition have engaged in a number of attacks against Shi\u2019a, including an attack on 23 June 2013 against a group of Shi\u2019a practicing a ritual in a private home in Abu Musallim that saw a large crowd, led by Salafist preachers, launch an assault with stones and Molotov cocktails.\nPolice, having attempted unsuccessfully to halt the attack, withdrew and four Shi\u2019a men were subsequently beaten to death while others, including women and children, were injured. In June 2015, convictions were finally handed out to 23 people (10 in absentia) for the deaths, each of whom received 14-year sentences, while eight others were acquitted.102 However, there has been no prosecution of those who contributed to the incitement against the victims, including the Salafist preachers who had engaged in weeks of hate speech prior to the attack.\u201d2\n[23] I find therefore, on a balance of probabilities, that according to evidence before me, authority protection may not be operational in Egypt. I therefore find, on a balance of probabilities, that state protection would not be adequate for the principal claimant if he were to return to Egypt.\nIFA\n[24] Based on the claimant\u2019s testimony and NDP documentary evidence, Salafist groups are all over the country, in addition the authorities may not be able to protect him or may not take his requests for protection seriously. Concurrently, the NDP suggests that there are situations where the police had to withdraw because their interventions were unsuccessful.\n[25] Therefore, I find, on a balance of probabilities, there is no viable internal flight alternative (IFA) for the claimant. The evidence suggests that there is a serious possibility that the claimant would be persecuted upon return to Egypt based on religion, him being married to a Shia woman.\n[26] Therefore, his claim is accepted. The principal claimant is recognized as a Convention refugee.\nASSOCIATED CLAIMANT ALLEGATIONS\n[27] The associated claimant alleges she cannot return to Iran because she would be persecuted by the authorities because she is a Muslim Shia and married to the principal claimant, who is a Sunni Muslim.\nANALYSIS\nCredibility\n[28] The determinative issue in this claim is credibility. I find the associated claimant to be a credible witness on a balance of probabilities.\n[29] The associated claimant testified in a straightforward and credible manner. Her oral testimony was consistent with her Basis of Claim form (BOC) and she provided documentary evidence in support of her allegations:\n\nBirth, divorce and Marriage certificateUniversity degreeLetter from his employer[30] The evidence on the NDP is that Sunni Muslims are being harassed, arrested and threatened in Iran:\n\u201cAccording to sources wishing to remain anonymous, 15 Arabs who converted from Shia to Sunni Islam were sentenced to a one-year term of imprisonment on 21 February 2013. They were reportedly detained in an unknown location for 21 days after their arrests on 17 January 2012\u2026. They were reportedly charged with spreading propaganda against the system by promoting Wahhabism and Salafism, holding group prayers, questioning the official religion of the country, producing and distributing deviant books, communicating with salafist and takfirist groups (groups accusing others of apostasy) and participating in the religious courses of salafist and takfirist elements.3\n[31] The associate claimant\u2019s testimony was that she and her husband were detained and interrogated at the airport and at the police station; and, also followed and monitored during their stay in Iran, because her husband is a Sunni Muslim. Therefore, she was scared thinking that she was going to be arrested and will disappear like many other people who are accused of becoming a Sunni Muslim convert, or a supporter of their religion. The claimant also stated that her mother asked her not to come back. As a consequence, subsequent to the experience with the authorities and the memory of her detention and harassment from her teenage years, she left Iran and have not returned. Her credible testimony is supported by the evidence in the NDP regarding authorities persecuting Sunni Muslims.\n[32] Therefore, on a balance of probabilities, I find, that there is more than a mere possibility that the claimant would be persecuted if she returns to Iran, because she is married to a Sunni Muslim.\nState protection\n[33] Through the associate claimant\u2019s credible testimony, she has established that the authorities persecuted her when she was visiting Iran because she is married to a Sunni Muslim. I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the associate claimant has provided clear and convincing evidence to rebut the presumption of state protection.\n[34] I also note, that the documentary evidence in the NDP concerning the treatment of Muslims in Iran that:\n\u201cThe July 2014 USDOS report notes that during the reporting year 2013, \u201c[t]here were reports of arrests and harassment\u201d of members of the Sunni community including \u201cSunni clerics and congregants \u201c, noting that \u201c[s]ecurity officials continued to raid prayer sites belonging to Sunnis\u201d. The same source also quotes human rights organisations as reporting \u201cseveral instances of due process violations\u201d against Sunnis.\u201d\nThe NDP also notes that \u201cAmong the sources consulted by ACCORD, no further information could be found on the treatment of persons living in mixed religious marriages.\u201d4 Nevertheless, according to the evidence in the NDP about the persecution and harassment of the Sunni Muslims in Iran by the authorities, I find, on a balance of probabilities, that there is more than a mere possibility that the associate claimant will be persecuted by the authorities because she is married to a Sunni Muslim if she returns to Iran.\n[35] Therefore, on a balance of probabilities, considering the claimant\u2019s credible allegations and the documentary evidence before me, I find that state protection would not be adequate for the associate claimant if she were to return to Iran, because the agent of persecution is the Iranian state.\nIFA\n[36] Based on the claimant testimony and NDP documentary evidence, I find, on a balance of probabilities, there is no viable internal flight alternative (IFA) for the claimant. The evidence suggests that there is a serious possibility that the claimant would be persecuted upon return to Iran based on religion for being married to a Sunni man.\n[37] Therefore, her claim is accepted. The associate claimant is recognized as a Convention refugee.\nCONCLUSION\n[38] I find, on a balance of probabilities, that there is more than a mere possibility that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, will be persecuted if he returns to Egypt and that the associate claimant, XXXX XXXX XXXX, will be persecuted if she returns to Iran, because of their religion, based on their interfaith marriage.\n[39] Therefore, both claimants are recognized as Convention refugees.\n(signed) P.

        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2019 RLLR 186\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: August 1, 2019\nPanel: Yonatan Rozenszajn\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Amro Hayek\nCountry: Egypt\nRPD Number: TB8-32362\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2020-00518\nATIP Pages: 000802-000808\nREASONS FOR DECISION\nINTRODUCTION\n[1] These are the reasons for the decision in the claim of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (the \u201cclaimant\u201d), who claims to be a citizen of Egypt, and is claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[2] In rendering my reasons, I have considered and applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guidelines on Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution.\n[3] Written submissions were received from claimant\u2019s counsel June 18, 2019 which I duly considered.1 On June 21, 2019, the claimant filed a good colour copy of her IRCC internet portal page.2 The Minister filed the claimant\u2019s visa application to Canada as well as a colour copy of her passport in response to the Board\u2019s post hearing requests.3\nALLEGATIONS\n[4] The claimant\u2019s allegations are set out in her Basis of Claim form (\u201cBOC\u201d).4 She amended her narrative on two other occasions.5 In summary, the claimant alleges that since childhood she was interested in Christianity. She alleges that around the age of 35, she started attending several Sunday church services when she was in Europe on routine business trips through her Europecar employer where numerous Christians worked. She alleges that she visited Canada in XXXX and XXXX 2016, attending church on both occasions and learning about Christianity. She alleges that she returned to Egypt and told her parents about her beliefs and Christianity. They responded badly and got her to resign from Europecar. The fact of her Christian beliefs became known and she started receiving threats and having garbage thrown at her by neighbours. She fled to Canada in XXXX 2018. After extending her visa once, she learned that her case may be eligible for refugee protection in Canada she made arrangement to commence a claim in November 2018.\nDETERMINATION\n[5] I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee as she has established a serious possibility of persecution on account of religion.\nANALYSIS\n[6] The determinative issue in this case is whether the claimant provided sufficient credible evidence to establish the basis of her claim, namely the genuineness of her alleged conversion to Christianity from Islam.\nIdentity \u2013 personal and national\n[7] The claimant\u2019s identity as a national of Egypt has been established, on a balance of probabilities, by a valid Arab Republic of Egypt passport6 that was seized by the referring IRCC (formerly CIC) office.\nIdentity\u2014religious\n[8] The claimant has also established her identity as a convert from Islam to Christianity by her testimony and by way of her personal documentation, including the following: a national identity card which list her religion as Muslim,7 a baptism certificate8; and various photographs depicting the claimant in church.9\nCredibility\n[9] The claimant was generally consistent in her allegations and testimony. It is beyond controversy that she has in fact been baptised in 2018 in Canada.\n[10] The main issue was her multiple returns from Europe, USA and even Canada, even after she started attending churches and considered herself Christian. She explained that she was not aware that her situation qualified for asylum and she wanted to resume her teaching at the university. She also wanted to confront her parents with her new faith after the XXXX 2016 to Canada because that was personally important to her.\n[11] I find her explanations reasonable in the circumstances because the claimant is a single, highly educated woman in Egypt that lives with her parents. Keeping cultural norms in mind and the Gender Guidelines, it is not unreasonable to expect that she may want to share this important aspect of her identity with her parents especially since it is clearly inferable that they supported her educational, professional and personal life choices up to that point. I also find that her desire to return and teach is intrinsically tied to her identity as an educated person. Lastly, while the claimant is fairly sophisticated, it is understandable that she was not sure whether her case would qualify for asylum until recently because her allegations of past persecution are on their face quite modest.\n[12] Being on the receiving end of threats, when there is no evidence of a serious possibility of those threats materializing into actual violence does not amount to persecution. Neither is having garbage thrown at occasionally while travelling in the neighbourhood amount to persecution when one balances the fact that the claimant was otherwise gainfully employed at the least in the immediate past.\n[13] Accordingly, I decline to draw an adverse inference as to the credibility of the claimant from her returns to Egypt and failure to claim protection in the past.\n[14] The claimant filed post-hearing documentation that appears to show that she was thinking in 2016 to immigrate to Canada as a skilled worker. I accept counsel\u2019s submissions that she did not meet the benchmark completely due to lack of testing for English. However, this evidence also indicates that in other respects she met the benchmarks and her application may very well have been approved in the end. However, I find that I accept the claimant\u2019s testimony that she declined to follow up with this application because it would have taken too long and she started getting worried for her safety, mainly due to her father\u2019s advice that people her in position could get into trouble in Egypt. I decline to draw an adverse inference as to the claimant\u2019s general credibility from her failure to follow up with the skilled worker application. I find that in fact this application shows that the claimant was in fact trying to leave Egypt permanently which supports her overall claim to be in a state of general suffering due to religious discrimination by society.\n[15] While her past conduct does raise some concerns, I find that I ultimately give the claimant the benefit of the doubt. The claimant was credible when it came to speaking about her religious knowledge and practices. There is an insufficient basis to question her honesty. I find that she has established the sincerity of her religious conversion to Christianity with sufficient credible evidence.\nSerious risk of religious persecution on a forward looking basis\n[16] While the claimant may appear to be able to maintain gainful employment in Egypt as a notorious Christian convert in the past, the country documentation evidence indicates that converts ultimate face an array of serious persecution including that \u201ca convert to Christianity from Islam will have extreme difficulty dealing with officials and neighbours who have any idea of his or her decision.\u201d10 Furthermore, \u201cMuslim converts to Christianity are regularly harassed by government officials who view their actions as a social offence against Islam tantamount to treason.\u201d11\n[17] The documentation adds the following statements from one of its sources consulted:\nSimilarly, in correspondence sent to the Research Directorate, a board member of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Canada stated that authorities will attempt to dissuade someone from converting from Islam to Christianity and may arbitrarily imprison the person alongside \u201cdangerous criminals\u201d if they insist on converting.12\n[18] The government frequently failed to prevent, investigate, or prosecute crimes targeting members of religious minority groups, which fostered a climate of impunity.\n[19] Country documentation confirms that Christians continue to be targeted by Islamic militants, attacks against Copts take place throughout Egypt, and state authorities are slow to act.13\n[20] In noting that various violent incidents against Christians took place in locations throughout the country, the panel also finds that there is not an area of the country where the claimant would be able to reside and safely participate in the community, and as such there is no internal flight alternative available to the claimant anywhere in Egypt.\n[21] Counsel\u2019s disclosure also establishes that converts are prevented from officially changing their designated religion assigned to her at birth, even if they seek a court order.14 This effectively prevents converts from integrating into the Christian community, which means they are still subject to Sharia law, they are not allowed to marry Christians and any foreign marriage of such a nature is not recognized and any children born from such a union would be assign a \u201cMuslim\u201d identity designation by default which cannot be changed.\n[22] I find that all of these forms of discrimination, including the illegality of conversion per se in Egypt and risks of vigilante attacks, cumulatively amount to persecution on a forward looking basis in the claimant\u2019s case. They also evidence a lack of state protection because this discrimination emanates from the state.\nNo state protection\n[23] I find that the claimant has rebutted the presumption of state protection because the harm ultimately emanates from the state or societal elements that are tacitly supported by the state at least in so far as they seek to stop conversions and punish intransigent Christians converters who refuse to return to Islam.\nNo IFA\n[24] I find that there is no viable IFA in Egypt for the claimant because there is no evidence that converts from Islam to Christianity are safe anywhere in the country.\nCONCLUSION\n[25] Based on the analysis above, I conclude that the claimant is a Convention refugee based on the ground of religion.\n[26] She has a well-founded fear of persecution.\n[27] Accordingly, I accept her claim.\n(signed) YONATAN ROZENSZAJN\nAugust 1, 2019\n1 Exhibit 11.\n2 Exhibit 12.\n3 Exhibit 10 and 13.\n4 Exhibit 2.\n5 Exhibits 8 and 9.\n6 Exhibit 1, package of information from the referring CBSA\/CIC.\n7 Exhibit 7\n8 Ibid.\n9 Exhibit 6.\n10 Exhibit 3, National Documentation Package (NDP) for Egypt, 29 March 2019 version, item 12.7: Whether people who have converted from Islam to Christianity, particularly those converts who have been arrested, are able to obtain passports and leave the country (April 2010-November 2013).

Moc\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Ameena Sultan\nCountry: Egypt\nRPD Number: TB8-32331\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2020-00518\nATIP Pages: 000796-000801\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] These are the reasons for the decision in the claim of Mr. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, who claims to be a citizen of Egypt and is seeking refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).1\nEXPEDITED DETERMINATION\n[2] Paragraph 170(f) of IRPA2 provides that the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) may allow a claim for refugee protection without a hearing, unless the Minister has notified the RPD of the Minister\u2019s intention to intervene within the time limit set out in the Refugee Protection Division Rules.3 Further, subsection 162(2) of IRPA4 directs each Division to deal with all proceedings before it as informally and quickly as the circumstances and the considerations of fairness and natural justice permit.\n[3] The claimant\u2019s case was identified as one that could be processed through the RPD\u2019s expedited process for Egyptian claims. The RPD received the claimant\u2019s signed Certificate of Readiness5 for the expedited process on February 14, 2019. Having carefully considered the evidence in this case, the panel finds that it meets the criteria for expedited determination.\n[4] This case has therefore been decided without a hearing, according to the Instructions governing the streaming of less complex claims at the Refugee Protection Division.6\nALLEGATIONS\n[5] The following is a summary of the claimant\u2019s allegations as outlined in the narrative to his Basis of Claim (BOC)7 form dated November 12, 2018.\n[6] The claimant is a 26-year-old resident of Cairo who fears for his life on the basis of his sexual identity as a gay man in Egypt. He recalls first coming to the realization of being attracted to boys at around eleven or twelve years of age, and engaging in casual relationships in high school and during military service. The claimant communicated with men online and became familiar with other members of the LGBTQ community in Cairo. In September 2016, he was arrested for the first time and charged with practising homosexuality. Following his release from detention, he had difficulty finding employment and became a XXXX XXXX. In September 2017, he was arrested for the second time and sentenced to a six-month term in military prison.\n[7] After his release from prison in May 2018, the claimant experienced fear on a daily basis. With the help of another friend who had also been imprisoned, the claimant was eventually able to obtain a Canadian visa through the Rainbow Railroad, an LGBTQ-rights organization, and left Egypt on XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. He filed a claim for refugee protection inland on December 12, 2018 in Toronto.\n[8] The claimant fears persecution and harm at the hands of homophobic persons on the basis of his sexual identity in Egypt. He also alleges that the authorities are unable or unwilling to protect him, as a gay man, in Egypt.\nDETERMINATION\n[9] The panel finds that the claimant is a Convention refugee under section 96 of IRPA for the following reasons.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\u2014personal and national\n[10] The claimant\u2019 s identity as a national of Egypt has been established, on a balance of probabilities, by a valid Arab Republic of Egypt passport8 that was seized by the referring IRCC (formerly CIC) office.\nIdentity\u2014Sexual Orientation\/Gender Identity and Expression (SOGIE)\n[11] The claimant has also established his identity as a gay man by way of his personal documentation, including but not limited to arrest records and court proceedings9 regarding charges of \u201cimmorality actions with men\u201d which include \u201cexchange of financial wage.\u201d10\nCredibility\n[12] The panel has reviewed the claimant\u2019s Basis of Claim (BOC),11 intake forms,12 GCMS notes by the Cairo visa post officer,13 and the claimant-specific documents disclosed by counsel,14 and has found the claimant to be credible regarding the central elements in this case \u2013 namely that he is a gay man who has previously been harassed and persecuted, including having faced criminal charges,15 on the basis of his sexual identity in Egypt.\n[13] In reviewing the National Documentation Package (NDP) for Egypt,16 the panel has found the claimant\u2019s personal evidence to be consistent with the objective country conditions documents before it. As such, the panel finds that the claimant has established, on a balance of probabilities, his profile as a gay man who has been targeted by Egyptian officials and homophobic individuals because of his sexual identity.\n[14] As sexual orientation falls within the membership of a particular social group category, and thus forms a basis for refugee claims, as per section 96 of IRPA, the test is whether there is a serious possibility of persecution should the claimant return to Egypt.\n[15] The panel finds, based on the evidence before it, that the claimant has met that test.\nState protection\n[16] In order to establish a claim pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA, the claimant must rebut the presumption of state protection. The claimant did not seek protection from the authorities, as the state itself was the agent of persecution in this particular case, through its discriminatory legal and judicial apparatus when interacting with LGBTQ persons in Egypt.\n[17] The panel has before it country conditions documentation indicating that, even though same-sex relationships between consenting adults are not illegal, \u201cthe Law on the Combating of Prostitution, and the law against debauchery have been used liberally to imprison gay men in recent years.\u201d17\n[18] The panel notes the following:\nPublic morality is recognised by international law as grounds for limiting expression \u2026 [and] individuals who, through their sexual or gender expression, disrupt conservative binary gender models are especially vulnerable in Egypt, according to an activist who was based in Egypt through recent years. Through 2015 and 2016, widely publicised arrests continue. \u2026\nAccording to 76 Crimes, the largest reported number of arrests of LGBT people has been in Egypt, where a crackdown has been under way since 2013 as part of a larger government effort to arrest and harass political opponents, human rights defenders and journalists. In late-2016, LGBT community leaders estimate that as many as 500 LGBT people have been sent to prison.18\n[19] Country documentation further states that\n[a]fter a coup resulted in a new government in late 2013, the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR) began documenting increased arrests and harassment of people perceived to be gay or transgender by the public morals police, with at least 77 arrests taking place between October 2013 and May 2014. Arrests continue at similar rates\u2014 many of them stemming from police efforts to entrap gay men by using social media.19 [citations omitted]\n[20] Country documentation confirms that LGBTQ persons continue to be targeted by Egyptian authorities through the state\u2019s penal and legal apparatus. The panel finds that the objective documentary evidence before it supports the claimant\u2019s allegations, and that he has provided clear and convincing evidence of the state\u2019s inability to protect him as a gay man. As such, the claimant has rebutted the presumption of state protection should he return to Egypt.\n[21] In noting that the state itself is the agent of persecution in this particular case, the panel also finds that there is not an area of the country where the claimant would be able to reside and safely participate in the community, and as such there is no internal flight alternative available to the claimant anywhere in Egypt.\n[22] Given the documentary evidence before the panel, both personal and objective, the panel finds that there is a serious possibility that the claimant could face persecution on the basis of his sexual orientation should he return to Egypt, and that state protection would not reasonably be forthcoming to him anywhere in the country.\nCONCLUSION\n[23] Based on the foregoing analysis, the panel has determined that the claimant has established that there is a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground as per section 96 of IRPA if he were to return to Egypt.\n[24] The panel therefore finds that the claimant is a Convention refugee and accepts the claim.\n(signed) M.

He recalls his introduction to members of the LGBTQ community at a caf\u00e9 in Cairo at the age of eighteen, and attending parties where people were openly gay. Having come from a disadvantaged background following his parents\u2019 divorce, the claimant saw an opportunity to make a lot of money and became a XXXX XXXX. He had a two\u00ad year relationship with a Saudi man whom he met through Facebook, in addition to a several same\u00ad sex relationships with members of the Cairo LGBTQ community. In May 2014, the claimant and a companion were apprehended by the morality police. They were abused and humiliated in detention before being charged with prostitution. The claimant was sentenced to four years\u2019 hard labour. While in custody and waiting for his appeal, he began taking a lot of drugs and engaged in self harm by cutting. The claimant was released after six months, but his health continued to deteriorate. Within a year of his release, the claimant was diagnosed with HIV and saw a number of his friends succumb to AIDS-related complications. With his mother\u2019s encouragement, the claimant started a successful course of treatment which resulted in a \u2018zero virus\u2019 test as of November 2017.\n[7] In 2018, the claimant entered into a relationship with a woman to whom he was introduced by his mother. When confronted by his girlfriend with an ultimatum, however, he chose his male partner over her. Reluctant to socialize, the claimant continued to fear arrest on a daily basis. With the help of Bedayaa, an LGBTQ-rights organization in Egypt, the claimant was eventually able to obtain a Canadian visa through the Rainbow Railroad, and left Egypt on XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. He filed a claim for refugee protection inland on November 26, 2018 in Toronto.\n[8] The claimant fears persecution and harm at the hands of homophobic persons on the basis of his sexual identity in Egypt.

He recalls feeling as if under constant surveillance by his father throughout childhood, and being disciplined for acting in a feminine manner by his mother. As an adolescent, the claimant realized that he was attracted to boys rather than girls. As he grew up in Mansoura, a small conservative town, he was afraid to act on his feelings. When he moved to Cairo in 2015 to attend university, however, the claimant began using social media to meet and date men. In 2016, he met XXXX, his long-term partner, and their relationship quickly became serious.\n[7] The claimant was able to keep his sexual identity, including his relationship with XXXX, secret from his parents, but the need to keep things from his strict parents was causing him a great deal of stress. In July 2017, XXXX was arrested by the police on suspicion of homosexual activity and facilitating prostitution. After his release from detention, XXXX came to the claimant\u2019s home, where the claimant\u2019s father discovered them. The claimant was badly beaten by his father, who attempted to kill him with a screwdriver during the assault.\n[8] The stress of XXXX court case and the claimant\u2019s abuse at the hands of his father cause the couple to agree to end the relationship. They had tried to flee Egypt and applied for visas to France and the Netherlands which were denied. Eventually, both he and XXXX were able to obtain Canadian visas with the help of Bedaya, an Egyptian LGBTQ rights agency, and through the Rainbow Railroad organization in Canada. The claimant left Egypt on XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. He filed a claim for refugee protection inland on November 8, 2018 in Toronto.\n[9] The claimant fears persecution and harm at the hands of homophobic persons, including his father, on the basis of his sexual identity in Egypt. He also alleges that the authorities are unable or unwilling to protect him, as a gay man, in Egypt.\nDETERMINATION\n[10] The panel finds that the claimant is a Convention refugee under section 96 of IRPA for the following reasons.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\u2014personal and national\n[11] The claimant\u2019s identity as a national of Egypt has been established, on a balance of probabilities, by a valid Arab Republic of Egypt passport8 that was seized by the referring IRCC (formerly CIC) office.\nIdentity\u2014Sexual Orientation\/Gender Identity and Expression (SOGIE)\n[12] The claimant has also established his identity as a gay man by way of his personal documentation, including but not limited to the following: text messages; letter of support from LGBTQ organization Bedaya; and various photographs depicting the claimant with his former partner XXXX and other LGBTQ activists.9\nCredibility\n[13] The panel has reviewed the claimant\u2019s Basis of Claim (BOC),10 intake forms,11 GCMS notes by the Cairo visa post officer,12 and the claimant-specific documents disclosed by counsel,13 and has found the claimant to be credible regarding the central elements in this case \u2013 namely that he is a gay man who has previously been harassed and persecuted, including having been physically assaulted by his father,14 on the basis of his sexual identity in Egypt.\n[14] In reviewing the National Documentation Package (NDP) for Egypt,15 the panel has found the claimant\u2019s personal evidence to be consistent with the objective country conditions documents before it. As such, the panel finds that the claimant has established, on a balance of probabilities, his profile as a gay man who has been targeted by homophobic individuals because of his sexual identity.\n[15] As sexual orientation falls within the membership of a particular social group category, and thus forms a basis for refugee claims, as per section 96 of IRPA, the test is whether there is a serious possibility of persecution should the claimant return to Egypt.\n[16] The panel finds, based on the evidence before it, that the claimant has met that test.\nState protection\n[17] In order to establish a claim pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA, the claimant must rebut the presumption of state protection. The claimant did not seek protection from the authorities, as the state itself is the agent of persecution in this particular case, through its discriminatory legal and judicial apparatus when interacting with LGBTQ persons in Egypt.\n[18] The panel has before it country conditions documentation indicating that, even though same-sex relationships between consenting adults are not illegal, \u201cthe Law on the Combating of Prostitution, and the law against debauchery have been used liberally to imprison gay men in recent years.\u201d16\n[19] The panel notes the following:\nPublic morality is recognised by international law as grounds for limiting expression \u2026 [and] individuals who, through their sexual or gender expression, disrupt conservative binary gender models are especially vulnerable in Egypt, according to an activist who was based in Egypt through recent years. Through 2015 and 2016, widely publicised arrests continue. \u2026\nAccording to 76 Crimes, the largest reported number of arrests of LGBT people has been in Egypt, where a crackdown has been under way since 2013 as part of a larger government effort to arrest and harass political opponents, human rights defenders and journalists. In late-2016, LGBT community leaders estimate that as many as 500 LGBT people have been sent to prison.17\n[20] Country documentation further states that\n[a]fter a coup resulted in a new government in late 2013, the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR) began documenting increased arrests and harassment of people perceived to be gay or transgender by the public morals police, with at least 77 arrests taking place between October 2013 and May 2014. Arrests continue at similar rates\u2014 many of them stemming from police efforts to entrap gay men by using social media.18 [citations omitted]\n[21] Country documentation confirms that LGBTQ persons continue to be targeted by Egyptian authorities through the state\u2019s penal and legal apparatus. The panel finds that the objective documentary evidence before it supports the claimant\u2019s allegations, and that he has provided clear and convincing evidence of the state\u2019s inability to protect him as a gay man. As such, the claimant has rebutted the presumption of state protection should he return to Egypt.\n[22] In noting that the state itself is the agent of persecution in this particular case, the panel also finds that there is not an area of the country where the claimant would be able to reside and safely participate in the community, and as such there is no internal flight alternative available to the claimant anywhere in Egypt.\n[23] Given the documentary evidence before the panel, both personal and objective, the panel finds that there is a serious possibility that the claimant could face persecution on the basis of his sexual orientation should he return to Egypt, and that state protection would not reasonably be forthcoming to him anywhere in the country.\nCONCLUSION\n[24] Based on the foregoing analysis, the panel has determined that the claimant has established that there is a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground as per section 96 of IRPA if he were to return to Egypt.\n[25] The panel therefore finds that the claimant is a Convention refugee and accepts the claim.\n(signed) M.

Moc\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Ameena Sultan\nCountry: Egypt\nRPD Number: TB8-28684\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2020-00518\nATIP Pages: 000741-000747\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] These are the reasons for the decision in the claim of Mr. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, who claims to be a citizen of Egypt and is seeking refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).1\nEXPEDITED DETERMINATION\n[2] Paragraph 170(f) of IRPA2 provides that the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) may allow a claim for refugee protection without a hearing, unless the Minister has notified the RPD of the Minister\u2019s intention to intervene within the time limit set out in the Refugee Protection Division Rules.3 Further, subsection 162(2) of IRPA4 directs each Division to deal with all proceedings before it as informally and quickly as the circumstances and the considerations of fairness and natural justice permit.\n[3] The claimant\u2019s case was identified as one that could be processed through the RPD\u2019s expedited process for Egyptian claims. The RPD received the claimant\u2019s signed Certificate of Readiness5 for the expedited process on February 1, 2019. Having carefully considered the evidence in this case, the panel finds that it meets the criteria for expedited determination.\n[4] This case has therefore been decided without a hearing, according to the Instructions governing the streaming of less complex claims at the Refugee Protection Division.6\nALLEGATIONS\n[5] The following is a summary of the claimant\u2019s allegations as outlined in the narrative to his Basis of Claim (BOC)7 form dated October 9, 2018.\n[6] The claimant is a 26-year-old resident of Cairo who fears for his life on the basis of his sexual identity as a gay man in Egypt. He recalls first coming to the realization of being attracted to boys rather than girls in middle school, and attempting to supress such feelings throughout high school. Following the events of the 2011 revolution, the claimant stopped attending mosque and no longer believed that homosexuality was a sin. In 2013, he joined Bedaya, an organization advocating for the rights of LGBTQ persons in Egypt.\n[7] The claimant was able to keep his sexual identity, including a long-term relationship with a live-in partner, secret for several years, until he was attacked by a group of neighbours in July 2017. When the police arrived, they arrested the claimant along with four of his friends, also members of the LGBTQ community, charging him with facilitating prostitution. While in detention, the claimant and his friends were abused and humiliated not only by the police, but also sexually assaulted and tortured by the inmates.\n[8] Even though the claimant was eventually cleared of the charges against him, his mental health had suffered as a result of the experience and the loss of his home and friends. He had unsuccessfully applied for visas to France and the Netherlands over 2017 and 2018 a number of times. The claimant was finally able to obtain a Canadian visa with the help of the Rainbow Railroad organization, and left Egypt on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018. He filed a claim for refugee protection inland on November 8, 2018 in Toronto.\n[9] The claimant fears persecution and harm at the hands of homophobic persons on the basis of his sexual identity in Egypt. He also alleges that the authorities are unable or unwilling to protect him, as a gay man, in Egypt.\nDETERMINATION\n[10] The panel finds that the claimant is a Convention refugee under section 96 of IRPA for the following reasons.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\u2014personal and national\n[11] The claimant\u2019s identity as a national of Egypt has been established, on a balance of probabilities, by a valid Arab Republic of Egypt passport8 that was seized by the referring IRCC (formerly CIC) office.\nIdentity\u2014Sexual Orientation\/Gender Identity and Expression (SOGIE)\n[12] The claimant has also established his identity as a gay man by way of his personal documentation, including but not limited to the following: Facebook profile and posts; letter of support from LGBTQ organization Bedaya; and various photographs depicting the claimant with his partner and other LGBTQ activists.9\nCredibility\n[13] The panel has reviewed the claimant\u2019s Basis of Claim (BOC),10 intake forms,11 GCMS notes by the Cairo visa post officer,12 and the claimant-specific documents disclosed by counsel,13 and has found the claimant to be credible regarding the central elements in this case \u2013 namely that he is a gay man who has previously been harassed and persecuted, including having faced fabricated criminal charges14 of which he was acquitted, on the basis of his sexual identity in Egypt.\n[14] In reviewing the National Documentation Package (NDP) for Egypt,15 the panel has found the claimant\u2019s personal evidence to be consistent with the objective country conditions documents before it. As such, the panel finds that the claimant has established, on a balance of probabilities, his profile as a gay man and LGBTQ rights activist who has been targeted by Egyptian officials and homophobic individuals because of his sexual identity.\n[15] As sexual orientation falls within the membership of a particular social group category, and thus forms a basis for refugee claims, as per section 96 of IRPA, the test is whether there is a serious possibility of persecution should the claimant return to Egypt.\n[16] The panel finds, based on the evidence before it, that the claimant has met that test.\nState protection\n[17] In order to establish a claim pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA, the claimant must rebut the presumption of state protection. The claimant did not seek protection from the authorities, as the state itself was the agent of persecution in this particular case, through its discriminatory legal and judicial apparatus when interacting with LGBTQ persons in Egypt.\n[18] The panel has before it country conditions documentation indicating that, even though same-sex relationships between consenting adults are not illegal, \u201cthe Law on the Combating of Prostitution, and the law against debauchery have been used liberally to imprison gay men in recent years.\u201d16\n[19] The panel notes the following:\nPublic morality is recognised by international law as grounds for limiting expression \u2026 [and] individuals who, through their sexual or gender expression, disrupt conservative binary gender models are especially vulnerable in Egypt, according to an activist who was based in Egypt through recent years.

All three claimants rely on the allegations as stated in the principal claimant\u2019s Basis of Claim, RPD file number TB8-26310.\nEXPEDITED DETERMINATION\n[3] Paragraph 170(f) of IRPA3 provides that the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) may allow a claim for refugee protection without a hearing, unless the Minister has notified the RPD of the Minister\u2019s intention to intervene within the time limit set out in the Refugee Protection Division Rules.4 Further, subsection 162(2) of IRPA5 directs each Division to deal with all proceedings before it as informally and quickly as the circumstances and the considerations of fairness and natural justice permit.\n[4] The claimant\u2019s case was identified as one that could be processed through the RPD\u2019s expedited process for Egyptian claims. The RPD received the claimant\u2019s signed Certificate of Readiness6 for the expedited process on January 29, 2019. Having carefully considered the evidence in this case, the panel finds that it meets the criteria for expedited determination. This case has therefore been decided without a hearing, according to the Instructions governing the streaming of less complex claims at the Refugee Protection Division.7\nALLEGATIONS\n[5] The following is a summary of the allegations as outlined in the narrative to the claimant\u2019s Basis of Claim (BOC)8 form dated October 11, 2018.\n[6] The claimant was born in Cairo- into a Muslim family. She had been married a total of three times. In around 2013, when her third husband insisted that they travel to Mecca for the pilgrimage, the claimant began to actively reject Islam. She started reading the Bible and watching Christian programs, and, in 2014 travelled to Italy to visit an old friend who had converted to Christianity. In Italy, the claimant attended church and took lessons to learn more about Christ, hoping to be baptized before returning to Egypt. In 2015, the claimant was unable to keep her new faith from her employer and colleagues, and quit her job as a result of the animosity. Suspicion of her conversion to Christianity spread, and she began to fear for the safety of her two sons, the minor claimants. The claimant\u2019s family members began to pressure her to undertake the pilgrimage, and the minor claimants feared that their father, the claimant\u2019s former spouse, might report her to the authorities for apostasy. The claimant realized that she could not practise her religion freely in Egypt. When she observed that her older son became interested in Christian teachings and expressed a wish to be baptized himself, the claimant made the decision to leave Egypt with her sons and seek safety abroad.\n[7] The claimants travelled from Egypt to Canada on previously obtained tourist visas and made their claims for refugee protection on October 18, 2018 at the port of entry in St. Catharines, Ontario.\n[8] The claimant fears persecution and harm at the hands of radical Islamists and state officials on the basis of religion in Egypt. She also alleges that the Egyptian authorities are unable or unwilling to protect her, and in tum her sons, as a convert from Islam to Christianity.\nDETERMINATION\n[9] The panel finds that the claimants are Convention refugees under section 96 of IRPA for the following reasons.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\u2014personal and national\n[10] The claimants\u2019 identities as nationals of Egypt have been established, on a balance of probabilities, by their Arab Republic of Egypt passports9 that were seized by the referring IRCC (formerly CIC) office.\nIdentity\u2014religious\n[11] The claimant has established her identity as a convert from Islam to Orthodox Christianity by way of the following personal documentation: her national identity card, birth, and divorce certificates, all of which indicate the holder\u2019s religion to be Islam10; and letters from churches in Italy, Egypt, and Canada11;baptism certificate from the Coptic Orthodox Patriarchate in Cairo12; and photographs depicting the claimant in church with her priest.13\nCredibility\n[12] The panel has reviewed the claimant\u2019s Basis of Claim (BOC),14 intake forms,15 and personal documentation disclosed,16 and has found the claimant to be credible regarding the central elements in this case \u2013 namely that she has converted from Islam to Orthodox Christianity and has actively practised her new faith as a Coptic Christian in Egypt and Canada since her official baptism ceremony, which took place on January 16, 201617 in Cairo.\n[13] In reviewing the National Documentation Package (NDP) for Egypt,18 the panel has found the claimant\u2019s personal evidence to be consistent with the objective country conditions documents before it. As such, the panel finds that the claimant has established, on a balance of probabilities, her profile as an Egyptian citizen who has converted from Islam to Christianity, and who faces a risk of persecution on the basis of religious identity.\n[14] As religion forms a basis for refugee claims, as per section 96 of IRPA, the test is whether there is a serious possibility of persecution should the claimants return to Egypt. The panel finds, based on the evidence before it, that the claimants have met that test.\nState protection\n[15] In order to establish a claim pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA, the claimant must rebut the presumption of state protection. The claimant did not seek police protection, as the representatives of the Egyptian state were themselves the agents of persecution in this particular case. The claimant feared her family members, including her mother, brothers, and former spouse, and tried to keep her new faith from state officials and everyone else around her. She came to believe that the police would not only fail to protect her and her children in Egypt, but would actively pursue her on charges of apostasy.\n[16] The panel has before it country conditions documentation indicating that\na convert to Christianity from Islam will have extreme difficulty dealing with officials and neighbours who have any idea of his or her decision \u2026 [and] Muslim converts to Christianity are regularly harassed by government officials who view their actions as a social offence against Islam tantamount to treason.19 [citations omitted]\n[17] Similarly, a spokesperson from the Coptic Orthodox Church of Canada stated that\nauthorities will attempt to dissuade someone from converting from Islam to Christianity and may arbitrarily imprison the person alongside \u201cdangerous criminals\u201d if they insist on converting. A report from Amnesty International (AI) states that under the country\u2019s emergency law, in force since the 1981 assassination of Egyptian president Anwar Sadat, there was a system of administrative detention allowing for the detention of individuals \u201cwithout charge or trial.\u201d The report indicates that such administrative detainees could include religious minorities, and \u201csometimes converts from Islam to Christianity.\u201d20 [citations omitted]\n[18] The panel also has before documentation indicating that Copts have complained of arise in kidnappings, armed robberies and assault following the ousting of former President Morsi.21 There are longstanding allegations that the authorities have failed to provide sufficient protection for the Coptic community, and that inadequate police response has created a climate of impunity:\nThe government frequently failed to prevent, investigate, or prosecute crimes targeting members of religious minority groups, which fostered a climate of impunity, according to a prominent local rights organization. The government often failed to protect Christians targeted by kidnappings and extortion according to sources in the Christian community, and there were reports that security and police officials sometimes failed to respond to these crimes, especially in Upper Egypt.22\n[19] Country documentation confirms that Christians continue to be targeted by Islamic militants, attacks against Copts take place throughout Egypt, and state authorities are slow to act.23 The panel finds that the objective documentary evidence before it supports the claimant\u2019s allegations, and that she has provided clear and convincing evidence of the state\u2019s inability to protect her as a Coptic Christian. As such, the claimant has rebutted the presumption of state protection should she return to Egypt. The panel also finds that there is not an area of the country where the claimant would be able to practise her religion freely and in safety.\n[20] Given the documentary evidence before the panel, both personal and objective, the panel finds that there is a serious possibility that the claimants could face persecution and harm at the hands of Muslim extremists, including state officials, should they return to Egypt. The panel further finds that state protection would not reasonably be forthcoming to the principal claimant as a convert from Islam and practising Orthodox Christian anywhere in the country, and that this lack of protection extends to her sons, the minor claimants, as well.\nCONCLUSION\n[21] Based on the foregoing analysis, the panel has determined that the claimants have established that there is a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground as per section 96 of IRPA if they were to return to Egypt.\n[22] The panel therefore finds that the claimants are Convention refugees and accepts the claims.\n(signed) M.

        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2019 RLLR 180\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: March 29, 2019\nPanel: Harvey Savage\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Raphael Vagliano\nCountry: Egypt\nRPD Number: TB8-25609\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2020-00518\nATIP Pages: 000705-000708\nREASONS FOR DECISION\nINTRODUCTION\n[1] These are the reasons for the decision in the claim of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, who claims to be a citizen of Egypt, and is claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[2] In rendering my reasons, I have considered and applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guidelines on Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution.\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] You allege the following: You allege that your husband belongs to a tribe in Egypt that conducts Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) on female children and female adults. Your husband\u2019s family has notified you that they wish to perform FGM on yourself and on your children when they reach four years of age. Your husband has told you that his family and tribe is very strong and that he is unable to prevent them from carrying this out. You also fear that as a politically liberal woman who has criticized the government in social media, you would face serious harm upon returning to Egypt. Just before you fled Egypt you insulted a military person seeking your husband and considered yourself fortunate that your name was not on a watch list as you exited the country.\nDETERMINATION\n[4] I find that you are a Convention refugee as you have established a serious possibility of persecution should you return to Egypt based on the grounds in section 96.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[5] I find that your identity as a national of Egypt is established by the documents provided: Passport.\nCredibility\n[6] Based on the documents in the file, I have noted no serious credibility issues. In particular, the evidence establishes the allegations as set out above. Your husband\u2019s letter that he is unable to oppose the strong pressure of his family and tribe to perform FGM on yourself and your daughters, and the letter from your wife\u2019s sister, from the same tribe, who underwent FGM. After reviewing the documents, I have no reasons to doubt their authenticity.\n[7] Based on the credibility of your allegations, and the documentary evidence set out below, I find that you have established a future risk that you will be subjected to the following harm: FGM complicated by your political history of dissent.\n[8] The fact that you face this risk is corroborated by the following documents: National Documentation Package for Egypt\u2014June 29, 2018, items 2.1, 4.3, 5.7, 5.6 and 5.7.\nRisk of harm\n[9] This harm clearly amounts persecution.\nState protection\n[l0] I find that adequate state protection would not be reasonably forthcoming in this particular case. The documentary evidence above cited demonstrates that police protection against FGM is often inadequate and inconsistent.\nInternal flight alternative\n[11] I have considered whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for you. I find that there are no other parts of the country, where you would not face a risk to your life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. I considered that your husband\u2019s tribe is strong and influential, that he is unable to prevent them from conducting this FGM ritual on you, and further that as a person who has demonstrated open dissent to the government, that there is no safe internal flight alternative for you in Egypt.\n[12] On the evidence before me, I find that it is not objectively reasonable, in all the circumstances, including those particular to you, for you to seek refuge in Egypt for the same reasons listed above.\nCONCLUSION\n[13] Based on the analysis above, I conclude that you are a Convention refugee. Accordingly, I accept your claim.\n(signed) HARVEY SAVAGE\nMarch 29, 2019\n",

        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2019 RLLR 179\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: January 30, 2019\nPanel: M. Moc\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): M. Mary Akhbari\nCountry: Egypt\nRPD Number: TB8-20690\nAssociated RPD Number(s): TB8-20691\nATIP Number: A-2020-00518\nATIP Pages: 000663-000669\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] These are the reasons for the decision in the claims of Ms. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (\u201cthe claimant\u201d) and Ms. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (\u201cthe associate claimant\u201d), who claim to be citizens of Egypt and are seeking refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).1\n[2] As the claimants are common-law partners, their claims were joined pursuant to Rule 55 of the Refugee Protection Division Rules.2 The principal file number on record is TBS-20690.\nEXPEDITED DETERMINATION\n[3] Paragraph 170(f) of IRPA3 provides that the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) may allow a claim for refugee protection without a hearing, unless the Minister has notified the RPD of the Minister\u2019s intention to intervene within the time limit set out in the Refugee Protection Division Rules.4 Further, subsection 162(2) of IRPA5 directs each Division to deal with all proceedings before it as informally and quickly as the circumstances and the considerations of fairness and natural justice permit.\n[4] The claimant\u2019s case was identified as one that could be processed through the RPD\u2019s expedited process for Egyptian claims. The RPD received the claimant\u2019s signed Certificate of Readiness6 for the expedited process on January 7, 2019. Having carefully considered the evidence in this case, the panel finds that it meets the criteria for expedited determination.\n[5] This case has therefore been decided without a hearing, according to the Policy on the Expedited Processing of Refugee Claims by the Refugee Protection Division.7\nALLEGATIONS\n[6] The following is a summary of the claimant\u2019s allegations as outlined in the narrative to her Basis of Claim (BOC)8 form dated July 19, 2018.\n[7] The claimants are a young female couple who fear for their life on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity in Egypt. The principal claimant describes growing up in Egypt and attending primary school in Saudi Arabia, and gradually coming to realize and understand her sexual orientation as a lesbian woman. In high school, the claimant began researching about the LGBTQ community online, and experienced her first romantic relationship with a classmate. In 2015, the claimant\u2019s parents discovered phone messages from her lesbian friends, and forcibly had her admitted to hospital for treatment of mental illness. Upon release, the claimant\u2019s daily activities continued to be monitored by her family. In October 2016, the claimant met her partner, the associate claimant, through social media, and the couple moved in together in September 2017.\n[8] The claimants observed the crackdown on the LGBTQ community by the Egyptian police, and attempted to secure travel visas to leave the country. As they moved from Cairo to Giza, they were at times stopped and questioned by the police, harassed by members of the public, and evicted from their apartment. Through Bedaya, an organization that assists LGBTQ individuals in Egypt, the claimants made contact with the Rainbow Railroad of Toronto, and attended interviews at the Canadian Embassy in Cairo. They left Egypt for Canada on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018, filing their claims for refugee protection inland on August 24, 2018 in Toronto.\n[9] The claimants fear persecution and harm at the hands of homophobic persons, including state officials, on the basis of their sexual orientation in Egypt. They also allege that the authorities are unable or unwilling to protect them, as lesbian women, in Egypt.\nDETERMINATION\n[10] The panel finds that the claimants are Convention refugees under section 96 of IRPA for the following reasons.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\u2014personal and national\n[11] The claimants\u2019 identities as nationals of Egypt have been established, on a balance of probabilities, by two valid Arab Republic of Egypt passports9 that were seized by the referring IRCC (formerly CIC) office.\nIdentity\u2014Sexual Orientation\/Gender Identity and Expression (SOGIE)\n[12] The claimants have also established their identities as lesbian women, including their personal identities as conjugal partners in a common-law relationship, by way of their extensive personal documentation, including but not limited to the following: supporting letters and correspondence addressed to the claimants from Rainbow Railroad and Bedaya; text messages between the claimants and their parents; rent receipts for the claimants\u2019 apartment in Egypt; and various photographs.10\nCredibility\n[13] The panel has reviewed the claimants\u2019 Basis of Claim (BOC),11 intake forms,12 GCMS notes by the Cairo visa post officer,13 and the claimant-specific documents disclosed by counsel,14 and has found the claimants to be credible regarding the central elements in this case \u2013 namely that they are lesbian women who have previously been harassed and persecuted on the basis of their sexual orientation in Egypt.\n[14] In reviewing the National Documentation Package (NDP) for Egypt,15 the panel has found the claimants\u2019 personal evidence to be consistent with the objective country conditions documents before it. As such, the panel finds that the claimants have established, on a balance of probabilities, their profile as lesbian women who have been targeted by Egyptian officials and homophobic individuals because of their sexual identity.\n[15] As gender identity falls within the membership of a particular social group category, and thus forms a basis for refugee claims, as per section 96 of IRPA, the test is whether there is a serious possibility of persecution should the claimants return to Egypt.\n[16] The panel finds, based on the evidence before it, that the claimants have met that test.\nState protection\n[17] In order to establish a claim pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA, the claimant must rebut the presumption of state protection. The claimants did not seek protection from the authorities, as the state itself was the agent of persecution in this particular case, through its discriminatory legal and judicial apparatus when interacting with LGBTQ persons in Egypt.\n[18] The panel has before it country conditions documentation indicating that, even though same-sex relationships between consenting adults are not illegal, \u201cthe Law on the Combating of Prostitution, and the law against debauchery have been used liberally to imprison gay men in recent years.\u201d16\n[19] The panel notes the following:\nPublic morality is recognised by international law as grounds for limiting expression \u2026 [and] individuals who, through their sexual or gender expression, disrupt conservative binary gender models are especially vulnerable in Egypt, according to an activist who was based in Egypt through recent years. Through 2015 and 2016, widely publicised arrests continue. \u2026\nAccording to 76 Crimes, the largest reported number of arrests of LGBT people has been in Egypt, where a crackdown has been under way since 2013 as part of a larger government effort to arrest and harass political opponents, human rights defenders and journalists. In late-2016, LGBT community leaders estimate that as many as 500 LGBT people have been sent to prison.17\n[20] Country documentation further states that\n[a]fter a coup resulted in a new government in late 2013, the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR) began documenting increased arrests and harassment of people perceived to be gay or transgender by the public morals police, with at least 77 arrests taking place between October 2013 and May 2014. Arrests continue at similar rates\u2014 many of them stemming from police efforts to entrap gay men by using social media.18 [citations omitted]\n[21] Country documentation confirms that LGBTQ persons continue to be targeted by Egyptian authorities through the state\u2019s penal and legal apparatus. The panel finds that the objective documentary evidence before it supports the claimants\u2019 allegations, and that they have provided clear and convincing evidence of the state\u2019s inability to protect them as lesbian women. As such, the claimants have rebutted the presumption of state protection should they return to Egypt.\n[22] In noting that the state itself is the agent of persecution in this particular case, the panel also finds that there is not an area of the country where the claimants would be able to reside and safely participate in the community, and as such there is no internal flight alternative available to the claimants anywhere in Egypt.\n[23] Given the documentary evidence before the panel, both personal and objective, the panel finds that there is a serious possibility that the claimants could face persecution on the basis of their sexual identity should they return to Egypt, and that state protection would not reasonably be forthcoming to them anywhere in the country.\nCONCLUSION\n[24] Based on the foregoing analysis, the panel has determined that the claimants have established that there is a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground as per section 96 of IRPA if they were to return to Egypt.\n[25] The panel therefore finds that the claimants are Convention refugees and accepts the claims.\n(signed) M.

She describes growing up in Mansoura, a small conservative city in northern Egypt. As an adolescent, the claimant was not clear about her sexual orientation, thinking that she might be gay, but over time came to realize that she was a transgender woman. In 2016, she began to take hormones in order to transition fully.\n[7] The claimant was harassed and bullied at university and transferred schools. One evening, she was stopped by the police, sexually assaulted, and her property taken and cell phone records examined. When she resisted, she was threatened with arrest and gang rape. The claimant began to receive calls from the police supervisor, demanding that she have sex with him or suffer the consequences. She was then evicted from her residence and rejected by her family when she sought their help. Through Bedeya, an organization that assists LGBTQ individuals in Egypt, the claimant made contact with the Rainbow Railroad of Toronto, and left Egypt for Canada on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018. She filed a claim for refugee protection inland on August 21, 2018 in Toronto.\n[8] The claimant fears persecution and harm at the hands of homophobic and transphobic persons on the basis of her gender identity in Egypt.

She describes growing up in a conservative family with an abusive father, and being bullied at school for acting feminine. When the claimant sought emotional support and disclosed her identity to her mother, she was ignored at first and then beaten severely. After graduation, the claimant found employment in XXXX, where she had to wear a man\u2019s uniform and internet with the public on a daily basis. She struggled in this job for one year before quitting, and was then subjected to further physical and psychological abuse by her parents. In September 2017, the claimant\u2019s two friends were arrested and detained for three months during a government crackdown against LGBTQ activists. The claimant feared arrest as well, and began the process of obtaining travel documentation in case she needed to flee Egypt.\n[7] In early 2018, the claimant made the decision to express her gender identity and present as a woman. She was forced to leave another position when she experienced abuse, transphobic messages, and sexual harassment. She also found out that men in the neighbourhood were planning to kill her. The claimant was able to obtain a Canadian visa with the help of the Rainbow Railroad organization, and left Egypt on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018. She filed a claim for refugee protection inland on August 20, 2018 in Toronto.\n\n[8] The claimant fears persecution and harm at the hands of homophobic and transphobic persons on the basis of her gender identity in Egypt. She also alleges that the authorities are unable or unwilling to protect her, as a transgender woman, in Egypt.\nDETERMINATION\n[9] The panel finds that the claimant is a Convention refugee under section 96 of IRPA for the following reasons.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\u2014personal and national\n[10] The claimant\u2019s identity as a national of Egypt has been established, on a balance of probabilities, by a valid Arab Republic of Egypt passport8 that was seized by the referring IRCC (formerly CIC) office.\nIdentity\u2014Sexual Identity\/Gender Identity and Expression (SOGIE)\n[11] The claimant has also established her identity as a transgender woman by way of her personal documentation, including but not limited to the following: text message log; Facebook profile and posts; affidavit from her lawyer in Egypt; and a psychiatric report.9\nCredibility\n[12] The panel has reviewed the claimant\u2019s Basis of Claim (BOC),10 intake forms,11 GCMS notes by the Cairo visa post officer,12 and the claimant-specific documents disclosed by counsel,13 and has found the claimant to be credible regarding the central elements in this case \u2013 namely that she is a transgender woman who has previously been harassed and persecuted on the basis of her gender identity in Egypt.\n[13] In reviewing the National Documentation Package (NDP) for Egypt,14 the panel has found the claimant\u2019s personal evidence to be consistent with the objective country conditions documents before it. As such, the panel finds that the claimant has established, on a balance of probabilities, her profile as a transgender woman who has been targeted by Egyptian officials and transphobic individuals because of her gender identity.\n[14] As gender identity falls within the membership of a particular social group category, and thus forms a basis for refugee claims, as per section 96 of IRPA, the test is whether there is a serious possibility of persecution should the claimant return to Egypt.\n[15] The panel finds, based on the evidence before it, that the claimant has met that test.\nState protection\n[16] In order to establish a claim pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA, the claimant must rebut the presumption of state protection. The claimant did not seek protection from the authorities, as the state itself was the agent of persecution in this particular case, through its discriminatory legal and judicial apparatus when interacting with LGBTQ persons in Egypt.\n[17] The panel has before it country conditions documentation indicating that, even though same-sex relationships between consenting adults are not illegal, \u201cthe Law on the Combating of Prostitution, and the law against debauchery have been used liberally to imprison gay men in recent years.\u201d15\n[18] The panel notes the following:\nPublic morality is recognised by international law as grounds for limiting expression \u2026 [and] individuals who, through their sexual or gender expression, disrupt conservative binary gender models are especially vulnerable in Egypt, according to an activist who was based in Egypt through recent years. Through 2015 and 2016, widely publicised arrests continue. \u2026\nAccording to 76 Crimes, the largest reported number of arrests of LGBT people has been in Egypt, where a crackdown has been under way since 2013 as part of a larger government effort to arrest and harass political opponents, human rights defenders and journalists. In late-2016, LGBT community leaders estimate that as many as 500 LGBT people have been sent to prison.16\n[19] Country documentation further states that\n[a]fter a coup resulted in a new government in late 2013, the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR) began documenting increased arrests and harassment of people perceived to be gay or transgender by the public morals police, with at least 77 arrests taking place between October 2013 and May 2014. Arrests continue at similar rates\u2014 many of them stemming from police efforts to entrap gay men by using social media.17 [citations omitted]\n[20] Country documentation confirms that LGBTQ persons continue to be targeted by Egyptian authorities through the state\u2019s penal and legal apparatus. The panel finds that the objective documentary evidence before it supports the claimant\u2019s allegations, and that she has provided clear and convincing evidence of the state\u2019s inability to protect her as a transgender woman. As such, the claimant has rebutted the presumption of state protection should she return to Egypt.\n[21] In noting that the state itself is the agent of persecution in this particular case, the panel also finds that there is not an area of the country where the claimant would be able to reside and safely participate in the community, and as such there is no internal flight alternative available to the claimant anywhere in Egypt.\n[22] Given the documentary evidence before the panel, both personal and objective, the panel finds that there is a serious possibility that the claimant could face persecution on the basis of her gender identity should she return to Egypt, and that state protection would not reasonably be forthcoming to her anywhere in the country.\nCONCLUSION\n[23] Based on the foregoing analysis, the panel has determined that the claimant has established that there is a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground as per section 96 of IRPA if she were to return to Egypt.\n[24] The panel therefore finds that the claimant is a Convention refugee and accepts the claim.\n(signed) M.

Maclean\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Deanna Karbasion\nCountry: Egypt\nRPD Number: TB8-05242\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2020-00518\nATIP Pages: 000625-000633\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] The claimant, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, seeks refugee protection under section 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).1\n[2] The claimant\u2019s allegations are set out most fully in her BOC and accompanying narrative statement which are summarized below.2\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] The claimant was born in XXXX 1965 in what was then considered the Jordanian annexed West Bank.\n[4] She has a university education \u2013 a XXXX XXXX XXXX. She married her first husband in 1988, and with him had four children born in 1989, 1992, 1997 and 2002. All the claimant\u2019s children reside in Canada. The claimant was divorced from her first husband in 2006. The claimant alleges that upon divorce, her married surname \u2018XXXX reverted to her maiden surname \u2018XXXX.\u2019\n[5] Following her divorce, the claimant met XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX living in Cairo, Egypt, on the internet through Yahoo Messenger. After communicating on a frequent basis, XXXX convinced her to relocate to Egypt with her children, which she did in XXXX 2006. The claimant established herself in Cairo and her children entered school. The claimant\u2019s eldest daughter had left home several years earlier, and eventually made her way to Canada via marriage. Over time, her remaining three children left for Canada under the sponsorship of their father, who had immigrated here in 2007. The claimant\u2019s last child immigrated to Canada in XXXX 2017.\n[6] The claimants married XXXX in August 2007, and she became an Egyptian citizen by marriage. The couple lived together sharing responsibilities and the claimant worked to have her professional qualifications recognized by the Egyptian Syndicate of Engineering Association. Successful in this endeavour, the claimant found work with a Cairo firm from January 2010 until March 2017.\n[7] In March 2017, the claimant\u2019s marriage to XXXX collapsed suddenly when she discovered that he was engaging in a same-sex relationship with a childhood friend XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX). The claimant immediately left home, and with her youngest son found rental accommodations elsewhere. The claimant made security arrangements with her new landlord.\n[8] The claimant almost immediately filed for divorce, which was granted on March 16, 2017. On April 1, 2017, the claimant started a new job with another firm in Cairo, which she had applied for prior to the collapse of her marriage. From March to December 2017, XXXX periodically telephoned the claimant seeking a solution to the questions he was receiving from family and friends about why his apparently stable marriage collapsed and was over so fast. XXXX went so far as asking the claimant to visit his parents, who she alleges were fond of her, to stop them from asking questions of him. The claimant declined the suggestion, which led to XXXX become more aggressive in his demands of her, going so far as suggesting that she accept the blame for the divorce. The claimant alleges that XXXX threatened to plant drugs on her and call the police if she did not cooperate. The claimant refused to accede to XXXX continuing demands.\n[9] The claimant alleges that because of societal attitudes towards same-sex relationships both XXXX and XXXX were at serious risk of social stigmatization, loss of employment or harm, even death, if their relationship was found out. She alleges that XXXX needed her not to tell anyone about his relationship with XXXX, a commitment she alleges she had given him at the time of the divorce. Fearing escalation of XXXX behavior, the claimant confided in her older children, who advised her to leave Egypt and with their help they explored exit options.\n[10] The claimant alleges that she could not return to Palestine, to which she had not returned since her departure in 2006. She alleges that she would need the permission of the Israelis in order to re-enter the West Bank, and suggests that the Israelis would be suspicious of her motives for returning after such a long absence. She claims that because of her family\u2019s history with the Israelis, she was at risk of detention upon return.\n[11] Furthermore, the claimant alleges that she could not come to Canada directly, as she had been denied visitor visas twice in 2016, and once at the beginning of 2017. The claimant applied for a United States (US) visitor visa in November 2017, which was received on January 25, 2018.\n[12] The claimant alleges that her feared escalated in January 2018, when in the middle of the month, she was approached in front of her place of employment by two thugs who told her that she should return XXXX telephone calls and do what he said. On January 31, 2018 she was again approached while on the way to work by the two previous thugs and a third who carried a knife. She alleges that she was threatened with an acid attack, being disappeared, or killed. After this second incident that claimant did not go to the police to file a report.\n[13] After making the arrangements to leave, the claimant departed Egypt on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018 flying to Buffalo via New York City, and from thence to the US\/Canada boarder, where she made her claim for refugee protection the following day.\nDETERMINATION\n[14] I find that the claimant is a person in need of protection. I accept her claim.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[15] On the basis of the claimant\u2019s testimony and certified true copy of her Egyptian passport,3 I am satisfied that the claimant is a citizen of Egypt. Canada does not recognize the state of Palestine, and accordingly, for the purposes of this matter, the claimant cannot be considered a citizen of the Palestinian Authority, and as such her identity as such is irrelevant.\nCredibility and Subjective Fear\n[16] In reaching my decision, I am guided by the IRB Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 4: Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution.4\n[17] I find the claimant to be credible. By her testimony and documentary disclosure, I find that she has established the core elements of her claim \u2013 that she is at risk of harm at the hands of XXXX. The claimant declared that the information provided in her BOCs is complete, true, and correct. The claimant\u2019s evidence is not internally inconsistent, inherently implausible, or contradicted by documentary evidence on country conditions in Egypt. In particular, I do not draw a negative inference on the claimant\u2019s failure to make an asylum claims in the US, and accept her explanation for her failure to do so. Simply put, having been denied Temporary Resident Visas for Canada, and in consideration that her entire family resides in Canada, the claimant sought an alternative means of coming here to reach safety.\n[18] In assessing the claimant\u2019s credibility, I reviewed her BOC,5 port of entry (POE) intake forms,6 and the claimant-specific documents disclosed by counsel, which included copies of: documents pertaining to her Egyptian marriage and divorce, her Egyptian Identity Card, education documents, Egyptian and Jordanian professional certification documents.7\nState Protection\n[19] This case is different than a domestic violence case, as the direct threat against the claimant occurred after she had divorced her husband and outside the context of the marriage. She is not threatened by XXXX because she is a woman per se but rather because she knows something which if revealed would place XXXX and his companion at considerable risk of harm themselves. Presumably, the threat from XXXX would be just the same if the claimant were a man who had knowledge of his sexual activities. That being said, it was in the context of the marriage that the demands were first made on XXXX to accept the blame for the failure of the marriage demands that continued after the divorce, and which then turned into direct threats of violence at the hands of third parties.\n[20] What turns this into a gender-based issue related to domestic violence is that the Egyptian authorities regard the threat against the claimant in the context of a family matter. It is the claimant\u2019s evidence that when she had previously approached the police of a matter of sexual harassment against her daughter, they had told her to deal with things from within the family.8 Thus, it was from the perspective that the threats made against her by her ex-husband would not be taken seriously, because she was a woman, that she did not seek the protection of the state.\n[21] The documentary evidence in the National Documentation Package (NDP) for Egypt, in respect of the police response to domestic violence and violence against women in general, would tend to bare out the claimant\u2019s concern. A report by the United Kingdom (UK) Home Office, in respect of the response of the police and courts in Egypt to violence against women, relates that:\n\u2018Civil society organizations reported police pressure not to pursue charges and fear of societal reprisal actively discouraged women from going to police stations to report crimes, resulting in a very small number of cases being investigated or effectively prosecuted. NGOs estimated the prevalence of rape was several times higher than the rate reported by the government.\u20199\n[22] The Home Office document further relates that:\n\u2018 \u2026currently very few women go ahead with legal complaints against their attackers or report attacks to the police. The problems of social stigma and lack of trust in the security forces mean that sexual violence in particular is unlikely to be reported to the police, including to the new Violence Against Women (VAW) unit. According to a 2013 study, 93.4 per cent of respondent survivors of sexual harassment said they did not request help from security forces at the scene of the incident. The most common reasons cited by survivors included: \u201cI feared for my reputation\u201d, \u201cI thought there was no text in the law to penalize harassment\u201d, and \u201cI was also scared from harassment by policemen.\u201d10\n[23] Other information in the NDP for Egypt reveals that violence against women is reported as being socially legitimized, it is surrounded by a culture of silence, largely imposed by the family. Moreover, according to Amnesty International, Egyptian law does not provide the victims with adequate protection.11 Protection mechanisms are very few, and are considered to be essentially ineffective. This is, in part, due to the existence of provisions within the Penal Code that excuse acts of violence that have been committed in good faith in accordance with Sharia Law; the requirements imposed on individual victims of assault to have to produce multiple witnesses. This is a very difficult condition to meet for female victims of violence, given the societal attitude toward women and violence, and the reported often dismissive or abusive attitude of officials who receive the complaints.\n[24] In that context, given also the reported reluctance of women to report violence because of shame, fear of retaliation against them and their children, and community pressure, violence against women virtually goes unpunished, allowing the offenders to act in almost total impunity. An Amnesty International Report from January 2015 relates that:\nThe inadequate and discriminatory legal and policy framework, coupled with the Egyptian authorities\u2019 failure to punish or address the underlying causes of violence against women and girls, has resulted in a culture of impunity in which sexual and gender-based violence against women and girls is pervasive. Such violence affects all aspects of their lives, in the family and the public sphere.12\n[25] Thus, there is a credible basis for the claimant\u2019s reluctance to seek state protection, and I find that, in these particular circumstances, it would not be forthcoming.\nInternal flight alternative\n[26] The claimant cannot live safely in Egypt. I asked the claimant why she could not go to live in Alexandria and be safe. She testified that she could not be safe anywhere in Egypt because she was a divorced woman, a Palestinian, and because XXXX had the means and resources to find her. The claimant\u2019s evidence is that after she had left XXXX, she sought out a new job, and that after having started at this new job she witnessed XXXX sitting in his automobile watching her as she left her place of employment. She testified that XXXX, who has connections with Egyptian immigration authorities in the context of his job as a travel agent, would know if and when she returned to Egypt.\n[27] I consider that, even now, the claimant continue to pose a threat to XXXX in that it is available to her to inform on him. He has demonstrated his intention in the past, and it is reasonable to assume that he remains highly motivated to prevent his secret from becoming public. Therefore, it is more likely than not, that if she returned to Egypt, he would try to silence her as a way of preserving his own safety.\n[28] I also consider that as a divorced woman, with no immediate means of financial support, and no man to protect her, the claimant would be targeted by those who adhere faithfully to the Islamic beliefs in respect of women and their societal role. The claimant is demonstrably westernized; she dresses as a Westerner, does not wear the veil, and as an engineer she has lived and worked outside the usual social norms that constrain many women in Arab countries. I have considered the Response to Information Request (RIR) entitled Egypt: Treatment of women who do not conform to Muslim practices and traditions, including wearing a veil (head covering), in rural and urban areas; state protection available to victims of mistreatment,13 and find that my conclusion with respect to the societal treatment of women in Egypt are justified.\n[29] Thus, whether in respect of the threat posed by XXXX, or the threat posed by Egyptian society, I find that the claimant would be at risk of serious human rights violations and persecution in all parts of the country.\nCONCLUSION\n[30] While this case does not fit squarely as a domestic violence claim, it originated from within the context of a marriage, and the agent of harm is the claimant\u2019s ex-husband. Consequently, I have analyzed the risk faced by the claimant from the perspective of domestic violence, but more broadly as violence against women in Egypt in general.\n[31] I am satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that there is a strong basis for the claimant\u2019s subjective fear of harm, and that the objective evidence supports a conclusion that her fears are well-founded, that state protection would not be forthcoming, and that, in her particular circumstances, she has no safe place to live in Egypt.\n[32] I therefore find that she is a person in need of protection pursuant to section 97(1)(b) of IRPA, and I accept her claim.\n(signed) KENNETH D.

The Minister submitted that the claimants were permanent residents of Italy and that the claimants were, therefore, excluded.\n[4] The application of Article 1E to this case was dealt with on a preliminary basis. I have determined below that Article 1E does not apply to the present case.\n[5] The claims have been decided without a hearing, according to the IRB\u2019s Chairperson\u2019s Instructions Governing the Streaming of Less Complex Claims at the Refugee Protection Division and paragraph 170(f) of the Act.\nARTICLE 1E\n[6] I will summarize the evidence material to the question of whether Article 1E is applicable in this instance. XXXX and XXXX claim to be Egyptian citizens who moved to Italy in 1996, and 1997, respectively, and lived in the country for over fifteen years. Their children were all born in Italy. XXXX and his family were granted permanent residence status in Italy in 2003, when they obtained \u201cCarta di Soggiorno\u201c.\n[7] XXXX and his family left Italy in 2012, to return to Egypt. Since XXXX and his family have not resided in Italy and have not resided in the EU, with the exception of XXXX who went there for a six-month visit.\nAssessment of the Issue\n[8] Article 1E of the Refugee Convention reads:\nThis Convention shall not apply to a person who is recognized by the competent authorities of the country in which he has taken residence as having the rights and obligations which are attached to the possession of nationality in that country.\n[9] That article is reflected in section 98 of IRPA: \u201cA person referred to in section E or F article 1 of the Refugee Convention is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection.\u201d\n[10] In the Zeng decision, the Federal Court of Appeal set out the test to be applied in article 1E exclusions. The Court stated, \u201cConsidering all relevant factors to the date of the hearing, does the claimant have status, substantially similar to that of its nationals, in the third country? If the answer is yes, the claimant is excluded.\u201d1\n[11] In the present case, the PC indicated that he and his family were granted permanent residence status in Italy in 2003, when they obtained Carta di Soggioro\u201d. I accept the PC\u2019s testimony that he and his family enjoyed rights in Italy as permanent residents that were substantially similar to those enjoyed by Italian nationals. Specifically, the PC testified that his children were able to go to school, that his family members had access to health care and other social services, the adults were able to seek and obtain employment, and the family had, demonstrably, been able to travel freely in and out of Italy, including to Egypt. These hallmarks of status substantially similar to nationals are directly in line with the four criteria outlined in the Federal Court\u2019s decision of Shamlou,2 namely, the right to return to the country of residence, the right to work freely without restrictions, the right to study and full access to social services in the country of residence.\n[12] While it is clear that the claimants have long resided in Italy, and actually held and enjoyed status there substantially similar to Italian nationals, the question is whether on the date of the hearing, the claimants still held this status.\n[13] According to the Response to Information Request3 a permanent resident of Italy will lose his status in the following cases:\n\nit has been acquired fraudulently;the state has ordered an expulsion measure against an applicant;the applicant no longer meets the requirements of the permit;the applicant has been absent from EU territory for 12 consecutive months;the applicant has acquired long-term resident status in another European Union member State\u201d;the applicant has been absent from Italy for more than 6 years.[14] Counsel for the claimants provided a legal opinion by Sara Riboldi,4 a lawyer who is a Member of the Ontario Bar and a member of the Italian Bar of Milan in Italy, with offices in Toronto and Milan. She regularly advises Italian government institutions on matters involving Italy and Canada and, on a regular basis, advises individuals on citizenship and immigration issues in relation to Italian law. I found her opinion to be clear and persuasive.\n[15] It is clear from the evidence that the claimants have been absent from EU territory for more than 12 months. Ms. Riboldi writes:\nAs explained above, subsection 7 of Article 9 of Law 286\/1998 referred to provides revocation of a long-term residence permit on the grounds of the holder leaving the EU for the period of 12 consecutive months. Specifically, the Italian version of Law 286\/1998 states that the Permit \u201c\u00e8 revocato in caso di assenza dal territorio dell\u2019Unione per un period di dodici mesi consecutive\u201d translated as \u201cis\u201d revoked if the holder leaves the EU for the period of 12 consecutive months. Therefore by operation of law the long-term permit is revoked when any conditions listed under Subsection 7 of the Law 286\/ 1998 is found. Some police websites erroneously mention that the long-term permit \u201ccan\u201d be revoked if someone leaves EU for more than 1 year. Please note that this is not the tenor of the law, which states that a Permit \u201cis\u201d revoked if the person leaves the EU for more than one year.\n[16] Ms. Riboldi continues:\nIf XXXX and his family were to return to Italy and truthfully disclose that they left the country in 2012 and did not return by the end of 2013, the Italian immigration authorities will immediately conduct an investigation, which will result in a legal decision concerning whether they have forsaken their long-term permanent resident status there. NP When faced with the prospect of revocation, the holder of the permit can argue that the period of 12 consecutive months did not run in his\/her case because he\/she encountered exceptional circumstances that did not allow him or her to return to the EU within the prescribed time. The burden of proof is on the holder of the permit to show the \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d. To reverse the revocation of a long-term residence permit, he would need to prove the existence of grave circumstances that would justify setting aside the revocation set by the law of the permit. The only exceptional circumstances considered in Italian case law on whether the 12 consecutive months did not run in a specific case are military reasons or very serious health issues. It is my understanding that neither of these justifications prevented XXXX and his family from returning to live in Italy. NP In sum, it is clear that: 1) XXXX and his family will not be issued a re-entry visa because they are no longer entitled to their Carta di Soggiorno; 2) because they cannot obtain valid documents they will be unable tore-enter Italy; 3) and because they have not been living in in Italy since 2012 and were absent from the EU for a period longer than 12 months, starting from 2012, it will be determined that they have lost their long-term permanent resident status.\n[17] Returning to Zeng, \u201cConsidering all relevant factors to the date of the hearing, does the claimant have status, substantially similar to that of its nationals, in the third country? If the answer is yes, the claimant is excluded.\u201d In this particular case the answer is clearly no. In my view, the claimants do not have status \u201csubstantially similar to nationals of Italy\u201d. They no longer have the right to work freely without restrictions, the right to study and the right to access to social services and most importantly they have no right to return.\n[18] I conclude that Article 1E does not apply to the present case.\nTHE CLAIMS\nAllegations\n[19] The allegations are fully set out in the narrative of the PC\u2019s BOC as expanded on in the narrative of his eldest son\u2019s BOC. In short, the PC was not reluctant to continue to express his support for President Morsi who was democratically elected but forced from office by the army and replaced by President Sisi. He would discuss his views with friends and family and post his views on social media. His home was raided by Internal Security who searched his home, took his laptop and forcibly removed him while blind-folded to an unknown location where he was roped to a chair, accused of being a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, and aggressively interrogated until the following day. Two months later, he was summoned to the police station. He learned through his lawyer that the police had started an investigation against him based on a business competitor\u2019s accusation that he was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood and a supporter of Morsi. His lawyer advised him not to report to the police and leave the country.\nDetermination\n[20] For the following reasons, I find that the claimants are Convention refugees.\nAnalysis\nIdentity\n[21] Certified true copies of the claimants\u2019 current Egyptian passports were included in the referral. This is sufficient to establish the claimants\u2019 personal identities as nationals of Egypt.\nNexus\n[22] I find that a nexus to section 96 has been established by reason of political opinion in the case of the PC, and membership in a particular social group, namely, family members of a political dissident, in the case of the PC\u2019s wife and children.\nCredibility\n[23] Regarding the credibility of the claimants, I have reviewed the claimants\u2019 BOCs, the claimants\u2019 intake forms, the personal documentation provided in support of the claim, as well as their country condition documentation. I have also reviewed country condition documentation contained in the National Documentation Package (NDP) for Egypt (June 29, 2018). The claimants\u2019 evidence is not internally inconsistent, inherently implausible, or contradicted by documentary evidence. Furthermore, the allegations are corroborated by personal documents that I do not have sufficient reason to discount, including a Notice to Appear from Sharqia police to the PC, and a copy of a police complaint against the PC accusing him of being a member of the Muslim Brotherhood.\nObjective basis of future risk\n[24] Based on the credibility of the allegations and the documentary evidence, I find that claimants face a future risk of detention, physical abuse and torture at the hands of the Egyptian authorities owing to the PC\u2019s support of Morsi and the perception that he is a member of the Muslim Brotherhood.\n[25] The documentary evidence5 before me on country conditions confirms that the government of Egypt severely represses and persecutes political opposition by means of arrest, long term detention, unfair mass trials, life sentencing and death sentencing, physical abuse, torture and disappearances. I am, therefore, satisfied that the claimants face a serious risk of serious human rights abuse by Egyptian security forces and the courts.\nNature of Harm\n[26] In my view, the harm the claimants face if they were to return to Egypt amounts to persecution.\nState protection\n[27] As the agent of persecution is Egyptian governmental authorities, I find it would be objectively unreasonable for the claimants to seek the protection of the Egyptian government in light of the claimants\u2019 particular circumstances.\nInternal flight alternative\n[28] On the evidence before me, I find that there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout Egypt, given the objective evidence that the authorities operate similarly throughout the country. Therefore, viable internal flight alternatives are not available to these claimants.\nCONCLUSION\n[29] Based on the analysis above, I conclude that the claimants are Convention refugees. Accordingly, I accept their claims.\n(signed) KEITH BRENNENSTUHL\nJune 20, 2019\n1 Zeng, Guanqiu v. M.C.I. (F.C.A., no. A-275-09), No\u00ebl, Layden-Stevenson, Stratas, May 10, 2010, 2010 FCA 118.

Eisenberg\nCountry: Egypt\nRPD Number: TB7-17225\nAssociated RPD Number(s): TB7-17236, TB7-17256, TB7-17260, TB7-17261\nATIP Number: A-2020-00518\nATIP Pages: 000536-000549\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] These reasons and decision are in regards to the claims for protection made by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (principal claimant), XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (adult female claimant), XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (elder minor male claimant), XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (younger minor male claimant), and XXXX XXXX XXXX (minor female claimant).\n[2] Each is claiming protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.1 The panel heard the claims jointly, pursuant to Refugee Protection Division Rule 55.2\n[3] The principal claimant was the designated representative for all three minor claimants.\nALLEGATIONS\n[4] The claims of the two adult claimants and the two minor male claimants are each against Egypt. The claim of the minor female claimant is against the United States of America.\n[5] The principal claimant\u2019s full allegations are set out in his Basis of Claim Form and related narrative,3 including its amendments,4 and addendum.5 The adult female claimant and the three minor claimants each rely on the narrative of the principal claimant.\n[6] The principal claimant joined the Nour Alhag (Light of Right) Association during his studies at XXXX XXXX XXXX in Cairo. After graduating university in 1991, he continued to oppose the corruption and nepotism that existed under the former regime of Hosni Mubarak. The principal claimant was harassed by the security and intelligence services in Egypt, until he relocated to Saudi Arabia in 1993.\n[7] The adult female claimant also attended XXXX XXXX XXXX, where she was a women\u2019s rights activist, especially concerning ending violence against women, ending early marriage, and ending Female Genital Mutilation practices. The adult female claimant was the victim of Female Genital Mutilation, and she fears that physical or psychological trauma might be inflicted on her daughter (the minor female claimant) in places with high Female Genital Mutilation prevalence rates, such as Egypt (including Aswan).\n[8] In Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, the principal claimant participated in the Kifaya (Enough) movement between 2004 and 2010. Upon a return to Egypt in 2007, he was subjected to harsh interrogation from security intelligence, based on his participation with Kifaya in Riyadh.\n[9] The adult claimants and the two minor male claimants returned to Egypt in XXXX 2011, where they participated in the Tahrir Square protests against Hosni Mubarak. The claimants returned Saudi Arabia the following month.\n[10] The principal claimant joined the Freedom and Justice Party in Riyadh, after the political party was founded in June 2011. During the election campaign, the claimant promoted the Freedom and Justice Party within the Egypt diaspora community. When President Mohamed Morsi was removed from office by General Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, the adult claimants and the two minor male claimants returned to Egypt in XXXX 2013, to protest the removal of the democratically-elected president, in Cairo\u2019s Rabaa Square.\n[11] The principal claimant was arrested and detained between July 7, 2013 and July 9, 2013. During his two-day detention, he was physically mistreated and accused of supporting the Muslim Brotherhood (based on his presence in Rabaa Square). The claimants departed Egypt for Saudi Arabia on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2013.\n[12] Between XXXX XXXX, 2016 and XXXX XXXX XXXX 2017, the principal claimant returned to Egypt on three occasions, in order to fight the appropriation of fifteen acres of his land, by the government of Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. The principal claimant eventually lost his appropriation appeal. The principal claimant was terminated from his Saudi Arabia employment in March 2017, a few weeks before he lost his land appropriation appeal in Egypt.\n[13] The adult claimants made arrangements to visit their elderly parents in Egypt, between XXXX XXXX, 2017 and XXXX XXXX, 2017. After the seven-day visit, the claimants travelled to Canada, and made a claim for protection in September 2017.\n[14] Based on the nature of the claim made by the minor female claimant (Female Genital Mutilation), the panel carefully considered the contents of Chairperson \u2018s Guideline 4 \u2013 Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution,6 both during the hearing and while rendering the decision.\nDETERMINATION\n[15] The panel finds that the principal claimant and the adult female claimant are both Convention refugees, pursuant to section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, based on their anti-government political opinion.\n[16] The panel finds that the elder minor male claimant and the younger minor male are each Convention refugees, pursuant to section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, based on their membership in a particular social group, namely family members of the adult claimants (who face a serious possibility of persecution in Egypt).\n[17] Despite the above, the panel finds that minor female claimant is not a Convention refugee, nor is she a person in need of protection, pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nANALYSIS FOR THE MINOR FEMALE CLAIMANT\nIdentity\n[18] The panel finds that the minor female claimant has established her identity as a national of the United States of America, based on a balance of probabilities. The minor female claimant presented a valid passport from the United States of America.7 The panel finds no reason to doubt the authenticity of this document.\n[19] The Basis of Claim Form narrative of the principal claimant referenced the high prevalence rate of Female Genital Mutilation practices in Egypt.8\n[20] Despite this, the panel notes that there was no narrative mention of any alleged risks of harm to the minor female claimant in the United States of America (including Female Genital Mutilation).\n[21] At the hearing, the principal claimant testified that his daughter (the minor female claimant) does not face a risk of harm in the United States of America. Similarly, the adult female claimant testified that her daughter (the minor female claimant) does not face a risk of harm in the United States of America.\n[22] The panel carefully considered the contents of the Basis of Claim Form for the minor female claimant,9 as well as the Basis of Claim Form or narrative of each of her family members,10 the written submissions of the five claimants, and the testimony of the two adult claimants. The panel finds that no claim against the United States of America was forwarded on behalf of the minor female claimant.\n[23] As such, the panel finds that the minor female claimant is not a Convention refugee, nor is she a person in need of protection, pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, as the minor female claimant does not face a serious possibility of persecution in the United States of America, and because her removal to that country would not subject her personally, on a balance of probabilities, to a risk to her life, a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or to a danger of torture.\n[24] The claim of the minor female claimant therefore fails.\nANALYSIS FOR THE THREE MALE CLAIMANTS AND THE ADULT FEMALE CLAIMANT\nIdentity\n[25] The panel finds that the principal claimant, the adult female claimant, and the two minor male claimants have each established their identity as nationals of Egypt, based on a balance of probabilities. They each presented their valid Arab Republic of Egypt passports.11 The panel finds no reason to doubt the authenticity of any of these four documents.\nCredibility\n[26] The panel finds that the principal claimant and the adult female claimant each testified in a straightforward and consistent manner, without the use of embellishments or contradictions.\n[27] The panel finds that the principal claimant was able to coherently describe in his testimony his opinions about the former regime of Hosni Mubarak,12 and how those opinion began to form when he entered university in 1987. He further testified about his affiliation with the Nour Alhag in university, including how he wrote articles that were published in The Wall journal. The panel also finds that the principal claimant was able to clearly articulate his ex-patriot involvement during his residency in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, after he departed Egypt in 1993.\n[28] In contrast, the adult female claimant testified that she was not politically involved in Egypt.\nCorroborating Documents\n[29] To corroborate his opposition to the al-Sisi regime in Egypt, the principal claimant presented an August 20, 2017 letter of support signed by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX,13 an August 5, 2017 letter of support14 and a September 15, 2017 letter of support15 (each signed by XXXX XXXX XXXX), a March 26, 2019 letter signed by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX,16 an undated letter signed by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX,17 as well as three protest photographs and a social media post.18\nProfiles of the Adult Female Claimant and the Minor Male Claimants\n[30] The adult female claimant testified that she and her two sons would be arrested in Egypt, simply because her husband is a member of the Freedom and Justice Party. She further testified that her husband\u2019s opposition to the current president of Egypt would lead to physical mistreatment (in custody) for the minor male claimants.\n[31] The principal claimant testified that his family all participated in demonstrations during their time in Canada. The protest rallies took place on February 22, 2019 and March 16, 2019.19\n[32] Amnesty International reports that there is a pattern of abuse by state agents in Egypt that became particularly evident since March 2015. The abuse includes arbitrary arrests, arbitrary detention, and enforced disappearances. Those subjected to enforced disappearances by the National Security Agency were perceived supporters of Mohamed Morsi or the Muslim Brotherhood. The victims were mostly males, ranging in age from fourteen-year-old boys to adult men in their fifties, and included students, academics and other activists, peaceful critics and protesters, and family members of government critics.20\n[33] Based on the above considerations, that panel finds that the country condition evidence points to the authorities in Egypt having some interest in the adult female claimant and the two minor male claimants, based on their political opinion against the president of Egypt.\nSubjective Fear Considerations\nNo Claim for Asylum in the United States of America\n[34] Some of the presented written evidence pointed to actions of the claimants, particularly the adult claimants, which did not seem to match the expected actions of a person who alleges fear of a return to their country of citizenship. All of the panel\u2019s concerns were put to at least one of the adult claimants at the hearing.\n[35] The panel notes that the adult claimants and the minor male claimants did not make a claim for asylum in the United States of America, despite having opportunities to do so after the arrest of the principal claimant in July 2013.\n[36] According to an entry stamp in his presented Egypt passport, the principal claimant was granted entry into the United States of America on XXXX XXXX, 2016.21 The principal claimant testified that his visits to the United States of America were both for business and pleasure, and that his wife had accompanied him on the trips for business purposes. The adult female claimant confirmed in her own testimony that she never resided in a different country from the principal claimant since they were married.\n[37] When the lack of a claim for asylum in the United States of America was put to the adult female claimant at the hearing, she testified that she and her husband regarded their lifestyle in Saudi Arabia to be affluent, that the principal claimant occupied a prestigious post for his employment, and that Saudi Arabia was relatively safe for them.\n[38] The claimants presented the Saudi Arabia employment termination letter for the principal claimant. It confirmed that he was informed of the termination on February 9, 2017,22 subsequent to the last known entry of the claimants into the United States of America. The panel accepts the explanations provided within the testimony of the adult female claimant regarding their lack of claims for protection in the United States of America. As such, the panel does not draw a negative credibility inference.\nDecision to Return to Egypt in XXXX 2017\n[39] The panel put to the principal claimant that all members of his family had visas to enter the United States of America, or in the case of the minor female claimant citizenship in the United States of America, when they departed Saudi Arabia for Egypt on XXXX XXXX, 2017. The panel would have expected persons fearful of a return to Egypt to have taken the opportunity to travel to the United States of America, as an alternative to returning to a risk of harm in Egypt.\n[40] The principal claimant testified that he simply wanted an opportunity to visit his family on one more occasion, as he feared that he would never see them again.\n[41] The claimants presented a September 15, 2017 letter signed by a member of the expatriate directorate of the Freedom and Justice Party in Cairo.23 XXXX XXXX XXXX confirmed that the principal claimant had been in contact with him in the two months leading up to his final trip to Egypt, and that XXXX XXXX XXXX assisted the claimants to return temporarily to Egypt for the purpose of a farewell to his ailing parents.\n[42] The panel accepts the principal claimant\u2019s explanation in his testimony about the reasons for his visit to Egypt between XXXX XXXX, 2017 and XXXX XXXX, 2017. As such, the panel does not draw a negative credibility inference.\nObjective Basis of the Claims\n[43] The overall objective evidence supports the claims for Convention refugee protection put forth by the principal claimant and the adult female claimant, based on their anti-government political opinion.\nPolitical Opposition in Egypt\n[44] The passing of the Protest Law in November 2013 has severely restricted the ability of citizens to protest peacefully against the state. The Protest Law was introduced amid a tense political environment characterised by recurrent protests.24 Serious political opposition is virtually nonexistent, as both liberal and Islamist activists face criminal prosecution and imprisonment.25\n[45] There were reports of physical assaults on members of political opposition movements.26 Arrests, harsh prison terms, death sentences, and extrajudicial violence targeting the political opposition have been common in recent years.27\n[46] Former president Mohamed Morsi was a leading Muslim Brotherhood member before his election in June 2012.28 The Freedom and Justice Party is as such considered the political wing of the Muslim Brotherhood.29 In August 2014, the administrative court system in Egypt revoked the license of the Freedom and Justice Party, and mandated its dissolution.30\n[47] The Freedom and Justice Party remains banned in Egypt. Authorities have not banned other Islamist parties.31\nInterest of the Authorities in the Two Adult Claimants\n[48] The panel carefully considered the testimony and the written evidence related to the adult claimant\u2019s promotion of the Freedom and Justice Party in Saudi Arabia, as well as his involvement in the Rabaa Square protests. The claimant presented Basis of Claim Form narrative statements which indicated that he promoted the Freedom and Justice Party in Riyadh after it was founded in June 2011, until the June 2012 elections.32\n[49] The two presented letters of support signed by XXXX XXXX XXXX33 indicate that the principal claimant was an active member of the Freedom and Justice Party in Riyadh, and that his duties included creating a wide front with the goal of ending the regime of Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, along with marketing slogans of the Freedom and Justice Party.\n[50] In regards to participation in Egypt, the claimant presented narrative statements which indicated that he and his family returned to Egypt in July 2013 to participate in the Rabaa Square protests. Immediately after his July 9, 2013 release from detention, the principal claimant evacuated his family from Rabaa Square, as instructed by his release conditions.34\n[51] The panel elicited testimony from the principal claimant related to his July 7, 2013 arrest, and subsequent two-day detention, in Cairo. The principal claimant testified that he was subjected to physical assaults in custody, and that he was asked if he was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood. The principal claimant testified that the authorities were trying to make the connection based on is political history file,35 as well as his attendance at the Rabaa Square protests. The claimant was released after two days, under the sole condition that he remove himself (and his family) from the Rabaa Square protests.\n[52] The panel notes that peaceful demonstrators and bystanders may be subject to questioning, detention, arrest, and conviction for participating in or being in proximity to unauthorized demonstrations in Egypt.36\n[53] The panel finds that, on a balance of probabilities, the actions of the principal claimant and the adult female claimant, in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Canada have drawn the attention of the authorities in Egypt. This is in consideration of the evidence of their public support for the opposition to government of Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.\n[54] As such, the panel finds that the principal claimant, the adult female claimant, and the two minor male claimants have each established a well-founded fear of returning to Egypt.\nState Protection for the Adult Claimants and the Minor Male Claimants\n[55] The two adult claimants and the two minor male claimants each fear the authorities of Egypt.\nRisk of Harm from the Authorities\n[56] President al-Sisi\u2019s government maintained its zero-tolerance policy towards dissent, introducing repressive legislation, notably a Non-Governmental Organization law that may end independent associations, reinstating a state of emergency and continuing near-absolute impunity for abuses by security forces under the pretext of fighting terrorism.37\n[57] Protesters have been subjected to various kinds of state-sponsored violence in Egypt, including long provisional detention.38 The Interior Ministry\u2019s regular police and its National Security Agency have used widespread arbitrary arrests, enforced disappearances, and torture against perceived dissidents.39\n[58] The panel finds it unreasonable to expect either adult claimant or either minor male claimant to seek redress or protection from the police or any other authorities in Egypt. The panel finds that adequate state protection would not be forthcoming for the principal claimant, the adult female claimant, or the two minor male claimants, in their respective particular set of circumstances.\n[59] For clarification, the panel finds that the authorities would on a balance of probabilities, be the primary agents of persecution for the two adult claimants and the two minor male claimants. The panel finds that the documentary evidence is both clear and convincing, and that it rebuts the presumption of adequate state protection for the two adult claimants and the two minor male claimants in Egypt.\nInternal Flight Alternatives for the Adult Claimants and the Minor Male Claimants\n[60] The state, and its National Security Agency, have national reach.\n[61] As a result of the above-referenced country condition documentation from the National Documentation Package, the panel finds that a viable internal flight alternative does not exist for the two adult claimants or the two minor male claimants in any place in Egypt, as the state and its National Security Agency are their agents of persecution.\n[62] The panel finds that the two adult claimants and the two minor male claimants each have a well-founded fear of persecution throughout Egypt, and that there is no viable internal flight alternative for any of them.\nCONCLUSION\n[63] The panel finds that there is a serious possibility that the principal claimant, the adult female claimant, and the two minor male claimants each face persecution in Egypt. The panel concludes that they are each Convention refugees, based on their anti-government political opinion, pursuant to section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[64] The panel therefore accepts the claims of the principal claimant, the adult female claimant, and the two minor male claimants.\n[65] Having considered the totality of the evidence, the panel finds that the minor female claimant is not a Convention refugee, nor is she a person in need of protection, pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, as the minor female claimant does not face a serious possibility of persecution, and because her removal to her country of citizenship would not subject her personally, on a balance of probabilities, to a risk to her life, to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or to a danger of torture.\n[66] The claim for protection made by the minor female claimant therefore fails.\n(signed) C.

Okay, I am going to give a decision now and in the interpreter will be doing this simultaneously, thank you.\n[2] This is the decision in the claims with respect to the following XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and the principal file is TB7-17112.\n[3] This decision is being rendered orally today and a written form of these reasons may be edited for spelling, syntax, grammar, references to the applicable case law and legislation and Exhibits may also be included.\n[4] First of all I would like to say that the designated representative in this case for the three minor children has been the principal male claimant Mr. XXXX and I have also taken into consideration in this case the Chairperson\u2019 s Guideline 4 before the IRB and that is with respect to the issue of gender-related claims.\n[5] Having said that the nexus in this case has been that of a membership in a particular social group under the issue of gender with respect to the two female claimants and for the entire family with the exception of the youngest child, well it is actually for the whole family, but then my decision for the youngest child will be different than it is for the rest of the family.\n[6] But the nexus for the whole family is with the issue of religion or being non-conformist to the extremist views of Islamic views of some in the country that are considered extremists, but nonetheless carry some weight, sometimes even with the government.\n[7] The allegations in this case have been and are found in the Basis of Claim Forms of the claimants, but they rely primarily on that of the principal claimant Mr. XXXX and these are that even though the family was living well and he was successful in his employment as a XXXX XXXX with the XXXX XXXX, everything was going well and the family had not had problems until 2017 when several threats were left in writing over a period of a few months, were left on the car of the female adult claimant.\n[8] And basically these threats made it very clear that her non-conformity to that she was only wearing a hijab, but was not wearing the Niqab had not gone unnoticed and neither had that of her daughter, her eldest child, XXXX, because XXXX was not wearing the Hijab.\n[9] She was also hanging around or had friends who were Christians and some of them were male friends and this was not being seen well by persons who carried a more extreme view of Islam and they were warned through letters that were left on the car as well as or in the mailbox as well as through e\u00ad mails that were later sent to the principal claimant.\n[10] And, the e-mails as well as the letters increased in their violent aspect and towards the end they were very insulting to the female claimants as well as threatening to behead the adult principal claimant and to basically kill the entire family for not dressing in proper Islamic attire as well as for not going to the mosque and for not following the mores of Islam.\n[11] So, for all this and these allegations which are found in the Basis of Claim Forms led the claimants to fear that this group was going to actually carry out their threats.\n[12] They tried to leave and go to other cities to live or to another city, to the city of Suez, but they were unable to live there without encountering that these people knew they had gone there as well as they knew that they had reported to the police what was being said to them and that increased their fear that they were somehow being watched and that the threats could be carried out.\n[13] They also became fearful that the police were not interested in helping them because whenever they had made a report or they did on two occasions the police did nothing about it and there was no followup despite being told they would follow up and with all that the claimants decided to leave the country immediately and given that the principal claimant had access to airline tickets quickly because of his position with XXXX.\n[14] They made their plans to leave the country given that they also had Canadian visitors visa or temporary resident visas. They left the country in XXXX 2017 and came to Canada and subsequently made claims for protection in Canada.\n[15] Yes, on XXXX XXXX, 2017, they arrived at Pearson and went to Hamilton where they had a friend living in Canada.\n[16] Okay, so, the issue of identity, I have considered that the certified true copies of your passports which are found in Exhibit 1 have indicated to me as well as the birth certificates that I have provided on file. On a balance of probabilities, I can conclude that the claimants are citizens of Egypt and the youngest claimant XXXX is the citizen of United States of America as his birth was in United States of America.\n[17] Therefore, I also wanted to say that I find that all the claimants with the exception of the youngest child XXXX XXXX XXXX, you are not included in this I am afraid, but the rest are Convention refugees for the following reasons.\n[18] As I have already mentioned the issue of your identity has been established. Looking at the issue of your credibility, I found that both you Mr. XXXX as well as Ms. XXXX that you were both credible witnesses in what you have alleged in your allegations, I have therefore accepted as credible.\n[19] With respect your credibility, I found that you were spontaneous in your replies and that you did not embellish when there was opportunity to embellish and your evidence was not inconsistent with the documentary material as well as with the rest of your documents. Therefore, I have accepted both of your testimony in this case.\n[20] According to your evidence, you seem to understand that you were not being Islamic enough by not wearing the Hijab in the case of XXXX as well as by having the friends that she had and going out with these friends.\n[21] And, with respect to you Ms. XXXX by not wearing the Niqab, you were considered not Islamic enough and therefore there would be consequences according to this extremist group that was sending you these threats and the consequences would be for your family as well as for your spouse by not insisting or not making the females of the family conform and wear the attire necessary.\n[22] According to the documentary material that is found in my package as well as the material found in counsel\u2019s packages of Exhibit-6 and 7 and then Exhibit-8 as well, it would appear that in Egypt there are persons, that although they are considered to be extremists, they express this through threats by expecting the entire population to conform and dress in a certain way and to go to prayer at a certain time.\n[23] Anybody who is perceived to be a non-believer in Egypt or someone who is perceived to not have faith is considered to have breached the social or religious mores and in some cases not perhaps in your case where you have not been accused of apostasy, but in other cases where persons have been accused of apostasy, that actually reaches the level of being considered a crime.\n[24] The documentary material in my package Sections 1, 2 and 12 speak about the serious possibility of violence or harassment and persecution at the hands of the Muslim community by extremists groups to persons who they perceive to be non-Islamic or apostate or anyone who insults the religion.\n[25] In cases with respect to women, when the first revolution occurred in 2011 and then since the second one that took place, sexual assault increased in Egypt and though it was underreported it still was occurring at a terrible rate.\n[26] In counsel\u2019s package, it speaks about there was at one point in the Arab world, being a woman in Egypt was considered to be the worst place to be a woman and so that was in 2013, but later reports have indicated that the situation has not improved tremendously at all for women.\n[27] The government brought in an anti-harassment law mostly to help women. However, this law was found to be quite onerous because a woman if she was able to get the police to take a report and take her seriously, she had to provide two witnesses to the harassment. So, needless to say, it went underreported as well and that was just in the case of harassment. We are not talking about the case where people are making threats.\n[28] And also in the documentary material in general referred to, speaks about the situation with respect to Human Rights in Egypt as having deteriorated very much so.\n[29] Now, with respect to the issue of State protection, that is where looking at the documents is so important and that is where the documentary material does also speak about when women complaint to the police, it does not get taken seriously and that is possibly what you experienced Ms. XXXX as well as XXXX when you went to talk to them about the threats that were being made to you.\n[30] For whatever reason they don\u2019t take it seriously enough and despite bringing in a law, this anti\u00adharassment law that might indicate the police is attempting to deal with the situation, nevertheless I have to look at, is the protection in the country adequate?\n[31] And, under the circumstances and looking at the documentary material at the present time, I don\u2019t find that it is under your circumstances where the documents speak about all the sexual assaults that are occurring to women and to anyone who does not dress in serious extremist Muslim garb.\n[32] And, generally many in the population believe that it is also the woman\u2019s fault if she is not dressed in strict Niqab or hijab and then is assaulted or sexually harassed, assaulted of course being worse.\n[33] So, given that and I believe that you Mr. XXXX when you said that you don\u2019t want anybody pressuring you or your family with respect to your religion or making you follow in a certain way as well as, as you ma\u2019am, Ms. XXXX when you said about how if you give in to one request that they make then they will just continue and until you are following everything that this group is telling you and while the documentary material speaks about the government trying to deal with extremism in terms of the violence that these extremists groups are causing in the country, it doesn\u2019t seem to be working at the level of persons such as yourself that are experiencing these threats.\n[34] Therefore, given all of this that could be imputed to you for being religious nonconformist as well as the being of the female gender so membership in particular social group and I believe that you could not get the adequate State protection from the government as you have tried by going to the police on two occasions and now that it is possible that they are wondering if the family of Mr. XXXX if you have made a refugee claim abroad as you have; given that now may even put you in a position if they were to learn that you have made a claim that is, that you might be viewed in a different light by the government as you believe that you would be viewed as a traitor despite the fact that you had a position that was considered to be one given to people who are viewed well from their prospective of national security.\n[35] So, for all these reasons I find that the four of you \u2026\u2026 oh, one more thing I have to mention is with respect to internal flight alternative in Alexandria. I\u2019ve decided that based on the evidence I believe that what you face which is a serious possibility of persecution. I believe you face it throughout the country and that even if you were to move to Alexandria, I don\u2019t believe you could do so and live safely without being in hiding and therefore that is not an option.\n[36] So, for these reasons then in the family XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX I find that you are Convention refugees.\n[37] However, with respect to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, there has been no evidence submitted regarding United States of America and that is that there is no evidence refuting the presumption of State protection for the minor child in the country of his citizenship.\n[38] I therefore find that you, XXXX, I have to reject your claim and I find that you are not a Convention refugee.\n[39] Okay? So, everybody else is\u2026. Thank you. And thanks Madam Interpreter. This hearing is now concluded. Good day to everyone.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

Kaminker\nCountry: Egypt\nRPD Number: TB7-16955\nAssociated RPD Number(s): TB7-16967, TB7-16968, TB7-16969\nATIP Number: A-2020-00518\nATIP Pages: 000519-000524\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: This is the decision in the claims with respect to, XXXX XXXX XXXX, who is the principal claimant and her three children, XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX and the principal file number is TB7-16955.\n[2] Okay. This decision is being rendered today orally and a written form of these reasons may be edited for spelling, syntax, grammar, references to applicable case law and legislation and exhibits may also be included.\n[3] I find that all the claimants are nationals of Egypt as there are certified true copies of their passports found in Exhibit 1, as well as, later in the temporary resident visa file, Exhibit 7 and this, as well as, there are other personal documents, copies which are on file and all these indicate to me, on a balance of probabilities, that I can conclude that the claimants are all citizens of Egypt.\n[4] I find also that the claimants are all Convention refugees and my reasons are as follows:\n[5] First of all, I would like to say that the designated representative in this case, for the minor child, XXXX, is the principal claimant, his mother and she has understood what her responsibilities were as his designated representative.\n[6] In deciding this claim, I have also taken into consideration and also in the hearing of this claim, Guideline 4 which is the Chairperson\u2019s Guidelines on Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-related Persecution. That\u2019s the name of the guideline.\n[7] Now, having said that, the nexus in this case is membership in a particular social group as gender for you, Miss XXXX and also under the ground of religion for being imputed to be an apostate or an infidel or in other words, to be considered un-Islamic or non-conforming to the religion and as for the children, that would be as family, also membership in a particular social group as family of an apostate or mortad(ph) mother as some may say it.\n[8] Now, also with respect to the allegations, these I will summarize very quickly. They are found in the Basis of Claim Form and I won\u2019t go through all of them, just to say that, you were all living in Egypt until you came to Canada on the XXXX XXXX XXXX of 2017, at which time you made a claim for refugee protection at an in-land office.\n[9] The troubles for you started around 2015 when at a social function, the principal claimant met extremists from the Muslim Brotherhood Party. These were women who would upon socially meeting other women, if they found that they were not Islamic enough or were not wearing the hijab, they would then start to see them socially and then commence with indoctrinating them or pushing them become more Islamic.\n[10] If they did not become more Islamic and conform to the Sharia law as these women, these two women, XXXX(sp) and XXXX(sp), were having the principal claimant do, then they would proceed to make threats and this is what happened in this case.\n[11] So, it started with criticizing your laughing, your way of talking and the clothes you wore or the lack of wearing the hijab and then later, it became that you should be wearing not just the hijab but the niqab and then there were attacks on your eldest son \u2013 sorry \u2013 first on your second son, then on the eldest son. Those attacks came later but all of these attacks resulted in serious physical injuries, as well as, the psychological injuries that accompanied those attacks.\n[12] There were also attacks to your car whereby you were purposefully hit by another car. Your car was hit by another car and that became a hit and run and then these threats continued.\n[13] There were a number of paper threats, letters, notes that were left for you, including, on one occasion, bleach was left with the threat of what that meant and how that would be used to disfigure you.\n[14] There were very insulting threats and also these were said to your sons, as well as, phone threats and these phone threats have continued too in Egypt and your husband has tried to stop them by saying that he is separated from you and is not in contact with the family, doesn\u2019t know where they are. Okay?\n[15] So, with respect to your credibility, I have found that you have testified in a very credible manner and you\u2019ve provided your testimony in a spontaneous way without any embellishments or contradictions and there were no discrepancies between your evidence and the documents and that also goes for the, any testimony given by your sons when I\u2019ve asked them questions.\n[16] There\u2019s also much of what you said is consistent with some of the documentary material with respect to how these extremists try to indoctrinate or make people be more Islamic and in Counsel\u2019s package of Exhibit 10, there is much information from the Guardian which is considered, in my opinion, to be a reliable publication and it speaks there about how the current government of El-sisi is having to deal with these extremists and how he\u2019s walking a tightrope because he was not the party that represented the, that was Dr. Morsi. He was not of the one that represented the Islamic side or the Muslim Brotherhood. But I\u2019ll get to that shortly.\n[17] So, with respect to your credibility, I have concluded that you are credible witnesses and, therefore, I accept what you\u2019ve alleged in your Basis of Claim Form as credible and I just wanted to speak about, with respect to what is considered under the ground of religion that I think you fall into in that you have a non-conforming religious, non-conforming to the religion view of or way of life. You do not \u2013 when you were in Egypt, would not wear the hijab, let alone the niqab.\n[18] You also said that you were brought up in a quite a liberal Islamic fashion. Both your parents were educated. Your mother, I believe, taught English literature. You went to a Catholic school where a lot of Christians were in your school. A lot of them were Muslims too because you said you were upper class and you had, that was considered to be a good education to go to these Christians schools. So, you went there.\n[19] You also would go by a Christian church as your mother did and light a candle and you do that here in Canada. But you have views of having Christian friends and celebrating Christmas and things that are not considered to be Islamic.\n[20] Whether they knew that or these women became aware of that is not clear but that doesn\u2019t negate the fact that these women did not find you Islamic enough with what they did know and from, because of that, they decided they were going to make you more and when that wasn\u2019t working, they were then using threats and following you and had you transferred to another job and then had somebody there follow you and push you down the stairs. So, you yourself, also encountered physical threats.\n[21] According to the documentary material, the documentary material speaks about how, just how religious a country Egypt is and how an expression of not following what some would perceive to be very religious, is an expression of one\u2019s religion or non-belief also.\n[22] It also indicates that in Egypt, it is often the case where, if women aren\u2019t wearing the hijab they are, there\u2019s a lot of sexual harassment that goes on. Where a report, I think it was Amnesty International \u2013 no \u2013 there\u2019s a report done whereby 99% of the women, at least 99% had stated they had been sexually harassed.\n[23] So, somebody\u2019s always saying something, it would appear but also going further, if one is perceived to not be Islamic enough, to be possibly atheist if a person is not Islamic enough, then because there are expectations of people going to prayer and non-believers are not treated very well in Egypt.\n[24] If they are regarded as apostates, given that apostacy is considered a crime in Egypt, then a person that doesn\u2019t follow the social or religious morays could be considered to be doing something very wrong, a crime, it could be.\n[25] But you\u2019re not at that point where you\u2019re being accused of being an atheist. You\u2019re not there. But what is serious, in my opinion, is that you are not considered to be Islamic enough and even though the Muslim Brotherhood members have been sought after by the current government and this current government has been trying to find supporters or sympathizers of the Muslim Brotherhood and rule, like, deal with them, nevertheless, this did continue to occur to you while El-sisi was in power, before you left the country and this has continued, these same people because they have managed, these women, to continue to try to do what they were doing to you.\n[26] Therefore, I think that you did go to the police and try to get them to write a report and they did not want to write one because it was the Islamic Brotherhood and that was at the time when it was no longer Morsi in power. It was El-sisi and the documentary material in the NDP package, which is Exhibit 6, it spoke there in Sections 1, 2 and 12, about the serious possibility of violence, harassment and persecution at the hands of the Muslim community, of the State and of also, extremist groups to persons who are perceived as non-Islamic or apostate and also anyone who they believe has insulted the religion.\n[27] I do not believe, under the current regime, that you would find help or assistance by the State to get protected because of your own experience but also because of what the documentary material speaks about, the human rights situation in Egypt, how it\u2019s continuing to deteriorate and how the authorities have arbitrarily restricted the rights to freedom of expression, association, peaceful assembly and many other rights and also, I\u2019m aware that the current government is in a way, he\u2019s facing a \u2013 the government\u2019s facing a difficult situation between, there was a very large group that supported the more Islamic view and according to the documentary material, he is walking that tightrope between the more theological side.\n[28] The documentary material also speaks about, in cases with respect to women where it had to do with sexual assault in Egypt, was underreported and they tried to bring in a law to make it a crime. However, not sexual assault but they\u2019ve made sexual harassment a crime as that occurs so much. But they made the law so restrictive, whereby a woman had to provide two witnesses and they had to get them to the police, get the perpetrator to the police and it became to onerous, according to Human Rights Watch at Item 10.1 of the documentary material.\n[29] Therefore, given all of this, that you could be imputed as being a religious non-conformist or an apostate and given that I believe your sons have experienced what would amount to persecution, in my view, because you are their mother and that you yourself have experienced that through the threats, the harassment, assault on you and the psychological turmoil that this has caused you, seeing how your sons are being attacked because of this situation with you, I do not believe that you would get help, that there is adequate state protection for you or any of you in Egypt and I also don\u2019t believe you could go live anywhere else in the country to be safe because it is the same laws and the same, this network of these extremists is very large and you did try to move elsewhere and they found out about it.\n[30] Therefore, for all these reasons, I find that the four of you are Convention refugees and I, therefore, accept your claims.\n[31] Do you understand?\n[32] Thank you and thanks, Mr. Interpreter, for all your help today.\n[33] INTERPRETER: As always the pleasure was mine.\n[34] MEMBER: Thank you. Good day to you all. Good day, Counsel.\n[35] This hearing is now concluded. \u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

Vega\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Sherif R Ashamalla\nCountry: Egypt\nRPD Number: TB7-16851\nAssociated RPD Number(s): TB7-16861\nATIP Number: A-2020-00518\nATIP Pages: 000507-000518\nREASONS FOR DECISION\nINTRODUCTION\n[1] These are the reasons for the decision in the claims of XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX. The claimants are married spouses, who claim to be citizens of Egypt, and are claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] The allegations in this case are found in the male claimant\u2019s (principal claimant) Basis of Claim (BOC) form which will be summarized.\n[3] The problems for these claimants commenced when the male claimant stood by and defended his Christian friends before a customary council session on 16 September 2016. The customary council was convened to settle a sectarian dispute between his Christian friends and Muslim tenants of the property owned by one of the friends. Many of those present were Salafists who follow a stricter, literalist and more puritanical interpretation of Islam. The customary council session was to determine the sectarian dispute between the male claimant\u2019s friends, the Christian brothers, one of whom was the property owner and his two tenants who were also brothers, and the Christian guard, whom the Christian brothers defended against the aggression of the Muslim tenants. In the altercation that ensued, one of the Muslim tenants was struck with the iron skewer he used to threaten the house guard. The Christian owner had taken the skewer from the tenant and beat him with it allegedly in self defense. The tenant later died in hospital a few days later. The police made several arrests of the involved parties. Given the appearance of sectarian strife, the case was transferred to a customary council to adjudicate the dispute. The claimant was invited to attend the last session of the customary council. Members of a Salafist Jihadi group, one of the most radical groups in Egypt, were part of the customary council. Also present were the head of the Security Department in the Red Sea Governorate and the head of the National Security Department and the Salafist radical group was forcing the authorities to accept their point of view. In their view, it was unacceptable that a Christian was the offender who victimized a Muslim.\n[4] The claimant expressed his opinion which opposed that of the Salafists and he was on the side of his Christian friends. It was the council that decided that the Christian offenders would pay the victim\u2019s family in compensation for the death, the amount of two million Egyptian pounds was fined. The claimant\u2019s position on the side of his Christian friends, given that he was a Muslim, angered a famous radical Muslim named XXXX XXXX. He accusingly asked the claimant if he was a Muslim or a Christian, which the claimant understood is a serious accusation in Egypt. The claimant also accused the council of unfairness and criticized the way they interpreted the Islamic religion. In response, Mr. XXXX XXXX became angry and approached the claimant and told him that he must reconsider his opinions against Islam or they will consider him an apostate. The claimant replied saying, \u201cYou are the ones that do not relate to Islam at all; you order a compensation of two million Egyptian pounds, for an accidental death by self-defence. This is not fair.\u201d XXXX XXXX then threatened the claimant saying that they will find him even if he goes to the end of the world as they have people everywhere in Egypt and they will teach him right from wrong. The claimant took this as a threat that they would hurt him. Later in February 2017, he was contacted by this radical group and they threatened him and his wife because of her not wearing the Muslim dress. The claimant responded that they would not be able to hurt either him or his wife as they have a strong police department in Egypt that would protect them. In April while walking with his wife in Giza, they were assaulted and beaten by young people. During the attack one of the assailants stated \u201cXXXX XXXX is telling you, hypocrite, apostate, that you are condemned by the rule of apostasy, you and your wife both. You know what apostasy means, this time we beat you, next time we slaughter both of you.\u201d After receiving medical treatment for their injuries they had a lawyer file a report with the police on their behalf regarding the assault both claimants had suffered; however, as the issue was seen as a sectarian issue, it would have to be reported to the commanding officer and any report made would have to first be approved by the National Security authorities. The officer advised the lawyer to tell the claimants to stay away from Cairo for a couple of days because of the high risk that members of the radical group would find them. The claimant gave his lawyer power of attorney to file a case against the person known as XXXX XXXX and the claimants moved around Egypt hiding among friends to avoid the radical persons looking for them.\n[5] The case was filed on May 21, 2017and the court set a date for a hearing on July 1, 2017. The court also ordered the police to investigate the matter and although they did not find XXXX XXXX, the claimant received threatening calls again and he was advised by his lawyer to flee the country and not return to Egypt. He fled to the USA on XXXX XXXX, 2017 where he stayed with a friend while his lawyer in Egypt arranged the translation of the claimant\u2019s documents to be presented at his hearing. While waiting the month that it took for the translation, the male claimant continued to receive threatening calls on his Egyptian phone number. He also communicated with his wife using the internet. They decided to turn off their respective phones. The male claimant travelled to Canada by air on XXXX XXXX, 2017 and his wife arrived on XXXX XXXX, 2017 from Egypt, from where she had been in hiding with a friend. They subsequently made a claim for refugee protection. They fear that if they return to Egypt, the Salafist group members will find them and carry out their threats.\nDETERMINATION\n[6] The panel finds that the male claimant is a Convention refugee. However, the panel finds that the female claimant is not a Convention refugee. The panel\u2019s reasons for the respective and different determinations are as follows.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[7] The panel finds that the claimants are both nationals of Egypt. The male claimant is Egyptian by his birth in Egypt and the female claimant by naturalization in 2012. This has been established by their testimony and by the supporting documentation filed, namely their respective Egyptian passports found in Exhibit 1, and from this evidence the panel concludes, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimants each have Egyptian citizenship.\n[8] However, in the case of the female claimant XXXX XXXX XXXX, the panel determines that she is also a citizen of the Philippines by her birth in that country. It is merely a formality for her to swear an oath of allegiance and she would be considered a dual citizen by the government of the Philippines.\nNexus\n[9] In this case, the nexus to the definition is the imputed religion or lack of Islamic faith of the claimants, but primarily that of Mr. XXXX who came to the attention of a radical Salafist Jihadi group by his defense of his Coptic Christian friends who were one of the parties in a sectarian dispute. The nexus is the same for Ms. XXXX in that she is seen to be non-conforming, or not Islamic enough by her not wearing the Islamic dress despite being a convert from Christianity to Islam.\n[10] The documentary material in the National Documentation Package in sections 1, 2, and 12 speaks about the serious possibility of violence, harassment, and persecution at the hands of the Muslim community of the State and also extremist groups to persons who are perceived as non-Islamic or apostate which I mentioned before or anyone who insults the religion.\n[11] According to the claimants\u2019 evidence, they seem to understand that they were being accused of not being Islamic enough by not wearing the Hijab in the case of Ms. XXXX as well as by having the Christian friends whom you defended against a Muslim in a dispute. The male claimant believes that as retribution for defending Christians against a Muslim, he may be accused of apostasy or treated as an apostate.\n[12] Furthermore, with respect to Ms. XXXX, by not wearing the Islamic dress, such as the hijab, she was considered not Islamic enough and therefore there would be consequences according to this radical group that was sending her husband these threats and the consequences would be for her as well as for her spouse by his not insisting or not making her conform and wear the attire the Salafist radical group, deemed necessary.\nCredibility\n[13] The panel found the claimants to be credible witnesses. They provided their answers at this hearing without embellishment and they answered all the questions without discrepancies in their evidence. Their responses were consistent with the Basis of Claim form and with the other evidence in this case. Many questions were asked and their forthright responses assisted in establishing their credibility in a favourable manner. Therefore, as they were found to be credible witnesses, the panel accepts their allegations as credible.\nState protection in Egypt\n[14] The documentary material clearly indicates that anybody who is perceived to be a non\u00ad believer in Egypt or a non-conformist to the social or religious mores, or someone who is perceived to not have faith is considered to have breached the social or religious mores and in some cases not perhaps in this case where they have not been accused of apostasy although the male claimant was threatened that he would be, but in other cases where persons have been accused of apostasy, that actually reaches the level of being considered a crime.\n[15] The documentary material Exhibit 4, Sections 1, 2 and 12 speaks about the serious possibility of violence or harassment and persecution at the hands of the Muslim community by extremists groups to persons who they perceive to be non-Islamic or apostate or anyone whom they perceive to have insulted the religion.\n[16] The documentary material found in both the (NDP) National Documentary Package and, counsel\u2019s package of Exhibits 8 and 9, speaks about the human rights situation in Egypt which has deteriorated and continues to deteriorate.\n[17] In Item 2.2, the annual report by Amnesty International titled, Egypt 2017\/2018 speaks about the human rights situation as it continues to deteriorate and about how the human rights crisis continued unabated. The authorities used torture and other ill treatment and enforced disappearance against hundreds of people and dozens were extra judicially executed with impunity. While in previous years the authorities had arbitrarily restricted the rights to freedom of expression, association, and peaceful assembly, they escalated the crackdown of civil society by subjecting NGO staff to additional interrogations, travel bans and the freezing of assets. Arbitrary arrests and detentions which were then followed by grossly unfair trials of government critics, peaceful protesters, journalists and human rights defenders. These acts by authorities occurred routinely. In some cases detainees in political cases or government opponents were held in prolonged detention without charge or trial. In general, many human rights groups throughout the world believe that the Egyptian authorities have misused many of their powers against their own citizens.\n[18] According to Item 2.2 of Exhibit 4, the latest Amnesty report regarding the exercise of freedom of religion, the authorities continued to violate this freedom by discriminating against Christians and there was continued impunity for sectarian attacks on Christian communities with the authorities relying on customary reconciliation and settlements agreed by local authorities and religious leaders. The violence by non-state actors against Christians increased significantly given the impunity by the authorities. While the claimants are not Christians, they are perceived as non-Muslims or apostates because the male claimant is taking the side of Christians over Muslims and his wife does not conform to the Islamic dress in public.\n[19] The panel finds that the claimant would not receive protection from the Egyptian authorities under the current regime and given their past experience and according to what the documentary material states about the human rights situation in Egypt. It has continued to deteriorate and the authorities arbitrarily restricted the rights to freedom of expression, association, peaceful assembly, and many other civil rights. Despite the semblance of legal court action in the claimant\u2019s case against XXXX XXXX, the police had previously refused to take a report and advised him through his lawyer, to flee the area and not to risk being found by the Jihadists. Therefore, their actions of commencing an investigation were only initiated by the court ordering it. The police, as an arm of the Egyptian government do not seem able to protect the claimants based on the preponderance of material from the NDP and particularly Item 2.7., which speaks about the growth of Jihadists groups in Egypt, some with ties to ISIS. Furthermore, when a charge of apostasy is brought against someone or a charge of denigration of religions, the treatment meted out by the police can be considered to be persecutory. In Item 12.1, at page 10 it states the following, regarding such treatment:\n[20] In August police arrested and interrogated a man whom they alleged had converted from Islam to Christianity. Police released him, reportedly telling him he was too old to withstand the treatment they ordinarily would give to apostates from Islam, according to sources.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[21] The claimants cannot go elsewhere in the country to stay safe without having to hide because they would face the same possibility or serious grounds of persecution throughout the entire country as the radical Jihadists are found throughout all of Egypt according to the preponderance of the documentary materials.\nThe Philippines \u2013 Female Claimant\u2019s Second Country of Reference\n[22] According to Williams1 a claimant may be considered to be a national of a country where the evidence establishes that it is within their control to acquire the citizenship of that country. If there is an automatic right to citizenship in that country under the law, if there is no discretion on the part of the Philippine government to refuse her citizenship and if the claimant can re-acquire Philippine citizenship by requirements that are mere formalities, then the claim can be assessed against the Philippines. Furthermore, if the claimant has no well-founded fear of persecution in that country of nationality then the claim for refugee status will be denied.\n[23] The female claimant is a naturalized citizen of Egypt as of 2012. She was born in the Philippines and had that citizenship since her birth to at least one Filipino citizen. The matter of dual citizenship is addressed in Item 3.5 of the National Documentation Package.2 According to the information contained in this document, the claimant was a dual citizen of the Philippines and Egypt as a result of the passage in 2003 of Republic Act (RA) 9225. This document states the following at page 2:\nHow does one reacquire Philippine citizenship under RA 9225?\nNatural-born Filipinos who lost their Filipino citizenship through naturalization in a foreign country may re-acquire Philippine citizenship by taking the Philippine Oath of Allegiance before a duly authorized Philippine official. The Philippine Oath of Allegiance does not require a person to renounce his allegiance to any other country.\n[24] Section 3 of the Republic Act No. 9225, which was passed on 29 August 2003, states the following:\nSection 3. Retention of Philippine Citizenship \u2013 Any provision of the law to the contrary notwithstanding, natural-born citizenship by reason of their naturalization of citizens of a foreign country are hereby deemed to have re-acquired Philippine citizenship\u201d upon taking the following oath of allegiance to the Republic:\n\u201cI________, solemny (sic) swear (or affrim) (sic) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the Republic of the Philippines; and I hereby declare that I recognize and accept the supreme authority of the Philippines and will maintain true faith and allegiance thereto; and that I imposed this obligation upon myself voluntarily without mental reservation or purpose of evasion.\u201d3\n[25] The previously-mentioned Act further states that:\nNatural born citizens of the Philippines who, after the effectivity of this Act, become citizens of a foreign country shall retain their Philippine citizenship upon taking the aforesaid oath.\nState Protection in the Philippines\n[26] The female claimant stated she fears returning to the Philippines as she fears that her family members will cause her problems. They have rejected her since they learned of her conversion to Islam in 2005 after she told her mother of the conversion when she was to marry her spouse, a Muslim. She had converted in 1996 and returned to the Philippines in 2004 but had not told anyone of her conversion fearing their rejection. When she was to marry she told her mother that she was marrying a Muslim and was asked why a Muslim. Then when she told her mother that she had converted she was not accepted. Her cousin XXXX in the Philippines, who does not care about the conversion was told to tell the claimant that she is a Muslim and she has nothing in the Philippines. The claimant understood that to mean that she is not to receive any inheritance as a result and that they have divided up any money that there was and have purposely excluded her from receiving a share. Furthermore, the female claimant believed that her Muslim marriage would not be recognized in the Philippines and thus it would need to be registered but would not be allowed to register it. The panel has no evidence that a Muslim marriage would not be registered in the Philippines. On the contrary, having consulted Exhibit 5, the NDP for the Philippines dated 30 April 2018, at Item 12.1 the International Religious Freedom Report indicates that about 10 to 12 percent of the population was estimated in 2012 to be Muslim. The majority of Muslims reside in Mindanao and nearby islands in the south with an increasing number of Muslims migrating to the urban centers of Manila and Cebu. The female claimant\u2019s family live in Iloilo City which is a one hour flight from Manila. The claimant has not rebutted the presumption of state protection regarding the Philippines should any family member try to cause her harm due to her conversion to Islam. Even if they were to learn of the claimant being in the Philippines and were to travel there to locate her, the panel finds that there would be adequate state protection for her in the Philippines.\n[27] States are presumed to be capable of protecting their citizens, except in situations where they are in a state of complete breakdown4. From the documentary evidence,5 the panel finds that the Philippines, regardless of its current political, economic, cultural and social problems, is not a state that is close to a complete breakdown. Consequently, the presumption that it is capable of protecting its citizens applies.6 According to the documentary evidence, the Philippines is a functioning multiparty, constitutional republic and a democracy. Therefore the presumption that the state is capable of protecting its citizens supersedes the principle that international protection should be sought. Where a state is in effective control of its territory, has police and civil authority in place and makes serious effort to protect its citizens, the mere fact that the state\u2019s efforts are not always successful will not rebut the presumption of state protection.7\nBurden of Proof\n[28] Absent an admission by the state of its inability to protect the claimant (the evidence in this regard is silent), the burden of proof is on the claimant to show through \u201cclear and convincing\u201d evidence the state\u2019s inability to protect her and thus successfully rebut the presumption of state protection.8 Such evidence could be past personal incidents in which state protection did not materialize or evidence of similarly-situated persons let down by state protection mechanisms. Failing this, the claimant could provide reliable and probative evidence that satisfies the Refugee Protection Division (RPD), on a balance of probabilities, that the state protection in the Philippines respectively, is inadequate.9\n[29] There is legislation in the Philippines, known as Republic (RA) 9262, Anti-Violence Against Women and their Children Act of 2004, which criminalizes violence within intimate relationships and the family. Response to Information Request number PHL105113.E10 reports about the efforts that government agencies have made to address the issue of violence against women and provide state protection. It speaks about the governmental agencies, mechanisms and support services in place to deal with this type of violence. It explains the different restraining orders such as the Barangay protection order, the temporary protection order and the permanent protection order. An Ombudsman is present in the country to deal with complaints when victims feel that the authorities have treated them unfairly.11 The government has taken measures to deal with violence against women and therefore has demonstrated a willingness to deal with this issue. Moreover, it appears that their efforts have been reasonably effective on an operational level. Consequently, while the protection provided by state authorities in the Philippines may not be perfect, it is adequate in the panel\u2019s opinion.\nCONCLUSION\n[30] Based on the foregoing reasons, the panel finds that, XXXX XXXX XXXX, is a Convention refugee. Also based on the foregoing reasons, in the protection claim of XXXX XXXX XXXX, the panel finds that she is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection, given the panel\u2019s finding that there is state protection available to her in the Philippines, her second country of reference. Furthermore, she has not rebutted the presumption of state protection in the Philippines, as required.\n[31] Thus, the claim of XXXX XXXX XXXX is rejected and the panel finds that she is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection within the meaning of sections 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[32] The panel further finds that the claimant, XXXX XXXX XXXX is a Convention refugee and his claim is allowed.\n(signed) M.J.

Vega\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Latoya Graham\nCountry: Egypt\nRPD Number: TB7-13974\nAssociated RPD Number(s): TB7-14095\nATIP Number: A-2020-00518\nATIP Pages: 000437-000441\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: This is the decision in the claims with respect to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX. The principal File Number is TB7-13974.\n[2] The adult claimant claims to be a citizen of Egypt and her son XXXX XXXX XXXX claims to be a citizen of United States of America. Both claimants are claiming refugee protection pursuant to Sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[3] This decision is being rendered orally today; a written form of these reasons may be edited for spelling, syntax, grammar; and references to the applicable case law, legislation and Exhibits may also be included.\n[4] Furthermore, the adult claimant Ms. XXXX is the designated representative of her minor child XXXX. In this claim, I have also taken into consideration the Chairperson\u2019s Guidelines with respect to women refugee or gender refugee claims and this is Guideline 4.\n[5] I find that the principal claimant is a national of Egypt as is established by her testimony as well as by the supporting documentation filed, namely, her passport which is found in Exhibit 1, and from this evidence I conclude on a balance of probabilities that she has Egyptian citizenship.\n[6] With respect to XXXX, I find that he is also a citizen of the United States of America and I conclude this from his American passport as well as his American birth certificate, both the documents have been filed as Exhibits.\n[7] I find, Ms. XXXX, that you are a Convention refugee for the following reasons, and I also find that your son, XXXX XXXX, is not a Convention refugee and I will explain it a little later.\n[8] In this case, the issue of the claimant\u2019s identity is partly that she is not only an Egyptian citizen but she is also, and perhaps foremost, she is identified as a Palestinian, and that is because both her parents were and all her family members are Palestinians, and one could say that then the nexus could be either under the issue of national or rather, because it is not a State, the lack of nationality, but it is in her case as in other persons who are Palestinians of Palestinian heritage, it is part of their identity.\n[9] In the case of the claimant, she is not a stateless Palestinian because she has the nationality of an Egyptian citizen, but this claim is based on the fact that the treatment that she has received repeatedly over the years has been that of imputed or that she is imputed as though she were a stateless Palestinian even though she is not.\n[10] So, the Basis of Claim Form contains the allegations of this case, I have briefly touched on it. The claimant was married once before. It was in that marriage that she acquired her Egyptian citizenship. She is currently divorced from that husband, she had a child with that first spouse and she later, after the divorce, married her current husband.\n[11] Her current husband is also of Palestinian origin and lived also in Saudi Arabia, and that marriage was arranged by her mother, but nonetheless that husband or current husband has no legal status in Egypt. He is not a part of this claim. His circumstances have been testified to by the claimant as through his circumstances she has been able to speak about how persons that have no other citizenship or that are stateless such as her husband, how they are treated, and also I mean her mother is also in a similar situation but they are not part of this claim.\n[12] So, the claimants left Egypt, and in 2017, went to the United States of America where she stayed for 1 day and then crossed into Canada or tried to, at the border she made her claim for refugee protection. She had a sister in Canada who has been living here for 21 years, and it was on the basis of having a sister here that she was allowed into Canada with her son to make the claim.\n[13] Her testimony as well as her Basis of Claim Form speaks about many times being harassed and humiliated at checkpoints because her identification indicates that she is of Palestinian origin and not of Egyptian origin.\n[14] She indicates that on her visits when she would leave Egypt and return either to Saudi Arabia mostly, then she would face about twice a year for about 4 years she said she would face hours of being made to wait by the security officials at the airport and she felt humiliated at this all the time.\n[15] She also puts in her Basis of Claim Form and later spoke in testimony about how she suffered discrimination repeatedly because she is a Palestinian, and that whenever she went for a job application or an interview, jobs for which she was very qualified, as she had worked in Saudi Arabia on a work permit and worked in these jobs, and yet in Egypt as soon as they notice the identifiers in her ID card or in her passport, the first two digits would indicate that she is a Palestinian, she never received the job in all the years that she kept trying to find employment in Egypt.\n[16] She testified that she was often told by some of the employers or prospective employers that the reason she was being denied the job was because of her Palestinian origin.\n[17] She also spoke within her Basis of Claim Form how she was also subjected to car searches and personal searches at checkpoints by police and the questioning that was asked was because of her Palestinian status despite being an Egyptian citizen.\n[18] So, Ms. XXXX, I have found you to be a credible witness. You did provide your answers at this hearing without embellishment. You answered all the questions without discrepancies in your evidence and your responses were consistent with your Basis of Claim Form and the amendments as well as with your other evidence. I did ask you many questions and I find that these have assisted in establishing your credibility in a favourable manner.\n[19] Now, I have considered the documentary material, much of which speaks mostly about stateless Palestinians and your situation is not the same as theirs, but counsel in her submissions made some interesting points, which are especially about how, while you have the protection so to speak of having an Egyptian passport, that\u2019s the official position and in theory, that it is a de facto situation you do not benefit it seems from that Egyptian citizenship, and that you are humiliated and questioned longer than anybody else who has an Egyptian passport and that is because of your ties to Palestinian origins, and this no matter what citizenship you seem to have keeps following you.\n[20] The counsel made reference to the Federal Court decision of Xie about the systematic denial of a right to work.\n[21] Now, the right to work of your husband is also existent, but I am not looking at his situation am looking at the fact that even though you have the benefit of an Egyptian passport in Egypt, you have still been denied systematically, I would say, the ability or to secure employment to support yourself, and when this happens on a systematic basis, I consider the right to support yourself to be a core human right, and therefore I find that you have faced cumulative discrimination that amounts to persecution.\n[22] There has been, I believe in your case, a pattern of repression and the effects of which are that the institutions such as the authority of the Egyptian government which should be protecting you, it would seem from the evidence that you have been denied and that you are not provided with that protection, partly because it is the government itself that made the decrees and certain laws making it harder or practically for stateless Palestinians they have no rights, but for persons such as yourself, there doesn\u2019t seem to, even though you are not a stateless Palestinian, the distinction and the protection you should have been afforded, I don\u2019t believe has been afforded to you.\n[23] The document referred by counsel, which is in the National Documentation Package found in Item 3.4, it speaks more generally there about Palestinians in Egypt. It speaks about how the policy changes, or what I refer to as a decree, were made by Mubarak, but these have continued and they have not improved. These have restricted work and the ability of families to reunite.\n[24] While that was perhaps more so to address the situation of those that were not granted the benefit of an Egyptian citizenship, in your case, as I have already mentioned, you are perceived to be Palestinian and that you have then experienced similar discriminatory practices that they have had imposed on them in Egypt, and so therefore, if you were being denied your rights as an Egyptian citizen over and over again because of your origins as a Palestinian, then that in my opinion amounts to persecution.\n[25] Given this current situation that is described in the National Documentation Package with how the government since the revolution in 2011 and then again afterwards which brought in the current government, the situation does not appear to have become better with respect to human rights.\n[26] On the contrary, it appears that human rights have deteriorated according to many sources, and the preponderance of documents including Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Freedom House and the United States Department of State, they speak about the rights, the authorities arbitrarily restricting rights to the population, and in your case if you are imputed to be a Palestinian national or a person who is of Palestinian origin, then I don\u2019t believe you would be protected.\n[27] So, I don\u2019t believe that there is State protection that is adequate in your situation given that you are overall perceived to be of the Palestinian origin and often treated as though you were stateless.\n[28] Also with respect to internal flight alternative, the situation for you will be the same throughout the country in my opinion. I don\u2019t believe that you would have an internal flight alternative. So, you cannot go elsewhere in the country apart from out of Cairo and stay safe because you would face the same serious grounds of persecution.\n[29] So, for these reasons, I find that you, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX are a Convention refugee, and I therefore accept your claim.\n[30] With respect to XXXX, however, there has been no evidence submitted regarding the United States of America that would refute the presumption of State protection for your son in that country of which I find that he is a citizen by virtue of his having a United States of America passport.\n[31] Therefore, I find that XXXX XXXX XXXX is not a Convention refugee and I reject his claim for protection. Do you understand that?\n[32] Thank you. This hearing is now ended and the hearing is concluded.\n[33] Thanks Mr. Interpreter for all your assistance. Good day counsel. Good day everyone.\n[34] INTERPRETER: Thank you.\n[35] COUNSEL: Thank you.\n[36] MEMBER: All the best to you ma\u2019am.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

Vega\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Mohamed Mahdi\nCountry: Egypt\nRPD Number: TB7-13684\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2020-00518\nATIP Pages: 000432- 000436\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: I am prepared to give you a decision at this time, okay.\n[2] This is the decision in the claim of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX file number TB7- 13684. This decision is being rendered orally today and a written form of these reasons may be edited for spelling, syntax, grammar. References to the applicable case law, legislation, and exhibits may also be included.\n[3] The claimant claims to be a citizen of Egypt and is claiming refugee protection pursuant to Sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[4] I find that you are a national of Egypt as is established by your testimony and by supporting documentation filed, your passport which is found \u2026 a copy of it which is found in Exhibit 1, as well as the \u2026 your birth certificate and translation of your birth certificate. And therefore, I conclude, on a balance of probabilities, that you have Egyptian citizenship and that you are whom you claim to be.\n[5] I should also mention that your iqama from Saudi Arabi a, a copy of that was also filed in this hearing.\n[6] The \u2026 Ms XXXX, I find that you are a Convention refugee and my reasons are as follows.\n[7] In this case, the nexus to the definition is your gender as a woman who was subjugated to male relatives deciding her marital status as well as her future.\n[8] The \u2026 sorry, the allegations are contained in your Basis of Claim Form. I will not repeat it all. Just briefly will summarize and say that you were born in Egypt, lived in and completed your schooling in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia while your father was working there. You have a brother and a sister.\n[9] When your father fell ill the family moved in 2013 back to Egypt. At which time your father \u2026 your father was hospitalized and subsequently died in 2013. At that point intime you and your mother and your sister and your brother, especially the women in the family, came under the care of your mother\u2019s oldest brother as the eldest male of the family, and you were \u2026 you had to live with him.\n[10] You were treated \u2026 as his attitude towards women is one of well, it\u2019s mean and horrific, and you \u2026 all of you were made to sleep in one room and you, your mother and your sister were not allowed to join him at the table for dinner but had to eat in the kitchen while your brother was allowed to eat with him, and you had to eat after he ate.\n[11] You called him a very conservative man and he was also, according to you, employed by the police department either as an informer or an agent to an informer or to an investigator, but I \u2026 the letters from all your relatives confirm that he was somehow an informer of some sort with the police department, or an informant I should say. And therefore \u2026 and the police department is not exactly correct word but rather the Ministry of the Interior. And you believe and fear that this man has access to power.\n[12] But given also the patriarchal nature of society in Egypt you fear that you could not go against him. And he objected to your studying a university education. He objected to your wanting to study medicine, and you were not allowed to go and study or stay in a girls residence, and you had to commute five hours total each day as you stayed at \u2026 in your grandfather\u2019s home which was a little closer than the original plan.\n[13] When \u2026 whenever you would have to ask for money \u2026 he controlled your inheritance. The money was very restricted, and your mother later learned that he had never invested the money but instead had spent it on gambling and drugs.\n[14] And so, with all this you felt you were terrified to go to the police and you felt that you could not continue like this.\n[15] The \u2026 the arguments between him and your mother would \u2026 actually had become physical, and he also, besides beating your mother, had beaten you as well.\n[16] And so, for all these reasons you fled to United States \u2019cause you had a US visa there, having traveled there previously, and on a previous occasion years ago. And then from the US you \u2026 the plan was you would come to Canada where you have family members here that are caring enough to \u2026 that they had gone to try to mediate the situation at one point. Okay.\n[17] Okay, just give me a second. In this case, while it is a \u2026 a gender claim, the current political situation of \u2026 which the documents speak about and which I\u2019m familiar with in Egypt, do not assist women, and therefore any \u2026 your uncle having any part of the working in the Ministry of the Interior is something that \u2026 on your statements that you\u2019re terrified of going to the police, given what the documentary material states, I find that you have discharged the burden of showing that the State would not protect you.\n[18] The onus was on you to do so but given that what the situation is there and the documentary material speaks about this.\n[19] Before that I just want to touch on your credibility. I believe that you were a credible witness in this case.\n[20] I had some concerns with the certain issues. I found that you answered them in a reasonable manner, and the concerns that I had, had to do with certain things not being completed, forms not being completed as detailed in the \u2026 the Immigration documents. But that I don\u2019t find to be material in this case, and therefore I do believe what you are alleging.\n[21] I\u2019ve also taken into consideration the letters that you provided from your mother, your aunt, your maternal aunt, your brother, and the uncle here who went there for three weeks with his wife to try to mediate the dispute between the eldest brother and your mother.\n[22] So, the documentary material speaks about the situation with respect to women. Under 5.1 it speaks there about harassment of women and how the government brought in a law in 2015 to try to help women.\n[23] One of the documents, I think it was in counsel\u2019s package of Exhibit 5. One of his documents speaks about the situation. That\u2019s the BBC article about Egypt: Worse for women out of 22 countries in the Arab world. In there it says a UN report in April \u2026 2013 is this article. In April 2013 said that 99.3 percent of women and girls in Egypt had been subjected to sexual harassment.\n[24] The sexual harassment statistics are horrendous, and it\u2019s \u2026 therefore the government it appears and of later documents, speaks about this plan that they came up with of trying to deal with sexual harassment and to deal with it by having some protection for women, and unfortunately, this \u2026 many women don\u2019t go to the police for it or try \u2026 don\u2019t necessarily prosecute \u2026 seek persecution of a harasser because in order to do so, to report it, the woman is required by law to catch her attacker and bring him and two other witnesses to the police and then sometimes they have to fight with the police to get the police to write a report.\n[25] Now, I know that\u2019s not the situation for you. Your situation, in my opinion, is worse because this is just an example of the government trying to improve the situation as they feel that they are trying to improve it for women.\n[26] The documentary material speaks about women who do not conform to certain traditional practices or Muslim practices such as by wearing the niqab, how they are treated. Those are the women that more harassed, and sometimes it goes beyond harassment and becomes assault, and it \u2026 it\u2019s known, and the documents mentions about how assault has been dealt with in the past.\n[27] So, people in the public also, according to the documentary material, believes that women that are not wearing their head covering should be subjected to harassment, or if they wear tight clothing or they\u2019re not veiled that there \u2026 and that there the most vulnerable to that harassment, okay.\n[28] So, with all this and given that the situation, as I mentioned the political situation in the country whereby all the documentary materials, the preponderance of it speaks about the deteriorating situation with respect to human rights in the country and the restriction of the rights to freedom of expression, association, peaceful assembly. Many rights have been curtailed.\n[29] State protection to women who experience sexual assault, according to Item 1.4 the UK document, that their State protection is limited. The women\u2019s protection is limited. Many sexual crimes go unreported.\n[30] Therefore, for \u2026 for all these reasons I don\u2019t believe there is adequate State protection for you in Egypt and I don\u2019t believe that you would face a situation different for yourself in \u2026 in another part of Egypt because if you were in hiding that\u2019s one thing, but that\u2019s not the type of life that we\u2019re talking about. We\u2019re talking about not hiding. So, as soon as you put in your information, if this relative your uncle would be able to find you and if you could not be protected, that\u2019s not \u2026 then that would be persecution. If you would \u2026 if you would try to force you to marry someone against your will, okay.\n[31] Therefore, for all these reasons \u2026 because you can\u2019t ask the Government of Egypt for protection as the documentary materials do speak about how they take this \u2026 the situation of home or family situations, domestic situations to be a family matter and therefore you would not find protection.\n[32] One document in the counsel\u2019s Exhibit 5 or that same document I was referring to also speaks about \u2026 where it says here, there are whole villages on the outskirts of Cairo and elsewhere where the bulk of economic activity is based on trafficking in women and forced marriages. And this was \u2026 was stated by Zahra Radwan of the US based group \u2026 US based rights group Global Fund for Women.\n[33] Okay. And that\u2019s \u2026 and therefore it is my opinion for all of these reasons that you, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, are a Convention refugee and I therefore accept your claim. Do you understand?\nCOUNSEL: Thank you.\nMEMBER: Thank you. Thanks, Madam Interpreter. And good day everyone. This hearing is now concluded.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

(IRPA).\n[2] The P.C. consented to act as designated representative on behalf of her minor children.\nEXPEDITED PROCESS\n[3] Paragraph 170(f) of the IRPA provides that the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) may allow a claim for refugee protection without a hearing, unless the Minister has notified the RPD of the Minister\u2019s intention to intervene within the time limit set out in the Refugee Protection Division Rules.1 Further, subsection 162(2) of the IRPA directs each division to deal with all proceedings before it as informally and quickly as the circumstances and the considerations of fairness and natural justice permit. The claimants\u2019 claims were identified as those that could be processed through the RPD expedited process for Egyptian claims. The RPD received the claimants\u2019 signed certificates of readiness for the expedited process on July 0, 2018.2 Having carefully considered the evidence in this case, the panel finds that these claims meet the criteria for the expedited determination. These claims have therefore been decided without a hearing, according to the Policy on the Expedited Processing of Refugee Claims by the Refugee Protection Division.3\nALLEGATIONS\n[4] The claimants\u2019 allegations are described in detail in their Basis of Claim Forms (BOC). However, they can be summarized as follows.\n[5] Although the P.C. was born in Kuwait, she is not a Permanent Resident there, but rather is a citizen of Egypt. She was born as a Sunni Muslim but converted to Christianity. Her children were baptized Christian. The P.C.\u2019s in-laws disapproved of her desire to convert. In fact, her sister-in-law threatened that the family would put her in a psychiatric hospital where she would be killed.\n[6] The P.C.\u2019s husband explained that Kuwaiti authorities would not help, but in fact they might accuse her of inciting sectarian strife and destabilizing the country and she could be killed under Sharia law.\n[7] On XXXX XXXX 2016, the P.C. took her children to Turkey thinking it was a secular state, but found it was not. In XXXX 2017, the P.C. returned to Kuwait to apply for a Canadian visa. It was denied, however, since she had a US visa, she entered Canada via the U.S.\nDETERMINATION\n[8] I find that the claimants are Convention refugees.\nANALYSIS\nIdentities\n[9] The claimants\u2019 identities have been established as per their Egyptian passports, birth certificates and marriage contracts. In fact, they submitted copious documents to prove that they are whom they allege to be.\nCredibility\n[10] In addition to the identity documents, the P.C. has submitted a certificate in which it indicates that the P.C.\u2019s sister-in-law\u2019s husband works with the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. As well, the claimants have provided country documents with respect to the treatment of individuals who convert to Christianity.\n[11] The panel has reviewed the claimants\u2019 evidence and finds that it is not internally inconsistent, inherently implausible or contradicted by documentary evidence on country conditions in Egypt.\n[12] The panel finds that the claimants have established that there is a serious possibility of suffering serious harm should they return to Egypt due to their identity as Christian convert.\n[13] This finding is supported by the national documentary evidence proffered by the Immigration and Refugee Board (the Board).4 Objective evidence indicates that abuses of Christians were increasing even before the fall of the Mubarak regime. Christian property, including homes, businesses, and churches, have been destroyed, and Christians have been the primary target of violent sectarian attacks. Christians have been arrested and detained; they have also faced harassment, rape, mental and physical abuse, and pressure to convert to Islam; police officers have been involved in the persecution of Christians. The state has not adequately protected Christians, and has failed to prosecute perpetrators.5\n[14] The United States Department of State reports that Egypt is a republic governed by an elected president. The last elections, both presidential and legislative, have been described by election monitors as having respected the national legislation on electoral matters. On the other hand, these same monitors have expressed serious reservations regarding the restrictions imposed by government authorities during the election campaigns, particularly with regard to freedom of expression and association.6 Nevertheless, despite these restrictions, the panel is of the view that the presumption of state protection is applicable in this case.7\n[15] The constitution adopted in 2014 guarantees freedom of religion and expressly recognizes the right of Christians, as well as Jews and Muslims, to practise their religion and to build their places of worship. It also recognizes the right to equality before the law and stipulates that discrimination and incitement to hatred are prohibited by law. It is reported, however, that the provisions of the new constitution are slow to be implemented. In fact, it is not so much the legal framework that is deficient, but rather the application by the institutions of laws and regulations that is greatly deficient.8\n[16] The evidence reveals that Christians represent 5 to 10 percent of the Egyptian population. Of these, 90 percent are Coptic Christians. The documentary evidence indicates that Coptic Christians have experienced and continue to experience discrimination and intimidation because of their religious beliefs, particularly in areas where there are many Muslim Brotherhood supporters. Over time, they have also been the target of sectarian violence.9\n[17] Admittedly, it is reported that this violence has decreased following the incidents that shook the Coptic community during the year 2013 and that the Head of State has continued the rapprochement he had begun with the members of the community following these incidents.10 However, it is reported that to this day, tensions, discrimination, and the threat of violence remain a constant problem. Coptic Christians have been the target of harassment and attacks on their property. It is also reported that they have been the victims of a large number of assaults of all kinds, as well as prosecution for blasphemy, proselytizing, and denigration of religion.11 Violent incidents and threats against the Copts in recent months do not seem to indicate an improvement in the situation.12\n[18] In recent years, a number of international human rights bodies have denounced the behaviour of police and judicial authorities towards members of the Coptic community. Indeed, either because of lack of means, or will, or because of their own involvement, it is reported that the police and judicial authorities do not intervene to protect Coptic Christians who are victims of criminal acts. These sources also denounce the use by government authorities of \u201ccustomary reconciliation\u201d sessions rather than legal proceedings to deal with cases of violence affecting members of religious minorities. This forces the victims to drop all formal charges in order to buy peace and to avoid any legal proceedings against the aggressors. This state of affairs, as well as the slowness shown by the authorities to prosecute the crimes committed against Coptic Christians, continue to foster an atmosphere of impunity.13\n[19] In light of the above, the panel finds that the claimants have established, on a balance of probabilities, that there is an objective basis to their claims. In addition, the panel finds that the claimants have rebutted the presumption of state protection. They have established, on a balance of probabilities, that there is clear and convincing evidence that the state is both unable and unwilling to protect them.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[20] The panel finds that there is no relevant Internal Flight Alternative in Egypt for individuals such as the claimants. The panel comes to that conclusion because, according to the above-cited documentary evidence, Christians are presently exposed to a constant risk of persecution wherever they may be located.\n[21] Accordingly, all claims are accepted.\n(signed) ROSLYN AHARA\nMarch 1, 2019\n1 Refugee Protection Division Rules, SOR\/2012-256.\n2 Exhibit 6.\n3 Policy on the Expedited Processing of Refugee Claims by the Refugee Protection Division, effective September 18, 2015.\n4 Exhibit 3, National Documentation Package (NDP) for Egypt (29 June 2018).\n5 Ibid., items 12.1 and 12.8,\n6 Ibid., item 2.1.\n7 Canada (Attorney General) v.

MacLean\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Imtenan Abd El Razik\nCountry: Egypt\nRPD Number: TB8-01796\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2020-00518\nATIP Pages: 000360-000370\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] XXXX XXXX XXXX, claims to be a citizens of Egypt, and is claiming refugee protection pursuant to ss. 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).1\n[2] The claimant\u2019s allegations are set out in her Basis of Claim Form (BOC), and are summarized as follows. The claimant alleges that if returned to Egypt she faces persecution on the basis of her imputed political opinion, as the family member of a person who is perceived by the Egyptian regime as being a member or supporter of the Muslim Brotherhood.\n[3] The claimant is married to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX was born on XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, in Sharkia Egypt.2 The claimant alleges, that from June 9, 1993, until January 17, 2005, XXXX was held in detention by the security forces of the then regime of Hosni Mubarak.3 The claimant alleges that XXXX detention was politically motivated and baseless, and that he was never charged, tried, or convicted of any crimes against the Egyptian state. She alleges that XXXX was perceived to be an Islamist, and consequently, a threat to the Egyptian regime. The panel considered a judgment from a case for compensation made by the \u201cPreliminary Court of South Cairo\u201d in favour of the Plaintiff, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX against the Defendant, the Egyptian Minister of the Interior, in the amount of 12,000 LE plus legal fees.4\n[4] The claimant alleges, that following his release from detention, she married XXXX and then arranged for him to join her in Saudi Arabia, where she had worked as a XXXX since 1998. The claimant alleges that her status in Saudi Arabia was contingent upon her having employment, which she had secured with XXXX XXXX, a member of the Saudi Royal family. Similarly, the claimant alleges that XXXX was able to secure his status on the basis of his employment by XXXX XXXX, another member of the Saudi Royal family.\n[5] The claimant and XXXX have three children, all born in Saudi Arabia. The claimant alleges that her children were registered against XXXX Saudi Arabian resident permit.\n[6] The claimant alleges, that in 2007 XXXX returned to Egypt briefly, in order to sell a certain property he owned, and that during his brief time in the country he was detained by Egyptian security officials on his arrival, questioned as to his whereabouts and activities, and that on his departure he was again detained and subject to questioning. The claimant alleges that XXXX swore never to return to Egypt.\n[7] The claimant alleges that in 2016 she was given notice by her employer that her job was ending, because her employer and her children were relocating to the US so that her children could attend school there. Similarly, Ahmed received notice from his employer that his contract would not be renewed because she was reducing her staff. The claimant alleges that fearing a return to Egypt, she and XXXX set out to find a country to which they could relocate. Attempts to travel to New Zealand were unsuccessful, and subsequently, on or about October 24, 2016, she and her family were issued tourist visas for Brazil, to which they all travelled on XXXX XXXX, 2016.5\n[8] The claimant alleges that from their arrival in Brazil, the family encountered difficulties with crime making them fearful of remaining there. The claimant alleges that it was decided to try to find another jurisdiction to which the family could flee, and that as her residency permit was still valid, she returned to Saudi Arabia on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2017. Where she was temporarily sponsored as a member of XXXX XXXX staff, as a courtesy, to enable her to find employment elsewhere. The claimant alleges that by the latter half of 2017, being unable to secure employment, and despairing from being separated from her family, she felt the need to return to Brazil for which she received a visa on November 26, 2017.\n[9] The claimant alleges, that on the basis of advice received from the person helping her obtain her Brazilian visa, she applied for a visa to come to Canada, which was issued on January 8, 2018. The claimant travelled to Canada on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018, where upon she made her claim for refugee protection.\nDETERMINATION\n[10] The panel finds that the claimant has met the onus to demonstrate that she is a Convention refugee, on the grounds of her imputed political opinion. Her claim is accepted.\nIssues\n[11] Identity and Credibility are always at issue, as is whether the claimant has a well-founded fear of persecution. The panel also considered whether the claimant had continuing status in Saudi Arabia or had achieved status in Brazil.\nAnalysis\nIdentity\n[12] The claimant\u2019s identity and Egyptian nationality are established on the basis of her testimony, and her valid Egyptian passport.\nCredibility\n[13] The presumption of truthfulness applies to the claimant\u2019s sworn testimony, unless there is a reason to doubt its truthfulness.6 Material contradictions, inconsistencies, and omissions in the claimant\u2019s evidence, if not satisfactorily explained, are a basis upon which the RPD may find that a claimant lacks credibility. A general finding of lack of credibility on the part of the applicant may extend to all relevant information flowing from her testimony.7\n[14] The panel makes a general finding that the claimant is a credible witness. Her testimony was spontaneous, complete, and consistent with the information contained in her BOC. She answered all questions put to her to the best of her ability. Her testimony was appropriately buttressed by objective documentary evidence.\nClaimant\u2019s Status in Brazil\n[15] Despite having made a claim for refugee protection in Brazil, the claimant does not have any legal status in Brazil. Among the documents disclosed by the Minister, were copies of documents written in Portuguese bearing the photographs of an adult male and three children. The documents were not translated, however, each document includes the words \u201cSolicita\u00e7\u00e3o de ref\u00fagio\u201d which literally translates as \u201cRequest for Refuge.\u201d The four documents were all issued on December 7, 2016, with validity through December 7, 2017. Also included in the document is reference to Brazilian law 9,474\/1997. The panel takes notice that Brazilian law 9,474\/1997 is the legislation defining the mechanisms for implementing the 1951 Geneva Convention and the 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, roughly the equivalent of Part Two of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act dealing with refugee protection.\n[16] The claimant testified that she too had been issued this form, but it was not among the documents she brought to Canada. Given the expiry date on the forms issued to the other family members, the claimant was asked if she had renewed her claim, which she answered in the negative.\n[17] The claimant\u2019s husband XXXX gave testimony by teleconference from Brazil and was queried on his knowledge of these documents. XXXX testified, that while the claimant had been issued such a document in 2016, because she was no longer in Brazil it had not been renewed, as had the documents for himself and the children. XXXX testified that the renewal of his form was automatic, and that new ones were not issued for the children. The panel ordered the production of the most recent documents pertaining to XXXX and\/or the children. Received post-hearing, the panel considered that XXXX is in possession of a Brazilian refugee claim form valid through December 7, 2018.8\n[18] Asked if his claim had been the subject of a hearing, XXXX answered in the negative. Asked if the document granted the children and him any status, he testified that it allowed them to live in Brazil and rent accommodation, but did not grant the right to have bank accounts, driver\u2019s license, or to work. Based on these documents, and the testimony of both the claimant and her husband on the subject of their possibly having status in Brazil, the panel is stratified, that at best, XXXX and the children have open refugee claims that have not been determined.\nThe Claimant Cannot Return to Saudi Arabia\n[19] The panel takes notice of the fact that the admission of foreign workers to Saudi Arabia is regulated, and that in order to have a right to reside there a person requires an employment sponsor. The testimony of the claimant, about how she and XXXX were able to reside and work in Saudi Arabia, is consistent with the panel\u2019s understanding of the process by which foreign nationals are able to reside in Saudi Arabia.\n[20] The panel considered the \u201cElectronic Exit Re-Entry Visa (single) with Duration issued to the claimant. The document makes reference to an Iqama, which is the term used in Saudi Arabia for a residence permit, issued to foreigners who arrive in Saudi Arabia on an employment visa. The claimant\u2019s document indicates that her Iqama was valid through January 9, 2019, but it bears an exit before date of April 14, 2018. The document stipulates that the Visa is valid for stays up to 90 days, or until the Exit Before Date, and that the Visa holder is not allowed to re-enter Saudi Arabia if the Iqama has expired or after the Exit-Entry Visa expiry date. In this case, the claimant was granted a 60 day stay, and no dependents were included in the visa. The claimant entered Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2018, and therefore as of April 4, 2018, her right to re-enter Saudi Arabia had expired. The panel is satisfied that neither the claimant nor XXXX currently have a right to enter and remain in Saudi Arabia, and thus, there is no question of their being able to return there as neither have a valid Visa.\nWell-founded Fear of Persecution\n[21] On the surface, the claimant does not have a claim. If anyone should be before the panel it is XXXX but he is in Brazil.\n[22] On the face of the facts before the panel, XXXX would have a clear claim for refugee protection on the grounds of a well-founded fear of persecution, because of his imputed political opinion. But, at what risk is the claimant? The claimant argues that the risk to her is collateral to that faced by XXXX, on the basis of their relationship and the likelihood that the regime, which is dead set on exacting retribution on the Muslim Brotherhood, would have no compunction to use the claimant in order to get to XXXX.\n[23] Is there any evidence to support such a conclusion? The panel considers that prior to 2005, the claimant was largely an unknown quantity in Egypt. She had grown up and obtained her education in an uneventful way. The Egyptian state came into her life only in 1993, after she and XXXX were engaged to be wed. XXXX disappeared several weeks after their engagement, and because the claimant was not then a tier one relative (parent or spouse), she was not allowed to visit him after he was eventually located within the Egyptian security system. It was only after XXXX release in January 2005, that the couple could continue their relationship; marrying that July. The claimant testified that three days after she wed, XXXX she was taken by a security officer to the local office and questioned. The claimant testified that she felt very worried, as this was the first time she had been to such a place.\n[24] The claimant remained in Egypt until the beginning of the school year, when she returned to Saudi Arabia and began preparing the documents to support his joining her there, which he did in 2006. XXXX had no difficulty leaving Egypt in 2006, but when he returned briefly to sell property in 2007, he was detained at the airport for several hours, both on his entry, and exit. The claimant testified that the local security office in Sharkia was contacted to see if there were any concerns. XXXX testified that it was because of his treatment in 2007 that he vowed never to return to Egypt, which he has not.\n[25] For her part, the claimant has only returned to Egypt once since 2005. In 2010 she returned to her home to visit family, taking her children, then only two with her. Asked if anything untoward befell her on this trip, the claimant testified that she entered normally but that when she went to apply for the renewal of her permit to work outside Egypt, which had been issued the same day the last time she applied, on this occasion its renewal was delayed for three days without any explanation. Thus, despite her low profile, there is some evidence that the claimant has come to the attention of the authorities in Egypt at the time of her marriage in 2005, and again in 2010.\nObjective Evidence of Human Rights Abuses and the Treatment of those Perceived to be members of the Muslim Brotherhood\n[26] Both the return trips to Egypt occurred before the events of 2011, which saw Hosni Mubarak removed from office, the Muslim Brotherhood legalized and elected to parliamentary power in the 2011 general election, and ultimately, the election of Mohamed Morsi as President in June 2012. The Morsi government was brief, his being ousted by the military in a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat in July 2013, following which General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi assumed power. Under the \u201cSisi\u201d regime, the Muslim Brotherhood has been banned and declared a terrorist organization.9\n[27] The documentary evidence confirms, that under the Sisi regime,\n[H]undreds of [Muslim Brotherhood] members and supporters have been put on trial and given harsh sentences in multiple cases. Rights advocates have repeatedly criticised the mass prosecutions, saying they lack guarantees for a fair trial.\u201d10\n[28] Harsh treatment has been reported for persons alleged to be supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood. In the same document it notes that,\n[A]ccording to Human Rights Watch, on 11 April 2015, \u201c51 alleged supporters of Egypt\u2019s Muslim Brotherhood\u201d were tried in a mass trial, where a judge sentenced \u201c37 people to life in prison and confirmed the death penalties of 14 others.11\n[29] In a 2017 report published by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, its author reports that, since the return of military rule in 2013,\n[A] new authoritarian regime has emerged in Egypt. The military establishment, security services, and intelligence agencies now rule the country and have managed to reintroduce fear as a daily constant in a nation still in dire straits.12\n[30] Elsewhere in the document it relates that:\nAfter a brief democratic opening, a new authoritarian regime has emerged in Egypt. The military establishment, security services, and intelligence agencies now rule the country and have managed to reintroduce fear as a daily constant in a nation still in dire straits.\n\u2026\nUsing undemocratic legal and judicial tools with a zeal unmatched even during the long authoritarian rule of former president Hosni Mubarak (1981-2011), Egypt\u2019 s generals are closing the public space by cracking down on autonomous civil society and independent political parties, asphyxiating the practice of pluralist politics, and pushing citizens away from peaceful and active engagement in public affairs. Scare tactics and police brutality are being used for wide-scale repression. Key opposition groups such as the Muslim Brotherhood, a small number of political parties, human rights defenders, and young activists are under immense pressure and struggling against the yoke of the government.13\n[31] Amnesty International in its 2018 \u201cEgypt. Amnesty International Report 2017\/18: The State of the World\u2019s Human Rights\u201d reports that:\nEgypt\u2019s human rights crisis continued unabated. The authorities used torture and other ill-treatment and enforced disappearance against hundreds of people, and dozens were extrajudicially executed with impunity. The crackdown on civil society escalated with NGO staff being subjected to additional interrogations, travel bans and asset freezes. Arbitrary arrests and detentions followed by grossly unfair trials of government critics, peaceful protesters, journalists and human rights defenders were routine. Mass unfair trials continued before civilian and military courts, with dozens sentenced to death. Women continued to be subjected to sexual and gender-based violence and were discriminated against in law and practice.14\n[32] Other items in the Human Rights section of the NDP speak to a worsening human rights situation, government actors acting with impunity, the crack down on opponents of the government perceived or otherwise. Thus, the objective evidence supports a conclusion that political freedoms and human rights are being curtailed by the government and its agents, and that, in particular, members or perceived supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood are being targeted.\nExpert Opinion\n[33] The claimant has filed an expert report prepared for her by Dr. XXXX XXXX XXXX\nXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, dated December 21, 2018.15 The panel has considered Dr. XXXX Curriculum Vita, and is satisfied that he is qualified to provide an opinion on human rights and the political situation in Egypt.16 In his report, he provided a political context for his opinion, citing various sources, including several as found in the NDP for Egypt. His major conclusions mirror the panel\u2019s findings in respect of the human rights and political situation in Egypt.\n[34] In this context, he offers the following, in respect of the claimant and her husband:\n\u201cIf the [claimant] were to return to Egypt, she would face a non-trival risk of arrest given her marriage to XXXX XXXX, who from his activity at his university and local mosque, appears to be someone who the regime viewed as supporting the [Muslim Brotherhood].\u201d\nGiven his lengthy imprisonment under the Mubarak regime XXXX \u201cfaces a heightened risk of reimprisonment should he return to Egypt.\u201d\nThe claimant has \u201csuffered harassment at the hands of the Egyptian security apparatus as a result of her marriage to Mr. XXXX.\u201d\nGiven the sharp increase in political repression since 2013, should she return to Egypt, \u201cthe Egyptian security services might increase their harassment of [the Claimant], perhaps even arrest her, either on accusations of belonging to a banned organization or in an attempt to pressure [XXXX] to return to Egypt.\u201d\nThe fact that XXXX was released from prison during the Mubarak era \u201cis no evidence that he is no longer of interest to the Egyptian government.\u201d\nThe Egyptian authorities \u201chave long employed a kind of \u2018catch and release\u2019 approach in which large numbers of people who are known to the security apparatus (with or without charges) are swept up whenever there is unrest.\u201d\n\u201d \u2026 targeting family members and friends of political prisoners for persecution based purely on their association with a political prisoner has been an all too common method of operation in Egypt over decades of military rule.\n\u201d \u2026 the record before me very strongly supports of the conclusion that [the claimant] has a reasonable basis for fearing political persecution should she return to Egypt.\u201d\nCONCLUSION\n[35] The panel finds, that in consideration of both the subjective and objective evidence, there is a nexus between the claimant\u2019s situation and the Convention ground of political opinion. The panel finds that on a looking forward assessment, should the claimant be returned to Egypt, there is a serious possibility that she will face persecution at the hands of the state or state actors, owing to her being associated by marriage to a known victim of state persecution, to wit, her husband XXXX. Since the state is the likely agent of persecution, the panel need not consider either state protection or an internal flight alternative, for there would be no place in Egypt that she would be safe, from the state. Accordingly, the panel finds that the claimant is a Convention refugee and accepts her claim.\n(signed) KENNETH D. MACLEAN\nJanuary 17, 2019\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.

Loebach\nCountry: Egypt\nRPD Number: TB8-01427\nAssociated RPD Number(s): TB8-01467, TB8-01477, TB8-01478\nATIP Number: A-2020-00518\nATIP Pages: 000318-000326\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] XXXX XXXX XXXX (the principal claimant, hereinafter referred to as the P.C.), her spouse, XXXX XXXX, their daughter, XXXX XXXX XXXX all citizens of Egypt, and their son, XXXX XXXX XXXX who is a citizen of the United States (US), are claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).1\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] The claimants\u2019 allegations are described in detail in the P.C.\u2019s Basis of Claim Form (BOC).2 However, they can be summarized as follows.\n[3] The P.C.\u2019s father is Palestinian, and despite the fact that she was born in Egypt to an Egyptian mother, it was difficult for her to get Egyptian citizenship. She was issued a Palestinian travel document from birth. Finally, she obtained Egyptian citizenship in 2012 after the revolution.\n[4] The P.C. faced a lot of harassment because of her Palestinian roots through school and even in her adult life. In 2011, she became engaged to an Egyptian military officer, following which she discovered that he was abusive, controlling and he wanted her to leave her employment and wear a hijab. When she refused, he hit her, so she ended the engagement.\n[5] On XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, the P.C married another man, XXXX XXXX. However her previous fianc\u00e9 would harass both her and her husband until she left for Canada.\nIn February 2014, state security came to the P.C.\u2019s husband\u2019s father\u2019s home, accusing him and the P.C.\u2019s husband of being a member of the Muslim brotherhood. On December 17, 2017, an attempt was made to kidnap the claimants\u2019 daughter.\n[6] On November 01, 2017, the P.C.\u2019s husband\u2019s Kuwait visa was revoked. She and her husband re-availed themselves to Egypt multiple times from Saudia Arabia, Kuwait, and even the US (after her son was born there) in 2016 and 2017.\nDETERMINATION\n[7] The panel finds that the P.C., her husband and their daughter would face a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground, and that, on a balance of probabilities, they would personally be subjected to a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or a danger of torture upon return to Egypt.\n[8] No evidence was adduced with respect to the P.C.\u2019s son\u2019s claim against the US. Accordingly, the panel finds that XXXX XXXX is not a Convention refugee, nor a person in need of protection.\nANALYSIS\n[9] The determinative issues in this claim are credibility, subjective fear and state protection.\nIdentity\n[10] On a balance of probabilities, the panel finds that the claimants have established their identities. They have submitted Egyptian passports for the P.C., her husband and daughter,3 Egyptian citizenship,4 and marriage certificate,5 and a US passport for their son.6 They have also provided a letter which indicates the termination of the P.C.\u2019s husband\u2019s employment in Kuwait, and his residency permit.7\nCredibility\n[11] In considering credibility, the panel is aware of the difficulties that may be faced by the claimants in establishing his claim, namely, the setting of the hearing room, and the stress inherent in responding to questions.\n[12] The onus is on the person making a refugee claim to present evidence that is credible on a balance of probabilities to support the allegations which form the basis of his claim.8 In this case, the panel finds that the claimants have met that onus.\n[13] While statements given under oath are presumed to be true, that presumption can be rebutted by contradictions or inconsistencies in the evidence.9 In reviewing the evidence, the panel \u201cmay also conclude that a claimant\u2019s evidence is implausible, or improbable, or dubious, or untenable, or unreliable, or absurd, or unconvincing.\u201d10\n[14] The panel found the P.C.\u2019s husband to be candid in his responses, and there were no inconsistencies or contradictions.\nSubjective fear\n[15] These claims were originally set down pursuant to section 170(f) of the IRPA, which provides that the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) may allow a claim for refugee protection without a hearing, unless the Minister has notified the RPD of the Minister\u2019s intention to intervene within the time limit set out in the Refugee Protection Division Rules.11 Further, subsection 162(2) of IRPA directs \u201ceach Division to deal with all proceedings before it as informally and quickly as the circumstances and the considerations of fairness and natural justice permit.\u201d12 This claim was identified as one that could be processed through the RPD expedited process for Egyptian claims. The RPD received the claimants\u2019 signed certificate of readiness for the expedited process on August 13, 2018.13 Having carefully considered the evidence in this case, it was deemed necessary to conduct a hearing to examine the subjective fear of the claimants, given the issues of failure to claim elsewhere, re-availment, and delay in claiming, and also to clarify the countries of reference.\n[16] After hearing the evidence the panel found the following:\n\nThe P.C.\u2019s daughter, although born in Saudi Arabia has no status there, but is a citizen of Egypt.The P.C.\u2019s husband has no residency rights in Kuwait after losing his employment there.The P.C. also fears the fact that her father was a Palestinian.The P.C.\u2019s husband, who provided the testimony, acknowledged that he had applied for a US visa in 2014, but was rejected due to insufficient documentation on two occasions. However, they were accepted in May 2017.The P.C.\u2019s husband lost his status in Saudi Arabia as a consequence of losing his employment 2011-2014.Six months later, the P.C.\u2019s husband went to Kuwait, and he lost his status in November 2017.XXXX 2017, the P.C. and her husband went to the US to visit and have a baby. According to the husband\u2019s testimony, he had insurance, and his wife was granted permission to travel in a late pregnancy.According to the P.C.\u2019s husband, their problems did not begin until after their return from the US on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2017.The claimants left Egypt and went to the US as they already had valid visas, but it was always their intention to claim in Canada, because the P.C. has relatives here.The claimants fear the P.C.\u2019s former fianc\u00e9. They went to the police, but when the police became aware that the perpetrator was an army officer, they decided not to get involved in any investigation.The P.C\u2019s husband. also fears the fact that he has been perceived to be a part of the Muslim Brotherhood.[17] The panel was satisfied after examining the foregoing that other than their trip to have a child born in the US, their re-availments were not abnormal, because the P.C.\u2019s husband had valid employment, and the incident which gave rise to their departure had not occurred earlier.\n[18] Moreover, the panel notes that the claimants provided copious documents to support their claims. These included identity documents, termination of employment documents,14 declarations from the P.C.\u2019s father, brother, and friend, her husband\u2019s brother, father and uncle, and an investigation report.15 The panel further finds that the evidence contained in the claimants\u2019 record and their testimony, is corroborated by the documentary evidence.\n[19] In view of the above, and in the context of a forward-looking assessment of the claimants\u2019 fears, the panel finds that should the claimants return to Egypt, there remains a risk of persecution beyond a mere possibility. The risk is further underscored by the documentary evidence adduced concerning the absence of state protection,16 as well as the absence of a viable IFA for the claimants in view of his particular circumstances.\n[20] Country documents indicate that significant human rights issues in Egypt include arbitrary or unlawful killing (by government agents), torture, and harsh and potentially life-threatening prison conditions.17 Furthermore, the Muslim Brotherhood has been outlawed and hundreds of Muslim Brotherhood members and supporters have been put on trial and given harsh sentences.18 Human rights organizations have concerns about the fairness and transparency of these trials.\n[21] The panel is of the view that the claimants\u2019 allegations in their BOC narrative are, on the balance of probabilities, true. The panel has does not have a good reason to not believe the claimants\u2019 allegations.\nProspective Risk of Return to Egypt\n[22] The claimant\u2019s husband fears persecution if he returns to his country of nationality, Egypt, because of his political opinions. As explained above, he has been accused of being affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood and as such, he is considered a political opponent by the current Egyptian regime. The panel finds that the P.C.\u2019s husband has established a link between his situation and a Convention ground, that is, his political opinions, whether real or imputed.\n[23] Furthermore, the P.C. and her husband are being targeted by a member of the army, and the police are refusing to conduct any investigation or provide any protection.\n[24] The panel has also taken into consideration the evidence regarding the current situation in Egypt, particularly concerning those perceived as being political opponents to the regime.19 According to the objective evidence, the Egyptian authorities are known for their repression of freedom of expression and association, notably repression of those who are considered political opponents.20 The US Department of State reports that the most significant human rights issues included:\n\u2026 unlawful or arbitrary killings by the government or its agents and terrorist groups; forced disappearances; torture; arbitrary detention; harsh and life\u00ad threatening prison conditions; arbitrary arrest and detention; political prisoners; arbitrary or unlawful interference with privacy; undue restrictions on free expression, the press, and the internet, including censorship, site blocking, and criminal libel; substantial interference with the rights of peaceful assembly and freedom of association, including government control over registration and financing of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) \u2026 21\n[25] According to the objective evidence on file, there are numerous reports that the Egyptian forces have used excessive force against activists and opponents, particularly during the demonstrations in 2011 and in 2013.22 A new wave of arrests began in May 2015. Sources indicate that thousands of people who are perceived as opponents to the current government have been detained for extended periods of time, which, in many cases, could be considered enforced disappearances.\n[26] There are also recent reports that indicate that members of the Egyptian military have committed acts that may amount to human rights violations, including arbitrary arrests and detention, torture, enforced disappearances, and extrajudicial killings.23 The objective evidence on file indicates that family members of perceived opponents were also subjected to these treatments. Finally, reports also indicate that there were problems with impunity for officials who committed abuses and unfairness in the judicial system.\n[27] The panel notes that in this particular case, according to the allegations, which have been deemed credible, the P.C.\u2019s husband has been accused of being a member of the Muslim Brotherhood. In consideration of the entirety of the evidence, including his particular situation, and in the absence of evidence to the contrary, the panel accepts that the P.C.\u2019s husband may be perceived as a political opponent upon returning to Egypt.\n[28] For all of the reasons explained above, considering the treatment of real or perceived political opponents and dissenters by the Egyptian authorities, as well as the risk from the P.C.\u2019s former fianc\u00e9e, the panel concludes that there is a serious possibility that the P.C.\u2019s husband may face persecution based on a Convention ground, that being his real or perceived political opinion, upon return to his country of nationality, Egypt.\nState protection and internal flight alternative (IFA)\n[29] Case law establishes a presumption that a state is capable of providing adequate protection to its citizens. In order to rebut this presumption, claimants must demonstrate, through clear and convincing evidence, that the authorities are not able or willing to provide them adequate protection given the alleged risks. Claimants must establish that they have a well\u00ad founded fear of persecution throughout their country of nationality.\n[30] The panel has taken into consideration that the P.C.\u2019s husband has been accused of being a member of the Muslim Brotherhood by the Egyptian authorities, he and the P.C. are fearful of her former fianc\u00e9, and she has encountered problems as a result of her father being a Palestinian.\n[31] As explained above, the panel has taken into consideration the objective evidence regarding the situation in Egypt, particularly regarding the treatment of political opponents and those who are perceived as such. Regarding those considered opponents and dissenters, it is reported:\nThe authorities used prolonged pre-trial detention, often for periods of more than two years, as means to punish dissidents.24\nAccording to the Report of the OHCHR Mission to Egypt in 2011:\n\u2026In addition, strikes, unregistered financial donations were formally banned, and thousands of opponents were arbitrarily detained and allegedly tortured. In fact, the Emergency Law gave the Government the right to detain individuals indefinitely, without any judicial safeguards.25\nPresident SISI has come under repeated international criticism for an ongoing government crackdown against various forms of political dissent and freedom of expression. Certain practices of Sisi\u2019s government, the parliament, and the security apparatus have been contentious, including:\n\u2026 police brutality, the apparently deliberate use of torture by security forces, and reported enforced disappearances of political opponents\u202626\n[32] As indicated above, there are reports of impunity for officials who committed abuses.\n[33] Upon consideration of the entirety of the evidence, the panel finds that the treatment of political opponents and dissidents, orthose perceived as such, is not limited to any regions in Egypt, but is widespread. The panel notes that the laws currently used to repress political opponents are national laws, and may be applied throughout Egypt.\n[34] Therefore, for all of the reasons explained above, and in consideration of the claimant\u2019s particular situation, as well as the current conditions in Egypt, the panel finds that there is clear and convincing evidence that state protection is not adequate for the claimants if they were to return to their home country at this time. The panel concludes that the presumption of state protection has been rebutted in these particular circumstances.\n[35] The panel further finds that there is a serious possibility of persecution for the claimants throughout Egypt. Therefore, a viable IFA is currently not available for the claimants within Egypt.\nCONCLUSION\n[36] Having considered all of the evidence, the panel finds that the claimants, the P.C., her husband, and their daughter, are Convention refugees as set out in section 96 of the IRPA. Their US-born son, XXXX XXXX XXXX, is determined not to be a Convention refugee, nor a person in need of protection.\n(signed) ROSLYN AHARA\nJune 20, 2019\n1 The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c.27, as amended, [IRPA], sections 96 and 97(1).\n2 Exhibit 2.1, Basis of Claim Form (BOC) \u2013 TB8-01427.\n3 Exhibit 1, Package of Information from the Referring CBSA\/CIC, Certified True Copies of Passports.\n4 Exhibit 4, Identity Documents 1, at pp. 33-35.\n5 Ibid., at p. 23.\n6 Exhibit 5, Identity Documents 2, at pp. 28-33.\n7 Exhibit 4, Identity Documents 1, at pp. 73-74.\n8 Orelien, Joseph v.

Short\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Zainab Jamal\nCountry: Egypt\nRPD Number: TB8-00625\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2020-00518\nATIP Pages: 000288 \u2013 000294\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, 34 is a citizen of Egypt who claims to have a well-founded fear of persecution in that country on the account of the fact that he is perceived by the ruling regime of President El-Sisi to be a member of, or a supporter of the Muslim Brotherhood. He accordingly claims to be a Convention refugee within the meaning of section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).1 The claimant also claims to be a person in need of protection within the meaning of subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).2\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] The following factual allegations are made by the claimant that he would face persecution in Egypt because of perceived political opinion, which has established a connection to a ground for claiming protection as a Convention refugee.\n[3] The claimant alleges that he was a small businessman in Egypt and owned a shop selling XXXX and other items. He was a supporter of President Morsi, because he thought that Morsi would act for the good of the common people, when he was elected President of Egypt in 2012. However, General El-Sisi came to power by a military coup in 2013.\n[4] On May 7, 2013, the claimant was arrested while taking part in a peaceful demonstration in front of the Ibrahim Morsi Mosque. The claimant says that he was accused of being part of the Freedom and Justice Party (a part of the Muslim Brotherhood) and was detained for 17 days. During that time the claimant was repeatedly beaten, and kept in inhumane conditions, consisting of severe overcrowding, no toilet facilities, and being forced to sleep on the floor in the same place where he had to urinate.\n[5] After that experience, the claimant, upon his release, resolved not to take part in any further political activity.\n[6] All was calm until 2016, when El-Sisi took the decision to cede the islands of Tiran and Sanafir to Saudi Arabia. The claimant, who held deep feelings about this subject, put a sign in his window that effectively stated that Egypt was not for sale. The claimant believes that the sign led the police to beat down his door at 4:00 am on December 5, 2016 and arrested him again. This time the claimant was taken to jail in his pyjamas where he was pushed down the steps and as a result he suffered a fracture to his left leg. Although the claimant\u2019s leg was broken, he was refused medical attention and was beaten for making a lot of noise. During his time in jail the second time, the claimant was tortured and held in solitary confinement for four days. After being held for a total of nine days, the claimant was released.\n[7] On December 18, 2016, he immediately sought medical attention for his left leg and was informed that it had been fractured. His leg was put in a cast for about six weeks afterwards.\n[8] The claimant maintains that after this last episode, he was thoroughly sick and tired of Egypt and sought another country to live in. To that end, he travelled to the United Kingdom (U.K.) in April of 2017. In England, the claimant consulted a lawyer, who advised him that successfully claiming refugee protection would take a long time and that he would have a better chance to successfully claim refugee status if he returned to Egypt and obtained U.K. visitors visas for his wife and children. Taking the lawyer\u2019s advice, the claimant returned to Egypt in XXXX of 2017.\n[9] After returning to Egypt, the claimant heard that Canada was also a country to which he and his family could potentially travel and seek shelter. The claimant applied for a Canadian visa in July 2017.\n[10] The claimant remembers briefly discussing the handing over of the two islands to a friend on the street. The next day, while the claimant was away, purchasing inventory for his store, he was contacted by his employee via telephone. The employee informed him that the police had come to his store and wished to arrest the claimant. Later, the police went to the claimant\u2019s home looking for him; when he could not be found, they arrested his brother. His brother was later released after questioning.\n[11] In the meantime, the claimant hid out at a cousin\u2019s house in another province. His visa to Canada was issued and his brother, who had held his passport was able to send it to the claimant through an intermediary.\n[12] The claimant then purchased his airline ticket to come to Canada. He was able to leave Cairo with the assistance of his cousin who had connections to officialdom. The claimant was able to move through Cairo airport where his documents were examined twice. He left Egypt on XXXX XXXX, 2017 and arrived in Canada shortly thereafter. He applied for refugee protection in December of 2018.\nDETERMINATION\n[13] The panel accepts the certified copy of the claimant\u2019s Egyptian passport3 entered into evidence and finds that the claimant is who he claims to be and is a citizen of Egypt.\nThe panel finds that the claimant is a Convention refugee and accepts his claim for protection.\nANALYSIS\n[14] The claimant has presented a number of documents, which in my opinion corroborate his allegations of fact. Specifically, I have taken note of the following documents and their certified translations; medical report4 confirming that the claimant suffered a broken leg; record of arrest;5 as well as letters from the claimant\u2019s father, brother, and cousin.6\n[15] Given the claimant\u2019s testimony and the documentary evidence, I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the allegations of fact alleged by the claimant are more likely are true.\n[16] Even though I am somewhat skeptical about the way that the claimant left Egypt for the second time, I am mindful that, although it is a dictatorship, Egypt is a creaky, inefficient bureaucracy, rife with inefficiencies and corruption and lacking the advanced information technology employed by other absolutist regimes. I accordingly find on a balance of probabilities that it was not implausible that the claimant left Egypt as alleged, passing through Cairo airport without attracting the attention of the authorities.\nSubjective fear\n[17] The largest problem that the claimant had to overcome, in this matter, was the fact that he had successfully left Egypt on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2017 and had voluntarily returned to that country on XXXX XXXX of the same year.\n[18] When asked why he had returned to Egypt in XXXX of 2017, the claimant said in effect that he returned because even though he was fed up with Egypt and no longer wished to live there at that time, he believed that he would not have any more problems because he was not politically active as he was not taking part in any demonstrations or showing outward signs of political activism. The claimant surmises that he was speaking with a friend on the street in July 2017, and he was overheard mentioning the ceding of Tiran Island and Sanafir Island. The claimant believes that it was this incident that triggered the issue of the arrest warrant on July 23, 2017.\n[19] The claimant testified that he had sought legal advice in the U.K. and he was advised that it would be better for him to return to Egypt and apply for U.K. visas with his wife and family. He was also told it would be better for all of them to apply for asylum in the U.K.\n[20] In the circumstances, I am cognizant of three points:\n[21] At the time of his return to Egypt in XXXX of 2017, the claimant thought that he had nothing to fear from the authorities. He reasoned that they would have no further interest in him because he was no longer politically active, in any way. He did not realize at the time that he could be re-arrested on the smallest pretext, or for no reason at all;\n[22] The claimant had sought and obtained legal advice in the U.K. Unfortunately, for him, that advice was not necessarily as wise as it might have been. The claimant was acting in a reasonable way and should not in these very specific circumstances suffer for acting on professional advice in returning to Egypt.\n[23] After he became aware of the new arrest warrant issued on July 23, 2017, the claimant immediately went into hiding and left Egypt by surreptitious means. After July 23, 2017 and until the present time, the claimant has demonstrated a constant subjective fear of the governing regime in Egypt.\nObjective possibility of harm\n[24] I am of the view that the findings of fact, as noted above certainly indicate that the claimant, should he return to Egypt would face a very real danger of persecution on account of his perceived support for the Muslim Brotherhood.\n[25] Moreover, the allegations made by the claimant are not inconsistent with the National Documentation Package.7 The U.S. Department of State Country Reports indicate that in Egypt,\n\u201c[t]he most significant human rights issues include arbitrary or unlawful killings by the government or its agents; \u2026 disappearance; torture; harsh or potentially life\u00ad threatening prison conditions; arbitrary arrest and detention \u2026 [t]he government inconsistently punished or prosecuted officials who committed abuses\u2026.8\n[26] The Country Reports further points out that \u201c[l]ocal rights organizations documented hundreds of incidents of torture throughout the year, including deaths resulting from torture.9 [footnotes omitted]\nINTERNAL FLIGHT ALTRNATIVE\n[27] Inasmuch as the Egyptian state, in this case is the agent of persecution, the issue of the availability, or effectiveness of state protection is rendered moot.\n[28] Moreover, the Egyptian state is in effective control of its national territory and there accordingly, can be no internal flight alternative for the claimant anywhere in Egypt.\nCONCLUSION\n[29] For the reasons cited above, I concluded that should the claimant return to Egypt, he would face more than a mere possibility of harm for a Convention reason. He is accordingly found to be a Convention refugee and his claim is accepted.\n(signed) WILLIAM T.

Coulthard\nCountry: Egypt\nRPD Number: TB7-25327\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2020-00518\nATIP Pages: 000253-000259\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] This is the decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) in the claim of XXXX XXXX XXXX as a citizen of Egypt who is claiming refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (the \u201cAct\u201d).1\nEXPEDITED PROCESS\n[2] The claim has been decided without a hearing, according to the Immigration and Refugee Board\u2019s Instructions Governing the Streaming of Less Complex Claims at the Refugee Protection Division and subsection 170(f) of the Act.2\n[3] In deciding the claim, the panel has considered all of the evidence before it, including the Basis of Claim (BOC) form,3 the referral documents,4 the country of origin information contained within the National Documentation Package (NDP)5 and the claimant\u2019s documentary evidence.6\nALLEGATIONS\n[4] The claimant alleges that he has two somewhat separate reasons to fear persecution in Egypt: first, as a person suspected of being a member of, or being allied with, the banned Muslim Brotherhood (MB); and secondly, as a person pressured by the authorities to spy on colleagues and other persons.\n[5] The claimant alleged that in 2011 while living and working in Cairo, together with his uncle he helped establish a charity to assist the poor. That uncle was already involved in charitable work as part of his involvement with the Muslim Brotherhood. The claimant alleges he never joined the Muslim Brotherhood as he tried to avoid political involvement, but together with some of his family members, he distributed goods to the needy with his charitable organization, which was not allied with the Muslim Brotherhood.\n[6] In December 2013, the organization\u2019s premises were raided by the Egyptian National Security (ENS). Both the claimant and his uncle were arrested; the claimant was release in three days, but the uncle was detained for a month. After a subsequent arrest in January 2014, the claimant was ordered to close the charity as the ENS claimed it was a front for political activity.\n[7] The claimant alleges that for the next four years, he continued to be harassed by ENS, detained occasionally and badly treated. He was questioned each time about the Muslim Brotherhood despite his denial of any knowledge of their activities.\n[8] He finally resorted to moving frequently to avoid the ENS harassment, but he was located each time and the detentions and interrogations about the Muslim Brotherhood continued until he left Egypt.\n[9] Starting in XXXX 2016, when the claimant was travelling to Sinai for his employer, he was stopped by the Egyptian Military Intelligence (EMI at a security checkpoint, he believes at the request of ENS. He was pressed to provide information to the authorities about his colleagues in Sinai and about the local people he came in contact with.\n[10] He refused to do so, largely because he feared that as a spy, he would be identified and killed by the locals he was being asked to spy on. His refusal led to detentions and threats that he would be killed if he did not provide information.\n[11] The claimant finally decided to leave Egypt using his own passport and an existing Canadian visa by arranging payment of bribes to authorities.\n[12] He fears he would be detained, tortured and perhaps killed on return to Egypt.\nDETERMINATION\n[13] The panel finds the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the Act, based on his perceived and actual political opinion which is opposed to the current regime\u2019s policies.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[14] The claimant has established his identity by his passport,7 his Egyptian Personal Identity card8 and other documentation.\nCredibility\n[15] When a claimant swears that certain facts are true, this creates a presumption that they are indeed true unless there is a valid reason to doubt their veracity.9 In this case, the claimant\u2019s evidence is internally consistent and consistent with information contained in the NDP.10 The panel concludes he is generally credible.\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution and Risk of Harm\n[16] As noted above, the claimant\u2019s fear of persecution in Egypt arises from two related issues; his perceived connection with the Muslim Brotherhood and his failure to comply with demands from EMI to spy on colleagues and local people in Sinai.\n[17] The claimant alleged that as his uncle was associated with the Muslim Brotherhood, he was suspected of associating with the MB as well.\n[18] The charitable organization he established with his uncle for non-political reasons was shut down in January 2014 as the government suspected that such organizations were connected to the Muslim Brotherhood charitable groups. The claimant was detained and interrogated by authorities about the Muslim Brotherhood on many occasions after that, despite his insistence that he was not connected with the group and had no knowledge of their activities.\n[19] The documentary evidence confirms that since 2013, the Muslim Brotherhood has been banned along with its associated organizations:\nThe USSD report covering events in 2016 observed that: \u2018The Muslim Brotherhood, the Muslim Brotherhood-affiliated Freedom and Justice Party and its NGO remained illegal, and the Muslim Brotherhood was a legally designated terrorist organization.\n\u2026According to Amnesty International in their Report 2015-2016: \u2018By the end of [2015], the government said it had closed more than 480 non-governmental organizations (NGO\u2019s) because of their alleged links to the MB group.\n\u2026The DFAT report state \u2018DFAT understands that most, if not all, NGO\u2019s affiliated to the Brotherhood have either been shut down, had their assets seized, and\/or had their board replaced with government appointees. 11\n[20] The documents indicate that because the MB was declared a terrorist organization, all its activities were thereby criminalized and many were detained:\nFreedom House\u2019s Freedom in the World report for 2017 similarly indicates that civil society organizations \u201cestimate that as many as [40,000] people were being detained for political reasons most of them for real or suspected links to the Muslim Brotherhood.12\n[21] Although the claimant\u2019 s organization was not in fact associated with the Muslim Brotherhood, his uncle\u2019s involvement both with the charitable organization and the MB brought the claimant to the attention of the authorities. His testimony that he was arrested, detained and tortured on many occasions indicates that while the authorities likely knew he was not a member of MB, or they would not have released him after the interrogations, he was a person they had targeted for constant surveillance and persecution. His attempts to relocate were unsuccessful and the persecution continued until he left Egypt.\n[22] The claimant alleged that in addition to the continual detentions and interrogations about the MB, starting in 2016, he was pressured by authorities to spy on colleagues in his workplace. The claimant alleged that as part of his employment, he was required to travel on occasion to Sinai, which is an area of ongoing conflict. The claimant refused to cooperate as he feared he would be killed by those persons he was asked to spy on.\n[23] By his refusal, the claimant has made it obvious to the authorities that he does not agree with government actions and policies. He has established that his political opinion is opposed to that of the regime.\n[24] The panel concludes that there is a serious possibility that upon return to Egypt, he would suffer persecution by government authorities for his perceived and real political opinion.\nState Protection\n[25] A state, unless in complete breakdown, is presumed to be capable of protecting its citizens; international protection comes into play only when a refugee claimant cannot obtain protection domestically. However, in this situation, where it is the state itself that is the agent of persecution, there is no state protection available to the claimant.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[26] There is no safe or reasonable internal flight alternative (IFA) location available to this claimant. He has tried to move residences frequently to avoid detection by the authorities, but they located him each time. As it is the authorities themselves the claimant fears and the Egyptian government is control of the entirety of the country, an IFA is not available.\nCONCLUSION\n[27] The claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the Act, because of his well-founded fear of persecution for his political opinion. The claim is accepted.\n(signed) TITA DE ROUSSEAU\nMay 22, 2019\n",

        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2019 RLLR 163\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: March 1, 2019\nPanel: Roslyn Ahara\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Mayoori Malankov\nCountry: Egypt\nRPD Number: TB7-25293\nAssociated RPD Number(s):\nATIP Number: A-2020-00518\nATIP Pages: 000246-000252\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] XXXX XXXX XXXX (the claimant), who is a citizen of Egypt, is claiming refugee protection pursuant to ss. 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).\nEXPEDITED PROCESS\n[2] Paragraph 170(f) of the IRPA provides that the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) may allow a claim for refugee protection without a hearing, unless the Minister has notified the RPD of the Minister\u2019s intention to intervene within the time limit set out in the Refugee Protection Division Rules.1 Further, subsection 162(2) of the IRPA directs each division to deal with all proceedings before it as informally and quickly as the circumstances and the considerations of fairness and natural justice permit. The claimant\u2019s claim was identified as one that could be processed through the RPD expedited process for Egyptian claims. The RPD received the claimant\u2019s signed certificate of readiness for the expedited process on September 21, 2018.2 Having carefully considered the evidence in this case, the panel finds that XXXX XXXX XXXX claim meets the criteria for the expedited determination. This claim has therefore been decided without a hearing, according to the Policy on the Expedited Processing of Refugee Claims by the Refugee Protection Division.3\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] The claimant is a XXXX XXXX XXXX, who was perceived to be a supporter or member of the Muslim Brotherhood. However, he alleges that he has solely represented clients accused of being members, but by association the government believes he is a supporter or member himself.\n[4] In 2014, he began representing these clients, and in August 2016, there were judgments acquitting his clients, whereupon he began receiving texts warning him to stay away from representing these clients.\n[5] In 2015, the claimant was one of the XXXX involved in the mass trials and prosecution of alleged members and supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood. This series of cases became a matter of public interest because several of the accused were young, and the stakes were high \u2013 some of these charges are punishable by execution. The claimant defended two young men in these afore mentioned cases.\n[6] In XXXX 2017, the claimant went to Turkey for vacation but returned as he did not have any fears at that time. On XXXX XXXX, 2017, the claimant came to Canada to assist a client in Canada, who had property issues in Egypt. While in Canada, he learned that his client\u2019s father had been arrested in Egypt. In July 2017, a second judgment came down acquitting his two clients of most of the charges. Around Mid-August 2017, five armed officers came to the claimant\u2019s home in pursuit of him and looking for documents. They forcibly entered their home and one of them tried to hit his wife in the head with his gun, but it landed on her shoulder. The officers told the claimant\u2019s wife that her husband would be arrested.\n[7] In August\/September 2017, authorities searched his office in Egypt. His colleague was arrested. In October 2017, the sister of one of his clients was arrested. On December 05, 2017, the claimant received numerous documents from Egypt to support his claim.\n[8] In October, the claimant learned that he was named as one of the lawyers that was being investigated for assisting cadres of the Brotherhood, and he also learned that a number of other lawyers working on the foregoing cases had been arrested.\nDETERMINATION\n[9] I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[10] The claimant\u2019s identity has been established as per a copy of his passport, his National ID Card, and his birth and marriage certificates.\nCredibility\n[11] The claimant has submitted copious corroborative evidence to support his claim. This documentation includes proof of his legal profession as well as his representation of the clients mentioned in his BOC. The supportive evidence also includes the court judgments which favoured the claimant\u2019s clients, minutes of investigations, court orders and lists of individuals indicated in the claimant\u2019s BOC, who are detained. I have no reason to doubt the authenticity of the aforementioned documents and find that the claimant has provided credible evidence that he was a professional XXXX representing Muslim clients, and as a result, he is perceived to be a member of the Muslim Brotherhood himself.\nProspective Risk of Return to Egypt\n[12] The claimant fears persecution if he returns to his country of nationality, Egypt, because of his political opinions. As explained above, he has been accused of being affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood and as such, he is considered a political opponent by the current Egyptian regime.\n[13] The panel finds that the claimant has established a link between his situation and a Convention ground, that is, his political opinions, whether real or imputed.\n[14] In evaluating the claimant\u2019s prospective risk of return, the panel has taken into consideration the claimant\u2019s personal profile and his particular situation at this time.\n[15] As explained above, the claimant is a XXXX who has represented clients who have been in the public eye. He has submitted evidence regarding his public personality, his public expressions of his political opinions, and particularly evidence regarding the political nature of his profession. Notably, he has been named by the Egyptian authorities on a list of persons who are accused of being members of the Muslim Brotherhood.\n[16] The panel has also taken into consideration the evidence regarding the current situation in Egypt, particularly concerning those perceived as being political opponents to the regime.4\n[17] According to the objective evidence, the Egyptian authorities are known for their repression of freedom of expression and association, notably repression of those who are considered political opponents.5 The U.S. Department of State reports:6\nThe most significant human rights issues included arbitrary or unlawful killings by the government or its agents; major terrorist attacks; disappearances; torture; harsh or potentially life-threatening prison conditions; arbitrary arrest and detention; including the use of military courts to try civilians; political prisoners and detainees; unlawful interference in privacy; limits on freedom of expression, including criminal \u201cdefamation of religion\u201d laws; restrictions on the press, internet, and academic freedom; and restrictions on freedoms of assembly and association, including government control over registration and financing of NGOs.\n[18] According to the objective evidence on file, there are numerous reports that the Egyptian forces have used excessive force against activists and opponents, particularly during the demonstrations in 2011 and in 2013. A new wave of arrests began in May 2015. Sources indicate that thousands of people who are perceived as opponents to the current government have been detained for extended periods of time, which, in many cases, could be considered enforced disappearances.7\n[19] There are also recent reports that indicate that members of the Egyptian military have committed acts that may amount to human rights violations, including arbitrary arrests and detention, torture, enforced disappearances, and extrajudicial killings. The objective evidence on file indicates that family members of perceived opponents were also subjected to these treatments. Finally, reports also indicate that there were problems with impunity for officials who committed abuses and unfairness in the judicial system.8\n[20] The panel notes that in this particular case, according to the allegations, which have been deemed credible, the claimant has been accused of being a member of the Muslim Brotherhood. In consideration of the entirety of the evidence, including the claimant\u2019s public personal profile and his particular situation, and in the absence of evidence to the contrary, the panel accepts that the claimant may be perceived as a political opponent upon returning to Egypt.\n[21] For all of the reasons explained above, considering the treatment of real or perceived political opponents and dissenters by the Egyptian authorities, as well as the treatment of their family members, the panel concludes that there is a serious possibility that the claimant may face persecution based on a Convention ground, that being his real or perceived political opinion, upon return to his country of nationality, Egypt.\nState Protection and Internal Flight Alternative\n[22] Case law establishes a presumption that a state is capable of providing adequate protection to its citizens. In order to rebut this presumption, claimants must demonstrate, through clear and convincing evidence, that the authorities are not able or willing to provide them adequate protection given the alleged risks. Claimants must establish that they have a well-founded fear of persecution throughout their country of nationality.\n[23] As explained above, the panel has taken into consideration the claimant\u2019s personal profile and his particular situation at the present time. Of note, the panel has taken into consideration that the claimant fears the Egyptian authorities. The panel has also taken into consideration that the claimant has been accused of being a member of the Muslim Brotherhood by the Egyptian authorities, allegation which he affirms is false, and that the authorities have been actively seeking him.\n[24] As explained above, the panel has taken into consideration the objective evidence regarding the situation in Egypt, particularly regarding the treatment of political opponents and those who are perceived as such. Regarding those considered opponents and dissenters, it is reported:\nThe authorities used prolonged pre-trial detention, often for periods of more than two years, as means to punish dissidents.9\nAccording to the Report of the OHCHR Mission to Egypt in 2011: In addition, strikes, unregistered financial donations were formally banned, and thousands of opponents were arbitrarily detained and allegedly tortured. In fact, the Emergency Law gave the Government the right to detain individuals indefinitely, without any judicial safeguards. 10\n\u2026 under repeated international criticism for an ongoing government crackdown against various forms of political dissent and freedom of expression. Certain practices of Sisi\u2019s government, the parliament and the security apparatus have been contentious including \u2026 police brutality, the apparently deliberate use of torture by security forces, and reported enforced disappearances of political opponents.11\n[25] As indicated above, there are reports of impunity for officials who committed abuses.\n[26] Upon consideration of the entirety of the evidence, the panel finds that the treatment of political opponents and dissidents, orthose perceived as such, is not limited to any regions in Egypt, but is widespread. The panel notes that the laws currently used to repress political opponents are national laws, and may be applied throughout Egypt.\n[27] Therefore, for all of the reasons explained above, and in consideration of the claimant\u2019s personal profile and his particular situation, as well as the current conditions in Egypt, the panel finds that there is clear and convincing evidence that state protection is not adequate for the claimant if he were to return to his home country at this time. The panel concludes that the presumption of state protection has been rebutted in these particular circumstances.\n[28] Considering his personal profile and current situation, as well as the objective documentation, as noted above, the panel finds that there is a serious possibility of persecution for the claimant throughout his country at this time. Therefore, a viable internal flight alternative is currently not available for the claimant within Egypt.\nCONCLUSION\n[29] Therefore, his claim for refugee protection is accepted on the basis of his perceived political opinion.\n(signed) ROSLYN AHARA\nMarch 1, 2019\n1 Refugee Protection Division Rules, SOR\/2012-256.\n2 Exhibit 4.\n3 Policy on the Expedited Processing of Refugee Claims by the Refugee Protection Division, effective September 18, 2015.\n4 Exhibit 3, National Documentat\nion Package (NDP) for Egypt (June 29, 2018), items 2.1 and 4.5\n5 Ibid., items 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4.\n6 Ibid., item 2.1.\n7 Ibid.\n8 Ibid., items 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 and 10.l.\n9 Ibid., item 2.2.\n10 Ibid., item 2.6.\n11 Ibid., item 4.7.\n",

The claimants\u2019 claims were identified as those that could be processed through the RPD expedited process for Egyptian claims. The RPD received the claimants\u2019 signed certificate of readiness for the expedited process on June 22, 2018.2 Having carefully considered the evidence in these cases, the panel finds that these claims meet the criteria for the expedited determination. These claims have therefore been decided without a hearing, according to the Policy on the Expedited Processing of Refugee Claims by the Refugee Protection Division.3\nALLEGATIONS\n[4] The claimants\u2019 allegations are described in detail in his Basis of Claim Form (BOC). However, they can be summarized as follows.\n[5] The claimant\u2019s father, wanting to secure the future of his family, sold everything to buy property in February 26, 2013. However, notwithstanding the legal rights and a contract, the Government seized the property and it became the property of the armed forces.\n[6] The P.C. attended many demonstrations beginning in 2011 and continued to do so after the revolution.\n[7] The P.C.\u2019s wife sustained an incident on a bus in March 2016, where the bus driver wanted to charge her more than the regulated price. The police were called and blamed her, not the driver beat her and took off her hijab. She reported the incident to the police, however, they refused to open an investigation.\n[8] In November 2016, the P.C.\u2019s wife went to visit her aunt the children. Unfortunately, the taxi driver was a criminal who kidnaps women and children. They were taken somewhere, and threatened, however, the P.C.\u2019s wife gave him everything they had and they were able to escape on foot.\n[9] On April 15, 2016, the P.C. attended a huge demonstration which took place in several provinces, asking to stop giving up the islands of Tiran and Sanafir to Saudi Arabia. The P.C. also attended the demonstrations that followed the actual waiver of these islands. The security forces came the day before the demonstration; they did not have any documents.\n[10] The Egyptian security arrested a lot of people in many of the provinces and the P.C.\u2019s house was among those where acts of violence took place. They entered the house without permission and broke everything, and stole his children\u2019s tablets with video games. The P.C. believes that a neighbour was an informant.\n[11] The P.C. continued to attend demonstrations demanding in rights and freedom. On June 16, 2017, the armed security forces attacked a demonstration; the P.C. was beaten in the face and abdomen and they tried to take his cellphone. He and others were arrested and detained at the metro station for several hours. A colleague of the P.C. photographed what was happening. The P.C. was detained for one week, where he was tortured, beaten, his cellphone taken and the photographs were deleted. The authorities threatened to imprison the P.C. at any time, and as well they threatened members of his family.\n[12] On August 22, 2017, the P.C. was surprised by a phone call from his neighbour basically warning him to leave. They went into hiding and arrived in Canada on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2017.\nDETERMINATON\n[13] I find that the claimants are Convention refugees.\nANALYSIS\nIdentifies\n[14] The claimants\u2019 identities have been established as per their passports, birth certificates, National ID Cards, and marriage certificate.\nCredibility\n[15] The claimants have provided proof of their professions, the P.C. as an XXXX and his wife as a XXXX. They have also submitted supporting letters from the P.C.\u2019s mother and a friend, witness declarations, a police report, and proof of land purchase, and a letter from the individual with whom the family hid. The P.C\u2019s wife has provided corroborative evidence of the taxi incident which occurred on the way to her home. The panel finds that this supportive evidence is consistent with the contents of the P.C.\u2019s BOC.\n[16] The claimants have also provided country documentation which is consistent with the Board\u2019s National Documentation Package (NDP), in which it describes, in particular, danger to women and children and those individuals who speak out against the government.\nObjective basis\/Prospective Risk of Return\n[17] In order to establish their claim as a Convention refugee, the claimants must demonstrate that if they were to return to their home country, they would face a serious possibility of persecution based on a Convention ground.\n[18] The claimants indicate that they fear persecution if they return to their country of nationality, Egypt, because of the P.C.\u2019s opposition to the government and the risk to his wife and children.\n[19] First of all, the panel has taken into consideration the family\u2019s personal profile and the P.C.\u2019s particular situation at this time. The P.C. is a professional who has participated in a number of demonstrations over the years, and has been detained as a result.\n[20] According to the objective evidence, the Egyptian authorities are known for their repression of freedom of expression and association, notably repression of those who are considered political opponents.4 The US Department of State reports:5\nThe most significant human rights issues included arbitrary or unlawful killings by the government or its agents; major terrorist attacks;\u2026 arbitrary arrest and detention; including the use of military courts to try civilians; political prisoners and detainees; unlawful interference in privacy; limits on freedom of expression,\u2026 restrictions on the press, internet, and academic freedom; and restrictions on freedoms of assembly and association, including government control over registration and financing of NGOs.\n[21] According to the objective evidence on file, there are numerous reports that the Egyptian forces have used excessive force against activists and opponents, particularly during the demonstrations in 2011 and in 2013. Sources indicate that thousands of people who are perceived as opponents to the current government have been detained for extended periods of time, which, in many cases, could be considered enforced disappearances. There are also recent reports that indicate that members of the Egyptian military have committed acts which may amount to human rights violations, including arbitrary arrest and detention, torture, enforced disappearances, and extrajudicial killings. The objective evidence on file indicates that family members of perceived opponents were also subjected to this treatment. Finally, reports also indicate that there were problems with impunity for officials who committed abuses and unfairness in the judicial system.6\n[22] The panel notes that in this particular case, according to the allegations which have been deemed to be credible, the P.C. has been the victim of aggression and has been arrested and detained on numerous occasions. In consideration of the entirety of the evidence, including the P.C.\u2019s personal profile and his particular situation, and in the absence of evidence to the contrary, the panel accepts that the P.C. may be perceived as a political opponent upon returning to Egypt.\n[23] Considering the treatment of real or perceived political opponents and dissenters by the Egyptian authorities, the panel concludes that there is a serious possibility that the P.C. may face persecution based on a Convention ground, that being his real or perceived political opinion, upon return to his country of nationality, Egypt.\nState Protection\n[24] Claimants must establish, through clear and convincing evidence, that the state would be unwilling or unable to provide adequate protection if they were to return to their home country.\n[25] As noted above, the panel has taken into consideration the P.C.\u2019s personal profile and his particular situation at the present time. The panel has taken into consideration that the claimants fears the Egyptian authorities. As explained above, the panel notes that according to the allegations, that the P.C. has been arrested and detained by the Egyptian authorities on numerous occasions, and prior to leaving the country in 2017, state security forces were looking for him.\n[26] More importantly, the P.C. has approached the police on a number of occasions, and they have taken no action whatsoever.\n[27] Therefore, for all of the reasons explained above, and in consideration of the P.C\u2019s personal profile and his particular situation, as well as the current conditions in Egypt, the panel finds that there is clear and convincing evidence that state protection is not adequate for the claimants if they were to return to their home country at this time. The panel concludes that the presumption of state protection has been rebutted in these particular circumstances.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[28] Claimants must establish that they have a well-founded fear of persecution throughout their country of nationality.\n[29] Once again, the panel has considered the family\u2019s particular situation at the present time. As explained above, the panel notes that they fear the Egyptian authorities.\n[30] Furthermore, as explained above, the panel has taken into consideration the objective evidence regarding the current situation in Egypt. Upon consideration of the entirety of the evidence, the panel finds that the treatment of political opponents and dissidents, or those perceived as such, is not limited to any regions in Egypt, but is widespread. The panel notes that the laws currently used to repress political opponents are national laws, and may be applied throughout Egypt.\n[31] For all of the reasons explained above, considering the P.C.\u2019s personal situation, as explained above, the panel finds that the there is a serious possibility of persecution for the claimants throughout Egypt at this time. Therefore, a viable internal flight alternative is currently not available for the claimants within Egypt.\nCONCLUSION\n[32] For all of the reasons explained above, the panel finds that these claimants are Convention refugees.\n[33] Therefore, their claims are accepted.\n(signed) ROSLYN AHARA\nMarch 25, 2019\n1 Refugee Protection Division Rules, SOR\/2012-256.\n2 Exhibit 7.\n3 Policy on the Expedited Processing of Refugee Claims by the Refugee Protection Division, effective September 18, 2015.\n4 Exhibit 6, National Documentation Package (NDP) for Egypt (June 29, 2018), items 2.1, 2.2, 2.3and 2.4.\n5 Ibid., item 2.1.\n6 Ibid., items 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.8, and 10.1.\n",

As you went through school, you were called names because others thought you were gay due to your more feminine manner. You became more and more gender dysphoric as you became older and it was more difficult to express your gender identity openly. As well, you began to question the religion of Islam in general terms, but also in respect to your gender identity, which you had decided accept by around age 13.\n[3] You did not feel safe to speak to your parents about what you were thinking and feeling, and there seemed to be mostly a concern around you being homosexual.\n[4] You learned to censor your actions and tried to confirm to the expectations of your family and society in general. You were able to connect with some friends who shared some of your values and also questioned Islam and were tolerant or gender non-conforming or of other sexual orientations.\n[5] You were finally able to come out as a transwoman with some friends in junior college and you knew that you could not live freely and openly in Brunei and made plans to leave.\n[6] You attempted to get into contact with the UNHCR in Thailand and then in Malaysia; however, this had numerous difficulties attached. Instead, you saved enough money to get to get to Canada, thinking this was the furthest away from those who might do you harm. You booked a trip in XXXX 2018, telling your parents that this was a vacation before you started university back in Brunei to avoid their suspicions.\n[7] You arrived in Canada XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018 and claimed for protection shortly thereafter.\n[8] You fear that if you return to Brunei you would face persecution, arrest, and death because of your gender identity as a transwoman and your religious beliefs.\n[9] I find that you are a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[10] In deciding your claim today, I have considered the SOGI Guidelines. You have established that you have a well-founded fear of persecution based on the Convention ground membership in a particular social group, specifically, gender identity as a transwoman, as well as on the ground of religion, as an apostate in Brunei.\n[11] Your identity as a citizen of Brunei is supported by your testimony and passport, as well as other documentation on file and I accept on a balance of probabilities your identity as a national of Brunei.\n[12] You made an affirmation to tell the truth and there is a presumption that sworn testimony is true unless there is sufficient reason to doubt its truthfulness.\n[13] I have found no reason to doubt your truthfulness. You testified in a straightforward manner and there were no relevant inconsistencies in your testimony or contradictions between your testimony and the other evidence before me.\n[14] You have provided numerous documents in support of your claim including several letters of support from individuals and various organizations who have been working with you who corroborate your allegations. These supporting documents can be found in Exhibit 4.\n[15] You have shared your personal lived experience of realizing you were transgender at a very early age and being forced to hide your feelings and your true identity from everyone. You were called names and suspected of being gay by other family members, as well as students during school, which led you to be more withdrawn from others in society at large.\n[16] You also began to question Islam and you came to that decision that it was not compatible with your own identity or your view of the world. You stated your spiritual beliefs are currently not active or you have put this aside for now but would definitely be seen as an apostate as you are no longer a practising Muslim.\n[17] Additionally, you have spoken publicly about some of the government back in Brunei and its lack of human rights and freedoms, and that can be found at Exhibit 4, page 63, where you gave an interview and described your own experiences.\n[18] Overall, I have found you to be a credible witness and, therefore, believe what you have alleged in support of your claim. There is certainly an objective basis for your claim and I have read the country documents provided by your counsel related to the country conditions in Brunei. I am not going to go into great detail but suffice to say, there is a plethora of evidence to suggest you have a well-grounded claim.\n[19] I am just going to mention a few areas. As have been discussed during the testimony, the US DOS Report provides information. Members of the LGBTI community reported societal discrimination in public and private employment, housing, recreation, and in obtaining services including education from state entities. LGBTI individuals reported intimidation by police including threats to make public their sexuality, to hamper their ability to obtain a government job or to bar graduation from government academic institutions.\n[20] Members of the LGBTI community reported the government monitored their activities and communications. Like all events in the country, events on LGBTI topics were subject to restrictions on assembly and expression. The LGBTI community reported that the government would not issue permits for community events or events on LGBTI topics.\n[21] There is also a Sharia Penal Code ban on anal intercourse between men or between a man and a woman who is not his wife. The Sharia Penal Code also prohibits men from dressing as women or women dressing at men without reasonable excuse or for \u201cimmoral purposes\u201d.\n[22] As far as turning away from Islam, being an apostate is illegal in Brunei. The punishment can be death or imprisonment for up to 30 years and corporal punishment.\n[23] Speaking out against the Brunei government is seen as dissent and is also illegal in Brunei, and the (Indiscernible) Act penalizes commentary against the government. [Amnesty International and US DOS Report.\n[24] Lastly, from the US DOS Report, human rights issues include censorship, criminal, liable, and the monitoring of private email and other electronic communication, substantial interference with the rights of peaceful assembly and freedom of association, restrictions on political participation and crimes involving violence or threats targeting lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex persons including intimidation by police and exploitation of foreign workers including through forced labour.\n[25] On the issue of state protection, there is clear and convincing evidence before me that the state is unable or unwilling to protect you. Given the deeply intrenched level of anti- LGBTI or transphobic or homophobic feelings and attitudes, and reports of state authorities being abusive and intimidating. As well, country conditions indicate discrimination and violence are acceptable, especially now that Sharia law has been declared. Those who define moral codes that have been put in place face fines, jail, and the death penalty.\n[26] You could not live openly as a transwoman without facing a serious possibility of a significant level or discrimination and violence from the society at large, as well as the state authorities.\n[27] Accordingly, I do not find you have an internal flight alternative in Brunei. For the foregoing reasons, I find that you are a Convention refugee and, therefore, I accept your claim.\n[28] This matter is now concluded.\n\u2014 DECISION CONCLUDED\n",

Although she was born intersex, she did not become aware of this until coming to Canada. She lived as a male in Kenya and had sexual relationships with boys or men. The claimant came to Canada in XXXX 2015 to study and began to identify as a woman. She has had relationships with both men and women and is transitioning not only in terms of clothing but she has undergone surgery and is taking estrogen and plans further surgery. She fears that if she returns to Kenya, she will face persecution and other risks for being transgender.\n[3] I find that pursuant to s. 96 of the Act the claimant is a Convention refugee as she has a well- founded fear of persecution in Kenya.\n[4] The claimant\u2019s identity as a national of Kenya is established by her testimony and passport in evidence. I\u2019m satisfied of her identity by this document.\n[5] In terms of credibility, the claimant gave testimony in a very open, thoughtful and obliging manner. She demonstrated a high degree of introspection as she candidly described how she came to learn that she is intersex, how she identified or expressed herself in Kenya and in Canada and how this has evolved and continues to evolve. She discussed the transition process and other medical measures she hopes to take in the future. She also testified about how her family members responded when she talked to them about being intersex and transgender. There were no material inconsistencies or contradictions within the claimant\u2019s evidence that undermined her credibility in respect of her central allegations.\n[6] I note that in terms of appearance, the claimant presents as female but more importantly she is clearly self-possessed about her sexual orientation and gender identity. I have no doubt that the claimant is a transgender woman and accept her allegations as credible.\n[7] I find that the claimant has a well-founded fear of persecution based on her sexual orientation and gender expression. The claimant was born intersex, raised as a male and is now a transgender woman. She does not believe that she can change her sex or her name on her government documents, and is concerned that if she presents as a woman with a male name and government documents to go along with it she will have difficulties finding employment, housing and adequate medical services for example. She also fears violence and problems with police if she attempts to report it.\n[8] As the claimant\u2019s fear of persecution is based on her membership in a particular social group her allegations form a nexus to the Convention.\n[9] The objective evidence corroborates the fact that sexual minorities face very serious problems in Kenya. Although the law in Kenya is silent on the \u2014 transgender issues according to Kaleidoscope Trust the penal code in Kenya criminalizes homosexuality referring it to as, \u201cCarnal knowledge of any person against the order of nature.\u201d\n[10] Human Rights Watch finds that:\nAuthorities can punish consensual same-sex sexual activity with up to 14 years in prison.\n[11] Though the UK Home Office report states that:\nIt is not clear if there have been any convictions.\n[12] Astraea Lesbian Foundation for Justice reports that:\nThere is no legal protection from discrimination based on one\u2019s sexual orientation or gender identity in Kenya. Furthermore, in Kenya criminalization of homosexuality has been used to justify harassment by police and state officials, torture, invasion of privacy, blackmail and extortion by security agencies and other non-state actors, denial of employment, violations of housing rights, interference with the right to education, poor access to health and medical research abuse.\n[13] The Department of State maintains that:\nViolence and discrimination against sexual minorities is widespread in Kenya.\n[14] It states that:\nPolice use public order laws, for example, disturbing the peace more frequently than same-sex legislation to arrest LGBTIQ persons.\n[15] According to the DOS:\nPolice frequently harass, intimidate or physically abuse sexual minorities in custody.\n[16] The DOS also states:\nThe constitution does not explicitly protect sexual minorities from discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender expression.\n[17] The evidence reveals that same-sex sexual activity is criminalized in Kenya and sexual minorities face very serious systematic and sustained human rights abuses that amount to persecution based on the claimant\u2019s status as a queer, transgender intersex woman and the treatment of sexual minorities, I find that there is a serious possibility of persecution if she returns to Kenya.\n[18] In this face \u2014 in this case, I do not find that the claimant could seek state protection because it is the state in part that the claimant fears for its human rights abuses and violations of fundamental freedoms of sexual minorities.\n[19] The UK Home Office finds that:\nThere are reports of police harassment, intimidation and physical abuse of sexual minorities while in custody.\n[20] Human Rights Watch finds that:\nPolice in Kenya play an ambiguous role, in some cases, they have protected sexual minorities from mob violence but they did not bring the perpetrators of violence to justice. In other cases, they have outright failed in their responsibility to protect by refusing assistance to victims because of their presumed gender identity or sexual orientation conducting arbitrary arrests or even perpetrating violence themselves.\n[21] Human Rights Watch maintains that:\nCriminalization of same-sex sexual conduct renders sexual minorities vulnerable to violence at the hands of ordinary citizens as well as law enforcement officials.\n[22] I, therefore, do not find that there is likely to be adequate state protection for the claimant.\n[23] I also do not find that the claimant could live safely elsewhere in Kenya as the treatment of sexual minorities is similar across the country, and the law criminalizing same-sex sexual relationships apply throughout the country.\n[24] Having considered all of the evidence, I find that there is a serious possibility of persecution if the claimant returns to Kenya, and I accept her claim under s. 96 of the Act. This matter is concluded.\n\u2014 DECISION CONCLUDED\n",

        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2019 RLLR 159\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: August 16, 2019\nPanel: Janko Predovic\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Robert J Hughes\nCountry: Kuwait\nRPD Number: VB8-05555\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2022-00978\nATIP Pages: 000155-000162\nREASONS FOR DECISION\nINTRODUCTION\n[1] This is the decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) in the claim for protection of XXXX XXXX aka XXXX XXXX (\u201cXXXX XXXX XXXX\u201d or the \u201cclaimant\u201d) under sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (the \u201cIRPA\u201d).1\n[2] The claim is being decided without a hearing, pursuant to the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada\u2019s Instructions governing the streaming of less complex claims at the Refugee Protection Division2 and subsection 170(f) of the IRPA.\n[3] In reaching my decision in this claim, I have considered all of the evidence before me, including the Basis of Claim (BOC) form,3 the referral documents,4 the information contained within the National Documentation Package (NDP) for Kuwait,5 and the balance of the claimant\u2019s documentary evidence and submissions.6\n[4] In substantively assessing the claim, I have also considered and applied Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9: Proceedings before the IRB Involving Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression.7\nALLEGATIONS\n[5] The following is a brief synopsis of the claimant\u2019s narrative and allegations as set out in his BOC form.\n[6] Though he was born female, the claimant self-identifies as a male and has done so since a very early age, perhaps as early as four years. When attending primary school, he felt different from his peers because he attended an all-girls school. He was called a \u201ctomboy\u201d among other things. Once an adolescent, he began to find himself attracted to girls and began to feel even more like he did not belong. He began to outwardly present himself in a more masculine fashion, which led to a suspension from his high school for failing to abide by gender role expectations. The claimant became depressed due to the social expectations of him and his changing body. He XXXX XXXX at 16. His mother took the claimant to XXXX in 2007 and 2008. The claimant continued seeing a XXXX until 2012.\n[7] As the claimant became older, he decided to transition from female to male. He took steps to make his outward appearance match his internal gender identity and began taking hormone therapy without a doctor\u2019s supervision. He also began planning to leave Kuwait for Canada and obtained a visa. Some visa problems prevented him from flying through the United States to Canada so the claimant then flew to Thailand instead, without informing his family. In Thailand, he underwent a mastectomy and hysterectomy.\n[8] Upon returning to Kuwait, the claimant experienced trouble entering the country because his outward appearance did not accord with the gender indicated on his passport. For similar reasons of gender non-conformity, he was arrested in 2016. The claimant continued to plan leaving Kuwait for good and waited for a suitable opportunity.\n[9] In 2017 the claimant flew to the UK and claimed protection immediately upon arrival. However, he withdrew that claim for protection and returned home before he could see it through when he learned that his mother had suffered a stroke. Upon returning to Kuwait, he was mistreated by his father, who effectively locked him up at home for nearly a year as a consequence of his gender non-conformity. The claimant\u2019s family does not support his transition.\n[10] In XXXX of 2018, the claimant made a final bid for freedom and made it to Canada on his still-valid Canadian visitor\u2019s visa. He claimed protection shortly after arrival.\n[11] In summary, the claimant has experienced harm in Kuwait as a consequence of his gender identity and expression. In that country, he is unable to freely express his gender identity and he has been arrested in the past on account of his masculine appearance. He fears that if he returns to Kuwait, he faces a serious possibility of persecution due to his gender identity.\nDETERMINATION\n[12] The claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to s. 96 of the IRPA.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[13] The claimant\u2019s personal identity and status as a national of Kuwait are established by the certified copies of his passports, and the Kuwaiti civil ID card, all of which are on file.8 I am satisfied on the evidence before me that the claimant is a citizen of Kuwait and no other country.\n[14] I note that in closely examining the passport and civil ID photographs (in which the claimant appears as a female) in comparison with a recent photograph of the claimant attached to his file9 (in which the claimant appears clearly male), it is clear to me that the photos are of the same person, but before and after a gender transformation.\nCredibility\n[15] When a claimant swears to the truth of certain allegations, a presumption arises that those allegations are true unless there is reason to doubt their truthfulness.10 There is no reason to displace the presumption in the present case. The photographic evidence to which I have already referred speaks for itself to a certain degree, as it depicts a clear gender transformation from female to male.11 In addition, there are various medical notes from multiple medical professionals dating back to 2012 referencing the claimant\u2019s gender-related medical concerns, and some of the medical procedures that he underwent to progress from female to male.12\n[16] An inconsistency that I had identified in the claimant\u2019s narrative (specifically, an error respecting the date of attempted travel to the United States) was reasonably explained in a supplementary narrative that the claimant delivered to the RPD. The claimant explained that his travel to the United States, which was impeded due to lack of a visa, was attempted in 2014 (prior to US visa issuance), not 2015 (after US visa issuance) as originally stated.13 In the face of the substantial other evidence corroborating the basis of the claim before me, and the reasonable explanation that was provided for the dates that did not quite line up, I accept that this error was due to a lapse in memory. I draw no negative inferences respecting the claimant\u2019s general credibility as a consequence of the error.\n[17] Having found the claimant generally credible, I accept the central elements of his claim for protection to be true. Specifically, I accept that the claimant was born female, has self\u00ad identified as a male for most of his life, and that he has transitioned to a male physique with hormone therapy and surgery. I also accept that the claimant has a subjective fear of persecution in Kuwait on account of his gender identity and expression.\nNexus\n[18] For a claimant to be a Convention refugee under s. 96 of IRPA, the alleged persecution must bear a nexus to one of the five grounds enumerated in the Convention refugee definition, namely race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.14\n[19] The claimant\u2019s fear of persecution in Kuwait is grounded in his membership in a particular social group, namely the transgender community. Therefore, I can and will assess the claim for protection under s. 96 of the IRPA.\nWell-Foundedness of the Fear of Persecution\n[20] The NDP for Kuwait states that Kuwait criminalizes atypical gender expression. Article 198 of the Penal Code states the following:\nWhoever makes a lewd signal or act in a public place or such that one may see it or hear it from public place, or appears like the opposite sex in any way, shall be punished for a period not exceeding one year and a fine not exceeding 1000 Dinar or one either of these punishments.15 (Emphasis added.)\n[21] In August 2016 in its Concluding Observations to Kuwait, the UN Human Rights Committee that oversees the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) stated that\nthe State party [Kuwait] should take the measures necessary to decriminalize sexual relations between consenting adults of the same sex and repeal the offence of imitating members of the opposite sex, in order to bring its legislation into line with the Covenant. It should also take measures to put an end to the social stigmatization of homosexuality and the harassment, discrimination and violence perpetrated against persons based on their real or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity.16\n[22] In reviewing the document that is the source of the statement immediately above (which document is hyperlinked within NDP item 6.1 at the bottom of page 129) it is clear that the UN Human Rights Committee is also concerned about \u201creports of harassment, arbitrary arrest and detention and about acts of violence, abuse, torture and sexual assault against persons on the basis of their real or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity\u201d in Kuwait.17 (Emphasis added.) These acts are persecutory, because they represent serious violation of fundamental rights, sustained or systemic, demonstrative of a failure of state protection.18\n[23] Given the foregoing, and the fact that the claimant appears and self-identifies as male despite having been born female, I find that the claimant\u2019s fear of persecution in Kuwait on account of his sexual identity and expression is objectively well-founded.\nState Protection\n[24] There is a presumption that a state will do what is adequate to protect its citizens and a claimant seeking refugee protection must rebut that presumption. Clear and convincing confirmation of a state\u2019s inability to protect must be provided to rebut the presumption.\n[25] In the present case, it is clear that the state is the agent of persecution. Accordingly, the presumption of state protection is rebutted and it is clear that there would not be adequate state protection available to the claimant if he sought it out.\nInternal Flight Alternative (IFA)\n[26] For an IFA to be viable in a s. 96 analysis, there must be no serious possibility of the claimant being persecuted there. Further, conditions in the putative IFA must be such that it would not be unreasonable in all the circumstances for the claimant to seek refuge there.\n[27] Kuwait criminalizes the expression of non-conforming gender identity nationally. Given that the claimant cannot be expected to conceal his gender identity or expression in order to live free from persecution,19 and given that the claimant is visibly identifiable as gender non\u00ad conforming (at least insofar as any state agent examining the claimant\u2019s Kuwaiti identity documents would immediately realize), I find that there is nowhere that the claimant can go in Kuwait and not face a serious possibility of persecution. Accordingly, he has no IFA.\nCONCLUSION\n[28] The claimant is a Convention refugee and I accept his claim. I welcome him to Canada and I wish him a peaceful life in this country.\n(signed) Janko Predovic\nAugust 16, 2019\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n2 Instructions governing the streaming of less complex claims at the Refugee Protection Division, effective date January 29, 2019.\n3 Exhibit 2.\n4 Exhibit 1.\n5 Exhibit 3, National Documentation Package (NDP), Kuwait, March 29, 2019.\n6 Exhibit 4.\n7 IRB Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9: Proceedings be\/ore the IRE Involving Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression (SOGIE), Ottawa, Canada, May 1, 2017.\n8 Exhibit 1.\n9 Exhibit 1.\n10 Maldonado v.

However, since childhood, she has presented as feminine. She has been bullied for acting feminine. She has been repeatedly told to cut her hair and \u201cact like a boy.\u201d\n[6] The claimant was pulled out of school because of her presentation, and was taken out of XXXXat XXXX XXXX because she was too feminine. In XXXX XXXX her instructor emotionally abused her and told the claimant that the instructor \u201cdidn\u2019t want a sinner in her class.\u201d\n[7] When the claimant was 18 years old, her father beat her with a whip. She reported the assault to the police. Despite the obvious injuries, the police provided no assistance. Instead they insulted the claimant.\n[8] The claimant was able to complete her education, and got a job as a XXXX XXXX with Fiji\u2019s Ministry of XXXX. Because the claimant presented in a feminine manner, the claimant continuously faced issues at work.\n[9] Beginning in XXXX 2013, the claimant began transitioning through self-medication. She dressed as a woman outside of work.\n[10] The claimant was born and grew up in XXXX, a town close to the north coast of XXXX XXXX, the main island in Fiji. She went to XXXX XXXX in XXXX, the capital city. After becoming an XXXX, the claimant returned to live in XXXX, and worked in XXXX, a town nearby. Because of issues at work regarding her gender identity, the claimant was transferred to a XXXX in the XXXX XXXX, a group of small islands more than 100 kilometers distant from XXXX XXXX.\n[11] The claimant saw the transfer as an opportunity, because she had increased responsibility for managing the island XXXX facility. However, she found the community there even less accepting than in XXXX XXXX. The claimant was assaulted. Her belongings were vandalized. When the claimant reported these crimes to the police, they did not provide any assistance to her.\n[12] The claimant was transferred back to XXXX in XXXX 2017. The claimant learned that the XXXX community had gone to the Ministry, possibly even the Prime Minister, to state that they did not want a transgender XXXX.\n[13] Back in XXXX, the claimant continued to experience ongoing mistreatment. Both co\u00ad workers and XXXX misgendered and mocked the claimant. She was treated with no respect at work. When she was harassed by XXXX or members of the public, her employer did not provide any assistance; instead, HR staff and her supervisors laughed at her.\n[14] Outside of work she was frequently abused; people spat at her for dressing and acting \u201clike a girl.\u201d She was assaulted and robbed in public. She did not receive any assistance from the police, and was even told that she \u201cdeserved it\u201d when she reported crimes against her to the authorities. At times police have themselves sexually harassed the claimant.\n[15] The claimant has been careful to dress in a manner that would not attract attention. She had to give up using public transportation because of the abuse she encountered on the bus, and began commuting to and from work daily by taxi. She lived in fear of being attacked and was constantly depressed.\n[16] By XXXX 2018, the claimant had saved enough money to leave Fiji. She was issued a Canadian visa on XXXX XXXX, 2018, and an American transit visa on XXXX XXXX, 2018. She arrived in Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2018. She completed her Basis of Claim form (BOC) and sought protection on XXXX XXXX, 2018.\nDETERMINATION\n[17] I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[18] I find that the claimant is a citizen of Fiji.\n[19] The claimant has provided a copy of her passport identifying her as a citizen of Fiji.4 The passport was issued on XXXX XXXX, 2009, and expired on XXXX XXXX, 2019. Although by now the passport has expired, it was a valid passport when the claimant entered Canada in XXXX 2018.\n[20] The claimant\u2019s passport has a Canadian visa and an American visa. The American visa has a photograph of the claimant and identifies her nationality as Fijian.\n[21] The claimant has provided a copy of her XXXX XXXX as a XXXX XXXX, issued by the Fiji XXXX XXXX in XXXX 2018.5 She has provided a copy of her Republic of Fiji learner permit, issued to the claimant when she was working on XXXX XXXX and expiring in XXXX 2017.6 These documents demonstrate the claimant\u2019s long-term presence in Fiji.\nNexus\n[22] I find that there is a nexus between the persecution alleged and the claimant\u2019s membership in a particular social group as a transgender woman in Fiji.\nCredibility\n[23] Based on the documents in the file, I have noted no serious credibility issues.\n[24] The claimant\u2019s identity as a woman is clearly established by the photographs in the identification documents she has provided.\n[25] The oldest photograph of the claimant in evidence before me is her photograph in her passport.7 The passport was issued in 2009, when the claimant was 19 years old. In this photograph the claimant has short hair and is wearing a men\u2019s or unisex shirt. The passport gives the claimant\u2019s sex as \u201cM\u201d for male.\n[26] The next photograph of the claimant is on her learner\u2019 s permit. Although there is no date on the permit to say when it was issued, the permit expired on XXXX XXXX, 2017. In this photograph the claimant has long hair in a feminine style. Although the copy of the permit in evidence is in black and white, it is clear that the claimant is wearing tasteful makeup. She is wearing a shirt with a wide collar that is consistent with women\u2019s clothing. The person in this photograph is the same person as in the passport photograph. In this photograph, the claimant is clearly presenting as a woman.\n[27] The permit does not include an entry for gender. However, despite the claimant\u2019s obvious feminine appearance, her name on the permit is \u201cXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.\u201d\n[28] The next photograph in time is the photograph in the claimant\u2019s XXXX XXXX XXXX, which was valid beginning on XXXX XXXX, 2018. The claimant\u2019s hairstyle has changed slightly from the photograph in her learner\u2019s permit; her long hair is hanging to her left, rather than her right. Again, the claimant clearly presents as a woman in this photograph.\n[29] The most recent photograph of the claimant in evidence before me is attached to her Generic Application Form, and is dated XXXX XXXX, 2018.8 This photograph is in color. The claimant is wearing feminine makeup (lipstick, eye liner and eye shadow), applied in a competent manner. She is wearing feminine clothing and jewelry. The claimant in the photograph clearly presents as a woman.\n[30] I recognize that, when I describe the claimant\u2019s appearance in these photographs as feminine, I am interpreting her presentation using North American assumptions. From the photographs, the claimant presents as a woman \u2013 in North America. Her appearance in the photographs \u2013 her hair, clothing, and makeup \u2013 are all consistent with how professional women in North America are expected by society to present.\n[31] I have considered whether the claimant\u2019s presentation might be interpreted as more masculine by Fiji\u2019s community standards. There is no evidence before me to suggest that Fijian style is so different that the claimant would be seen as masculine in Fiji.\n[32] The claimant has provided evidence in her BOC that she has declared as true, with the same force and effect as if made under oath.9 When a claimant swears to the truth of her allegations, those allegations are presumed to be true unless there is a reason to doubt their truthfulness.10 I see no reason to doubt the truthfulness of the claimant\u2019s allegations.\n[33] The claimant is clear, throughout her BOC and attached narrative, that she wears women\u2019s clothing and presents as feminine. Even recognizing that I am approaching her photographs using North American presumptions, in her photographs, the claimant is feminine in appearance.\n[34] The claimant has provided a copy of a complaint she made to the police in XXXX 2018.11 In the \u201cBackground Information\u201d section, the claimant is referred to as \u201che.\u201d However, in the section for identification of the complainant, beside \u201cSex,\u201d \u201cF\u201d has been circled and then crossed out, with \u201cM\u201d left circled. This is consistent with the claimant\u2019s allegations that she presents herself to the public in Fiji as a woman.\n[35] Based on all of the evidence before me, I find that the claimant\u2019s evidence is credible. I find that the claimant has established that she is a transgender woman. She identifies as a woman and presents herself as a woman, although she was born a biological male.\nObjective basis of future risk\n[36] The BOC asks each claimant to identify their sex as identified in their passport. The claimant has marked \u201cMale,\u201d consistent with her passport. The BOC then provides the opportunity for a claimant to self-identify their sex or gender if the claimant does not identify with the sex or gender in their passport. The claimant has written that she identifies herself as \u201cFemale.\u201d As set out above, I find that the claimant is a transgender woman.\n[37] The claimant is identified as male by Fijian authorities. His passport gives his sex as male, and his learner\u2019s permit refers to him as \u201cMr.\u201d12 She is referred to as \u201che\u201d in the police report, and the gender identification is amended from female to male.13 However, as is clear from the photographs, the claimant presents herself to the world as a woman, and has been doing so for years.14\n[38] The claimant has set out her personal experiences in her BOC and narrative.15 She has faced constant harassment and abuse because she is a woman. She has been pulled out of school. She has been beaten by her father. She has been transferred at work against her will, for no legitimate reason. She has been subject to verbal abuse and physical violence by the community. When she has sought assistance from police or her employer, she has been met with indifference or further abuse.\n[39] The constant mistreatment has left her XXXX. She has had to consider very carefully how she can present herself to the world while still trying to remain true to her identity. She has had to change her life to protect herself, to the extent that she cannot feel safe using public transit. I find that the cumulative harassment that the claimant has experienced in Fiji amounts to persecution. There is no basis to believe that she will face any better treatment if she were to return now.\n[40] The claimant\u2019s experiences are consistent with the objective evidence before me.\n[41] Fiji\u2019s constitution prohibits discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation, gender, and gender identity and expression. Nonetheless, LGBTI persons continue to face discrimination in areas such as employment, housing, or access to health care in Fiji.16\n[42] Transgendered persons in Fiji have been killed in hate crimes. In one reported case a person was charged in that death.17 However, in two other cases there were no arrests reported, and members of the LGBTI community expressed distrust of the police based on past experiences of harassment, discrimination and violence by authorities.18 Reports of the murder of a transgender woman did not acknowledge that she was trans and did not describe the murder as a hate crime.19\n[43] The president of Fiji has launched a campaign to combat prejudice and violence against the LGBTI community in Fiji.20 However, in 2019 the prime minister of Fiji and religious and community leaders have made strong public statements opposing same sex marriage, with the prime minister saying it would never happen as long as his government remained in power because Fiji was a God-fearing country.21\n[44] This has been a long-held position. In 2016 the prime minister also expressed opposition to same-sex marriage, characterizing the issue as \u201ca topic pushed by NGOs \u2026 under the issue of human rights.\u201d The prime minster is quoted as saying, regarding a woman who wants to marry another woman, \u201cGo and have it done in Iceland and stay and live there.\u201d22\n[45] The strong public condemnation of same-sex marriage and its illegality effectively prevents the claimant from marrying in Fiji. The claimant is identified by authorities as biologically male, and so she cannot marry a man. The claimant presents as and appears to be a woman, and so will be subject to societal abuse if she takes another woman as her spouse. The claimant is trapped in the middle and denied the possibility of having such a relationship.\n[46] There is some support expressed for LGBTI rights in Fiji. However, LGBTI persons continue to face harassment, discrimination, and potentially lethal violence. Prominent members of the government and community continue to express opposition to LGBTI rights because of strongly held conservative and traditional beliefs.23\n[47] This is consistent with Fiji\u2019s patriarchal society. Despite legal protections for women from domestic and gendered violence, a large majority of women in Fiji continue to experience violence linked to pervasive gender stereotypes and norms of male dominance. More than half of women surveyed have had partners who insisted on knowing where they were at all times, and more than a third have had to ask permission from their husbands before seeking health care for themselves. Almost half of all women surveyed, 43%, agreed that there are \u201cgood\u201d reasons for a man to hit his wife, including for some if the woman does not complete household work to the man\u2019s satisfaction.24\n[48] Traditional support for male dominance has led in Fiji to underreporting of widespread gender violence and a persistent perception among law enforcement officials that domestic violence is a private matter. Perpetrators of gender-based violence against women frequently enjoy impunity. Hate speech against women is prevalent in society and the media.25\n[49] As a woman, the claimant faces this threat of violence. As a transgendered woman in a conservative, male-dominated society, the threat she faces is even greater.\n[50] Violence against women is publicly and officially condemned in Fiji. However, it is still accepted societally, and continues to occur with impunity because of traditional values. Despite the government\u2019s stated support for some LGBTI rights, trans women in Fiji cannot realistically have better protection than other women in Fiji.\n[51] Based on all of the evidence before me, I find that the claimant has established that there is an objective basis for her fear of persecution in Fiji. I am satisfied that the claimant faces a serious risk of persecution if she were to return to Fiji.\n[52] For the reasons set out above, I find that the claimant has rebutted the presumption of state protection. As noted above, despite the government\u2019s stated position, I find that the state does not provide adequate protection to LGBTI persons in Fiji. Gender-based crimes of violence based on traditions of male dominance continue to occur with impunity.\n[53] The claimant has sought protection from the state. She has not received any protection. Instead, she has received insults and further abuse.\n[54] Similarly, I find that the claimant does not have a viable internal flight alternative. Based on the evidence before me, I find that she faces a serious risk of persecution throughout Fiji.\n[55] The level of protection provided by the state, and the attitudes of the community, are consistent throughout Fiji. Further, the claimant has relocated in Fiji. She has lived in Suva, the capital and largest city in the country, and has experienced persecution there. She has lived in a small rural community, and has experienced persecution there.\nCONCLUSION\n[56] For the reasons set out above, I find that the claimant XXXX XXXX, aka XXXX XXXX, is a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA, and I therefore accept her claim for protection.\n(signed) Nick Bower\nSeptember 25, 2019\n1 S.C. 2001, C. 27.\n2 Instructions governing the streaming of less complex claims at the Refugee Protection Division, effective Jan. 29, 2019.\n3 Chairperson \u2018s Guideline 9: Proceedings Before the IRB Involving Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and\nExpression, effective May 1, 2017.\n4 Exhibit 1.\n5 Exhibit 1.\n6 Exhibit 1.\n7 Exhibit 1.\n8 Exhibit 1.\n9 Exhibit 2.\n10 Maldonado v.

Please note, that the written reproduction of this decision may contain changes in grammar, syntax and references to additional country conditions as the case may be. Your going to receive a written copy of my decision in the mail as well as your counsel. The claimant in this matter is XXXX XXXX XXXX. She is a Mexican citizen and claims refugee protection pursuant to Sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, hereafter referred to as IRPA.\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] The claimant\u2019s allegations are fully set out in her Basis of Claim Form found at Exhibit 2. To summarize, the claimant alleges a serious possibility of persecution and a risk to life in Mexico on account of her gender identity, her HIV status by Mexican society at large and also a serious possibility of persecution and a risk to her life by La Familia Michoacana, a Mexican drug trafficking organization.\nCHAIRPERSON\u2019S GUIDELINES\n[3] In hearing this claim, I have considered and applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 4, Woman Fearing Gender Related Persecution and Guideline 9, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression.\nDETERMINATION\n[4] I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee as contemplated within Section 96 of IRPA. She has demonstrated a serious possibility of persecution in Mexico on grounds of her gender identity and is therefore, a member of a particular social group, transgendered persons. I should note that the claimant had alternate potential Nexus to the Convention as well. For example, on the basis of her political activism on behalf of the transgender community or on the basis of being a female fearing gender related persecution in Mexico. As I am accepting her claim, my reasons will only focus on one of these Nexuses.\nANALYSIS\nIDENTITY\n[5] The claimant\u2019s identity is established, on a balance of probabilities, by her Mexican passport, contained within Exhibit 1 and a birth certificate and Mexican government documentation confirming her gender transition, both of which are contained in Exhibit 4.\nEXCLUSION UNDER ARTICLE 1F(b)\n[6] The claimant was charged while living in Texas with possession of cocaine. She plead guilty to the lesser included offence of possession of cocaine between 1 to 4 grams. A third-degree felony which was reduced from the original charge of a second-degree felony. She received a sentence of three years in prison but only served a fraction of that sentence before being paroled. She was then subsequently deported to Mexico in early 2011. Details are fully provided in the claimant\u2019s disclosure in Exhibit 4. The equivalent offence under Canadian law would be Section 4 Subsection (1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act for possessing a Schedule One substance. This is a hybrid offence but presumed for our purposes to be an indictable election by the crown.\n[7] In considering the totality of the facts are set out in JS Sikhara v. Canada and its related jurisprudence. I find that the claimant is not excluded from refugee protection under article 1 F(b). I do not have the requisite, serious grounds to consider that a serious non-political crime was committed by the claimant outside the country of refuge. It is highly likely, sorry it\u2019s unlikely she would have a received a custodial sentence at all in Canada, given her status as a first-time offender, her guilty plea which is a sign of remorse and the very small amount of cocaine involved. And so, for those reasons, I find that she\u2019s not excluded from refugee protection.\nINCLUSION\nCREDIBILITY\n[8] I find that the claimant was a credible witness, on a balance of probabilities. Her evidence both in documentary form and in oral examination was consistent, was free from material omissions or contradictions. She was very articulate, she followed my instructions perfectly, she was pleasant and respectful and did not embellish her evidence. I have no concerns with her credibility, but even if I didn\u2019t believe the claimant she would still have her residual profile which would produce a serious possibility of future persecution in Mexico as a member of a particular social, transgendered women. Also, her HIV status and her status as a woman who has experienced past gender related persecution would also expose her to a future persecution for, sorry, to future persecution in Mexico on those grounds as well. In any event, I accept the claimant\u2019s evidence without reservation.\n[9] I will not revisit all of the details of her claim but the main findings that I would make in grounding my decision as are as follows. First of all, she\u2019s a transgendered Mexican woman, she\u2019s also HIV positive. She has experienced past gender related violence including several sexual assaults and has been threatened with death by her own brother. She has in the past been forcibly sex-, sex trafficked by a Mexican drug cartel, placing an already marginalized person into an even further marginalized group. She has been denied both employment and educational opportunities in Mexico in a systemic fashion on account of her gender identity. She has been diagnosed by the Centre for Addictions in Mental Health with gender dysphoria and post traumatic stress disorder. That report is contained within Exhibit 4 of the claimant\u2019s documents. She has been involved in a number of transgender rights and LGBTQ organizations as an advocate in United States and Canada and would continue that activism even if she was returned to Mexico. She has a sincerely held belief that if returned to Mexico she would face persecution and violence on account of her gender identity, her diagnosis and her trans rights activism. She believes that she would not have access to her currently prescribed medication in Mexico which would pose a risk to her life and also her dignity as a human being.\nNEXUS\n[10] As I mentioned, I find that the claimant is the member of a particular social group, transgendered persons. Gender identity is an innate and unchangeable characteristic of a human being as identified in Ward v. Canada and as such this claimant has a Nexus to the convention.\nSUBJECTIVE FEAR\n[11] The claimant at all material times has acted consistent with someone who professes a subjective fear of persecution. For example, the claimant filed for refugee protection within a month of her arrival in Canada. As such, and in part because I found her wholly credible, I find that there is sufficient evidence on the record to conclude that the claimant has a subjective fear of persecution on a Convention ground.\nOBJECTIVE BASIS\n[12] Counsel has filed 22 articles detailing the violence against LGBTQ persons in Mexico. The first article details that Mexico is now the world\u2019s second deadliest country for trans people, it is dated September 11th, 2019. Another article from May 7th, 2019, discusses how a shortage of HIV drugs in Mexico have left hundreds of people without medication, which is essential to their survival. Other articles included, describe the torture in gruesome murder of gay men and trans-gendered women in Mexico. I find that these articles are wholly consistent with the National Documentation for Mexico-, National Documentation Package for Mexico as a whole vis \u00e0 vis transgendered persons. They are very recent articles and I find that they are highly probative and I furthermore, place great weight on counsel\u2019s documentary disclosure. Turning now to the NDP for Mexico, Item 6.1 of the NDP notes that, \u201cA report on crimes against transgendered women sent to the research director by a representative at the support centre for transgender identities, in Spanish, Centro de Apoyo a las Identidades Trans or CAIT, an NGO that advocates for the rights of transgendered woman in Mexico, indicates that transgendered women are discriminated against by the police in the judicial authorities.\u201d The representative from Colectivo Leon Gay Ac, which is also a-, an NGO for transgendered persons, indicated that LGBTQ persons are frequently harassed and arbitrarily detained due to their physical appearance, the way they dress or for express-, expressing affection in public.\n[13] The representative also indicated that they are barred from assembling in public because they are seen as, \u201cengaging in prostitution\u201d or giving a, \u201cbad example or bad image to society.\u201d According to Colectivo Leon Gay Ac, officials from the public ministry often mistreat LGBTQ persons and refuse to open investigations for crimes against them. In-, In correspondence with the research directorate, a representative from Queer Investigations, a civil society that advocates for the right of LGT-, rights of LGBTQ persons in Mexico, indicated that despite a lot of training provided to judicial authorities on sexual diversity, there\u2019s still a lot of intimidation and threats against the LGBTQ population due to what they perceive as faults against morals, which are used to extort members of the LGBTQ community.\n[14] Also, from item 6.1, \u201cTransgender women in Mexico face brutal violence, not only from private citizens but also from state officials.\u201d Police officers in the military subject transgender women to arrest, extortion and physical abuse. Many transgender women have been the victims of police violence or know someone who have been a victim. According to Victor Clark, Professor at San Diego University and the Director of the Bi-National Centre for Human Rights in Tijuana, Mexico, the police and military are the primary predators targeting trans gender women. Mexican police target transgender women and arbitrarily arrest them for pretextual reasons such as, \u201cdisturbing the peace\u201d and \u201cbecause they were not wearing female clothing for being perceived to be sex workers even if they were not, for failing to carry a valid health card for-, for allegedly carrying drugs or for being said to be gay.\u201d\n[15] For example, in March 2014, police officers in Chihuahua, Mexico arrested five transgender women for not carrying a health card even though this isn\u2019t a crime. At the police station, male police officers forced the transgender woman to undress in front of them. The police then illegally forced the women to take HIV tests, the police held the transgender women in jail for 36 hours and demanded 200 pesos from each woman for release. For decades, the Mexican police forces have been implicated in cases of arbitrary detention, torture and other human rights violations that are often unpunished. Police officers often extort transgender women for sex or money in return for not arresting them or for releasing them from jail. Many transgender women have had to pay almost daily bribes to avoid being arrested.\n[16] Furthermore, in its March 2017 Human Rights report, covering the year 2016, the USDOS report notes the following concerning the discrimination of LGBTQ persons in Mexico. Discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity was prevalent, despite a gradual increase in the public tolerance of LGBTQ individuals according to public opinion surveys. In March, Ruby Suareaz Araujo began-, became the first transgender municipal counsellor in Guanajuato, for example. In October the press reported three killings of transgender individuals in a space of 13 days. NGOs stated that transgender individuals face discrimination and were mar-, marginalized even within the gay and lesbian community. These are but a few examples of the information contained within the claimant\u2019s Country Conditions Documentation and the NDP for Mexico, which for reference is Exhibit 3. I find that in considering all of this information, that the-, on a balance of probabilities, the claimant has demonstrated an objective basis for her subjective fear of persecution in Mexico on account of her membership in a particular social group, transgender women and also on account of her HIV diagnosis, and so in that vain her fear is well-founded.\nSTATE PROTECTION\n[17] States are presumed to be capable of protecting their citizens. Mexico is a democratic country with a functioning government and a military that exercises effective control over its territory. Therefore, the claimant must-, must rebut the presumption of state protection with clear and convincing evidence. Where the state itself is an agent of persecution, however, the claimant will also succeed at rebutting this presumption. The country documentation for Mexico provides sufficient documentation to demonstrate that state actors are often an agent of persecution for members of the LGBTQ co-, community and especially the trans community. Claimants are not required to place their lives in jeopardy to avail themselves of state protection, which in any case would not be reasonably forthcoming. Item 6.1 provides the following examples where state actors have been implicated in the atrocities against LGBTQ persons, \u201cIn Mexico City a young man was alleg-, allegedly arrested by federal police officers while he was walking the street late at night. When asked why he was being arrested, the officers answered, \u201cbecause you are gay\u201d and then asked him to preform oral sex on them.\u201d\n[18] Police abuses also reported to take place in and around places were LGBTQ persons socialize or-, or its surroundings. For example, a violent police raids reported to have taken place at a LGBTQ beauty pageant in Monterrey, Mexico in February 2013. Agents of the federal police force under the command of an official of the Federal Public Ministry stormed the nightclub where the contest was taking place, ordered everyone out and arrested at least 70 people who were present at the event who were fined without criminal charges. According to the information presented to the commission, police agents insulted them using homophobic and trans-phobic slurs, \u201cfaggots, we are taking you because you are dressing up-, because dressing up as women is immoral.\u201d\n[19] The claimant has testified today that she has little faith in the ability of the authorities in Mexico to protect her. She alleges that the transgender community at large feels the same way. Item 6.3 explains why that might be. From Item 6.3, transgender women often do not report hate crimes or police abuse because the authorities rarely investigate these crimes. When the police do get involved, they frequently minimize the crime and mischaracterize it for example, in violent murder cases the police usually determine that the cases are \u201ccrimes of passion,\u201d instead of hate crimes. Holding police and military abusers accountable is also difficult. The process for punishing the police and military is, \u201cextremely slow and inadequate.\u201d\n[20] Transgender women avoid reporting police out of fear of police retaliation against them or their family members. Further, human rights commissions tend to be anti-LGBTQ and will often disregard complaints by transgender women. Transgender women cannot depend on inadequate and ineffective laws penalizing hate crimes to protect their rights. Since Mexico recognized same sex marriage in 2010, several prominent advocates in the transgender community have been brutally murdered. Many of these killings occurred in Mexico City despite its adaptation of hate crimes statues and anti-discrimination laws. In 2010, a Mexican National Survey about discrimination found that 83.4 % of LGBTQ Mexicans had faced discrimination because of their sexual preference. In 2011, the same survey reported the principal bases of discrimination was sexual preference. In 2012, however, gender identity was the most frequent bases for discrimination showing growing rates of discrimination against the transgender community. \u201cIt is clear the Mexican government is unable to effectively protect transgender women\u201d, that\u2019s a direct quote.\n[21] In considering the testimony of the claimant and the documentary evidence provided by counsel and the National Documentation f-, for Mexico, I find that the claimant has rebutted this presumption of state protection with clear and convincing evidence. I find that adequate state protection would not be forthcoming for this claimant and I find that the Mexican state itself is an agent of persecution for her.\n[22] Lastly, internal flight alternative. The claimant alleges a fear of Mexican society in general as well as the La Familia Michoac\u00e1n Cartel. I purposed Mexico City as a-, as an internal flight alternative outside of Michoac\u00e1n that I believed would be safe and reasonable in the claimant\u2019s circumstances. For the following reasons, I find that the claimant would face a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground in Mexico City and therefore, the IFA location fails the first prong of the analysis. Item 6.4 depicts Mexico City as the most progressive area in-, in Mexico visive LGBTQ rights. For example, it was the first district to legalize same sex marriage and also to allow persons to change their gender identity. One source quoted in this item said that there are, \u201cgay friendly zones or gay zones where the LGBTQ community feel safe from being abused. Although there are police officers that look for anyway to intimidate or extort couples wherever they are.\u201d\n[23] The UN special rapporteur on extra judicial and arbitrary executions noted, \u201cthe alarming pattern of grotesque homicides from lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals and the broad impunity for these crimes, sometimes with the suspected complexity of investigative authorities.\u201d According to the report by CA-, CEAV and Fundaci\u00f3n Acrois, trans women and homosexuals represent the group most effected by motivated physical assaults. Between January 2014 and December 2016, 202 sexual minorities or those perceived as such were killed as a result of their sexual orientation or gender identity or expression. Including 108 trans women, 93 gay men and 1 lesbian woman. The highest number of victims, 76, was recorded in 2016. Of the total 202 victims, 33 showed signs of torture while 15 showed signs of sexual violence.\n[24] In addition to these cases, I also eluded to a case from Mexico City earlier in my decision. In item 6.4 discusses how in June 2012 in Mexico City, the body of a transgendered women was dismembered. Her remains were found abandoned in different neighbourhoods in the Benito Juarez District. In 2013 police found the body of a transgender woman who headed the special unit for attention to members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transsexual, transgender, transsexual and intersex community of the Attorney General of the Federal District. In July 2013, two attackers released pepper spray into a crowd of 500 at a beauty contest for transgendered woman. Again, these are but a few examples of the violence and persecution that trans people face on a daily basis. And Mexico City does not appear to be the safe-, as safe as it is liberal for the LGBTQ community.\n[25] Ultimately, I find that the preponderance of evidence weighs in favour of the finding that the claimant would face a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground in Mexico City and throughout Mexico and therefore, I find that the proposed IFA location is not safe for her.\nCONCLUSION\n[26] The claimant has demonstrated a serious possibility of persecution in Mexico on the Convention ground of membership in a particular social group, transgender women. This, this serious possibility exists on a forward-looking basis and throughout Mexico such that there is no location within Mexico which is both safe and reasonable in all of her circumstances. She has demonstrated, on a balance of probabilities, that the adequate state protection would not be forthcoming for her, in part because the state authorities are an agent of persecution. As such, the claimant is a Convention refugee within the meaning of Section 96 of IRPA. Her claim is therefore, accepted.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

Gayda\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Nicholas Woodward\nCountry: Bahamas\nRPD Number: TB8-27227\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2022-00978\nATIP Pages: 000106-000110\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: Okay, we are on the record and I am ready to give you my decision. I am going to accept your claim. This is the refugee protection decision for the claimant XXXX XXXX XXXX, the File Number is TB8-27227.\n[2] You are claiming refugee pursuant to Sections 96 and 97 (1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. I have considered your testimony and the other evidence in the claim as well as guidelines 4 and 9.\n[3] Guideline 4 deals with gender related claims and guideline relates to proceedings before the Immigration and Refugee Board involving sexual orientation, gender identity and expression. After considering all of the above I am ready to give you my decision.\n[4] I find that you are a Convention refugee. You have established on a balance of probabilities a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground, the nexus being your membership in a particular social group, namely a bisexual woman.\n[5] Your allegations are set out in your Basis of Claim Form. In summary, you allege that you are a citizen of the Bahamas and you fear harm at the hands of society due to your sexual orientation.\n[6] You have on a balance of probabilities established your personal and national identity through your testimony and the provision of your Bahamian passport to Immigration Refugee Citizenship Canada when you made your refugee claim at an inland office.\n[7] A certified true copy of your passport is before me in Exhibit 1.\n[8] I find that you have established on a balance of probabilities that you are a bisexual woman and you have a subjective fear of persecution based up on this.\n[9] You gave clear and convincing testimony about who you are and how you came to the realization that you were attracted to girls and then women, your past same sex relationships as well as your heterosexual relationships and your fear that others in the Bahamian community discovering your sexual orientation including some people close to you such as family members and ex-abusive male partners and the fear of having to keep your true self hidden in order to avoid physical aggression and verbal taunts and harassment from such people as well as the Bahamian community at large if you were to return to Bahamas.\n[10] Your testimony was detailed and spontaneous about your life including your male and female relationships and your attempt to get documents to assist in corroborating your allegations.\n[11] You also provided credible testimony about your family but your family suspecting you of being a lesbian as they thought something, I should say suspected something about your girlfriend at one point who was dressed in a more masculine manner with one uncle aggressively saying homophobic things such as keep your sissy friends outside on the streets.\n[12] You testified that you felt you had nowhere to go and that those who were supposed to support you as your family did not do so and that society wouldn\u2019t be on your side either if you were to be true self.\n[13] Further, your testimony was generally consistent with your Basis of Claim Form and also supported by two letters from the Bahamas and the writer\u2019s identity documents were also provided along with those letters.\n[14] One is from a fellow co-worker who was also a bisexual to whom you disclosed your sexual orientation as a bisexual in the past and another letter was from a past woman you would had a brief sexual relationship within Bahamas.\n[15] You also provided me when asked at the hearing with your phone to look at your text history of your conversations with the woman that you have been having, such text history showed since XXXX of 2019 up to the present day and this is someone you were interested in and you have met a few times but with whom you have not yet been physically intimate with.\n[16] You also showed me your dating profile on the online dating website MeetMe that showed your orientation as bisexual.\n[17] You provided me access to these items without hesitation and they assist in corroborating your sexual orientation.\n[18] I find that minor inconsistencies in your testimony are not material and do not go to the core of your claim that you presently and for the foreseeable future identify as a bisexual woman and you fear discrimination, threats and other harms if you were openly who you are if you return to the Bahamas.\n[19] Moving to the subjective basis of your claim. You had previously travelled to the USA over the years on several occasions. You explained that you had aunts, uncles, and cousins there and would usually stay with them and these trips were often for special celebrations such as birthdays, to do shopping and also to give you a chance to clear your head and have some relaxation.\n[20] The trips were generally all of short duration of a few days to a maximum of just over one month. I asked if you had ever thought of making an asylum claim in the USA and you indicated that you had not known that such a thing is possible at the times of these trips.\n[21] You had testified similar to your Basis of Claim Form that you only learned of making a refugee claim on the basis of your sexual orientation in Canada when you were visiting Canada for what you thought would be a short trip and when you met friends who were LGBT friendly of a friend you were staying within Canada after which point you started to look into the process of making a refugee claim here in Canada.\n[22] You candidly acknowledged in your testimony that if you had known about the process while visiting the USA you don\u2019t think you would have claimed there at that point as you believe the USA to be unsafe in terms of racial violence.\n[23] I accept that you are subjectively fearful of returning to the Bahamas and that you have reasonably explained why you did not previously claim asylum while visiting the USA.\n[24] I find therefore that you have well-founded subjective fear of persecution.\n[25] Moving to the objective basis of you claim, the objective country reports and the articles and reports found in the National Documentation Package at Exhibit 3 and in counsel\u2019s country conditions evidence found at Exhibit 5 are consistent with your evidence about what you have experienced.\n[26] In Exhibit 3, I refer specifically to Item 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3; those documents indicate that the LGBTQ population in Bahamas face widespread discrimination, harassment, and at time violence from community members and that LGBT persons are usually fearful of being open about their sexual orientation.\n[27] In summary, I find that you have established on a balance of probabilities that you have well founded fear of persecution in the Bahamas as a bisexual woman.\n[28] State protection, based on your personal circumstances as well as the objective country documentation I have just briefly outlined, I find that you have rebutted the presumption of State protection, adequate State protection is not available to you in the Bahamas as a bisexual woman.\n[29] You testified that you did not think the police would care in assisting someone seen as a lesbian or bisexual and that the police similar to many in the community in the Bahamas are homophobic.\n[30] Although homosexuality was decriminalized in the Bahamas in 1991, LGBT persons face widespread stigmatization and discrimination as homophobia is permeated throughout cultural attitudes and expressed in religion, music and other expressions, that is a quote from Item 6.1 in the NDP.\n[31] According to many sources in the National Documentation Package for example Item 2.3, Freedom in the World Report of 2018, discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity is not prohibited by law and LGBT people report discrimination in employment and housing.\n[32] The law in Bahamas does not provide protections against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.\n[33] The objective country reports indicate that significant stigma against homosexuality persists in the Bahamas and that this is widespread and often results in psychological and physical violence without adequate protection from the authorities.\n[34] Items again 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3 of the National Documentation Package report that police in the Bahamas did not take threats and crimes against the LGBT community seriously and often ridiculed LGBT persons who came to them for help.\n[35] We are turning now to the issue of internal flight alternative. On a balance of probabilities, I find that there is no viable internal flight alternative for you in the Bahamas.\n[36] The objective evidence before me indicates that homophobia and the resulting violence and discrimination experienced by people on the LGBT spectrum are common problems throughout the country and therefore there is no part of the country where you could live safely and openly as a bisexual woman.\n[37] In conclusion, based on the totality of the evidence I find you to be a Convention refugee and I accept your claim. All the best, we are concluded.\nCLAIMANT: Thank you.\nMEMBER: You are welcome.\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

Andrachuk\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Hannah Lindy\nCountry: Saudi Arabia\nRPD Number: TB7-24971\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2022-00978\nATIP Pages: 000097-000100\nDECISION\n[1] On September 5, 2019, the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) heard the claim of XXXX XXXX XXXX, who claims refugee protection under sections 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA). On that same day, the panel rendered its oral positive decision and Reasons for decision. This is the written version of the oral decision and Reasons that have been edited for clarity, spelling, grammar and syntax with added references to the documentary evidence and relevant case law where appropriate.\n[2] XXXX XXXX XXXX, I have considered your testimony and I am ready to render my decision orally.\n[3] You claim to be a citizen of Saudi Arabia. You claim refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.1\n[4] In rendering my reasons, I have considered the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9: Proceedings Before the IRB Involving Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression (SOGIE).2\n[5] Your Basis of Claim (BOC) Form3 contained your detailed allegations. I will just give a very brief summary.\n[6] You allege that, although you were born in a female body, you have always felt as a male and were not interested in female things. Even throughout childhood and your high school and post-secondary education, you felt as a male and you wanted to pursue male interests. However, this was impossible for you to do in Saudi Arabia.\n[7] Now, since in arriving in Canada you now dress as a male and you have a male haircut and are undergoing hormone treatment to transition to acquire male characteristics, and eventually to a male appearing body.\n[8] You allege that you fear that you could not live in Saudi Arabia as your true self, as a transgender male, and that the only way you could survive there is if you looked and totally acted as a female.\n[9] Your fear is directed towards the government and the police, society in general, as well as fear of your own family. You fear that, particularly your father, could never accept you as a transgender male and that in order not to bring shame to the family, he would even consider killing you.\n[10] I determine, based on your evidence and the objective evidence, that you are a Convention refugee as your fear of persecution is based on membership in the particular social group of transgender individuals. I find your fears are objectively well-founded.\n[11] In regards to your personal identity and identity as a citizen of Saudi Arabia, I find that you have established your identity by your testimony and supporting documentation, particularly a certified true copy of your passport,4 the original of which is with the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA).\n[12] The issues in this case are your identity, the credibility of your identity as a transgender male, and the well-foundedness of your fear of persecution in Saudi Arabia.\n[13] In regards to credibility, I find that you were a credible witness. Therefore, I accept what you have alleged in support of your claim.\n[14] You have provided evidence that lead me to accept that you are living as a male and transitioning to a male body. You have submitted sufficient documents5 that you are receiving masculinizing hormonal treatment and that you are under a doctor\u2019s supervision in the process of your transition.\n[15] You also have testified that you are pursuing surgical procedures to complete your transition, and at first you are planning to undergo top surgery for the removal of your breasts.\n[16] In this regard, Exhibit 46 has several documents which attest to what treatment you are undergoing. For example, you submitted prescription receipts7 for the hormone injections that you receive weekly, and two letters8 from two doctors that you are have been under their care, including transgender care and other treatments since XXXX 2017.\n[17] I find that, on a balance of probabilities, you have established your identity as a transgender male.\n[18] In regard to the well-foundedness of your fear, I find that there is sufficient evidence in our National Documentation Package (NDP),9 as well as in counsel\u2019s country document package, submitted as Exhibit 5,10 which proves that your fears are well-founded.\n[19] The objective documentation supports your allegations that individuals in your circumstances would face persecution in Saudi Arabia.\n[20] Counsel has pointed to the Canadian travel advisory in regard to Saudi Arabia in Exhibit 5.11 The travel advisory basically states that those convicted of engaging in sexual acts between individuals of the same sex would be punished, as it is illegal to engage in those activities. And, the same travel advisory states bluntly that being transgender is illegal in Saudi Arabia.12\n[21] Our National Documentation Package also indicates, particularly in the United States Department of State\u2019s (US DOS) \u201cSaudi Arabia 2018 Human Rights Report\u201d that \u201c[i]t is illegal for men \u2018to behave like women\u2019 \u2026 and visa versa.\u201d13 It is noted also that no lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) groups operate in Saudi Arabia and there is little freedom of the press to indicate to what extent LGBTQ members may be persecuted.14\n[22] The Freedom House report at item 2.4 of the NDP, echoes the US DOS report, that same sex activity is prohibited under Sharia law and that LGBTQ members are at risk of persecution or even death.15\n[23] Item 6.1 points out that there is state-sponsored homophobia in Saudi Arabia and that government persecutes LGBTQ members, who are usually arrested and often tortured.16 Counsel specifically pointed out the case of the incident where 35 individuals were raided at a party and arrested for cross-dressing,17 and that two Pakistani citizens in that incident died in detention after enduring torture, including flogging.18\n[24] There is also evidence in the Exhibit 519 that society, in general, ostracizes people who are LGBTQ or who do not conform to sexual norms in Saudi Arabia, and not only do they ostracize these people, they may also physically harm them.\n[25] There is also documentation which confirms that not only are transgender people not tolerated in Saudi Arabia, but that there is no surgery available for transgender people to transition to what they believe is their proper sex. In addition, it appears that in Saudi Arabia, you always have to act according to the gender to which you were assigned as you gender at birth.\n[26] In summary, on reviewing the objective evidence that was submitted, I find that your fear of being persecuted in Saudi Arabia is justified and that you would not be able to live as a transgender male there.\n[27] Therefore, I find that you are a Convention refugee and the Refugee Protection Division accepts your claim.\n1 The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IF.PA), S.C. 2001, c.27, as amended, sections 96 and 97(1).\n2 Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9: Proceedings Before the IRB Involving Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression, Guidelines issued by the Chairperson pursuant to paragraph 159(1)(h) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, Effective date: May 1, 2017.\n3 Exhibit 2, Basis of Claim (BOC) Form, received December 20, 2017.\n4 Exhibit 1, Package of information from the referring CBSA\/CIC, received December 20, 2017.\n5 Exhibit 4, Personal Documents, pp.32-42, received August 26, 2019.\n6 Exhibit 4, Personal Documents, received August 26, 2019.\n7 Ibid., pp.35-37.\n8 Ibid., pp.41-42.\n9 Exhibit 3, National Documentation Package (NDP) for Saudi Arabia (March 29, 2019).\n10 Exhibit 5, Country Documents, received August 26, 2019.\n11 Ibid., pp.1-4.\n12 Ibid., p.4.\n13 Exhibit 3, NDP for Saudi Arabia (March 29, 2019), item 2.1, s.6 \u2013 Acts of Violence, Discrimination, and Other Abuses Based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity.\n14 Ibid.\n15 Ibid., item 2.4, s.F4.\n16 Ibid., item 6.1.\n17 Ibid.\n18 Exhibit 5, Country Documents, pp.65-66, received September 10, 2019.\n19 Exhibit 5, Country Documents, received August 26, 2019.\n",

        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2019 RLLR 154\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: December 9, 2019\nPanel: S. Randhawa\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): El-Farouk Khaki\nCountry: Bahamas\nRPD Number: TB7-23928\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2022-00978\nATIP Pages: 000093-000096\n[1] PRESIDING MEMBER: I\u2019ve asked you questions and I\u2019ve listened to counsel\u2019s submissions at this point and I am ready to render my decision and I have reviewed the evidence that\u2019s before me and it\u2019s in abundance including your testimony and I have considered counsel\u2019s submissions.\n[2] I reserve the right to \u2013 this decision is final, but I reserve the right to edit the written version of the reasons for syntax, spelling and grammar and to add references to legal citations and footnotes of country conditions, country documentary evidence as necessary.\n[3] Now you are claiming refugee protection pursuant to Section 96 and Section 97.(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[4] You were born on XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and you\u2019re claiming to be a citizen of Bahamas.\n[5] Now your allegations are presented in your Basis of Claim Form which are the original narrative and then there is the amended narrative and then there is an amendment to the amendment.\n[6] Basically your allegations are that you are \u2013 from the beginning you were lesbian, you liked women and then basically you started as a male and you considered yourself as a male. I\u2019m not going to repeat all the allegations that are in the part of your Basis of Claim Form.\n[7] Now my determinations are that I find you to be a Convention refugee pursuant to Section 96 of the IRPA and a person in need of protection under Section 97 and I find that you\u2019ve established your claim on a balance of probabilities that you are indeed \u2013 you were lesbian, you\u2019re transcending into being a transgender male.\n[8] Now I have also taken into consideration the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9: Proceedings Before the IRB Involving Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression, that is the SOGIE Guidelines. I\u2019m satisfied and accept your personal identity as a citizen of Bahamas since there is a true, certified copy of your Bahamas passport and you recently provided your birth certificate.\n[9] There was \u2013 I had to consider country of reference because of the reference made to your father being from Turks & Caicos (ph). However, according to the birth certificate it indicates that your father was from Bahamas. So I\u2019m not going to address further than that on that issue. I accept that you are who you say you are. You \u2018re transcending into a transgender male.\n[10] You have testified \u2013 you have clarified the facts and you have testified spontaneously. There were certain times that you corrected the counsel and me. However, when a claimant swears that certain facts are true this creates a presumption that they are indeed true unless there is a valid reason to doubt their voracity.\n[11] You identified that there was discrimination and that your family also did not accept the way you were and in the SOGIE Guidelines it\u2019s stated that: \u201cSome individuals with diverse SOGIE may face different risks due to additional factors such as race, ethnicity, religion, faith or belief system, age, disability, health status, social class and education. Where appropriate, these intersectional factors should be considered when determining whether an individual has established a well-founded fear of persecution.\u201d\n[12] In your case you did not embellish or exaggerate.\n[13] The issues identified, one of the issues was failure to claim in the U.S. You have visited U.S. two times or three \u2013 more than three times and you had a visa to go to U.S. You did not file a claim and your reasoning was that you did not know what to do. There were several ways \u2013 your counsel and I asked you why would you not ask some people and your basic answer was that you did not know, you didn\u2019t \u2013 second time you said people \u2013 the way \u2013 when counsel asked you did you know the way people can stay permanently in U.S. you said that they were there on student visa and as student then you could stay. However, you returned back several times, but I do accept your explanation about that.\n[14] And there was a re-availment from Canada two times and your explanation was that your current partner at that time you were going to \u2013 XXXX (ph) I believe was \u2013 you were going to marry her and the marriage didn\u2019t go through. She said she didn\u2019t love you anymore and the marriage fell apart.\n[15] You were asked about sponsorship and you said you were not aware of it. You were asked whether \u2013 XXXX XXXX (ph) who is here (inaudible) you said that you only spent few hours with her that you didn\u2019t know.\n[16] Now the documentary evidence which counsel quoted and the documentary evidence from NDP package which is our number BHS104686.E, it tells us about what the legal situation in Bahamas is. Sources indicate that homosexuality was decriminalized in Bahamas in 1991.\n[17] However, it also states the Bahamas is the only English-speaking Caribbean country where same\u00ad sex acts are legal.\n[18] However, the same document states that protection against discrimination in the workplace based on sexual orientation is not addressed in the Employment Act of 2001 of Bahamas.\n[19] Now in the same document there\u2019s a quotation from the Cari-FLAGS coordinator providing the following Caribbean context to explaining homophobia in Bahamas. \u201cIn the British Caribbean, hyper-masculinity is valued and black men especially are expected to perform their masculinity in compliance with the hegemonic norm. Openly gay men, effeminate men or transgender people are seen as betraying manhood. These values are rigidly policed and it is culturally acceptable to exert physical violence against men who betray these gender norms.\u201d\n[20] This same document goes on to state that: \u201cMajority of LGBT people are not \u2018out\u2019 in the traditional sense, they balance degrees of visibility and invisibility in their personal and professional circles. Physical and psychological violence is typically directed towards \u2018out\u2019 LGBT people like activists, and others who declare publicly their orientation or gender identity.\u201d\n[21] And the same documents indicates that LGBT people in the Bahamas have been subject to violence, including killing.\n[22] There are further indication in this document which indicates that considering \u2013 now failure to claim in and of itself is \u2013 does not negate your claim. So I\u2019m accepting your explanations for that and the documentary evidence supports your claim and you have presented your psychological reports and the reports from Sherbourne Clinic that you are advancing to your next stage of taking treatment.\n[23] So reviewing all the \u2013 considering all the evidence and your counsel\u2019s submissions I find on a balance of probabilities that you are a transgender man, you were lesbian going to transgender and that your testimony was credible and the documentary evidence supports your claim. Therefore, I accept your claim. Good luck.\nCLAIMANT: Thank you.\nCOUNSEL: Thank you.\nPRESIDING MEMBER: Thank you.\n\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2013\n",

        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2019 RLLR 153\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: November 4, 2019\nPanel: Georgia Pagidas\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Tony Manglaviti\nCountry: India\nRPD Number: MB7-19949\nAssociated RPD Number(s): MB7-19977 \/ MB7-19978\nATIP Number: A-2022-00978\nATIP Pages: 000027-000033\nREASONS FOR DECISION\nINTRODUCTION\n[1] This is the decision of the Refugee Protection Division (the Panel) in the claim for refugee protection of XXXX XXXX (\u201cthe claimant\u201d) and his parents, XXXX XXXX XXXX (\u201cthe father\u201d) and XXXX XXXX (\u201cthe mother\u201d), all citizens of India. The claimants are seeking refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (the Act).1\n[2] The claimant\u2019s allegations are detailed in the narrative annexed to the Basis of Claim form (BOC).2 The following is a summary of the allegations therein.\nDETERMINATION\n[3] Having considered the totality of the evidence, the Panel finds that the claimants are \u201cConvention refugees\u201d.\nALLEGATIONS\n[4] The claimant alleges he is a gay man from India.\n[5] The claimant fears returning to his country due to his sexual orientation which has put his life and his parents\u2019 lives in danger.\n[6] The claimant alleges that in 2013, when he went to senior secondary school, he met his partner XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX who was already studying in this school.\n[7] The claimant\u2019s parents learned about his sexual orientation in XXXX 2015. The claimant alleges that they were both shocked and saddened, but that they soon began to support him.\n[8] Police arrested XXXX on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2017, and he confessed about his relationship with the claimant. The claimant alleges that XXXX parents were very strict and conservative, and that they beat XXXX following his release.\n[9] On XXXX XXXX XXXX 2017, upon the complaint of XXXX parents who believed that he contributed to spoiling their child, the claimant\u2019s father was arrested. He was detained in the police station for two days. He was forced to pay money to secure his release.\n[10] The claimant alleges that thereafter his relationship with XXXX ended. He also alleges that his father\u2019s business had to be closed, as they were boycotted by the community.\n[11] The claimants applied for refugee status in Canada, on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2017.\nIdentity\n[12] The claimants\u2019 personal and national identities are established, on a balance of probabilities, by the documentary evidence on file, specifically their passports seized by the Canadian authorities, copies of which are produced in the file.3\nCredibility\n[13] In this context, the determinative issue for the Panel is whether or not the claimant has credibly established, on a balance of probabilities, that he is homosexual. On the basis of the evidence before it, the Panel finds that the claimant has established that he is homosexual.\n[14] In deciding this claim, the Panel considered the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9: Proceedings before the IRB Involving Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression.4\n[15] Testimony given under oath is presumed to be true unless there is a reason for doubting its truthfulness. In this claim, the Panel has no such reasons.\n[16] The Panel finds the claimant was credible with regards to the determinative issue of his claim. The Panel finds the claimant is credible for the following reasons.\n[17] The claimant testified at the hearing in a straightforward manner. He was detailed and open in his answers to the Panel\u2019s questions, and at no time he did try to embellish or exaggerate his allegations as it appears in the examples below.\nDiscovery of Sexual Orientation\n[18] When asked about his discovery of his sexual orientation, the claimant was able to provide a great deal of detail about how he saw himself growing up. He explained that from a young age he realized that he was different when he compared himself to his peers. He felt no attraction for girls, but instead fantasized about boys. As he grew up, he was curious and searched on the internet to learn more about his homosexuality. His descriptions were sincere and believable, and his testimony was not embellished nor rehearsed. There were no discrepancies or inconsistencies in his testimony, nor were there any relevant omissions in his BOC that were not reasonably explained. As a result, the Panel finds that, on a balance of probabilities, the claimant is credible with respect to the discovery of his sexual orientation.\nFirst Intimate Same Sex Relationship\n[19] The claimant testified that his first same-sex relationship began around 2013 in secondary school with his classmate XXXX XXXX, whom he referred to as \u201chis partner\u201d throughout the hearing. His description matched the information contained in his BOC. He took the Panel through the development of his relationship with XXXX, which started as friends at the end of 2013 until it became serious. The claimant testified that he became intimate with XXXX in the XXXX of 2014. He also provided details, such as how he felt both happy and shocked that XXXX accepted his first kiss and how they planned the precautions they would take to avoid raising suspicion in the public, and particularly with XXXX family. He described the emotional ties that had developed between the two of them, and how they spent hours talking in parks, doing yoga together and watching movies. There was coherency to the claimant\u2019s oral testimony that demonstrated the claimant\u2019s credibility. There were no discrepancies between claimant\u2019s testimony and his BOC, nor were there any relevant omissions. As a result, the Panel finds that, on a balance of probabilities, the claimant is credible with respect to his first same-sex relationship.\nLife in Canada\n[20] The claimant also testified about having a casual encounter with two other men in Canada, one of which appearing in the photos he submitted.5 He testified with enthusiasm that he has started organizing entertainment events for his South Asian Community in Montreal, and how he along with others are trying to find a \u201cway to organize a gay event\u201d.\nCorroborative Oral and Documentary Evidence\n[21] When the claimant\u2019s father was asked about the incident of his arrest on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2017, he testified in a sincere and open manner. He confirmed the allegations in the BOC narrative and he explained his problems with the police and the parents of XXXX clearly. When asked about his fear, the claimant\u2019s father was spontaneous and sincere in expressing to the Panel his feelings of fear ever since the incidents with XXXX parents and the police occurred. He added that his fear is ongoing despite the fact that he is in Canada, because of the summons that was issued for his arrest in India. The Panel finds his testimony credible. In support of their claims, the claimants submitted a lawyer\u2019s letter6, a police summons7, a medical report8 and a XXXX report9. The Panel finds that the claimant\u2019s parents established that the underlying cause of their fear is related to the aforementioned events. The Panel further finds these documents credible and affords them full weight.\n[22] The claimant also provided three photographs of himself with his partner. He described in detail the context in which the pictures10 were taken and how they were taken. He also provided pictures11 of himself and two gay friends in Canada that he referred to in his BOC. Again, the claimant was able to describe the context in which these photos were taken and his testimony was consistent with the allegations in his BOC. Therefore, the Panel affords full weight to these pictures.\nSTATE PROTECTION\n[23] The Panel finds that the claimants have rebutted the presumption of state protection with clear and convincing evidence that the Indian state would be unwilling or unable to provide them with adequate protection. The Panel took into account the substantial documentary evidence from independent and reliable sources on the situation in this country from the National Documentation Package for India.12\n[24] The Panel recognizes that the documentary evidence reports13 that same-sex consensual relations were decriminalized in India, in XXXX 2018, when the Supreme Court declared that Section 377 of the Penal Code was unconstitutional. The evidence reports14 that the decriminalization of same-sex conduct will not immediately result in full equality for the LGBT community in India. While the Supreme Court judgement held that the aforesaid reading down of Section 377 shall not lead to the reopening of any concluded prosecutions, the documentary evidence reports that it is too early to draw any conclusions for pending arrests and cases.\n[25] The summons to the claimant\u2019s father was issued prior to the Court decision and the claimant\u2019s name is still on file with the police. Furthermore, the documentary evidence15 confirms that violence, abuse and harassment suffered at the hands of the police still exist throughout India and the Panel therefore finds that the claimants would be at risk.\nINTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE (IFA)\n[26] The Panel proposed Mumbai as a possible IFA for the claimants.\n[27] The Panel finds that the claimants have established that, on a balance of probabilities, they face a serious possibility of persecution in Mumbai. The Panel therefore finds that there is no viable IFA for the claimants in India.\n[28] The claimant\u2019s father is a person of interest to the police and the principal claimant became known to them through XXXX and co-claimant\u2019s arrests by the police.\n[29] Furthermore, the documentary evidence16 reports tenant registration is existent in Mumbai. The purpose of tenant registration is for authorities to verify the identities of the tenants and to confirm that they are not wanted criminals, terrorists or fugitives from the law.17\n[30] In view of all these particular circumstances, the Panel concludes that the claimants would face a serious possibility of persecution should they return to India and live in Mumbai.\n[31] Given that the first prong of the internal flight alternative test has not been met, there is no need to consider the second prong.\nCONCLUSION\n[32] For the foregoing reasons, the Panel concludes that there is a serious possibility that the claimants would be persecuted on the basis of their membership in a particular social group, namely Indian homosexual man and family, in the event of their return to India.\n[33] The claimants XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXXandXXXX XXXX XXXX are \u201cConvention refugees\u201d pursuant to section 96 of the Act. Their claims are therefore accepted.\nGeorgia Pagidas\nNovember 4, 2019\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c, 27, as amended.\n2 Document 2 \u2013 Basis of Claim Form (BOC).\n3 Document 1 \u2013 Package of Information from the referring Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) \/ Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC): Passports.\n4 Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9 of the Refugee Protection Division: Guideline issued by the Chairperson pursuant\nto paragraph 159(1)(h) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act: Involving Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression.

In rendering its reasons, the panel has considered and applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 3 on Child Refugee Claimants: Procedural and Evidentiary Issues and the Chairperson\u2019 Guideline 9 on Proceedings Before the IRB Involving Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression\nDETERMINATION\n[4] I find that the claimant is a Convention Refugee pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA.\nALLEGATIONS\n[5] The claimant is a XXXX XXXXyear-old transsexual male from a suburb of Mexico City in Mexico. His biological father is still in Mexico. His mother is now deceased, after being killed by the claimant\u2019s mother\u2019s partner at the time. The claimant now lives in Canada under the auspices of a guardian.\n[6] The claimant calls himself a transsexual male. When asked why, the claimant explained that his goal is to transition into a male. However, since he hasn\u2019t had any surgeries yet to start that process, he calls himself transsexual as opposed to transgender. He does identify as a male and in that regard, now calls himself XXXX, as opposed to his birthname, XXXX. He stated for the most part, his friends in school refer to him as XXXX, as does his guardian, XXXX and his sister, with whom he lives.\n[7] The claimant testified that he started noticing that he didn\u2019t want to be a woman when he was XXXX years old; he felt like \u201che was living his life inside a body where he didn\u2019t belong.\u201d He was confused because to be a female in Mexico was to act like a \u201cprincess\u201d and to be \u201cdelicate like a woman\u201d. However, he recalls that since he was four that he liked to play rough with everyone and that he didn\u2019t like dressing the \u201cway they wanted him to.\u201d\n[8] These thoughts started becoming more important to him and at age XXXX XXXX he started asking people at school to call him by a different name. Several of his friend\u2019s mothers thought he was weird and complained to his mother. The claimant remembers his mother crying and asking him why he was causing her so many problems. The claimant also remembers being told not to come to school because of who he was.\n[9] When asked about where he is in the process of transition, the claimant explained that he wears a \u201cbinder\u201d to flatten his breasts, that his hair is cut short in the style of a man and that he wears male clothing. He wanted to start testosterone treatment and have breast surgery but the doctor he spoke about this told him he was too young.\n[10] When asked about what he fears if he goes back to Mexico, the claimant stated that he would have many problems. He would have to use the name he was given at birth, XXXX XXXX and the people in Mexico \u201cwouldn\u2019t accept him because they\u2019re close-minded.\u201d\n[11] He saw and heard of people who were transvestites that were either beaten or killed. He stated if he went back, he \u201ccouldn\u2019t be himself\u201d for fear of talking about what he wants to be and being killed.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[12] I find that identity has been proven on the balance of probabilities by the proffering of a passport in the name of the claimant, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, who wishes to be called XXXX. (see Exhibit #1)\nCredibility\n[13] The determinative issue in this matter is whether or not the claimant has credibly demonstrated that he was born a female but is undergoing the process of transitioning to a male. On that issue, the panel has found there is more than enough evidence on the balance of probabilities to make that finding, based on the credible testimony of the claimant, corroborative statement documents and a document from the Gender Program stating that the claimant is on a waiting list. (Exhibit 5) The claimant stated that he went to see a doctor about having surgery which would help to transition him into a male, however he was told that he was too young. All of the above demonstrates the claimant\u2019s clear intentions to transition despite being advised that it was not possible at this juncture due to his young age. As well, the panel has taken note that the claimant is on a waiting list to attend the Gender Program at the University of XXXX. It is reasonable to conclude, that by proceeding with such a project, that the claimant\u2019s gender issues continue to dominate his life and further bolster his claim that he wishes to transition into a male.\n[14] The panel has noted that the Minister provided written submissions in this claim on the issue of credibility. Although it is not clear from reviewing the submissions and the documents, it would appear that the issue of credibility is based on the fact that the claimant originally applied to Canada for a student visa, which was rejected. A few months later, he arrived in Canada and applied for refugee protection. The panel has not been provided with the reasons for the rejection of the student visa application.\n[15] In arriving at a decision on credibility, the panel is unable to conclude that the minister\u2019s submission negatively impacts the claimant\u2019s credibility. The panel found the claimant to be credible in his testimony. He was consistent in his narrative and sincere in his beliefs. In particular, he described his past experiences identifying as a male, trying to express his gender identity as such and being met with a lack of support in his community; for example, having to miss school due to complaints made by his friends\u2019 mothers regarding his request to be called a different name.\nNexus\n[16] I find that the claimant has satisfied the panel that he meets one of the five grounds set out in the Convention Refugee definition by meeting the criterion of being a member of a particular social group, more specifically as a transsexual male with intent to transition into a transgender man.\nWell-Founded Fear\n[17] I find that the claimant has established that he has a well-founded fear of persecution.\n[18] Country conditions from the National Documentation Package demonstrate that Mexico is taking some positive steps with respect to public tolerance of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or questioning (LBBTQ) individuals.2\n[19] However, according to a report by the transgender law centre in Cornell University Law School lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) clinic, it is noted that \u201cit is important for adjudicators to be aware that sexual orientation and gender identity are distinct components of identity\u201d.3\nGender identity describes \u201ceach person\u2019s deeply felt internal and individual experience of gender, which may or may not correspond with the sex assigned at birth, including the personal sense of the body\u2026 and other expressions of gender, including dress, speech and mannerisms.\u201d Sexual orientation, on the other hand, is \u201ceach person\u2019s capacity for\u2026 sexual attraction to, and intimate and sexual relations with, individuals of a different gender or the same gender or more than one gender.\u201d Transgender women are as diverse in their sexual orientations as non-transgender women. They may identify as straight, lesbian, bisexual, queer, or any other sexual orientation. When asylum decisions refer to transgender women as gay men with female sexual identities, it is important to be aware that this may be an inaccurate and therefore disrespectful way of describing the individual\u2019s gender identity. This inaccuracy can have serious and harmful consequences as it may contribute to misunderstandings regarding the deadly dangerous country conditions for transgender women in Mexico, as described below.4\n[20] As well, the same report\u2019s Executive Summary states that despite the legal changes for same-sex couples in recent years, transgender women in Mexico still face pervasive persecution based on their identity gender identity and expression. It notes the following:\nIndeed, violence against LGBT people has actually increased, with transgender women bearing the brunt of this escalation. Changes in the laws have made the LGBT communities more visible to the public and more vulnerable to homophobic and transphobic violence. Increased visibility has actually increased public misperceptions and false stereotypes about the gay and transgender communities. This has produced fears about these communities, such as that being gay or transgender is \u201ccontagious\u201d or that all transgender individuals are HIV positive. These fears have in turn led to hate crimes and murders of LGBT people, particularly women. rans\u2013women continue to face beatings, rape, police harassment, torture and murder in Mexico.5\n[21] It is reasonable to conclude from a review of the country conditions that while there has been some improvement in terms of attitudes towards LGBTQ issues, there is still a long way to go, particularly for persons with the claimant\u2019s profile.\n[22] The claimant is still quite young. He encountered negative attitudes and even some discrimination while he was living in Mexico and while he was commencing his transition. Since coming to Canada he wears his hair very short, has changed his name, wears a \u201cbinder\u201d to hide his female breasts and has inquired into having surgery to complete the transition. It is clear to the panel that the claimant is sincere in his desire to transition. I find that the country conditions demonstrate that the claimant would face a serious possibility of persecution if he were to return to Mexico and continue with the transition that he has begun. Notably, this is not a situation where the claimant would be specifically targeted by his family if he returned; in fact, he quite frankly stated that his family which includes his grandmother and even his father to a certain extent, have expressed support for the claimant\u2019s gender transition.\n[23] I therefore find that the claimant would have a forward-facing serious possibility of persecution if he were to return to Mexico as a transgendered woman.\nSTATE PROTECTION\n[24] States are presumed to be capable of protecting their citizens, except in situations where the state is in a state of complete breakdown. To rebut the presumption of state protection, a claimant must provide \u201cclear and convincing\u201d evidence that state protection is inadequate. I find that the claimant has done so in this case.\n[25] The report referred to earlier from the Cornell University Law School states the following as it pertains to protections in Mexico for Transgender people:\nAs described earlier, transgender women have limited formal legal protections in Mexico against discrimination and hate crimes. Only Mexico City has an antidiscrimination law that explicitly protects against gender identity discrimination. Other protections that exist exclusively in Mexico City include name changes, legal recognition of gender changes, and specialized healthcare for transgender people. Transgender women continue to experience pervasive discrimination in public and in their private lives. Even a representative of CONAPRED stated that \u201ctolerance towards groups such as homosexuals is still \u2018practically the same\u2019 even after the State [Mexico] recognized their rights.\u201d The 2013 U.S. State Department Human Rights Report on Mexico stated that \u201cdiscrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity was prevalent[.]\u201d It also noted that \u201cthe government did not always investigate and punish those complicit in abuses.\u201d Transgender women often do not report hate crimes or police abuse because the authorities rarely investigate these crimes. When the police do get involved, they frequently minimize the crime and mischaracterize it. For example, in violent murder cases the police usually determine that the cases are \u201ccrimes of passion\u201d instead of hate crimes. Holding police and military abusers accountable is also difficult. The process for punishing the police and military is \u201cextremely slow and inadequate.\u201d Transgender women avoid reporting police abuse out of fear of police retaliation against them or their family members. Further, human rights commissions tend to be anti-LGBT and will often disregard complaints by transgender women. Transgender women cannot depend on inadequate and ineffective laws penalizing hate crimes to protect their rights.\n[26] The same report referred to above also references a case of a transgender woman fleeing persecution and torture. The report finds that the court\u2019s decision to grant asylum to the transgender woman was explicit in acknowledging that laws recognizing same-sex marriage do little to protect a transgender woman from discrimination, harassment and violent attacks in daily life in Mexico.6\n[27] I find based on the objective evidence referred to above demonstrates inadequate protection to transgendered persons and therefore rebuts the presumption of state protection\nInternal Flight Alternative (IFA)\n[28] For an IFA to be exist, the panel must be satisfied on a balance of probabilities that (1) the claimant would not face a serious possibility of persecution in that location and (2) that conditions in that location are such that it would be objectively reasonable, in all the circumstances, including those particular to the claimant, for him to seek refuge there.\n[29] Given the panel\u2019s previous analysis of the objective evidence, which indicates that the problems faced by those in the claimant\u2019s situation are widespread and tied to pervasive negative societal attitudes about the claimant\u2019s particular social group, I find that the claimant would face a serious possibility of persecution throughout Mexico. Therefore, I find that an IFA does not exist for the claimant.\nCONCLUSION\n[30] Based on these considerations I conclude that the claimant is a Convention refugee and I accept his claim.\n(signed) \u201cBonita Small\u201d\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n2 Exhibit 3, National Documentation Package, Mexico, 30 August 2019, tab 2.1: Mexico.

I would like to add that in the event that written reasons are issued, they will reflect those that I\u2019m giving you now.\n[2] XXXX XXXX XXXX is a citizen of Uganda who claims refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[3] Her complete allegations are contained in her Basis of Claim form and narrative. A brief summary follows.\n[4] The claimant worked as an XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX at the XXXX XXXX Research Institute, the XXXX, from 2014 onwards. Beginning in XXXX 2018 she secretly began providing XXXX to clients at her home in XXXX XXXX The clients were referred to her by XXXX XXXX (ph) an LGBT activist in Uganda working at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.\n[5] The claimant believed in the work that XXXX and other activists were doing in Uganda, advocating for human rights for LGBT persons. This is why she got involved in this work.\n[6] The claimant was subsequently accused by her community, including the local village counsel, of accommodating LGBT persons and teaching immoral acts due to her counseling sessions out of her home.\n[7] On the XXXXof XXXX XXXX 2018 the claimant was arrested by a police officer accompanied by village security personnel. She was released on a police bond. Following her release she was harassed by members of the community and perceived to be a lesbian. She received death threats.\n[8] She moved with her family to another community, XXXX XXXX, for their safety. Shem found an agent through a friend who helped her get a Canadian visa which was issued on XXXX XXXX 2018.\n[9] The claimant is afraid that she will be arrested and prosecuted in Uganda on the false charge of promoting immoral acts. She\u2019s also afraid of becoming the victim of mob justice as a result of her work with the LGBT community or as a perceived lesbian.\n[10] The determinative issue in this case is credibility.\n[11] The claimant\u2019s identity as a citizen of Uganda is established by her testimony and the supporting documentation filed, including a certified true copy of her passport.\n[12] With respect to credibility, when a claimant swears to the truth of certain allegations this creates a presumption that those allegations are true unless there is reason to doubt their truthfulness. Overall, I found the claimant to be a credible witness.\n[13] For the most part, she testified in a straightforward manner and there were not material inconsistencies or omissions in her testimony or contradictions between her testimony and the other evidence before me that have not been explained.\n[14] There were a few omissions in the claimant\u2019s testimony and her testimony occasionally lacked detail; however, I agree with counsel that these issues were generally minor and\/or could be explained by her serious nervousness during the hearing.\n[15] A few questions arose during the hearing about a number of the documents that the claimant provided in support of her claim, principally the Uganda police bond form. During the hearing I noted that the document provided by the claimant is different in form and content than the contemporary example provided in the NDP. Additionally, some of the printed details on the form appear to be inaccurate relative to objective evidence about the Criminal Code and Procedures in Uganda. Moreover, there is a conspicuous spelling error on a printed part of the form.\n[16] Counsel addressed a few of these issues in her submissions. For example, she produced a wide variety of purported Uganda police documents as a result of a Google search; however, it is unclear that any of these are from an official source or are contemporary with the claimant\u2019s allegations. Therefore I prefer the document in the NDP.\n[17] While it\u2019s far from clear that the bond form is fraudulent or improperly issued I assign little weight to the document as a result of these concerns.\n[18] The claimant also produced a news article from the Red Pepper newspaper, apparently corroborating the basic details of her narrative.\n[19] While the research produced by the Research Directorate about this publication, that is the Red Pepper, indicates that the paper is a purveyor of, to use counsel\u2019s words, salacious news articles which are not necessarily grounded in fact, overall I find that this evidence actually supports her case.\n[20] I accept that this is a genuine so-called news article that was actually published in Uganda.\n[21] I agree that it is implausible that the claimant would plant this story herself given the harm that this would subject her and her family to and the fact that it exists is likely evidence of the campaign in Uganda to our and\/or harm her.\n[22] Notwithstanding the few identified credibility issues in this claim, I find that the overwhelming burden of evidence on file which includes letters of support from NGOs and other persons, reliable evidence of her employment and her credentials and so on and so forth, is reliable and corroborates her claim and central allegations.\n[23] On a balance of probabilities I find that the claimant has established that she was an XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and activist in Uganda; that she was threatened and effectively chased out of her community because of her views about and acceptance of LGBT persons; and as a perceived lesbian.\n[24] The available country evidence in the NDP together with the evidence disclosed by the claimant establishes that there is an objective basis for her fear of persecution. I accept counsel\u2019s submission that the claimant has a well-founded fear of persecution on the basis of imputed membership in a particular social group, in addition to on the basis of political opinion.\n[25] According to the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9, individuals may be subjected to persecution by reason of their perceived or imputed SOGIE. Examples may include individuals who do not fit stereotypical appearances or conform to socially accepted SOGIE norms may be perceived as individuals with diverse SOGIE when they are not.\n[26] Those advocating for or reporting on SOGIE rights may be perceived to be individuals of diverse SOGIE and individuals who provide support for individuals of diverse SOGIE, for example, partners who remain with individuals of diverse SOGIE through, for example, gender re-assignment surgeries, may be perceived to be individuals with diverse SOGIE.\n[27] I find that some of these circumstances apply to the claimant.\n[28] Additionally, the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline states that in addition to their status as an individual with diverse SOGIE, political activism by an individual to promote SOGIE rights may put that individual at increased risk of persecution. In other words, persons may also have a well-founded persecution by reason of political opinion when they are promoting SOGIE rights.\n[29] I find that on a balance of probabilities the claimant falls into that category or would be perceived to be.\n[30] In Uganda, same sex sexual activity is criminalized under the Penal Code which prohibits unnatural offenses and acts of gross indecency. Popular support for new laws imposing harsher punishments for persons believed to be homosexual culminated in the anti- homosexuality bill of 2009.\n[31] While the anti-homosexuality bill of 2009 was annulled in 2014, meaning that the promotion of homosexuality is no longer criminalized, Ugandans are no longer seemingly required to report gays and lesbians to authorities, homosexuality remains a criminal offense under Uganda\u2019s Penal Code.\n[32] The United States Department of State report on Uganda identifies violence and discrimination against marginalized people, including LGBT persons as one of the country\u2019s greatest human rights problems. According to the United States Department of State LGBT persons face discrimination, legal restrictions, societal harassment and violence, intimidation and threats. There\u2019 s considerable evidence, as counsel pointed out, that LGBT activists, that is persons who are actively advocating for the rights of LGBT persons \u2013 and I would put the claimant in that category \u2013 also face a serious possibility of persecution.\n[33] The UK Country of Origin report for Uganda on sexual orientation and gender identity, for example, refers to a report by Sexual Minorities Uganda, SMUG, who in their 2018 report stated that health workers still carry out forced anal examinations when the Uganda police forces individuals who have been arrested for homosexuality, sodomy or carnal knowledge against the order of nature to be examined.\n[34] The police were once again the biggest violators of the rights of LGBT persons in Uganda in 2017 according to the same UK Home Office report although there were much fewer violations perpetrated by the police in this year than in any previous years. A high propensity to violate the rights of LGBT persons is easily explained by the fact that the police often interfaces more with LGBT persons, especially when they\u2019ve come into conflict with the law and the limited levels of knowledge and understanding of LGBT person issues among the members of the police force.\n[35] Human Rights Watch noted in its November 2016 submission to the Universal Periodic Review that the government has increasingly sought to curtail the work of NGOs workingon topics considered sensitive to the government such as governance, human rights, land,oil, and the rights of LGBT persons. Tactics include closure of meetings, threats, andheavy-handed bureaucratic interference.\n[36] Additionally, concerns remain that the 2016 NGO law effectively criminalizes legitimate advocacy and the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual transgender people, LGBT persons. An Independent article \u2013 an article in The Independent \u2013 Gay Rights Activists Defy Again the Law by Publishing New LGBTI Magazine, dated January 2015, stated gay rights activists in Uganda have risked detention by police, threats of violence and death threats to publish a new magazine showing the stories of the country\u2019s lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex community.\n[37] There are many other similar references in the NDP.\n[38] With respect to state protection and internal flight alternative, I find the claimant has rebutted the presumption of state protection and that she does not have a viable internal flight alternative. In this case, the state is either the agent of persecution or effectively grants impunity to the non-state agents of persecution.\n[39] The evidence shows that social attitudes towards LGBT persons and activists are more or less uniform across the country. While the claimant is not herself a lesbian, she is perceived to be one in Uganda due to her XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX work with members of her community which, in itself, is rooted in her political opinion about human rights of LGBT persons.\n[40] Over and above this, the objective evidence shows that her works as an LGBT activist, once again rooted in her political opinion, puts her at risk from state and non-state agents.\n[41] Therefore, having considered all of the evidence before me, I determine that there is a serious possibility that the claimant would be persecuted in Uganda on grounds of imputed membership in particular social group and political opinion. Therefore, I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee and I accept her claim.\n\u2014 PROCEEDINGS CONCLUDED\n",

        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2019 RLLR 150\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: May 28, 2019\nPanel: Joshua Prowse\nCounsel for the Claimant(s):\nCountry: Nigeria\nRPD Number: VB8-01902\nAssociated RPD Number(s):\nATIP Number: A-2022-00210\nATIP Pages: 000156-000163\n\u2014 PROCEEDINGS COMMENCED\n[1] PRESIDING MEMBER: This is the decision in the claim for refugee protection made in File VB8-01902. That is the claim of XXXX XXXX XXXX and her two children.\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] The specifics of this case are stated in the narrative of your Basis of Claim form. In short you state that you left Nigeria because of history of domestic violence that you faced as well as risk of female genital mutilation or FGM for the minor Claimant who is part of this proceeding.\n[3] In assessing this case, I considered the following Chairperson\u2019s guidelines. Guideline 3 on child refugee claimants. Guideline 4 on women refugee claimants.\nDETERMINATION\n[4] I find that you are Convention refugees.\nIDENTITY\n[5] Your personal identity and your identities as a citizen of Nigeria are established by your testimony and the supporting documentation filed, principally copies of your passports which are on file at Exhibit 1.\nOBJECTIVE EVIDENCE ABOUT COUNTRY CONDITIONS\n[6] I will start assessing your allegations that you face a serious possibility of persecution in Nigeria by examining the context of the country conditions relevant to your situation. There are a number of documents about female genital mutilation, it\u2019s prevalence in Nigeria and the state response to it. I note the Response to Information Request that is on file entitled Prevalence of female genital mutilation among the Urhobo including consequences for refusing to undergo this procedure, particular pregnant women. State protection available. And that document which makes a number of general comments and reviews evidence about the response to FGM including in Lagos area. And it states that FGM is still deeply entrenched in the Nigerian society. It describes it as widespread and rampant and it notes that according to one source 41 percent of adult women in Nigeria have undergone some form of FGM and that FGM is more prevalent in the southern states of Nigeria.\n[7] A question also arises, and I\u2019ll touch on this a little bit later but partly now, about the extent of the legislation and state response involving FGM. There\u2019s a document on file at 5.32 of the National Documentation Package from the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund, UNICEF entitled Country Profile FGM in Nigeria, October 2016. It\u2019s also from an organization 28 Too Many which is an anti-FGM advocacy organization. And it notes at page 3 of that document that more than 20 million women and girls have been cut or are at risk of being cut and it discusses the nature of the legislation relating to FGM in Nigeria. At page 52 of that document it notes that while there is federal legislation, which is referred to by it\u2019 s acronym the VAPP, V-A-P-P. That is a federal law and therefore it\u2019s only effective in the federal territory of Abuja and that while each individual state in this case, Lagos, where the Claimants\u2019 were last residing have passed legislation. Though the nature of that legislation varies and in some states there isn\u2019t specific legislation related to FGM. In Lagos there is but there are reportedly significant problems with it\u2019s enforcement.\n[8] The US Department of State reports that police often refuse to protect women when \u201cthe level of alleged abuse did not exceed customary norms in the area.\u201d And that generally speaking effective enforcement of such laws has been wanting.\n[9] There\u2019s a second aspect to this claim which involves violence, domestic violence being inflicted upon the Principal Claimant and her son and this something that has been ongoing and has reportedly affected them for a number of years. We have information on file in the National Documentation Package about the prevalence of domestic violence and recourse and options available to those who experience it. For example there\u2019s a Response to Information request entitled Nigeria \u2013 Domestic Violence including Lagos state legislation recourse, state protection and services available to victims. And it discusses the fact that domestic violence as in, perhaps both countries, is quite prevalent but it also discusses a situation in which the state response available for those who experience domestic violence is quite limited. That there are very few services such as shelters available in the country and it describes the situation in which authorities such as the police and the courts are generally unaware of many key laws that are on the books but effectively unenforced.\n[10] Given this evidence, I conclude that there is an objective basis to the allegations before me. The risk that has been described is consistent with information on file about the treatment of others in Nigeria.\nDO YOU FACE A SERIOUS POSSIBILITY OF PERSECUTION?\n[11] A claimant has the burden to induce evidence which shows they face a serious possibility of future persecution. This must be credible and believable evidence. Given my conclusion about the general country conditions, the questions for me to assess in order to determine these Claimants individual risks were first is it credible that they, in particularly the Principal Claimant have been subjected to domestic violence while they have been in Nigeria. And secondly is there a forward looking risk of circumcision for the female minor Claimant and violence attendant to that circumcision for the other Claimants should they refuse to partake in the procedure. And in general when assessing these issues I will say that I found the Claimants to be credible witnesses and I therefore believe what they have alleged in support of their claims.\n[12] In assessing credibility in a refugee claim we start from the presumption that claimants and their allegations are credible. This presumption reflects the fact that claimants are providing sworn testimony and that circumstances facing fleeing refugees can compromise their ability to present corroborative evidence. In assessing whether a claimant\u2019s statements are believable we consider whether the facts presented are detailed, plausible and consistent.\n[13] These criteria are met in this case as the Claimants relayed their testimony convincingly both in writing and orally. And as I\u2019ve stated their allegations are also consistent with information on file about country conditions.\n[14] I asked some specific questions turning first to the allegations about domestic violence. Their testimony was consistent about this. The Principal Claimant\u2019s son testified about what he has observed and what he fears in this respect. There\u2019s corroborating documents on file including from a friend of the Principal Claimant who corroborates the statements about the domestic violence that this family has been subjected to over a significant period of time at the hands of Principal Claimant\u2019s ex-spouse.\n[15] And the Claimants state that they ran away from this ex-spouse about a year before leaving Nigeria and then coming to North America. I asked a number of questions about this. The Claimants continued their schooling over this period. How were they able to afford this sort of schooling? How were they able to afford visa applications? How were they able to afford international travel including to Benin then the United States during this period. And all of the Claimants\u2019 answers on in terms of those types of questions were satisfactory, in my view. The Claimants received financial aid from a comparatively wealthy friend of the Principal Claimant who the Principal Claimant has known since she was a very young girl. This friend took the Principal Claimant and her children in. Supported them and facilitated their exit from the country. The minor Claimants did not need to pay for schooling at this time as they were attending a state school and in fact they switched what school, for instance the male child was in around the time of their move away from the ex-partner\u2019s home and towards Lagos and they are completely consistent between their testimony and the other documents on file in this respect.\n[16] The male Claimant says he last saw his father in 2015 and that the family went to the United States because his dad wanted to circumcise his younger sister. Which takes me to the second question that I considered in terms of the credibility of specific allegations. That\u2019s the risk of circumcision for the minor Claimant in these proceedings. I have the Claimant\u2019s sworn and consistent testimony in this respect that the agent of persecution inflicted and arranged to inflict FGM on another one of the Principal Claimant\u2019s children. That child died from the procedure. I have corroborating documents related to that death. Including a medical report which describes it in detail. And further more this is a claim in which I have a number of corroborating documents related to the ongoing risk to these Claimants and the way that the principal agent of persecution has pursued them and in their absence from Nigeria has pursued the Principal Claimant\u2019s friend who was instrumental in facilitating their exit from the country. I have a medial report at Exhibit 5 regarding injuries that this friend suffered as recently as last month as a result of thugs that the agent of persecution hired to pursue her and attempt to obtain information about the Claimants whereabouts. I have a police report that this individual filed about the fact that she was pursued by these thugs which names the principal agent of persecution in the police report. I have a detailed Basis of Claim amendment which includes corrections and was updated to reflect recent circumstances and I also have a number of statements on file including an affidavit from the Principal Claimant\u2019s friend, XXXX (ph.). And I have bank statements, psychotherapist\u2019s letter and a sworn declaration.\n[17] In sum I accept that these Claimants face a violence at the hands of the Principal Claimant\u2019s ex-partner who is seeking to inflict FGM on the minor Claimant and who has generally been abusive towards both the Principal Claimant and the children of their relationship and is not content to see these individuals move on from the relationship. Given the past persecution, the persecution of those similarly situated to them, I conclude that there is a serious possibility of these Claimants being persecuted should they return to Nigeria.\nDOES THE HARM THAT YOU FACE UPON TO NIGERIA AMOUNT TO PERSECUTION?\n[18] The harm that a refugee fears must be persecution. And our refugee law, persecution can be considered the sustained or systemic violation of basic human rights. The circumstances that you face implicate in a sustained or systemic manner a number of such rights. This includes the right to life which is illustrated by the fact that one of the Principal Claimant\u2019s children already died when FGM was inflicted upon her. This is protected in Article 6 of the Internal Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which provides that every human being has the inherent right to life. This is also relates the freedom from domestic violence and gender based violence is a form of discrimination that seriously inhibits women\u2019s ability to enjoy rights and freedoms on a basis of equality with men. And this is discrimination within the meaning of the Convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women.\n[19] A situation involving such rights violations will be persecutory if it has substantially prejudicial effects for persons concerned. And it\u2019s clear that that is the case here. The Claimants write eloquently in their narrative at paragraph 48 in that \u201cI am afraid to return to Nigeria because I know my partner and his family are still looking for me and may children. I know that if XXXX (ph.) found us he would harm or mistreat us and force my daughter to be circumcised. For these reasons I seek protection in Canada.\n[20] Given these statements that the Claimants fear returning to Nigeria and their description of the harm that they have experienced and have anticipated upon return, I find that they subjectively fear returning to Nigeria and I conclude that the harm that they fear about is persecution.\n[21] When reaching this conclusion I did consider the fact that they spent some time in the United States prior to claiming in Canada. In fact they spent a significant amount of time there and ultimately stayed beyond the expiry of and validity period for their US visa. I don\u2019t find that I should draw a negative inference about the credibility of the Claimants\u2019 subjective fears of persecution in Nigeria, at that point, for several reasons. First two of the Claimants are quite young at that time. A minor Claimant and another who just reached the age of majority of that period and then for the Principal Claimant she\u2019s quite a vulnerable individual. She does \u2014 she\u2019s functionally illiterate, has no history of schooling in Nigeria. Was dependant upon others for advice and was deterred from claiming apparently for financial reasons. I find that in the circumstances the Claimants have amply and reasonably explained their failure to claim refugee protection in United States at the time that they did.\nARE YOUR FEARS BY REASON OF ONE OR MORE OF THE GROUNDS IN THE REFUGEE CONVENTION?\n[22] In order to qualify for refugee status under the Refugee Convention, an individual must demonstrate that they have a well-founded fear of persecution \u201cfor reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion.\u201d\n[23] I conclude that this requirement is met in your cases as your fears of persecution in Nigeria relate to the Convention grounds first of particular social group related to the particular social group of women. And second for the male Claimant the particular social group of the family. It\u2019s clear that the domestic violence that the Principal Claimant has experienced and the female genital mutilation that the minor Claimant stands to experience, is something that is disproportionally inflicted upon women and also it is something where the state response is disproportionally anemic because of the gender of the victims of those practices.\nSTATE PROTECTION\n[24] The refugee definition specifically requires that each refugee establish that they are \u201cunable or by reason of their fear, unwilling to unveil themselves of the protection of their country.\u201d It is the duty of all states to offer protection to their nationals. Refugee protection only becomes available when a claimant\u2019s country of nationality fails in the performance of this duty. These Claimant\u2019s have evidence which demonstrates that this requirement is met in their cases as they are unable to avail themselves of the protection of their country.\n[25] And I have a number of documents about this. But with respect to the enforcement of anti- FGM legislation in Nigeria the Response to Information that I quoted earlier on the prevalence of female genital mutilation among the Urhobo states that \u2014 has a bunch of more general statements about FGM, starting at page 6 of that report. It states that no cases of legal prosecution of people who have been subjected to girls or women to FGM have been documented in Nigeria. And that even in Nigerian states that have legal provisions in place to prosecute the perpetrators of FGM either under general or specific criminal laws, prosecutions are very rare.\n[26] Counsel provided a summary of some of the country conditions with respect to state protection in his submissions. He noted that the UK Home Office report at 1.7 of the National Documentation Package indicates that the effectiveness of state protection is undermine by a lack of resources, by corruption and that women face pervasive discrimination in attempting to access such state protection and that the bribery rate for police among those who wish to access police protection is nearly 50 percent. And I find that this is particular relevant given that fact that this agent of persecution is connected to politicians in the country.\n[27] In short there is clear and convincing evidence before me that Nigeria will not afford these Claimants the protection we expect of a state and that they are consequently unable to obtain adequate protection from their country.\nINTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE\n[28] When considering whether you have an internal flight alternative we ask whether there is a part of your country in which you would not face a serious possibility of persecution and whether it would be reasonable to expect you to move there. I conclude that you do not possess a viable internal flight alternatives in your country.\n[29] This is for several reasons. In terms of the Principal Claimant, in my view, there are evident issues related to the reasonableness of any internal flight alternative. She is illiterate, uneducated, single women with children without any work experience outside of the home. However this is tempered by the fact that she would be relocated with her adult child who is in his early XXXX XXXX male child with above average education in Nigeria and in my view the analysis of the reasonableness of any relocation would be complicated by that fact. However it\u2019 s not necessary for me to consider the reasonableness of relocation in this case because I find the viability of an internal flight alternative fails on the first prong of the analysis. The internal flight alternative location identified in this case, Port Harcourt, is one where there would remain a serious possibility of persecution for these Claimants by reason of the fact that the agent of persecution would be able to track them down and locate them in Port Harcourt through the Claimant\u2019s friend who resides in Lagos.\n[30] The Federal Court jurisprudence is clear that this Board cannot expect an individual to have to make a secret return to their country or a return where they are excluded from their support groups, from their friends, for their family members. Counsel directed me to the case of Ohakam 2011 FC1351 and I find that the principal coming out of that case is directly applicable to the circumstances before me. The Principal Claimant\u2019s best friend, one who she is in frequent contact with, is located in Lagos while this friend has not divulged information about the Claimants\u2019 whereabouts to date, it cannot be expected that this friend would be able to refrain from doing so indefinitely. Especially in light of the evidence before me that the agent of persecution has engaged in an ongoing campaign of harassment, threats and the hiring of thugs to intimidate her in order to obtain such information. As these Claimants would not be able to escape a serious possibility of mistreatment by internal relocation, I conclude that they do not possess a viable internal flight alternative in Nigeria.\nCONCLUSION\n[31] In conclusion I find that the Claimants are Convention refugees and I accept their claims. That concludes today\u2019s hearing. We are now off the record.\n\u2014PROCEEDINGS CONCLUDED\n",

        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2019 RLLR 149\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: December 2, 2019\nPanel: Shamshuddin Alidina\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Pawandeep Johal\nCountry: Romania\nRPD Number: TB9-10780\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2022-00210\nATIP Pages: 000127-000132\nDECISION\nMEMBER: You asked me to address you as, Sir.\nI have all the evidence that I need to make a decision and I have a decision for you and if you need the decision in writing, you can ask the Refugee Board to give it to you.\nIf you elect to do that, I reserve the rights to make grammar error corrections, syntax error corrections and to incorporate documentary evidence and case laws where deemed necessary.\nSo, I\u2019m going to address the name that is given in the file. Okay?\nCLAIMANT: Of course. I understand. For legal purposes. Yes.\nMEMBER: Yeah.\n[1] XXXX XXXX, a citizen of Romania, claims for refugee protection pursuant to Sections 96, 97(1)(a) and 97(1)(b) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, IRPA.\n[2] The claimant alleges that, at the time he left Romania, he was not sure of his sexual orientation. He knew that he was not a female.\n[3] After he came to Canada for education, he married a female called, XXXX XXXX. Both of them travelled as a couple to Romania and while in Romania for one week, they had difficulties. They were discriminated against and ill-treated, particularly when the claimant went to use washrooms and other\npublic places.\n[4] His family also looked at him differently and he had difficulties with his family too, that being the fact that he was not being accepted as what he was.\n[5] The claimant alleges that should he return today to Romania and be what he is, he would be persecuted. He would be discriminated in every walk of life. His identity would not be accepted. He would not be accepted in the employment fields, housing, healthcare and even the Counsel says he could not work with the kids because his identity is different.\n[6] Should he seek help from the police, they would not take him seriously.\n[7] He decided to seek for refugee protection because he felt that, should he return to Romania, he would be persecuted.\n[8] Basically, this is a sur place claim which is the realization of the danger of being what he is, after leaving Romania.\n[9] At the outset of the hearing, the claimant indicated that his identity is not being a female. He would love to change his name to XXXX as a first name and XXXX to be the second name and the last name to remain, XXXX XXXX because XXXX is neither a male name nor a female name. It can be used both, both ways.\n[10] The claimant indicated that should he do that, he would not recognized in Romania. He would not be able to change that name with the Romanian authorities.\n[11] He also testified that, should he do that, he would not be able to even change his documents.\n[12] His same-sex marriage with XXXX would not be recognized. Although, today he is separated from her but he is in a relationship with another female.\n[13] The claimant provided documentary evidence in Exhibit 6 which gives his true identity in so far as his sexuality is concerned. The claimant, for the sake of the testimony today in the hearing, said that he could be addressed as a \u201che\u201d and a transgender. He says, in reality, he was a non-binary. In that, he says, he is neither a female nor a male.\n[14] He testified that should he return \u2013 should he stay in Canada and be allowed to stay in Canada, he would have his breasts removed while he would remain the other female parts and that would be his identity.\n[15] He testified that he would not be able to do that in Romania. They would remove all the parts of the female and make him a male or leave all the parts of the female and let him be a female. He is not comfortable with that identity of being a total male or a total female.\n[16] Therefore, in Exhibit 6, the Counsel has provided us documentary evidence of the definitions of a non-binary person.\n[17] The claimant testified that he had no reason to seek any protection in Canada when he arrived, since he came, simply for education. Education took a little bit longer but then his sexuality was still not known to him. He was in a state of confusion and he got married to a female.\n[18] He then decided to go to Romania because his father was not well and while he was in Romania, he testified that his family began not accepting him as a binary. The society in general was not accepting him. He went to use a male washroom and he had difficulties.\n[19] He returned to Canada and applied for refugee protection knowing that he could not live in Romania.\n[20] Therefore, based on the evidence that is adduced, the panel finds that the claimant is neither a female nor a male. The claimant is a non-binary and the question remains what would happen to people like him who would perhaps be called a transgender if he returned to Romania. That\u2019s the closest thing that they would do.\n[21] The objective evidence is very important in this case because it\u2019s a sur place claim so the panel examined the documentary evidence.\n[22] In so far as the claimant\u2019s testimony is concerned, the claimant indicated that should he return to Romania, his gender identity would not be accepted. That\u2019s the first thing. His name changed to XXXX and XXXX, as a second name, would not be acceptable to the authorities.\n[23] He testified that he would have serious problems looking for a job because his identity would not be accepted. He would have problems seeking healthcare in Romania. He would have difficulties obtaining housing for rent.\n[24] His family has stopped accepting him as what he is.\n[25] The panel in determining objective evidence went through a number of documentations that are very clear. The DOS Report indicates that the law in Romania prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation. In this case, the claimant has a sexual orientation which is not mentioned anywhere.\n[26] The NGOs reported that societal discrimination against LGBT persons was common and there were some reports of violence against them. The claimant did face violence while he was there.\n[27] Discrimination in employment occurred against the LGBT people.\n[28] Although this year, the Pride parade with some 5,000 participants was without an incident in Bucharest, there were a hundred people who took part in a counter-protest.\n[29] The law governing legal gender recognition for transgender persons was vague and incomplete. In some cases, authorities refused legal gender recognition unless an individual had first undergone sex re-assignment surgery.\n[30] Access to adequate XXXX services was also limited because some XXXX refuse to accept transgender patients. In this case, the claimant is neither a male nor a female nor a transgender. He is a non-binary and there is absolutely no mention about the term non-binary in any of the documentary evidence that we have before us, either from the NDP or from the claimant\u2019 s counsel.\n[31] However, the panel will cite some documents because Counsel has provided a number of documents which indicates what happens to people like the claimant in Romania. This is the news, the latest one, page 109 of Exhibit 4 and that indicates the Romania has passed no legislation recognizing or promoting gay rights since the Balkan country joined the EU 12 years ago and since it decriminalized same-sex relationships 18 years ago. As a result, gay couples and transgender people still face huge problems as they try to go about with their lives.\n[32] Documentary evidence indicates in regards to Romanian LGBT millennials on page 112, in Romania \u2013 sorry, in a new report on Romania, the Counsel for Europe\u2019s Commission Against Racism, Intolerance, expressed concern about a number of issues, notably the widespread problem of racist and intolerant hate speeches and inadequate responses of the criminal justice to hate crimes and discriminations against Roma and LGBT persons, although it notes that some progress has been made.\n[33] Documentary evidence on page 115 indicates that, temporary passports were issued to Adrian Common(sp)[1] , after he was denied new passports. He was issued a temporary passport instead.\n[34] Documentary evidence of April 2017 indicates, for many transgender people in Europe something as simple as changing their names or gender on a driver\u2019s licence requires an invasive and offensive medical procedure. Of the 47 countries currently signed up to the European Convention on Human Rights, 22 countries require transgender people to undergo sterilization before allowing them to change their names or gender on a legal document.\n[35] The claimant indicated he would have to do that because he is not who everybody thinks he is.\n[36] Page 19 of Counsel\u2019s objective document says, that 6 in 1 0 Romanians would not want to have a gay family member and 29% would not want a Roma relative. This is according to the survey.\n[37] As such 74% of those surveyed said, they don\u2019t trust homosexuals and 72% said they don\u2019t trust Roma immigrants.\n[38] The survey revealed a high intolerance towards homosexuals.\n[39] The next page, 21, indicates that more than 2\/3 of the respondents don\u2019t agree with gay marriages and 60% disagree with the idea of civil partnerships.\n[40] The present cases, this is page 41, the present cases concern two trans men who claim that their right to privacy and right to found a family have been violated. The legal framework on legal gender recognition in Romania remains uncertain subjecting trans people to [2:11:56] judicial procedures and pathologizing and invasive medical requirements when they request for recognition of their gender identity. The claimant indicate that he would have to change either totally to male or totally to female.\n[41] Documentary evidence on page 46 clearly indicates that the article which argues that Christians are suffering religious discrimination at the hands of the pro-LGBT campaigners comes as the country prepares for a referendum next month which could prevent same-sex marriage by changing the Constitution to define marriage as being between a man and a woman. That\u2019s exactly what the claimant indicated.\n[42] On page 69 the documentary evidence gives the clear picture of Romania is today. Romania is regarded as one of Europe\u2019s most homophobic countries. Same-sex sexual activity is legal but there is no legal recognition of same-sex couples. The church holds a huge influence over the population. Approximately 85% of the 19 million population belong to Romanian Orthodox Church.\n[43] Anti-gay campaigns led by Coalition for Family gained 3 million signatures in the country in 2016 urging for the government to act to amend the Constitution.\n[44] On page 74, the 19th March 2019 article indicates that the Senate rejected by a majority on March 8th two bills that would have allowed same-sex individuals to close a civil partnership and enjoy rights similar to those of married couples.\n[45] That is, in a nutshell, the objective evidence of what the society in Romania is.\n[46] Based on the documentary evidence, the panel finds that the claimant would not be able to change his name. The claimant would not be able to have his parts like, the breasts removed and the rest of the female parts kept and should he return and continue, which he says he would, to be a non-binary, he would be targeted. He would be discriminated in employment, in housing, by his family and he would not have protection, as well as, he would not be able to change his name to XXXX XXXX.\n[47] All that cumulatively amounts to persecution.\n[48] The panel finds that the claimant \u2013 the panel finds that there is serious possibility that the claimant would be persecuted as a non-binary, should he return to Romania.\n[49] For all above reasons, XXXX XXXX, is a Convention refugee.\n(Signed by) Shams Alidina\nI wish to thank you, Sir, for coming.\nI wish to thank the two Counsels.\nThe hearing is over.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n\n",

I have considered all of the evidence and I am ready to render my decision orally.\n[2] You are claiming to be a citizen of Lebanon and are claiming refugee protection pursuant to Sections 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] You alleged that you cannot return to Lebanon because of your fear of persecution due to your gender identity as a transgender person and you fear persecution from your family and society at large.\n[4] During the hearing and in making my decision I have considered and applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline number 9 regarding claimants with diverse sexual orientation and gender identity and expression.\nDETERMINATION\n[5] For the following reasons, I find that you are a \u201cConvention refugee\u201d.\nIDENTITY\n[6] I find on a balance of probabilities you have established your personal identity and your identity as a citizen of Lebanon through your documentary evidence, in particular your Lebanese passport as well as through your credible testimony.\nNEXUS\n[7] I find that you have a nexus to the Convention as a member of a particular social group, specifically as a person fearing persecution due to your gender identity.\nCREDIBILITY\n[8] You testified in a spontaneous and forthcoming manner with no omissions, contradictions or inconsistencies and I therefore accept as true what you have told me here today and what you have written in your Basis of Claim.\n[9] You provided detailed testimony about first realizing that you were a transgender in Lebanon preferring to wear women\u2019s clothing in secret at an early age, about a time when your uncle assaulted you for wearing earrings, about seeking the assistance of an LGBTQ group in Beirut in Lebanon.\n[10] You told me about how you got there and how they weren\u2019t ultimately able to help you, about a relationship that you had with a man in Lebanon. You provided details about how that relationship began and what you liked about him and about convincing your parents to come and let you study here in Canada. And you also told me about your experiences here in Canada, about how seeing gay and transgender people out in the world started to make you feel more comfortable about exploring your own gender identity, about your relationship with a man named XXXX and how he also encouraged you to push and explore your boundary. And you corroborated this evidence with a number of text messages and pictures of XXXX.\n[11] Based on your credible testimony, I find that you have a subjective fear of returning to Lebanon.\nOBJECTIVE BASIS\n[12] The country condition documents are clear that LGBTQ individuals who are open about their identity face widespread discrimination and violence in Lebanon.\n[13] The United States Department of State Report at 2.11 of the National Documentation Package notes that there is official and societal discrimination against LGBTI persons and that there is no (inaudible) anti-discrimination law to protect LGBTI persons. And the same document notes that most reports of abuse came from transgender women and it also notes that a project from the Arab Foundation for Freedom and Equality highlighted employment discrimination faced by transgender women.\n[14] Item 6.2 of the National Documentation Package notes that article 534 of the Lebanese Code is still in force which makes illegal \u201cunnatural sexual intercourse\u201d carrying a sentence of up to a year in prison. And the same document notes that although some judges had held that this law cannot be used to convict LGBTQ individuals, arrests under the law have continued and actually increased from 2016 to 2017 and that this ambiguity creates a scope of violence against LGBTQ individuals. The same document reports the terrible treatment that LGBTQ individuals face by police, including physical violence, mandatory HIV testing carried out in an unsafe manner and psychological torment.\n[15] Item 2.2 of the National Documentation Package notes that security forces continue to arrest people and press charges under this law and similarly item 2.8 of the National Documentation Package notes that in 2017 a transgendered woman in Lebanon was detained due to her sexual identity.\n[16] Item 6.3 of the NDP notes that when asked whether people could identify not strictly as either a man or a woman, 72 per cent of Lebanese people surveyed disagreed and that the idea that there was only two sexes had 97.5 percent agreement.\n[17] Item 9.4 of the National Documentation Package notes that LGBTQ people often faced recurrent humiliating treatments and verbal and psychological violence and abuse from the police and also reported being harassed. And this also includes a reference of a transgender person who was treated very terribly by the police and in another case an individual was deprived access of medicine for nine months.\n[18] And lastly, I note that there is some positive evidence of life for LGBTQ people specifically in Beirut and Lebanon. Item 6.4 of the NDP notes that there is an underground LGBTQ life in Beirut, but the same document describes police abuse of LGBTQ individuals, police raids on LGBT establishments and that LGBTQ individuals are not able to live openly in Beirut without facing severe harassment and discrimination.\nBY CLAIMANT\n[19] I can help you with that. There is maybe one road. I think we can live there, but you cannot from the society. It\u2019s called the \u201chamara (phonetic)\u201d.\nBY THE MEMBER\n[20] And similarly, item 2.8 of the National Documentation Package notes that while the first Pride Parade in Beirut happened in 2017, numerous events were either cancelled or downsized due to threats of violence and protests. And similarly, item 2.5 of the National Documentation Package it says LGBTQ individuals face a moderate risk of societal and official discrimination and that in Beirut an individual would be able to lead a relatively open life, but would need to keep a low profile and would be at risk of societal and family ostracism.\n[21] I find that the term of \u201crelatively open life\u201d understates the significant risks described earlier in the report that individuals with whatever sexual orientation and gender identity face and that the documentary evidence is clear that individuals who live openly face extreme persecution and discrimination including in Beirut.\n[22] And based on this documentary evidence, I find there is an objective basis for your fear of returning to Lebanon.\nSTATE PROTECTION\n[23] As discussed in the documents discussed above, the police often do not protect LGBTQ individuals and are in fact frequently agents of persecution towards LGBTQ individuals and particularly transgender individuals and I therefore find that adequate State protection would not be available to you if you were to return to Lebanon.\nINTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE\n[24] The documentary evidence discussed above states that even in Beirut where there is something of an underground LGBTQ community, individuals are notable to live openly without facing severe discrimination by society and the police and that anti-LGBTQ sentiments are prevalent throughout the entire country. And I therefore find on a balance of probabilities that you would face a serious possibility of persecution throughout Lebanon and therefore do not have an internal flight alternative available to you.\nCONCLUSION\n[25] I find that you face a serious possibility of persecution as a result of your gender identity and therefore find that you are a \u201cConvention refugee\u201d. Your claim is therefore accepted.\n",

Ross\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Howard Gilbert\nCountry: Czech Republic\nRPD Number: TB6-04818\nATIP Number: A-2021-00655\nATIP Pages: 000040-000051\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] [XXX], the principal claimant, [XXX] and [XXX] (a.k.a. [XXX]) claim protection in Canada pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA)1.\n[2] In accordance with Rule 55 of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) Rules the claims were heard jointly,2 with the principal claimant being designated the representative for the three minor claimants.3\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] The claimants rely on the allegations set out in the narrative portion of the principal claimant\u2019s Basis of Claim Form (BOC)4. Briefly, the claimants allege a well-founded fear of persecution in the Czech Republic due to their Roma ethnicity. They claim to be afraid of the ethnic Czech population, racist elements in Czech society, namely, skinheads and the police. The claimants also state that they do not have a reasonable expectation of state protection, as whenever they have made attempts to obtain state protection, the police did not respond to their attempts.\nDETERMINATION\n[4] For the following reasons, the panel finds that the claimants are Convention refugees.\nISSUES\n[5] The determinative issue in the claim is credibility. At issue also is the claimants\u2019 delay in claiming protection, and their failure to claim protection in the United States (US).\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[6] The panel finds that the claimants\u2019 identities as nationals of the Czech Republic are established by the copies of their passports, found in Exhibit 1.5\n[7] The panel also finds that the claimants\u2019 ethnic profiles as Roma persons is satisfactorily established on the basis of the principal claimant\u2019s testimony, the attestation from the Roma Community Centre,6 and also by the fact that during the hearing, interpretation services were provided using the Romungro dialect of the Roma language.\nCredibility\n[8] In assessing the credibility of the claimants\u2019 allegations of discrimination, the panel noted that there were several issues relevant to the assessment, namely the principal claimant\u2019s failure to claim protection in US, his re-availment of the protection of the Czech Republic, and his delay in claiming protection once the claimants arrived in Canada. The panel considered each of these issues in turn.\nDelay in claiming\n[9] The claimants arrived in Canada on [XXX] 2016, and made claims for protection on or about [XXX] 2016.7 A witness, [XXX], was called to explain the delay in claiming.8 She provided a number of reasons for the delay, including that she had to meet with the claimants several times before the forms were completed. The panel considered her evidence, as well as the length of the delay in assessing the impact of the delay on the claimants\u2019 credibility. The delay is was six weeks. The panel concluded that when the totality of the circumstances is considered, a six-week delay is not so lengthy as to seriously impugn the credibility of the claimants.\nFailure to claim elsewhere\/re-availment\n[10] The principal claimant travelled to the US in 2012, but did not make a claim for asylum. He testified that having travelled to the US on a temporary work programme, and being alone in the US, he only wanted to return to his family. He explained that had he claimed asylum in the US, he likely would have been separated from them for a long time, something that he did not want to do.\n[11] Counsel submitted that the principal claimant had provided a reasonable explanation for his failure to claim asylum in the US, and why he returned to the Czech Republic. On considering the principal claimant\u2019s explanation, the panel concluded that the explanation was credible, in the circumstances of the family being a young family. Accordingly, the panel finds that the credibility of the principal claimant was not undermined by the fact that he did not claim protection in the US and returned to the Czech Republic.\nDid the claimants experience discrimination?\n[12] In their BOC, the claimants alleged a well-founded fear of persecution in the Czech Republic due to their Roma ethnicity.9 In their amended narrative, they detailed their living circumstances which they described as poor and crowded.10 The settlement in which they lived was primitive, its roads were unpaved, there was no running water, garbage pickup was sporadic. In addition, the settlement was not serviced by public transportation. The claimant alleged that conditions in similar Czech communities was radically different from those in the Roma settlement. The principal claimant testified that he made several attempts to find alternate housing through government agencies, but was turned down at each attempt.\n[13] The principal claimant testified as to the difficulties he and the other claimants encountered in public places and in obtaining publicly-available services. His cited incidents where he and his family were refused service in restaurants, followed in stores, as well as being attacked and beaten on public transit. Although the claimants turned to the police for assistance, the police did not act on their reports.\n[14] In response to the panel, the principal claimant described the following incidents of discrimination:\na) being refused employment that had been promised to him through agent;\nb) being refused public housing although such housing was available;\nc) being constantly humiliated in public spaces, particularly in shops where the family was followed; and\nd) the family was refused service in restaurants.\n[15] The principal claimant alleged that the family\u2019s Roma ethnicity was the sole reason for the discriminatory treatment meted out to him and the associate claimants.\n[16] In the instant case, the discriminatory acts include being refused employment some 30-40 times. The principal claimant alleged he had been unemployed since 1998.11 He testified that he made some 30-40 unsuccessful attempts to finds work. As he did not speak the Czech language well, a Czech speaking friend would call the prospective employer on his behalf. Assured that there was work to be had, the principal claimant would then report to the workplace. Invariably, he would then be told that there was no work. The principal claimant cites this situation as an example of anti-Roma racism. The panel is not entirely persuaded of his position, because it can be argued that the employer never agreed to hire the principal claimant. He was intending to hire the Czech speaking person to whom he spoke. Put simply, the principal claimant was not the person the employers were expecting. In the result, the panel is not persuaded that the principal claimant\u2019s ethnicity was the only deciding factor at play.\n[17] With respect to their treatment in the public sphere, the panel finds that following the claimants while they shopped and refusing entry into restaurants, without justification, are clearly discriminatory acts.\n[18] The principal claimant also described the following incidents:\n\u2022 in the summer of 2015, an ice cream parlour refused to serve his wife and son;\n\u2022 that same summer, the principal claimant\u2019s mother and son were ejected from coffee shop;\n\u2022 substandard medical care \u2013 Roma forced to wait or pay for services that should be free;\n\u2022 intimidation by skinheads \u2013 in [XXX] 2013 about 80 skinheads marched through their community, screaming insults and beating Roma. The police took no action when complaints were made, although the complainants were able to describe their attackers; and\n\u2022 in [XXX] 2014, the principal claimant and his spouse were attacked in a similar fashion. They went to a hospital and after a three to four hour wait, they were told that the doctor was too busy to see them. They went to the police station where they made a complaint. When they followed up two weeks later, the police informed them that the case was closed due to a lack of information.\n[19] The panel finds that these actions are all clearly discriminatory in nature. In fact, the [XXX] 2013 incident is clearly of a criminal nature.\nThe documentary evidence\n[20] The Board\u2019s documentary evidence stated that racial discrimination is widespread in the Czech Republic. The Report of the Czech Ombudsman Office cites the following statistic:\nRacial or ethnicity-based discrimination is perceived as the most frequent type of discrimination in the Czech Republic. Almost two thirds of respondents believe it is widespread, one fifth even believes it is extremely widespread.12\n[21] With respect to the perception of how readily redress for discrimination is available, report goes on to note that:\n[t]he respondents are very sceptical in rating the chances of the victims to assert their rights. Only 15 % believe that it is easy to get help for the victims of discrimination; and only 2 % of the respondents find the redress very easy. On the other hand, three quarters of the respondents think that it is difficult to invoke their rights, and more than one quarter consider it to be very difficult.13\n[22] The US Department of State (DOS) Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2018 in the Czech Republic, identifies \u201ccrimes involving violence or threats of violence\u201d against members of the Roma population as among the human rights issues prevalent in that country.14 Amnesty International makes specific reference to the ruling of the police in the death of a Roma man who died while being restrained by municipal officers and employees of a pizzeria as a result of his allegedly aggressive behaviour.15 The police discontinued their investigation finding that no crime had been committed.\n[23] In its latest report, the US DOS states the following regarding the treatment of Roma persons:\nNational\/Racial\/Ethnic Minorities\nThere were approximately 300,000 Roma in the country, and many faced varying levels of discrimination in education, employment, and housing and have high levels of poverty, unemployment, and illiteracy.\nHate crimes against Roma continued to be a problem\u2026 Observers reported hate crimes are not sufficiently recognized by police, prosecutors, and judges, who often lacked will or adequate knowledge.\n[\u2026 ]\nDespite legislative measures aimed at desegregation of Roma in education, according to a Ministry of Education study, more than 29 percent of students in special schools were Roma, compared with 3.6 percent in regular elementary schools. After the introduction in 2017 of a free compulsory year of preprimary education at the age of five to six years old, the enrollment of Romani children in kindergartens increased slightly but remained markedly below the levels for non\u00ad Romani peers. To support desegregation of Roma in schools, the government increased funding to provide additional support to students with special needs in mainstream schools.\nApproximately one-third of Roma lived in \u201cexcluded localities\u201d or ghettos. While the law prohibits housing discrimination based on ethnicity, NGOs stated that some municipalities discriminated against certain socially disadvantaged groups, primarily Roma, basing their decisions not to provide housing on the allegedly bad reputation of Romani applicants from previous residences.\nThe 2017 amendment to the law on persons with material need, which was intended to solve housing problems, in some cases had the opposite effect. The amendment allowed cities to declare certain areas as having an \u201cincreased occurrence of socially undesirable activity\u201d. In such designated zones the government paid only a part of housing subsidies. Some cities started to use this instrument to get rid of Roma and other low-income citizens.\nIn September the European Roma Rights Center criticized President Zeman for his negative statements on Roma and in an open letter called for his resignation.\nZeman had stated that the unemployed persons in one of the country\u2019s villages he visited were exactly the Roma who were forced to work during communism under the threat of imprisonment.\nRoma were the most frequent targets of hate speech on internet.\nIn September the district court in Tachov fined a woman 20,000 koruna ($800) for posting threatening comments on the internet under a school photo of first graders from a local school. The children were mainly Romani, Arab, and Vietnamese, and the comments suggested sending them to gas chambers, shooting them, or throwing a hand grenade into the classroom. Police did not originally qualify the incident as a hate speech offense, but the supreme prosecutor requested a further investigation that led to the conviction.16\n[24] The panel takes the documentary evidence to indicate that, in the Czech Republic, there is widespread discrimination against Roma persons. The panel finds that the claimants have clearly experienced discrimination.\nDiscrimination as opposed to persecution\n[25] The issue for this panel is whether the discrimination these claimants experienced in the Czech Republic has risen to the level of persecution such as to bring them within the Convention refugee definition. Counsel for the claimant took the position that it has. He described the situation for Roma in the Czech Republic as being dire. He argues that the discrimination that Roma, in general, and the claimants in particular, experience in the Czech Republic has risen to the level of persecution.\n[26] The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Handbook and Guidelines discusses the issue of discrimination, noting the following:\n54. Differences in the treatment of various groups do indeed exist to a greater or lesser extent in many societies. Persons who receive less favourable treatment as a result of such differences are not necessarily victims of persecution. It is only in certain circumstances that discrimination will amount to persecution. This would be so if measures of discrimination lead to consequences of a substantially prejudicial nature for the person concerned, e.g. serious restrictions on his right to earn his livelihood, his right to practise his religion, or his access to normally available educational facilities.\n55. Where measures of discrimination are, in themselves, not of a serious character, they may nevertheless give rise to a reasonable fear of persecution if they produce, in the mind of the person concerned, a feeling of apprehension and insecurity as regards his future existence. Whether or not such measures of discrimination in themselves amount to persecution must be determined in the light of all the circumstances. A claim to fear of persecution will of course be stronger where a person has been the victim of a number of discriminatory measures of this type and where there is thus a cumulative element involved.17\n[27] The UNHCR document provides guidance in the determination of whether the experiences of a claimant have, cumulatively, risen to the level of persecution. The Federal Court in Liang, citing paragraphs 54 and 55 of the UNHCR Handbook, affirmed that in the exercise of determining whether cumulative discrimination and harassment constitutes persecution, it is necessary to \u201cevaluate the claimant\u2019s personal circumstances and vulnerabilities including age, health, and finances \u2026 \u201c18\n[28] The principal claimant\u2019s personal circumstances include a low level of education, limited employment prospects, and limited finances. Balanced against these are the facts that he is relatively young ([XXX]), and in good health. This is also true of the female claimant.\n[29] The claimants allege, and their counsel submits, that the measures of discrimination they faced in the Czech Republic has led to consequences of a substantially prejudicial nature for them, namely serious restrictions on their access to normally available educational facilities and their right to earn their livelihoods. In addition, counsel submits that, as Lovari, the claimants are made particularly vulnerable to discrimination. While conceding that many Roma are well integrated into Czech society, counsel described the [XXX] as being among the most excluded group of Roma in the Czech Republic. He stated that they, along with the [XXX], tended to live in isolated communities and were susceptible to the types of discriminatory practices the documentary evidence speaks to.\n[30] In its report, Freedom House, estimated that the size of the Roma population in the Czech Republic was about 250,000 persons.19 Freedom House stated that Roma face \u201coccasional threats and violence from right-wing groups.\u201d20.\n[31] The panel finds the two reports to be reliable, as the information they contain originates from sources that have an awareness of the situation of Roma in the Czech Republic. The sources cite information from NGOs and appear to be unbiased. Moreover, while the two reports are distinct, they contain and confirm substantially similar information. The panel gives significant weight to this objective information.\n[32] Nonetheless, in assessing whether the discrimination the claimants experienced has risen to the level of persecution, the panel is mindful of the dicta of the Federal Court in Liang, regarding the necessity of evaluating a claimant\u2019s personal circumstances and vulnerabilities including age, health, and finances when determining whether cumulative discrimination and harassment constitutes persecution.21\n[33] The principal claimant\u2019s personal circumstances are that:\n\u2022 he is from one of the groups of Roma that are not integrated into Czech society;\n\u2022 he lacks much formal education, does not speak the Czech language well, and has considerable difficulty finding employment;\n\u2022 he is relatively young, with a growing family; and\n\u2022 he and his family members have personally suffered a number of racist incidents, including witnessing an intimidatory march of skinheads through their community and an attack by skinheads in [XXX] 2014.\n[34] In considering whether the incidents of discrimination amount, on a cumulative basis, to persecution, the panel is not persuaded that being refused service at an ice-cream parlour or being asked to leave a caf\u00e9 amounts to persecution. Unpleasant yes, embarrassing, yes, but these appear to have been isolated incidents for which there may or may not be other explanations, which were not disclosed to the panel.\n[35] The march through the claimant\u2019s community was patently intended to frighten and intimidate all of the Roma in the community. The DOS Report indicates that:\nHuman rights issues included crimes involving violence or threats of violence against members of the Romani minority.\nThe government took steps to prosecute and punish officials who committed abuses in the security services and elsewhere in the government.22\n[36] In the panel\u2019s view, this speaks to the willingness of Czech authorities to investigate and prosecute offences against the Roma and other minorities, which is at odds with the claimants\u2019 position that state protection will not be available to them.\n[37] The result is that it is not clear to the panel that the incidents of discrimination the claimants complain of rise to the level of persecution. At the same time, the panel is also mindful of the statements in paragraph 55 of the UNHCR Handbook relating to cumulative discrimination. In particular, the effect of the measures of discrimination on the mind of the claimants. In testimony, the principal claimant discussed the effect the various incidents have had on him. The panel found him to be largely credible, as he answered all questions put to him without seeming exaggeration or subterfuge. He expressed his apprehension of returning to the Czech Republic, and the certain discrimination he and his family would face. The panel is not an expert in [XXX] issues. However, it finds that, in all the circumstances of the case, including the principal claimant\u2019s personal circumstances, the cumulative effect of the discriminatory incidents was that they have created a feeling of apprehension and insecurity in the mind of the principal claimant, as regards his future existence and that of his family if returned to the Czech Republic. The panel finds that this apprehension is not limited to their financial existence, as the principal claimant could go abroad to earn money as he has already done.\nThe claims of the associate claimants\n[38] As stated earlier, each associate claimant relies on the same set of circumstances as the principal claimant. The panel finds that they have established a nexus to the Convention refugee definition as members of a particular social group, namely, family members of the principal claimant, as well as by virtue of their Roma ethnicity. As such, the panel determines that the outcomes of their claims will be similar to that of the principal claimant.\nCONCLUSION\n[39] For the reasons provided, the panel finds that there is a reasonable chance that the principal claimant would be persecuted on the ground of his Roma ethnicity if returned to the Czech Republic. The panel determines the principal claimant to be a Convention refugee. His claim for protection is accepted.\n[40] The panel makes a similar determination with respect to the associate claimants. Their claims are also accepted.\n(signed) H.

You had several relationships with women, and the most serious one was with [XXX]. She was with you when the father of your son entered an eating establishment and verbally assaulted you because of your sexual preference. Shortly after, you and [XXX] both became members of Gays and Lesbians in Zimbabwe (GALZ). At the end of January 2018, that same person, [XXX] came to your house and forced you to perform oral sex on him. He was violent with you. You did not report this to police because you feared being arrested because of your sexual orientation. After you were terminated from your employment in April 2018, due you feared because of your sexual orientation, you left Zimbabwe fearing continued persecution and eventually entered Canada from the United States. You were also fleeing from [XXX] whose father raped your sister in Zimbabwe. [XXX] father is also the nephew of [XXX] was threatening you to produce your sister, and unbeknownst to him, she had fled to Canada where she made a successful refugee claim. You fear not only for yourself but for your son who is a co-claimant because if he returns to Zimbabwe he will face the wrath of both [XXX] because of you and your identity as a lesbian, and you will not be able to protect him.\nDETERMINATION\n[5] I find that you are Convention refugees as you have established a serious possibility of persecution should you return to Zimbabwe based on the grounds in section 96.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[6] I find that your identities as nationals of Zimbabwe are established by the documents provided: passports and birth certificates.\nNexus\n[7] I find that you have established a nexus to section 96 by reason of your membership in a particular social group, a lesbian in Zimbabwe.\n[8] Based on the documents in the file, and the testimony at this hearing I have noted no serious credibility issues. In particular, the evidence establishes the allegations as set out above. Your sister [XXX] whom you mentioned in your narrative, was a witness at today\u2019s hearing and she confirmed many aspects of your claim. In particular, she confirmed your sexual orientation as a lesbian, your various relationships while she was still living in Zimbabwe, and her agent of persecution, [XXX] who plays a central role in why you fear returning to Zimbabwe. I found her testimony credible.\n[9] I further considered the letter from [XXX] with whom you had a relationship in Zimbabwe and she confirmed the events with [XXX] which culminated in your decision to flee Zimbabwe with your son and various other written correspondence including from your mother. I also note your attested to membership in the GALZ organization. After reviewing the documents, I have no reasons to doubt their authenticity.\n[10] I have also considered the evidence of bullying and harassment experienced by your son when word spread that his mother is someone perceived as gay.\nObjective basis of future risk\n[11] Based on the credibility of your allegations, and the documentary evidence set out below, I find that you have established a future risk that you will be subjected to the following harm: retribution by violent assaults and inability to obtain adequate state protection.\n[12] The fact that you face this risk is corroborated by the following documents: National Documentation Package (NDP) for Zimbabwe \u2013 June 29, 2018, items 1.4, 2.6, 6.2 and 6.3, as well as, Exhibit 5.\nNature of the harm\n[13] This harm clearly amounts to persecution.\nInternal flight alternative\n[14] I have considered whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for you. On the evidence before me, I find that there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout Zimbabwe. Anti-gay legislation criminalizing same sex relations is operative throughout Zimbabwe and carries a maximum penalty of three years.\n[15] On the evidence before me, I find that it is not objectively reasonable, in all the circumstances, including those particular to you, for you to seek refuge in Zimbabwe for the following reasons. Anti-gay legislation criminalizing same sex relations is operative throughout Zimbabwe and carries a maximum penalty of three years.\nCONCLUSION\n[16] Based on the analysis above, I conclude that you are convention refugees. Accordingly, I accept your claims.\n(signed) Harvey Savage\nMarch 22, 2019\n",

I have considered your testimony and the other evidence in this case and I am ready to render my decision orally. In making this decision, I have considered the guidelines for sexual orientation.\n[2] You are claiming to be a citizen of Uganda and are claiming refugee protection pursuant to Sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[3] I find that you are a Convention refugee for the following reasons.\n[4] The allegations of your claim can be found in your Basis of Claim Form at Exhibit 2. In short, you allege persecution as a member of a particular social group, namely that you are in danger of being harmed because of your identity as a gay Ugandan man as same-sex sexual activity has been criminalised in Uganda.\n[5] You fear both the police and your community as you have alleged that you have been previously sought by the police after being attacked by a homophobic mob.\n[6] Your personal identity as a citizen of Uganda has been established by your Ugandan passport. I therefore find on a balance of probabilities your identity and country of reference have been established.\n[7] In terms of your general credibility, I have found you to be a very credible witness, and I therefore accept what you have alleged in your oral testimony and in your Basis of Claim form. You testified in a straightforward manner about your fears without any embellishment, and there were no inconsistencies that went to the core of the claim that were not explained.\n[8] Your testimony was spontaneous including being able to provide details about how you first began to understand your sexual orientation as a youth. You were able to give specific detailed testimony about your emotions and the difficulties you face keeping your feelings a secret after seeing homophobic reactions from the community, your school, your church and your family.\n[9] You gave extremely detailed testimony about your current partner [XXX] (PH), including how the relationship developed, what attracted you to [XXX] (PH), and how you were able to keep your relationship a secret as a whole. Your testimony regarding how your sexual orientation was exposed was also descriptive, consistent and in line with the documentary evidence you provided.\n[10] As well today, you showed me that you have been in ongoing contact with [XXX] (PH) since you came to Canada, and you were able to show me your communication with him after he had fled to a remote village in Uganda. You showed me your messages on WhatsApp on your phone dating back to February 2018 shortly after you had left Uganda.\n[11] When reading through the months and months and months worth of messages, I noted that you both refer to each other with terms of endearment and that the messages were varied, plentiful and continuous up to this time. I saw that he had wished you luck on your hearing today.\n[12] I find that the messages that you showed me were authentic as I saw them on your phone, and I saw how far back they dated and overall consistent with the nature of the relationship that you have alleged.\n[13] As well in support of your claim, you provided documentary evidence. I note a medical assessment completed here in Canada, which states that you have injuries consistent with the assault that you had alleged in Uganda. I noted a detailed letter from your same-sex partner, again, very detailed, consistent with your allegations and very much in line with the nature of the relationship that you alleged.\n[14] I noticed that you provided photographs of you and your same-sex partner as well as a letter from your uncle, the person who helped you escape Uganda and who provided support for you while you were in hiding. As well, I see that you have provided confirmation of money transfers showing that you have been sending money to your same-sex partner in Uganda. These documents can be found in Exhibit 6 through 8.\n[15] I am therefore satisfied that the events have occurred as alleged and that you would face persecution at the hands of either the Ugandan government or your community should you return to Uganda. I find that you have established your subjective fear.\n[16] I find that there is a link between what you fear and one of the five Convention grounds, specifically that as a gay man you are a member of a particular social group because of your sexual orientation. Therefore, your claim has been assessed under Section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[17] I further find that you have an objective basis for your fear because of the documented conditions for Uganda as per the evidence in Exhibit 3, which is the National Documentation Package for Uganda. I specifically note Item 6.1 which states that Ugandan law criminalises same sex sexual acts. The law in Uganda further restricts the access of sexually nonconforming individuals to protections against discrimination that are available to other Ugandans.\n[18] I also note that there is further criminalisation of same sex activity under the Penal Code which prohibits unnatural offences and acts of gross indecency, and that homosexuality is rejected by most Ugandans on the basis of tradition, culture, religion and moral values. Many in Uganda perceive homosexuality as \u201cun-African and un-Christian\u201d or inspired by western practices, and it is also presented in connection to wider threats to \u201cauthentic\u201d African values and traditions.\n[19] Therefore, in considering all of this information, I find that your subjective fear has an objective basis. I find that you have a well-founded fear of persecution due to your sexual orientation.\n[20] I further find that Stare protection would not be reasonably forthcoming in your case as per the evidence already discussed. As per Item 6.1 of the National Documentation Package at Exhibit 3, same\u00adsex sexual activities are criminalised. The same Item also notes that many people who identify as a sexual minority are often unable to receive police protection from abuse by non-State actors for fear of being arrested or ignored or further abused. As such. I find that there is clear and convincing evidence that State protection would not be available to you nor would it be reasonable for you to seek such protection.\n[21] Given the conditions discussed, I further find that there would be a serious possibility of persecution anywhere in Uganda as homosexuality is criminalised throughout the country and societal attitudes as discussed are consistently homophobic throughout the country.\n[22] As the test for an internal flight alternative fails on the first prong, I find that there is no viable internal flight alternative for you anywhere in Uganda.\n[23] Based on the totality of the evidence, I find the claimant to be a Convention refugee. Your claim is therefore accepted.\n[24] So, this will conclude today\u2019s hearing. I would like to thank everyone for their participation.\n[25] Thank you, sir. Thank you counsel.\n[26] COUNSEL: Thank you madam member.\n\u2014REASONS CONCLUDED\u2014\n",

Bardai\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Adrienne C Smith\nCountry: Indonesia\nRPD Number: TB6-03152\nATIP Number: A-2021-00256\nATIP Pages: 0000158-000163\nACO RECOMMENDATION\n[1] The claimants\u2019 allegations are as set out in their Basis of Claim Forms (BOCs ).1 In summary, they allege a fear of persecution at the hands of the Indonesian Government and society on the basis of their sexual orientation and HIV-positive status. The claimants state that they were in a same-sex relationship prior to their arrival in Canada and that on [XXX] they married each other in Toronto, Ontario.\n[2] The original hearing of this claim was held on February 7, 2018 where the claim was reserved for a decision. The Member recused herself from the claim March 1, 2018 and was therefore unable to render a final decision on the claim. On February 12, 2019 the RPD sent a letter to Counsel and the Claimants, giving them the option to conduct a new hearing or assign a new Panel to render a decision, relying on the claimant\u2019s testimony from the February 7, 2018 hearing and the documents already on file. Counsel responded on February 12, 2019, requesting that the RPO make a decision based on the evidence provided at the original RPD hearing. She has also made an application for additional post-hearing disclosure pursuant to RPD Rule 50. This disclosure was accepted and added as Exhibit 10.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[3] With respect to identity, the claimants have submitted their Indonesian passports to Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) officials upon making their claim.2\n[4] In support of their sexual identity, the claimants have provided a substantial amount of evidence including their Ontario marriage license, certificate of marriage, personal photographs and letters of support from friends in Indonesia, in addition to their testimony.3\n[5] In support of their identity as HIV-positive individuals, the claimants have provided a letter from [XXX] of Regent Park Community Health Centre who states that both Mr. [XXX] and Mr. [XXX] are infected with HIV and that they are both currently on medication to treat the infection. In further support, they have provided letters of support from the Toronto People with AIDS Foundation, Asian Community Aids Services and from [XXX] a Public Health Nurse with Toronto Public Health.4\nCredibility\n[6] I have reviewed the claimant\u2019s evidence including their BOCs, Port of Entry notes, the documentation provided in support of their claim by counsel and the recording of the hearing held on February 7, 2018. I have also reviewed country condition documentation contained in the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada\u2019s National Documentation Package (NDP)5 for Indonesia. The claimants\u2019 evidence was detailed, consistent and there did not appear to be any serious credibility issues that arose from the documents in the file on a balance of probabilities. Their testimony at the hearing appeared sincere and credible. The Member at the original hearing accepted their profile as individuals in a same-sex relationship and there does not appear to be any evidence before me to the contrary.\nWell-founded Fear of Persecution on a Convention ground:\nRace\nNationality\nReligion\nX Particular Social Group\nPolitical Opinion\n[7] The documentary evidence supports the allegations noted by the claimants. It is well documented that while homosexuality is not criminalized in Indonesia, the rights of LGBT groups have come under attack in 2016 which stemmed from a comment made by the Minister of Higher Education, Muhammad Nasir on January 24, 2016 about how he wanted to ban LGBT student organizations from university campuses.\u201d Since this comment, mass religious groups and NGOs joined the rhetoric; psychiatrists proclaimed same-sex sexual orientation and transgender identities as \u00b7\u00b7mental illnesses\u201d; the country\u2019 s largest Muslim organization called for criminalization of LGBT behaviors and activism and forced \u201crehabilitation\u201d for LGBT people. The repercussions continue to be felt by LGBT people in Indonesia.7\n[8] According to Human Rights Watch, more recently the Indonesian Government publicly called for policies that would target LGBT individuals for arrest and \u201crehabilitation.\u201d8 Local decrees and other official documents reviewed by Human Rights Watch proposed handing over lists of alleged gay and bisexual men to authorities, changing school curriculum to teach lies and hatred of LGBT people, force medical intervention to attempt to change their sexual orientation or gender identity and censoring speech about LGBT rights.9\nState Protection:\n[9] With respect to state protection and in the particular circumstances of this case, according to the documentary evidence, the \u201cgovernment took almost no action to prevent discrimination against LGBT persons,\u201d and in some cases it failed to protect LGBT individuals from societal abuse\u201d. Further reports indicate that while the central government has not criminalized same-sex relations, various provincial governments have implemented their own laws to punish LGBT individuals, including the Aceh provincial government which passed a law prescribing \u201c100 lashes and\/or up to 8 years in prison\u201d.10 The same report further notes that other provinces such as South Sumatra, Kalimaman, Tasikmalaya (West Java) and West Sumatra have done the same, though the punishment varies.11\n[10] Given the remarks made by government officials and more recently, the increasing anti-LGBT rhetoric depicted in counsel\u2019s post-hearing disclosure, it would appear that the claimants have rebutted the presumption of state protection.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[11] I have further considered the objective country documentation which demonstrates a country with an increasing intolerance towards LGBT individuals. This intolerance is echoed in the NOP according to Human Rights Watch:\nA series of anti-LGBT public comments by government officials grew into a cascade of threats and vitriol against LGBT Indonesians by state commissions, militant Islamists, and mainstream religious organizations. That outpouring of intolerance has resulted in proposals of laws which pose a serious long-term threat to the rights and safety of LGBT Indonesians.\n[12] Given the participation of the state in this growing anti-LGBT rhetoric, the laws put in place by various provincial governments throughout the country and the particular profile of the claimants, it appears that the claimants would be unable to live safely anywhere throughout Indonesia.\nCONCLUSION\n[13] Having considered all of the claimant\u2019s evidence on a forward-looking basis, including the claimant\u2019s BOC, Ministers information, Counsel\u2019s disclosure, the objective country documentation for Indonesia and the recording of the original RPD hearing, I recommend that this claim is suitable to he accepted without another hearing.\n(signed) N. LeBlanc\nMarch 26, 2019\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] I have reviewed all of the evidence on file and listened to the testimony from the hearing. I have considered the particular circumstances of the claimants as well as the recommendation made by the Adjudicative Claim Officer and I agree that these claims are suitable to be accepted without another hearing for the following reasons.\n[2] I find that the claimants have sufficiently established their personal identities as citizens of Indonesia as well as their personal profiles as members of the LGBTQ community on a balance of probabilities. I did not find any issues as it relates to the credibility of their allegations or documents on file on a balance of probabilities. I also find that the claimants have established an objective basis for their claims. I find that the claimants face a serious possibility of persecution based on their membership in a particular social group. I further find that in the particular circumstances of the claimants that there is no adequate state protection or a viable internal flight alternative available to them. As such, I find the claimants to be Convention refugees.\n[3] Their claims are accepted.\n(signed) S.

The [XXX] cause is gay rights activism in Ukraine.\n[2] [XXX], his son, is claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Act by reason of his membership in a particular social group; namely, he identifies as gay.\n[3] In reaching a decision, the panel has considered Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 92 in relation to proceedings before the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada involving sexual orientation and gender identity and expression.\nALLEGATIONS\n[4] The claimants\u2019 allegations are set out fully in their Basis of Claim (BOC) forms.3\n[5] In summary, [XXX] is a citizen of Ukraine who fears persecution based on his sexual orientation, specifically as a gay male\n[6] [XXX] is the father of the [XXX], and a civil rights activist working for gay rights in Ukraine. He fears persecution by reason of his civil rights activism.\n[7] Both father and son have suffered physical violence, threats, and police indifference in Ukraine by reason of their membership in their particular social group.\nDETERMINATION\n[8] The panel finds that the claimants have established a serious possibility of persecution in Ukraine based on a Convention ground; namely, membership in a particular social group.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[9] The panel is satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, as to [XXX] and [XXX] personal identity and identity as nationals of Ukraine, based on the certified true copies of their Ukrainian passports in evidence.4\nCredibility and Subjective Fear\n[XXX]\n[10] The panel questioned [XXX] first about the allegations set out in his BOC. The panel finds that the claimant was, on the balance, a credible witness. His testimony was consistent with the allegations set out in his BOC. He described his association with and the friends he had in the LGBT community, specifically those he had met at GenderZ. He discussed the activities and demonstrations that he had participated in there. He described his relationship with [XXX], how they met and started dating in March 2018, how they located the apartment in which they eventually moved into together. He also described beatings he had undergone, and produced medical reports supporting his injuries.\n[11] One two occasions when [XXX] was attacked, the incident was reported to the police. In one attack, the police threatened to turn the accusation back on to [XXX], as his attacker claimed to be a victim who had counterattacked. In another incident the police pressured witnesses and kept them from giving statements confirming the attack.\n[12] [XXX] was clear and cogent in his testimony that he would not feel safe in any part of Ukraine, and that police protection was not available to him or his father.\n[13] [XXX] testimony supported his father\u2019s claim. He described his father\u2019s activism on behalf of the gay community in Ukraine. He recalled and gave the example of an incident he witnessed in which people active in fighting for gay rights were attacked; they were his friends and the police did not want to accept their statement as to what had happened to them \u201cdue to hate.\u201d He feared for his father\u2019s safety in Ukraine as his father was known as an activist fighting for gay rights.\n[XXX]\n[14] The panel also questioned [XXX]. The panel finds that the claimant was, on the balance, a credible witness. His testimony was consistent with the allegations set out in his BOC. [XXX] confirmed that his son is gay, and described how he and his son had discussed the son\u2019s sexual orientation from the early realization of it.\n[15] In his BOC [XXX] described his son\u2019s struggle with being gay in Ukraine; the assaults which his son had suffered, the law firm he had retained to provide legal support for his efforts to advance protection for the gay community, the attack he himself had endured during a morning run when three men wearing uniforms beat him and tried to drag him into a minivan, the efforts he had made to seek protection and redress from the police, and the futility of these efforts.\n[16] Although he had applied for and been granted a temporary visitor\u2019s visa into Canada in [XXX] 2018, for both himself and his son, [XXX] did not leave Ukraine until [XXX], 2018. The panel questioned [XXX] as to why he had waited so long if he indeed feared persecution both on his own account and that of his son.\n[17] [XXX] said that a child\u2019s happiness comes first. His son had met a boy named [XXX] and loved him, and because the move to Canada, where they knew no one and would suffer considerable financial difficulties, would prove so difficult (it would not be possible for his wife and daughter to accompany them to Canada), he decided to stay and hope. He was concerned for his own safety but would not leave his son alone in Ukraine; and so they waited.\n[18] In November 2018, his son and [XXX] were attacked by a group of people who were insulting their sexual orientation. [XXX] ran away and this ended [XXX] relationship with [XXX]. [XXX] became involved in pressing for a police investigation only to discover that one of the attackers was the son of [XXX]., the First Deputy Public Prosecutor of the claimants\u2019 home city.\n[19] [XXX] testified that [XXX] was a known criminal, is corrupt and takes bribes, and he produced media articles that support this assessment. [XXX]., seeking to disengage his own son from the allegations of assault, phoned and threatened [XXX]. [XXX] testified that not only does he fear returning to Ukraine by reason of the fact that he is a known gay rights activist, and gay rights activists are targeted in Ukraine, but also because [XXX]. would now have particular reason to harm him.\n[20] [XXX] described what he referred to as the special relationship that police and prosecutors have in Ukraine, and the reason why, in his view, the bias will not soon change. He said that it was not a long time ago that the Criminal Code of the Soviet Union made it a criminal offence to be gay; and that gay persons were prosecuted and sent to psychiatric hospitals for \u201ctreatment\u201d. These laws, it was his observation, are still ingrained in Ukrainian society.\n[21] The panel has reviewed the articles that describe the corruption and violence surrounding the office of the Deputy Public Prosecutor and accepts that because of his involvement in the case in which the prosecutor\u2019s son was implicated, [XXX] is at a heightened risk should he return to Ukraine.\n[22] Finally, the panel notes that the claimants provided documentary evidence in support of their claims, most notably pictures and letters from the LGBT community in Ukraine, police reports, and medical reports.5 The panel finds these documents to be relevant and probative in support of both of the claimants\u2019 allegations.\n[23] In light of the testimony that the panel has found to be credible, and considering the documentary evidence, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant [XXX] is gay, and that he experienced physical violence in Ukraine due to his sexual orientation.\n[24] The panel also finds, in light of the testimony that the panel has found to be credible, and considering the documentary evidence, that, on a balance of probabilities, [XXX] is a civil rights activist advocating for gay rights who experienced physical violence and threats in Ukraine due to this activism.\nObjective basis of the claim\n[XXX]\n[25] Having considered the country conditions documentation, the panel finds that there is an objective basis to what [XXX] fears in Ukraine.\n[26] The objective documentary evidence indicates that the LGBTQ community in Ukraine faces bias and hostility6 and that discrimination against the LGBTQ community in Ukraine takes place in almost every area of life.7 Discrimination is considered to be frequently encountered in employment, education, healthcare and treatment by law enforcement authorities. Violence against individuals in the LGBTQ community is noted to be a significant human rights issue in Ukraine.8 While Ukraine was the first former Soviet State to decriminalize same-sex activity, social intolerance is noted to have gradually increased since that time.9\n[27] Evidence in the National Documentation Package (NDP) for Ukraine suggests that violence against the LGBT community in Ukraine is on the rise:\nNash Mir\u2019s monitoring network in 2018 documented 358 cases of actions motivated by homophobia \/ transphobia, discrimination and other violations of LGBT rights in Ukraine. 34 included events that happened in 2017, the rest- 324 cases \u2013 occurred in 2018. In comparison, previously in 2017 Nash Mir Center documented 226 cases. Such a sharp increase in the annual number of the reported LGBT rights violations, in our opinion, resulted from both increasing efficiency of the monitoring network activity and the real growth of violence against LGBT people by right-wing radical groups.10\n[28] In light of the objective documentary evidence the panel finds that [XXX] has a well-founded fear of persecution in Ukraine based on his profile as a gay man.\n[XXX]\n[29] [XXX] provided documentary evidence to support his claim that gay activists were targeted in Ukraine.\n[30] An article published in February 8, 2018, in the Gay Alliance Ukraine reported an attack by five masked men shouting \u201cSieg Heil\u201d and \u201cDeath to Faggots\u201d on four activists who were members of the \u201cGay Alliance Ukraine\u201d organization. As a result of the attack two of them were taken to the hospital.11 A July 2018 World report dated July 1 2018 described as severe beating by unidentified assailants of a gay activist who was organizing a gay pride parade in Kryvyi Rih.\n[31] The National Document Package, World Report 2019: Ukraine Human Rights Watch12 contains the following confirmation of Oleksandr\u2019 s concerns for his safety as a human rights activist;\n1. Authorities did not conduct effective investigations into numerous assaults against anti-corruption and other community activists. In November 2018, Kateryna Handzyuk, an anti-corruption activist, died from burn wounds inflicted in a July acid attack.\n2. Members of groups advocating hate and discrimination carried out at least two dozen violent attacks, threats, or instances of intimidation against Roma people, LGBT people, and rights activists in several Ukrainian cities. In most cases, police failed to respond or effectively investigate.\nIn March, hate groups attacked events to promote women\u2019s rights in Kyiv, Lviv, and Uzhgorod. In Kyiv, they physically assaulted participants while police looked on.\n3. In May, hate groups disrupted an equality festival in Chernivtsi while local police failed to effectively protect participants. Also in May, hate groups in Kyiv disrupted an Amnesty International LGBT rights event in Kyiv. Police present took no action and made homophobic comments.\n[32] In light of the objective documentary evidence the panel finds that [XXX] has a well-founded fear of persecution in Ukraine based on his profile as a gay rights activist.\nState Protection\n[33] The claimants bear the onus of establishing, with clear and convincing evidence, that adequate state protection would not be forthcoming to them, were they to return to Ukraine. Having considered all of the evidence, including circumstances particular to the claimants, the panel finds that they have met this burden.\n[34] It is reported in the objective documentary evidence that incidents of homophobic violence are rarely investigated or prosecuted by the authorities in Ukraine and that there is no effective hate crime legislation in place.13 Significant problems are noted in the objective evidence with respect to law enforcement treatment of same-sex activity. Failure by the police to intervene in order to prevent violence and other crimes is also noted to be a problem, and it is also noted that the police sometimes use violence against people on the basis of their sexual orientation.14 The current United States Department of State (USDOS) human rights report for Ukraine indicates that there was sporadic violence against LGBTQ persons and that Ukrainian authorities often did not adequately investigate these cases or hold perpetrators to account.15 Crimes and discrimination against LGBTQ persons is noted to remain underreported and police open very view cases related to such acts.16 Further, it is reported that politicians at the local level sometimes voice opposition to LGBTQ rights and failed to protect individuals of the LGBTQ community.17\n[35] In September 2017, [XXX] was attacked. The attack was homophobically motivated. He required medical attention. The traumatologist was obligated to report such incidents to the police and so on September 19th, 2017, the claimants were called into the District Department of Internal Affairs. The investigating officer made derogatory comments about [XXX] sexual orientation, and berated [XXX] for how \u201cpoorly\u201d he had raised his son.\n[36] When by October 2017 [XXX] went to check on the progress of the case, he was told that there was no news, the police had important work to do, and [XXX] should not disturb them with unnecessary requests.\n[37] [XXX] retained a lawyer, and submitted a complaint to the prosecutor\u2019s office. The investigator told [XXX] that he was being \u201cvery imprudent\u2019 and that he \u201cshould be very careful\u201d. The investigator suggested that [XXX] might have been the real aggressor and could be charged with the offence.\n[38] On the advice of a lawyer, after this, [XXX] decide to stop pursuing the case.\n[39] The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that adequate state protection would not be forthcoming to the claimants were they to return to Ukraine.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[40] Given that homophobic attitudes and incidents of violence against LGBTQ people are reported to occur throughout the country, the panel finds that the claimants would face a serious possibility of persecution wherever they went in Ukraine. The panel therefore finds that there would be no viable IFA for the claimants should they return there.\nCONCLUSION\n[41] Having considered all of the evidence, the panel finds that the claimant [XXX] has established that he faces a serious possibility of persecution in Ukraine based on a Convention ground, namely his membership in a particular social group by virtue of being a gay man. Pursuant to section 96 of the Act, the panel finds that the claimant is a Convention refugee.\n[42] The panel also finds that the claimant [XXX] has established that he faces a serious possibility of persecution in Ukraine based on a Convention ground, namely his membership in a particular social group by virtue of being a civil rights activist for the LGBTQ community. Pursuant to section 96 of the Act, the panel finds that the claimant is a Convention refugee.\n[43] Accordingly, the panel accepts the claims of both [XXX] and [XXX].\n(signed) C.

        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2019 RLLR 142\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: December 13, 2019\nPanel: D. D\u2019Intino\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Gabriella B Uteras Sandoval\nCountry: Mexico\nRPD Number: TB9-00090\nATIP Number: A-2021-00256\nATIP Pages: 0000133-000139\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: Alright so just let me get started here. Okay so this is my decision with respect to the claim of [XXX] File number TB9-00090. I just want to alert you sir that you are going to get a written copy of these reasons and as will your counsel and there may be some changes with respect to grammar, syntax and additional references to documentary evidence.\n[2] The claimant is a citizen of Mexico and claims refugee protection pursuant to Sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[3] I have considered the chair person\u2019s Guideline 9 in this claim which relates to sexual orientation, gender identity and expression. I am required to consider these guidelines and I find them helpful.\n[4] I have considered your testimony sir and the country documentation for Mexico and the documentation you have provided and this is my decision.\nDETERMINATION:\n[5] I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee on the grounds of membership in particular social group gay men. As I have made a positive determination on this ground I need not go on to analyze your claim under Section 97.\nALLEGATIONS:\n[6] Your allegations are fully set out in your basis of claim form which is Exhibit 2, in summary you have testified that you fear persecution in Mexico because of your sexual orientation and as well your HIV positive status.\n[7] You further allege that there is no adequate state protection for you in Mexico nor is there an internal flight alternative that is both safe and reasonable for you because the persecution you fear exists throughout all OF Mexico.\nIDENTITY:\n[8] Your personal identity as a citizen of Mexico is established on a balance of probabilities by your testimony and by your Mexican passport which is Exhibit 1.\nNEXUS:\n[9] The claimant has a number of potential nexus\u2019s to the convention, for example as I mentioned as a gay man or as a gay man who has HIV positive status. I will accept you claim simply on the basis of your sexual orientation.\n[10] Under Section 96 the test is whether there is a serious possibility of persecution on this ground should you return to Mexico and I find that you have met this test.\nCREDIBILITY:\n[11] You affirm to tell the truth in your testimony today; you confirmed that you likewise affirmed to tell the truth when you completed your basis of claim form. When a witness swears or affirms to tell the truth this creates a presumption of truthfulness unless there is evidence to the contrary.\n[12] I find that you were a credible witness. Your evidence was consistent, logical, clear and supported by highly probative documentary evidence. The evidence you gave me today and what you wrote in your narrative can be very briefly summarized as follows.\n[13] You were born and raised in Agua Linda Puebla Mexico. That growing up you were verbally assaulted and discriminated against because of choice of dress or the way you spoke which other people determined to be feminine.\n[14] You realized that you were gay from a young age and had your first relationship with a same sex partner around the age of twelve. When you moved away from home and got a job with [XXX] you were told by your boss that he did not want you to be hired because he did not want gay people working there.\n[15] On a number of occasions you were physically and verbally assaulted because of your sexual orientation. You told me about one robbery in particular where your wallet and your phone were taken and the thieves told you they had been following you and your partner and the demanded your pin, they indicated that they knew where you lived and where you worked and that they were watching you.\n[16] You came to Canada in [XXX] 2018 and subsequently claimed refugee protection. When you told your parents about your sexual orientation they had a difficult time accepting it and have still not fully accepted it as they hold out hope that you will one day have a family with a woman.\n[17] While in Canada you were diagnosed with HIV. You are currently in receipt of medical treatment and counselling. You do not believe you can return to Mexico and live openly and safely anywhere in the country as a gay man who is HIV positive.\n[18] You fear that you will not have access to your medication without which it would lead to the development of the AIDS virus and place your very life at risk.\n[19] So that is a very condensed version of your testimony and your narrative.\nOBJECTIVE DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE:\n[20] Conservative attitudes prevail in Mexico and public displays of affection between same sex partners are not considered socially acceptable and that is reflected in Item 6.2 of the NDP and Item 6.1.\n[21] Furthermore in Item 6.1 and I quote from the US Department of State report for 2017 \u201cdiscrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity was prevalent despite a gradual increase in public tolerance of LGBTQ individuals according to public opinion surveys\u201d.\n[22] In one report information was published according to which one thousand three hundred and ten cases of killings of LGBTQ person\u2019s motivated by homophobia were committed in Mexico between 1995 and April 30th 2016. Forty four of those killings occurred in 2015 and fifteen in the first portion of 2016.\n[23] In the last ten years in Mexico there has been an average of seventy one homicides a year of LGBTQ persons. The UN special repertoire on extra judicial or arbitrary executions noted \u201can alarming pattern of grotesque homicides of LGBTQ individuals and broad impunity for these crimes sometimes with a suspected complicity of investigative authorities\u201d.\n[24] For example between January 2014 and December 2016 two hundred and two persons, sexual minorities were killed as a result of their sexual orientation or gender identity including a hundred and eight trans women, ninety three gay men and one lesbian woman.\n[25] The highest number of victims seventy six was recorded in 2016. Of the total two hundred and two victims thirty three of them showed signs of torture while fifteen showed signs of sexual violence. That is from Item 6.4 of the NDP.\n[26] From Items 6.2 I take the following two examples. On the 6th of May 2019 a group of six armed men attacked and robbed a shelter where eleven LGBTQ asylum seekers were staying setting the door of the shelter on fire.\n[27] The shelter\u2019s legal representative informed Amnesty International that the men returned a few hours later shouting homophobic slurs and threatened to kill them if they did not leave the neighborhood.\n[28] According to the 2018 national study on discrimination against sexual and gender minorities in Mexico 41.8 percent of the respondents indicated that they did not believe that adequate public healthcare services were available for sexual minorities and 31.1 percent don\u2019t even know if those services exist. The absence of adequate health services for sexual minorities is a noted problem in Mexico.\n[29] Furthermore in February 2019 the Federal Government noted, announced that it would no longer fund civil society organizations for activities such as outreach or HIV testing. Mexico city has the highest number of documented HIV cases in all of Mexico, despite these high infection rates medical treatment for HIV and AIDS is largely unavailable in less urban areas due to cost.\n[30] Even in areas that have free anti retro viral drugs they are usually reserved only for the sickest people. Many in Mexican society hold misconceptions about the LGBT community and HIV that further contribute to the widespread stigma associated with both HIV and LGBTQ persons.\n[31] A national survey of Mexicans found that fifty nine percent believe that HIV\/AIDS is caused by homosexuality. These misconceptions and stigmas exist even among medical providers in Mexico. In fact most hospitals view homosexuality as a risk factor for HIV and often discriminate against those who seek treatment.\n[32] The Commission on Human Rights in Mexico City also reported that HIV and AIDS clinics often actively mistreat and discriminate against LGBTQ persons living with HIV or AIDS. That is from Item 6.3 of the NDP.\n[33] Claimant\u2019s Exhibit 5 contains letters from family and friends as well as medical documentation which confirm all of the core allegations underpinning the claimant\u2019s claim, including his sexual orientation and HIV positive status.\n[34] Relying on those items I find that there is a strong objective basis for the fear you have of being persecuted in Mexico. I also found that you subjectively fear persecution, outright violence or death in Mexico on the basis of your sexual orientation and your HIV status. Therefore I find that your fear is well founded.\nSTATE PROTECTION:\n[35] States are presumed to be capable of protecting their citizens but this presumption is rebuttable with clear and convincing evidence. The NDP for Mexico quoting a number of nongovernmental organizations indicate that there are high levels of distrust in the authorities and that rights for gay people are still treated as exceptions to be granted at the discretion of local officials.\n[36] According to the US country reports for 2016, civil society groups claimed police routinely subjected LGBTQ persons to mistreatment while in custody.\n[37] According to several sources the judicial system is not effective in investigating crimes committed against sexual minorities.\n[38] Furthermore there is evidence that state actors have been and continue to be involved in forced disappearances and extra judicial killings adding to the reasons why LGBTQ persons would fear approaching the state for protection and the reference for that, references Item 2.1of the NDP at Page 4.\n[39] Another example from the NDP on August 5th of 2017 an eighteen year old man was beaten to death by a group of ten taxi drivers who worked at a taxi stand outside a gay bar in San Luis Potosi. Local human rights defenders claim the killing was a hate crime because the victim was attacked due to his sexual orientation.\n[40] The President of the San Luis Potosi state commission for human rights agreed with that. Advocates also argued negligence in investigating the case due to homophobia in the police. As of October 2017 no one had been arrested in connection with the killing. That is from Item 2.1.\n[41] From Item 6.1 according to an organization called Collectivo Leange(ph). Officials from the public ministry often mistreat LGBTQ persons and refuse to open investigations for crimes against them.\n[42] Furthermore despite the training provided to judicial authorities on sexual diversity there is still a lot of intimidation and threats against the LGBTQ population due to what they perceive as faults against morals which are then used to extort members of the LGBTQ community.\n[43] This is but a small sample of the documentation in the NDP and in the claimant\u2019s country conditions documentation which support my conclusion that Mexico is unable or unwilling to provide protection to individuals like this claimant.\n[44] I found all, sorry I found the claimant to be credible. I find that the objective evidence supports the claimant\u2019s evidence and that it demonstrates on a balance of probabilities adequate state protection for you in Mexico would not be reasonably forthcoming.\nINTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERANTIVE:\n[45] I purpose Mexico City as an internal flight alternative outside of Puebla that I believed would be safe and reasonable in the claimant\u2019s circumstances. For the following reasons I find that the claimant would face a serious possibility of persecution on the grounds of his sexual orientation in Mexico City and therefore the internal flight alternative location fails the first prong of the analysis.\n[46] The first prong of the analysis asks whether there is a serious possibility of persecution or a Section 97 risk on a balance of probabilities in Mexico City.\n[47] Item 6.4 of the NDP which is a response to information request on Mexico City depicts Mexico City as the most progressive area in Mexico concerning LGBTQ rights. For example there was a first district in Mexico to allow legal same sex marriage and to allow a person to change their gender identity.\n[48] One source that is quoted in this item talks about gay friendly zones or zones where the LGBTQ community feel safe from being abused. However they note that there are police officers that look for anyway to intimidate or extort same sex couples wherever they are.\n[49] The UN special repertoire on extra judicial or arbitrary executions notes that there remains broad impunity for crimes against the LGBTQ community.\n[50] According to a report by the transgender law society and Cornell University Law School, LGBTQ clinic, police harassment against the LGBTQ community remains high in Mexico City.\n[51] A 2016 report indicates that out of four hundred and twenty five person\u2019s interviewed, one hundred and thirty nine reported some form of abuse by authorities including delays in or refusal to provide services, violence and insults. That comes from Item 6.4.\n[52] Claimant\u2019s Exhibit 5 at Tab 22 contains articles which describe a shortage of HIV\/AIDS drugs which has not yet been resolved in Mexico placing the lives of thousands of people at risk.\n[53] Again these are but a few examples of the violence and persecution that gay people face on a daily basis and Mexico City does not appear to be as safe as it is socially liberal for the LGBTQ community.\n[54] Ultimately I find that the preponderance of evidence weighs in favor of finding that the claimant would face a serious possibility of persecution on a convention ground in Mexico City and throughout Mexico. Therefore I find that Mexico City is not a viable internal flight alternative for the claimant.\nCONCLUSION:\n[55] I have considered your testimony, the documentary evidence and the country conditions documentation and I find that there is a serious possibility of persecution by Mexican society generally on the basis of your sexual orientation and your HIV positive status should you return to Mexico.\n[56] I therefore find you to be a Convention refugee under Section 96 and I accept your claim for protection.\n[57] That is my decision thank you very much. Thank you so it is 11:56 I have delivered my decision we will go off record thank you everyone.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

Rozenszajn\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): El-Farouk Khaki\nCountry: Egypt\nRPD Number: TB8-33214\nATIP Number: A-2021-00256\nATIP Pages: 0000128-000132\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: So, I have considered the testimony and the other evidence in the case and I am ready to render my decision orally.\n[2] The oral reasons form the basis of the decision and they are recorded on a CD Rom; a transcript is also produced but the transcript does not get viewed for any spelling errors or mistakes, so if there is any doubt as to the meaning in the transcription regard must be had to the original CD Rom audio recording.\n[3] So, the claimant [XXX] claims to be a citizen of Egypt and is claiming refugee protection pursuant to Sections 96 and 97.1 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[4] I have considered the Guidelines on Guideline 9, sexual orientation and gender identity and expression guideline, SOBI Guideline in deciding the claim.\n[5] By way of determination I find that the claimant is a Convention Refugee for the following reasons.\n[6] I find he has established a serious possibility of persecution based upon the convention ground of particular social group, which is gay men in Egypt or homosexual men in Egypt.\n[7] The claimant\u2019s allegations are found in Exhibit 2 which is his basis of claim form and he basically alleges that he is a gay man, that he has known since 11 that he was homosexual and he likes men and is not attracted to women.\n[8] It is a very long story and I am not going to summarize all of it, but suffice to say that he likes Europe, he likes Germany, he has been many, many times to Europe. He studied there and went back and there were many attempts at seeking jobs and other forms of permanent status in Europe over the years and he just was not able to and he always came back to live in Egypt where he basically either was a recluse or he was engaged in some form of online gay dating to the best of his abilities as he could and when those platforms came on the market and (inaudible) sufficiently.\n[9] He alleges that he had great hopes for Egypt during the revolution, but it did not materialize. He alleges that ultimately he was actually entrapped while using a (inaudible) application where he was basically arrested by a couple of undercover cops who then basically abused him, took him to the station and then eventually let him go.\n[10] At that point he felt he was unsafe in Egypt and he came to Canada where he claimed refugee protection.\n[11] So, in terms of the claimant\u2019s identity as a national of Egypt, I find he has established his identity by reason of the supporting documentation and his testimony, mainly his Egyptian passport. I find he is a national of Egypt as he alleged.\n[12] In terms of credibility, I find the claimant to be ultimately a credible witness and therefore believe what he has alleged in support of his claim. His identity as a homosexual man is supported by numerous documents, including various profiles and text messages and exchanges with various other gay men, which is in the record such as in Exhibit 10 and 11. There are a number of support letters also that testify to that.\n[13] His testimony generally consists on that particular aspect of his credibility or his story, so there is no reason to question it.\n[14] The main issues in this case were \u2026 before we get into the re-availments I would also note that there were a couple of omissions from the basis of claim form, such as the names of the officers who arrested him, but I find that I accept his explanation that they were either fake names or he did not remember or they were not actually listed properly because they were just really quick messages that did not actually mention the name. I find all that is sufficient and I find that there is really no reason to expect that he would learn the names of the undercover officers if they actually were undercover. So, I find there is no reason to doubt his credibility on that basis having heard the explanation.\n[15] The main issue really is the numerous re-availments to Egypt and failures to claim over a very, very lengthy period of time, stretching all the way to the 1990s and just the continuing ability to enter and exit Egypt constantly and really no apparent fear to return and leave Egypt as a gay man.\n[16] So, I put that to the claimant and he explained that really it has got to do with his risk profile that changed materially recently, just before he left when he was arrested which really caused him to fear his safety. Beforehand he really wanted to live he says in Europe and he made many, many efforts to get jobs in Europe and that also is corroborated and appears credible on its face as we can see in the record, given the numerous letters of responses for various jobs and permits he tried to get.\n[17] But he felt that the risk was just too high, that he would be barred from Europe in the future. He could not continue to try to get a job or that it might even lead him into more trouble if he was deported as a failed refugee claimant.\n[18] Now, I find that I ultimately accept his explanations because there is a very evident desire to leave the country, but he wanted to do it in a more commercial skilled-worker fashion and that is a legitimate reason and I find also that there is a big difference between his risk profile in those past years and the risk profile that he has now, which is he now has a record with the police, a record of arrest and so his risk profile is a lot higher than it was before.\n[19] Ultimately, you know, it is ultimately his decision as to why he chose to live as a recluse in Egypt and put himself at risk like that where he could not be openly homosexual, it is really his own problem at this point, but I find that in terms of his credibility it is sufficient that his risk profile is just different now than it used to be and so again, there is no reason to doubt his credibility and I do not find that the re\u00ad availments are sufficient to therefore dismiss the claim in and of itself.\n[20] Having found him credible I find there is also a nexus to the convention, it clearly goes to a particular social group.\n[21] In terms of state protection I find that state protection has been rebutted in this case because it will not be reasonably forthcoming given that the agent of persecution is the State, it is the police, the undercover authorities and that is well corroborated in the Item 2.1 of the NDP, the U.S. DOS report which states that in fact the government does go online and track homosexuals who on various (inaudible) applications and they prosecute LGBTI persons on charges such as debauchery and violating teachings of religion. There are prison sentences upon conviction of up to 10 years.\n[22] According to a local rights group there have been more than 250 reports of such arrests since 2013 and while there are anti-discrimination laws they are not used to protect the homosexual individuals at all in Egypt and that is all in addition to the societal discrimination, legal discrimination and social stigma that really inhibits homosexuals from organizing and trying to defend their rights in Egypt and it is you know all corroborated.\n[23] There are reports of arrests and harassments of homosexuals in this report, including intimidation and restrictions and basically self-censorship which all corroborates the claimant\u2019s account of basically living as a recluse most of the time in Egypt.\n[24] So, I find that there is no state protection in this case given that the state is the agent of persecution and the objective basis for these fears that are on the record.\n[25] Turing to internal flight alternative, I find that the first prong is not met in this case. There is a serious possibility of persecution I find throughout Egypt. There is no evidence of any particular city such as for example Alexandria or Giza has any more tolerant attitudes towards homosexuals compared to Cairo and there is no evidence that the state is any more tolerant and persecutory against homosexuals in other parts of Egypt, (inaudible) to Cairo which actually the most metropolitan place in the entire country.\n[26] So, I find that internal flight alterative does not exist for the claimant.\n[27] Having considered all the evidence I find that the claimant has a well-founded fear of persecution against Egypt.\n[28] I find that he has established that he has an entitlement to be considered and determined to be a Convention Refugee. I therefore accept his claim for him to be a Convention Refugee based upon a particular social group as a homosexual gay man.\n[29] That is it; thank you very much.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

You allege that you first felt that you were different at the age of 14 while in attendance at a seminary school. You confided in a friend called [XXX], who eventually lead you to connect with a group that tried to assist SOGIE people in Rwanda called Ubumwe. This lead you to meeting [XXX], also a student, with you and you became friends and lovers. You were discovered at school in the dormitory having sex by the headmaster, while the other students were class. This lead to a two week suspension, and your parents were notified. You returned long enough to write your exams to graduate, and then you returned to your hometown, but in a separate house away from the family. You continued to see [XXX]. Your father discovered this and arranged to have you arrested by police, where you were held for a week, and treated with severity. Your elder brother found a way to get you out of jail, and he made arrangements to have you sent to your grandmother\u2019s where you stayed, in hiding. Your grandmother was ill one day and asked you to go to the store where you were spotted by people who knew you, and you fled never returning. Your bother found a safe place for you to stay and helped to make arrangements for you to leave Rwanda.\nDETERMINATION\n[5] I find that you are a Convention refugee as you have established a serious possibility of persecution on account of your member of a particular social group.\nANALYSIS\n[6] The determinative issues in this case are credibility, state protection, and internal flight alternative.\nIdentity\n[7] I find that your identity as a national of Rwanda is established by your testimony and the supporting documentation filed including your passport, national identity card, and a letter from Black Cap Aids Prevention, and the Ubumwe from Rwanda, both of which identify you as a gay man.\nCredibility\n[8] I find you to be a credible witness and therefore believe what you alleged in support of your claim. You provided educational documents and photos of you and your lover [XXX] in Rwanda, and you continue to be active in LGBTQ activities in Toronto.\n[9] You testified in a straightforward manner and, there were no relevant inconsistencies in your testimony or contradictions between your testimony and the other evidence before me.\n[10] The panel also adverts to the principle from Maldonado v. M.E.I [1980] 2.F.C. 302, that when a claimant swears to the truth of certain allegations, this creates a presumption that those allegations are true unless there be reason to doubt their truthfulness.\nState protection\n[11] I find that it would be objectively unreasonable for you to seek the protection of the state in light of your particular circumstances. The objective documents in the National Documentation Package (NDP) for Rwanda, item at 6.1, The Rights of LGBTI People in Rwanda and item 6.2, Situation of sexual minorities, confirm that although homosexuality is not illegal, SOGIE persons are stigmatised and marginalised. The documents report that they are often jailed due to prevailing religious and cultural beliefs. Our research also confirms that in Rwanda, LGBT persons face arbitrary arrest and institutional discrimination, that human rights violations are underreported for fear of further persecution or stigmatisation.\nInternal flight alternative\n[12] I have considered whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for you. On the evidence before me, I find that there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout Rwanda. The country is very small, and the societal beliefs are the same everywhere. The claimant would not be able to continue to express himself freely as homosexual man in Rwanda.\nCONCLUSION\n[13] Based on the analysis above, I conclude that you are a Convention refugee. Accordingly, I accept your claim.\n(signed) Me Dominique Setton\nJuly 23, 2019\n",

He seeks refugee protection against Nigeria pursuant to Sections 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[3] For the following reasons the panel finds the claimant is a Convention refugee and this claim is accepted.\n[4] COUNSEL: Just relax. Like sit back and chill out. Okay.\n[5] MEMBER: Should I \u2026 should I do the rest in writing perhaps?\n[6] COUNSEL: No, you can read it.\n[7] MEMBER: I\u2019m \u2026 I\u2019m just going to keep talking from here.\n[8] This claim was based on the following allegations. The claimant is bisexual. He left Nigeria in [XXX] 2017 when pressure from the community and his family became too much to bear any longer regarding his sexual orientation.\n[9] The claimant arrived in the United States on [XXX], 2017 and thereafter arrived in Canada on [XXX], 2018. The claimant signed his Basis of Claim on September 21st, 2018.\n[10] The panel took into consideration the Chairperson\u2019s guidelines on sexual orientation and gender identity and expression when considering the process of this hearing and \u2026 and assessing the facts of this case.\n[11] The identity of the claimant was established on the basis of his Nigerian passport. The original of which was seized by the Minister.\n[12] The panel\u2019s only significant concern in this claim was his failure to seek protection in the United States. The claimant was an educated and successful businessman. His friends in the United States knew about his sexual orientation. Instead of seeking legal means to remain in the understood he colluded with his friends to engage in a fake marriage of convenience so that he could immigrate there.\n[13] The claimant also explained that he feared the American Government and president who is not welcoming of refugees.\n[14] The panel does not accept these explanations. The United States is a democratic country which upholds the rule of law. They are Convention signatory and maintain a functioning asylum determination system.\n[15] It is simply not credible that the claimant took no steps to secure his own safety and protection in the United States until just before his visa was set to expire. The claimant\u2019s failure to seek protection in the United States does undermine his allegations of subjective fear and the credibility of this claim. Having said that, this concern being the only significant concern in this claim the panel is prepared to give the claimant the benefit of the doubt.\n[16] The claimant is entitled to the presumption that he has been truthful unless there is reason to believe otherwise. While this failure to claim is concerning, the panel cannot say that it undermines the credibility of this claim in its entirety.\n[17] In all of the respects the panel found that the claimant was credible. The claimant spoke about his relationships in Nigeria, both with men and his wife. He spoke about how he lived and how he managed to keep his sexuality hidden from the community.\n[18] The claimant answered difficult questions posed by the panel. And where the panel had concerns about the narrative, those concerns were answered with reasonable and plausible explanations. There were no inconsistencies or embellishments.\n[19] The panel found the claimant\u2019s testimony was compelling and the claimant was amply \u2026 the claim was amply supported by objective documentation including extensive proof that this ordeal has taken a severe toll on the claimant\u2019s mental health.\n[20] These supporting aspects of the claim were not outweighed by his failure to claim in the United States.\n[21] The National Documentation Package for Nigeria supports this claim. The panel has access to reliable sources such as the US DOS report and the UK Home Office report. Each of which are clear about the consequences of same sex relationships in Nigeria. Punishments can include vigilante justice and 14 years in prison, for example.\n[22] Whereas the State is the agent of persecution, the claimant has rebutted the presumption that State protection would be adequate or forthcoming.\n[23] Likewise, there is no location in Nigeria the claimant could go where he would not face a serious possibility of persecution.\n[24] For all these reasons the panel finds this claim is credible. The claimant\u2019s fear is well-founded. The claimant faces a serious possibility of persecution in Nigeria on account of his membership in a particular social group being a bisexual person.\n[25] The claimant is a Convention refugee and this claim is accepted.\n[26] Thank you very much.\n[27] COUNSEL: Thank you.\n[28] MEMBER: Thank you both very much. Thank you, sir, for being here and I know that this was difficult for you. Go home and get some sleep.\n[29] CLAIMANT: Thank you so much.\n[30] MEMBER: Thank you very much.

You will be provided with a transcript of my decision which I reserve the right to edit.\n[2] The claimant [XXX] claim is a citizen of India who seeks refugee protection pursuant to Sections 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[3] As I stated I\u2019ve not only considered your testimony and the other evidence before me I\u2019ve also considered the chair person\u2019s guideline 9 with regards to the proceedings before the Immigration and Refugee board involving sexual orientation and gender identity and expression.\n[4] I\u2019ve also considered the information on the situation in your country of origin India found in the boards national documentation package as well as in the information provided by counsel in Exhibit 5.\n[5] The details of the allegation on which you relying can be found in your basis of claim form Exhibit 2.

The claimant hails from a high cast family in India and social standing is important.\n[6] Growing up the claimant experienced homophobia from his family and society. He wrote in his narrative and testified about the fact that he was constantly bullied. He also wrote about the fact that he was admonished for being too feminine. His family denied his sexuality, they tried to change the way he walked and talked, limited his hand jesters and he also expressed that his father still thinks there\u2019s something wrong with him mentally and physically.\n[7] The claimant was also verbally, physically and sexually abused and harassed since a young age because of his sexual orientation.\n[8] On [XXX] 2015 the claimant came to Canada to study at the [XXX]. He has not returned to India since that time.\n[9] In 2016 the claimant met a man with whom he had a relationship and eventually married. The relationship later broke down but during that relationship the claimant developed the courage to come out to his parents about his sexual orientation. They threatened to cut him off financially and eventually did which prevented the claimant from pursuing his studies.\n[10] In 2018 the claimant learned from a friend about the refugee protection process and filed a refugee claim at the end of September 2018.\n[11] On the basis of your membership in a particular social group that is your status as a gay man. The panel finds that you have established that you face a serious possibility of persecution for convention ground pursuant to Section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[12] I find that the treatment that you experienced as a gay man in India including family rejection, harassment and social ostracism cumulatively amounts to persecution.\n[13] In terms of your personal identity I find on a balance of probabilities that you are a national of India, this was established by your sworn testimony and a certified copy of your passport issued by the Republic of India found in Exhibit 1.\n[14] In regards to your sexual orientation I find that you have established your profile as a gay man. You gave extremely credible testimony regarding this. I believe your story regarding your experiences in India with your family and with society in general. You testified in a straightforward manner, you answered questions without exaggeration or embellishment and your oral testimony was consistent with the allegations provided in your basis of claim form narrative and consistent with the information on the situation in your country of origin.\n[15] In regards to subjective fear I do note that there was a delay in claiming is somewhat lengthy delay considering that you came to Canada in 2015 and only filed your claim in 2018. I do note however that you had a valid student permit at the time that you filed your claim and you did provide an explanation for the delay which I accept and so I draw no negative inference.\n[16] In regards to the objective basis for your fear Item 2.1 of the national documentation package for India the latest version dated March 2019 indicates that lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons faced physical attacks, rape and blackmailing in India. LGBTI groups reported they face widespread social discrimination and violence and that in fact some police committed crimes against LGBTI persons and use the threat of arrest to coerce victims not to report the incidents. This is consistent with the information found in Item 6.1 of the national documentation package as well as the information provided by your counsel in Exhibit 5.\n[17] I do note that consistent with the information provided in September of 2018 same sex sexual acts were decriminalized in India, however neither same sex marriages nor civil unions are recognized in the country.\n[18] 6.1 states that in spite of the fact that same sex relations have been decriminalized there\u2019s still a need for acceptance, many people still have the mentality that homosexuality is wrong. The change in law does not mean that people in the LGBTI community are starting to disclose their sexuality especially to their parents because this is still a problem in India.\n[19] In regards to the fact that violence and discrimination exist it indicates that in spite of the fact that decriminalization has taken place of same sex relations some sexual and gender minorities still face violence and harassment in India. This is also consistent as I said with the information provided by your counsel in Exhibit 5 and its also consistent very much with your evidence as to what you believe would happen to you in spite of the fact that same sex relations have now been decriminalized in India.\n[20] I conclude based on my review of the documentary evidence that your fear of persecution in India due to your sexual orientation has an objective basis.\n[21] In regards to whether or not you would receive adequate state protection I take into consideration Guideline 9 which says that even though there have been small steps in the law it doesn\u2019t mean that you would have adequate state protection in your country of origin. In fact Item 2.1 yes indicates that even though activists welcomed the verdict in of September 2018 they believe it is still too early to determine how the verdict would translate into social acceptance or into safe and equal opportunities for LGBTI persons.\n[22] Also Item 6.1 indicates that a report from 2017 states that obstacles for justice (ph) for sexual minorities in India is still an issue because of the attitude and behaviour of the police, viewed as one of the biggest barriers to LGBTI persons accessing justice in India. It indicates that there is violence, abuse and harassment suffered at the hands of the police in India and that in several cases the police have refused to file complaints submitted by members of the LGBTI community due to bias or stereotypes.\n[23] This is also consistent as I stated before with Item 2.1 which indicates that some police committed crimes against LGBTI persons and used the threat of arrest to coerce victims not to report the incidents.\n[24] Based on my review of the documentary evidence I find that adequate state protection would not be reasonably forthcoming to you in India and that you have rebutted the presumption of state protection. Likewise I\u2019ve considered the documentary evidence when looking at internal flight alternative.\n[25] I\u2019ve also considered your own testimony where you expressed that as someone who\u2019s not considered the standard heterosexual male and as someone who bend the gender quite often and in the manner in which you express yourself you would not be accepted in Indian society and so I\u2019ve taken that into consideration and I find that you have no viable internal flight alternative that you would not be safe in any area of the country because you would not be able to live openly as a gay man without fear of harassment and violence.\n[26] So in conclusion I find that you have established the presence of subjective fear, that you do have an objective basis of that fear, that you face a serious possibility of persecution in India. I therefore accept your claim pursuant to Section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. Good luck to you.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

The file number is TB8-24140.\nCLAIMANT\n[2] The claimant asked the Member for letting her sister into le hearing room\nMEMBER:\n[3] Yes, absolutely. The counsel\u2019s going st- ask your sister to come in.\nCLAIMANT:\n[4] Thank you.\n[5] MEMBER: She can be the support person for you. I know it\u2019s a, it\u2019s a big day and it\u2019s a big decision.\n[6] So, you are claiming to be a citizen of Barbados and are claiming refugee protection pursuant to Sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).\n[7] I\u2019ve considered your testimony and the other evidence in your claim. And I\u2019m giving you my decision orally. And that is to accept your claim. In assessing your claim, I have applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guidelines. Guideline 9 on sexual orientation and gender identity and expression. I find that you are a convention refugee pursuant to Section 96 of the Act on the grounds of your membership in a particular social group as a bi-sexual woman. I find that you would face a serious possibility of persecution in the future if you returned to Barbados.\n[8] Your allegations are set out in detail in your Basis of Claim form. In summary you allege a fear of acts of violence, harassment and hostility as well as pervasive discrimination from the community because of your sexual orientation in, as a bi-sexual woman in the Bahamas, I\u2019m sorry, in Barbados. You allege that if you return to Barbados, you will face stigma, social exclusion and discrimination in many aspects of life and from the community. And this would include verbal insults and possible physical violence. That you could not live openly and freely as a bi-sexual woman in Barbados without experiencing this kind of harassment threats and discrimination.\n[9] You allege that the state authorities such as the police are also homophobic and could not be depended upon to offer you protection in situations where you may be threatened with or experience violence on account of your sexual orientation. And you say that there\u2019s no safe place for you to live anywhere in Barbados.\n[10] Your identity. I find that your personal and national identity as a citizen of Barbados has been established on a balance of probabilities by your testimony as well as the supporting documentation filed in Exhibit I. Mainly the certified true copy of your Barbadian passport that was seized by the Immigration Refugee Citizenship Canada officers, when you started your refugee claim.\n[11] The nexus in this case, the link between what you fear and the refugee convention is your membership in a particular social group as a bi-sexual woman. Therefore, I\u2019ve accessed, assessed your claim under Section 96.\n[12] Moving on to your credibility. In terms of your general credibility, I found you to be a credible witness. Your testimony was straight forward and consistent with your Basis of Claim form and other forms. And there were no inconsistencies or omissions that were relevant or went to the core of your claim. You provided spontaneous details of how you came to understand that you were attracted to women. And that you are, and that you came to the understanding that you were bi-sexual. You also provided details of your past same sex relationships and the discriminatory and threatening incidents that you experienced m Barbados. These were details that I would expect of someone who had lived the experiences described.\n[13] For someone as yourself who has grown up in a society such as Barbados wh-,which is the country evidence tells us that being on the LGBT spectrum there is treated with scorn and ridicule and given the strong influence of religion in a small country, being LGBT is often viewed as being sinful. I found your testimony to be credible. You testified without any obvious embellishment and in a fluid immediate way. You also provided corroborating documentation about your sexual orientation. Letters from your friends who knew of your sexual orientation at this moment now in Canada as well as tho-, as well as those who knew you in Barbados as being bi-sexual and for having experienced problems there because of it.\n[14] You also provided, provided letters from your sisters, one sister in Canada who identifies as a lesbian and whose refugee claim was accepted in 2014. And a letter from a sister in Barbados who provided details about your family situation and learning about your sexual orientation and how she has seen the change in you on her visit to Canada. And she\u2019s noted that you were no longer having to hide who you are. And she sees you now as someone who is confident and comfortable with herself.\n[15] You also provided a letter from the youth resource worker at Supporting Our Youth, S-O-Y, SOY that provides the Black Queer Youth program, which you are attending. You also provided photographs of you with past girlfriends in Barbados and you spoke knowledgably and credibly about the circumstances of these photos and your feelings for these women. How it was when you dated them and why you broke up with them.\n[16] You responded with reasonable explanations and plausible details to my questions for you about these corroborating documents. And as I\u2019ve mentioned these documents go to the core aspects of your claim namely your identification as a bi-sexual woman and the fact that you\u2019ve lived in and been in same sex relationships in the past.\n[17] Your sister [XXX] was here and she is here and was willing to testify as a witness on your behalf. However, given your credible testimony and other corroborating evidence, I did not, I determined I didn\u2019t need to hear from her, as I found that you\u2019ve established your core allegations on a balance of probabilities.\n[18] I believe you, that you\u2019ve been attracted to both men and women in the past. And you\u2019ve had intimate relationships with both. I believe that the incident that, what you\u2019ve described as incidents of past harassment, threatened violence and discrimination and you\u2019ve experienced that due to your bi-sexuality and the perception of others in the Barbadian community that you are a bi-sexual.\n[19] You testified that you would like to, bl-, live openly and freely and be free to date both men and women in the future. And that for you it depends on the personality of the person that you meet. Therefore, I find you\u2019ve established your core allegations of being a bi-sexual woman and fearing persecution in the future in Barbados.\n[20] Moving to subjective fear. I\u2019ve considered that and I find that you\u2019ve established that you\u2019re subjectively fearful of returning to Barbados. Prior to your recent arrival in Canada on [XXX] 2018 and claiming refugee status shortly thereafter, you visited Canada in [XXX] 2017 for approximately 2-3 weeks. And you had came, you came on that trip with your mother, sister and your sister\u2019s friend to visit your sister in Canada, [XXX]. Who now resides here since her refugee claim was accepted in 2014. And then you returned to Barbados on [XXX], 2017.\n[21] I asked you why you returned to Barbados at that time, knowing how you\u2019d had to live there hiding your sexual orientation and knowing how society treated people who were on the LGBT spectrum. And why you didn\u2019t make a refugee claim in Canada when you were here for that first time. You responded that you had travelled with your mother and she was very controlling, protective and strict. You didn\u2019t want to upset her by staying in Canada and you believed that she would possibly blame your sister here, if you remained in Canada.\n[22] You described that your sister\u2019s relationship with your mother was already fairly fragile due to your mother learning that she was a lesbian. And you didn\u2019t want to come out to your mother as you knew that she had already suspected you were gay and had said in the past that she couldn\u2019t deal with having two gay children. This testimony, testimony was consistent with your Basis of Claim form.\n[23] You testified that you went back to Barbados at that time and then you actually slipped into depression again and you didn\u2019t feel like you were supposed to be living there anymore. You dated a man who was physically violent with you, when he learned that you had dated girls in high school and had been outed by classmates for being gay. He told you that he didn\u2019t want to be known as a guy who dated a girl who had dated girls. You spoke with your sister in the spring of 2018 and she encouraged you to come to Canada to be safe and free and make a refugee claim. She offered her financial support for you to make the journey and have a place to stay here. So, you came here in [XXX] 2018 and shortly, and shortly thereafter made your refugee claim.\n[24] I have found your cresti-, testimony to be credible and you returned for, to Barbados from your first visit to Canada before your subsequent return back to Canada to file your refugee claim has been reasonably explained. Therefore, I find you have a subjective, a well-founded subjective fear of persecution in Barbados.\n[25] Moving to the objective basis of your risk of persecution. According to the documentary evidence in the National Documentation Package, Exhibit 3, LGBT persons in Barbados face widespread and social stigma, bullying, discrimination, harassment and at times violence. Particularly within their own families. The Item 2.1 is the United States Depart of States report on human rights practices in Barbados. And for the year 2018, it notes that the law criminalizes consensual same sexual activity in Barbados between adults with penalties up to life imprisonment. And there were not reports though of the law being enforced during the year.\n[26] The law in Barbados does not prohibit discrimination against a person based on real or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity in areas such as employment, housing, education or health care. Civil society groups reported that LGBT persons faced discrimination in these areas in Barbados and that police disapproval and societal discrimination against LGBT persons made them more vulnerable to threats, crime and destruction of property.\n[27] Now, the Federal Court has held and it\u2019s set out in the SOGIE guidelines, in particular, paragraph 8.5.1.1, that being forced to conceal ones sexual orientation to avoid harm is, is itself persecutory as it constitutes a serious interference with a fundamental human right. Many LGBT persons in Barbados are unfortunately forced to conceal their sexual orientation to avoid societal discrimination, widested-, widespread stigma, bullying and harassment, as well at times violence. I find that you would, you, that if you were forced to do this as well, that such expectation interferes with your fundamental human rights. Therefore, I find your allegations to be objectively well-founded.\n[28] Moving to state protection. I find that you have rebutted the presumption of state protection with clear and convincing evidence, that adequate state protection would not be available to you were you to seek it in Barbados. You testified that in your view, based on what you had heard in the media and from others in the community that the police were very homophobic in Barbados and that they have a reputation for turning a blind eye when gay people need help.\n[29] The objective documentary evidence in our National Documentation Package at Item 6.1 a response to information request. Indicates that most members of the LGBT community do not report matters to the police out of fear of negative repercussions or facing ridicule and that LGBT individuals in Barbados have faced condemnation by police officers. And a UN report from 6 years ago as noted in that RIR, response to information request from 2012, noting that police were denounced as discriminatory by, in this UN report, in their treatment of victims who are from the LGBT community. In Barbados as I\u2019ve already noted, same sex relations continue to be criminalized and while not prosecutions appear to have occurred under the law for quite a number of years, I find that having such a law further legitim- legitimizes discriminatory and oppressive treatment towards LGBT individuals.\n[30] Also, there\u2019s some documentary evidence that indicates the state of Barbados does not have laws in place that prohibit this, that prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. That\u2019s found in Item 2.1, page 9, as well as Item 6.2 a report entitled Criminalization of Homosexuality a report from March 2019 page 4. It is reported that it is common for LGBT persons to face discrimination in housing and employment. Therefore, I find the state fuels and allows discrimination to be accepted by such laws that criminalizes same sex, she-, same sex activity as well not having laws in place to prohibit discrimination on the basis of one\u2019s sexual orientation.\n[31] Your experiences in Barbados are consistent with this evidence. You faced homophobic remarks from a past, past employer and also bullying and threatening behaviour from other students while attending school. You felt you could not go to the school administration because you were fearful they would tell your parents but also because the school admiss-, administration you did not feel would, would offer you any assistance. This is found in the documentary evidence that there\u2019s no human rights or anti-discrimin-, discrimination laws or processes in place that you could have turned to. You felt demeaned and that you had to hide who you were to be safe and not face harm.\n[32] In light of this evidence, I find you\u2019ve rebutted the presumption of state protection based on your personal circumstances as well as the objective country documentation. I find that adequate state protection would not be available to you in Barbados. I\u2019ve considered whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for you in Barbados. Barbados is a very small country and there\u2019s no evidence that the societal, discriminatory and homophobic attitudes are localized or that there would be any place where you could live openly and safely as a bisexual woman without experiencing such discrimination.\n[33] You testified about the problems you face and that moreover that the law criminalizing same sex relations is one that applies to the entire country. And it\u2019s a way that the state as I\u2019ve said perpetuates the stigma and hostility of the public towards LGBT individuals. I therefore find that there\u2019s no viable internal flight alternative to you in Barbados.\nCONCLUSION\n[34] So, in conclusion and based on the totality of the evidence, I conclude that you are a Convention refugee pursuant to Section 96 if the Act and I therefore, accept your claim.\n[35] CLAIMANT: Thank you\n[36] MEMBER: Thank you. We are concluded.\n",

I find that you are a Convention refugee.\n[4] You are claiming to be a citizen of Algeria and you are claiming refugee protection under s. 96 and s. 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[5] You allege that you are a citizen of Algeria. You allege a fear of persecution in Algeria based on your sexual orientation. You identify as bisexual. In your words, you say that you identify as a man who has sex with men. You also alleged a fear of persecution because you do not believe in anything. You do not believe in Islam. And this puts you at risk in Algeria. You allege that if you return, the State or the police will not protect you because you are not a believer in Islam and you will not be protected because of your sexual orientation. You fear the police and the members of the public in general.\n[6] In terms of identity, I find your personal identity as a citizen of Algeria has been established by your testimony and your Algerian passport. I have a certified copy in Exhibit 1. So, I considered those, the documents, the passport and your testimony, and I find, on a balance of probabilities, that your personal identity and your national identity have been established and the country of reference has also been established as being Algeria.\n[7] I assessed your \u2013 the credibility also and I find that your testimony was straightforward and it was in keeping with the information in your basis of claim and there were no significant inconsistencies or omissions that went to the core of your claim. In general, I have found you to be a credible witness. So, therefore I accept what you have alleged in your oral testimony and in your Basis of Claim. The Basis of Claim is in Exhibit 2.\n[8] In support of your claim, you provided documentary evidence, confirming that some of your family members are aware of your sexual orientation and that you have discussed your sexual orientation with your doctor in Canada, that you have been attending [XXX]. And that\u2019s who you identify as, a bisexual man or a man who likes to have sex with men.\n[9] These documents have been entered as exhibits in Exhibits 6 and 7. I note your brother [XXX] (ph.) wrote a letter saying that he knows about your sexual orientation, and [XXX] (ph.) from [XXX] wrote a letter confirming that you have been attending programmes at [XXX], an LGBTQ organisation in Toronto. And Julia tell us in her letter that you have shared your experiences as a bisexual man in Algeria with her and you have shared your experiences with the group at [XXX].\n[10] You have provided photograph of your current boyfriend in Canada and you have provided proof that you are active on dating sites. You showed me your profile on Bazoo, and I was able to verify, to confirm, your relationship with the person you showed me on pictures.\n[11] I note that I was concerned by the fact that you did not bring your boyfriend as a witness or I have not received any support letter from him. You explained that your relationship, although it is a romantic relationship, it\u2019s still new and you were shy to ask.\n[12] So, after listening to your testimony, I find that your testimony and the documentary evidence establish, on a balance of probabilities, that you are a man who have [sic] sex with other men. So, I accept what you have alleged in your Basis of Claim.\n[13] I note that your claim was based on religious beliefs and sexual orientation. I assessed the aspect of sexual orientation; and as it disposes of your claim, I will not address the religious aspect in my decision.\n[14] So, I find that there is a link between what you fear and one of the five Convention grounds, specifically membership in a particular social group, gay men in Algeria.\n[15] I verified the objective evidence to see if your subjective fear was founded and I noted that the objective documentation supports your allegations, that individuals in your circumstances face persecution and discrimination in Algeria and they are subjected to violence, are shamed, and they risk to be arrested and sent to prison.\n[16] In the National Documentation Package in Exhibit 3, the National Package for Algeria, Document 6.1, it says that homosexual activities are criminalised. It says that Algeria has been rejecting recommendation to eliminate discrimination against LGBTQ community. And the same document and Document 2.1, the DoS Report for 2017-2018, this reports (inaudible) that people continue to be arrested for engaging in same-sex sexual activities. LGBTQ people suffer abuses from the police and they are discriminated against in health and employment. And Document 6.2, Response to Information Request, contains similar information, same information as in Documents 6.1 and 2.1 that same-sex activities are criminalised.\n[17] I note that your counsel has provided some evidence in Exhibit 5 and some articles were published in 2019 and they talk about LGBTQ people who were killed in Algeria.\n[18] So, I considered this objective evidence in conjunction with your allegations that I find to be credible and I find that the fear you expressed has an objective basis.\n[19] Therefore, I find that you have a well-founded fear of persecution.\n[20] I looked at State protection and I find that State protection would not be available to you, were you to seek it Algeria.\n[21] I refer to the objective documentary evidence, Document 6.2, the Response to Information Request. It contains information that victims, homosexual victims never report homophobic violence, as they are afraid of Algerian authorities. That was said by somebody who said \u201cnever.\u201d But it says that acts of violence are not reported due to fear of the laws. And the same Response to Information Request contains information of incidents where people were caught and charged and were sentenced, were sentenced to spend time in jail and were fined. For instance, one was required to pay 20,000 dinars. And the same Response of Information [sic], talks about two young men, homosexual, who posted their relationship on Facebook and they were arrested and were sent to pre-trial detention.\n[22] So, and I find that as the State, the Government of Algeria and the police (inaudible) as homosexual sexual activities are criminalised in Algeria, it would not be reasonable for you to seek protection from the police or from any other authority.\n[23] So, in light of the objective country documentary [sic], I find that you have rebutted the presumption of State protection. And based on your personal circumstances as well as the objective documentation, I find that adequate State protection will not be available to you in Algeria.\n[24] I have also considered whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for you in Algeria. note that the country documentation indicates that the situation for individuals in your circumstances is the same throughout the country. The country documentation indicates that the attitude towards LGBTQ in Algeria is the same throughout Algeria; and SOGIT, the Guideline 9, paragraph 8.7.1 states that it is established in law that an internal flight alternative is not viable if an individual with a diverse sexual orientation or gender identity must hide their sexual orientation in order to live in that location.\n[25] So, I therefore find that you face serious possibility of persecution throughout Algeria based on your sexual orientation; and, as such, I find there is no viable internal flight alternative for you in Algeria.\n[26] So, having considered the totality of the evidence before me, I find you to be a Convention refugee. You have established that there is a serious possibility of persecution, based on your sexual orientation, if you were to return to Algeria.\n[27] I accept your claim.\nDECISION CONCLUDED\n",

I find that you both would face a serious possibility of persecution in the future if returned to the Dominican Republic. I\u2019m accepting your claims.\n[3] The detailed allegations are set out in the Basis of Claim which are at Exhibits 2 and 3. You are both citizens of the Dominican Republic and claim that you fear persecution your country of nationality because of your identity as a gay and bisexual man respectively. Both of you describe how you would not be able to live openly as a couple in the Dominican Republic and that you could be subjected to discrimination or violence because of your sexual orientation. You have each described your own experiences of past violence and discrimination in the Dominican Republic, as well both of you in your Basis of Claim forms described how the police were unresponsive and negative towards you when you attempted to report a robbery and sexual assault.\n[4] Both of you were subject to verbal abuse when others perceived you as a couple out in public. Mr. [XXX] claim form and testimony documented verbal and physical abuse by his family when he exhibited what they deemed as non-masculine behaviors. As well after he was sexually assaulted the police were unwilling to investigate this. Mr. [XXX] claim from and testimony documented that he was sexually abused by his brother from aged 10 to 14 after his brother suspected he may be gay. His brother threatened to tell his family and gang members about his sexual orientation if he told anyone what he was doing to him. As well his employment was in jeopardy due to his sexual orientation. It was also shown that he could lose custody and access to his son if his sexual orientation was made public. You both allege there is no state protection for you or an internal flight alternative. Both claimants explained how homophobia is prevalent all-over Dominican Republic and the police, rather institutions do not have, do not offer any protection to gays or bisexuals.\n[5] Both your personal identities as citizens of the Dominican Republic have been established by your testimony and copies of your passports in Exhibit 1.\n[6] In terms of your general credibility, I have found you both to be credible witnesses. I accept each of your allegations on a balance of probabilities as you both have provided credible testimony as well as documentary evidence in support of your claim. You each spoke about the allegations in your claim, including your sexual orientations, the discrimination and violence you each faced in your country and around your decision to leave. Both your testimony was detailed, spontaneous, and consistent with your other evidence. I have no reason to doubt the genuineness of your claims. Importantly, you also provided several probative documents such as copies of support le-, letters corroborating your allegations. You also provided a police report corroborating the incident of the robbery and as noted the police did not include the sexual assault which you attempted to report. I also have numerous photographs depicting your relationship, vacations together and your time in Canada.\n[7] On the subject of Mr. [XXX] re-availment, I note it was only for eight months. He explained how he was desperate to go back to find a way for both himself and Mr. [XXX] to come to Canada together. He explained that when he was first in Canada he did not realize he could claim refugee status on the basis of sexual orientation and he only determined that when he was back in the Dominican Republic. After speaking with someone, a friend he made in Canada when he was here. He further explained that after being back in the Dominican Republic and ex-, and experiencing additional harassment based on their sexual orientation the decision was made for him to go back to Canada and claim refugee status. While he and Mr. [XXX] would find a way to get him to Canada. It\u2019s important to consider the context here, fear, depression and a lack of knowledge that he could\u2019ve claimed his refugee status when he was first here. And I do not believe that it would be reasonable to infer that your return indicates a lack of subjective fear. I find that you both, that both of your subjective fears been established by the credible testimony and documentary evidence. And I believe what you both have alleged on a balance of probabilities.\nState Protection\n[8] Having both, having accepted both of your allegations I have assessed these allegations against the country conditions evidence that we have on the Dominican Republic to determine whether each of you had faced a serious possibility of persecution and whether state protection will be available to you. I have considered Item 6.1, 6.4, and 2.1 of the Na-, National Documentation Package for the Dominican Republic which is at Exhibit 4. As well, your counsel has provided multiple documents and newspaper reports. To summarize, the evidence indicates that LGBT individuals often face intimidation and harassment in the Dominican Republic both from authorities and society. There were reports of violence against LGBT individuals including gay and bisexual men. People were reluctant to file official complaints due to fear of reprisals or humiliation.\n[9] It is noted that a report cited in Item 6.1 also indicates that the LGBT community experiences difficulty when trying to access the justice system and the police sometimes do not provide them with assistance. Moreover, discrimination is persa-, pervasive and affects LGBT people in the context of employment in the workplace and educational settings and healthcare settings. I find that you would not be able to live your lives freely and you would not be able to maintain a relationship in an open manner without risking harm or discrimination. You would face a risk of violence, harassment or discrimination by private actors, or even the police and I\u2019ve considered that some of this has already occurred to you in the past. I find that the evidence establishes that you would each face a serious possibility of persecution due to you sexual orientation and the evidence is sufficient to also rebut the presumption of state protection. Finally given that the situation would be generally consistent throughout the Dominican Republic there would be no internal flight alternative available to either of you.\n[10] I therefore determine that each of you has a well-founded fear of persecution on the basis of your membership in a particular social group and that you are both Convention refugees pursuant to Section 96 of the Immigration Refugee Protection Act. Your claims are therefore accepted.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2019 RLLR 133\n\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\n\nDate of Decision: October 15, 2019\n\nPanel: Avril Cardoso\n\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Said Assiani\n\nCountry: Ghana\n\nRPD Number: TB8-19083\n\nATIP Number: A-2021-00256\n\nATIP Pages: 000087-000098\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] The claimant alleges he is a citizen of Ghana and is claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration Refugee Protection Act (IRPA)1.\nDETERMINATION\n[2] I find that the claimant has established a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground, namely his sexual orientation as a gay man.\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] The claimant\u2019s allegations are set out in his Basis of Claim form (BOC). He alleges that he is a citizen of Ghana and fears persecution at the hands of society and the state in his home country because he is a gay man.\nANALYSIS\n[4] The main issues in this case are 1E exclusion and credibility including failure to claim in the United States.\n[5] In deciding this claim, I considered Guideline 92. The purpose of Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9 is to promote greater understanding of cases involving sexual orientation and gender identity and expression (SOGIE) and the harm individuals may face due to their non-conformity with socially-accepted SOGIE norms. This Guideline addresses the particular challenges individuals with diverse SOGIE may face in presenting their cases before the Board and I was mindful of these issues in coming to a decision in this claim.\n[6] I also considered all of the evidence including the oral testimony and documentary evidence entered as exhibits.\nIdentity\n[7] The personal and national identity of the claimant is established on a balance of probabilities through the certified true copy of his Ghanaian passport3 and testimony.\n1E Exclusion\n[8] Section 98 of IRPA provides that a person referred to in section E or F of Article 1 of the Refugee Convention is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection.\n[9] Article 1E specifies that the Convention shall not apply to a person who is recognized by the competent authorities of the country in which he has taken residence as having the rights and obligations which are attached to the possession of the nationality of that country.\n[10] The Federal Court of Appeal in Zeng4 articulated the legal test that must be applied when deciding whether Article 1E applies. All relevant factors to the date of the hearing should be considered to determine whether a claimant has status substantially similar to that of its nationals in the third country. If the answer is yes, the claimant is excluded. If the answer is no, the next question is whether the claimant previously had such status and lost it, or had access to such status and failed to acquire it. If the answer is no, the claimant is not excluded. If the answer is yes, the RPD must consider and balance various factors. Such factors include but are not limited to the reason for the loss of status, whether the claimant could return to the third country, the risk the claimant would face in the home country, Canada\u2019s international obligations, and any other relevant facts.\nThe claimant is not excluded based on his residence in the United States\n[11] The claimant entered the United States (U.S.) on [XXX], 2009 on a U.S. Fianc\u00e9 Visa which was issued on February 19, 2009 with an expiry date of August 3, 20095. The claimant testified that his fianc\u00e9e was murdered on [XXX], 2009 prior to their intended marriage on March 20th, 2009.\n[12] The claimant testified that he subsequently married another U.S. national, [XXX] on [XXX], 2014.\n[13] The claimant testified that his spouse applied for a green card for him on April 25, 2015 but it was denied. He testified that his lawyer told him he would have to return to Ghana and his wife could then apply to sponsor him. He testified that he refused to return to Ghana because he feared for his life.\n[14] The claimant testified that he was able to obtain a U.S. work permit in 2015 as well as a driver\u2019s licence through his wife. He said the work permit expired in 2017 and the renewal was refused as he was informed he must return to Ghana.\n[15] The claimant testified that he has been divorced from his wife in the U.S. for about five months.\n[16] I find that the claimant does not have status substantially similar to nationals in the U.S. as of the date of hearing. The claimant\u2019s temporary status in the U.S. based on the Fianc\u00e9 Visa expired as of August 3, 20096. The claimant\u2019s application to adjust his immigration status in the U.S. was denied in a decision dated January 22, 2016 from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security7. The claimant\u2019s attempt to renew his work permit was refused. The U.S. biometrics report indicates that the claimant was issued an EAD Combo Card8. The country documentation for the United States indicates that an EAD (Employment Authorization Document) grants employment authorization to individuals along with an order of supervision for persons who have been ordered to be deported or removed from the U.S.9. This document also indicates that conditions may include periodic meetings with immigration officials, obtaining travel approval and providing written notice of change of address and confirms that work authorizations for persons under an order of supervision must be renewed annually. This evidence cumulatively demonstrates that the claimant did not have status in the U.S. substantially similar to that of its nationals. He was to be deported and no longer had the ability to work since his work permit renewal was denied.\n[17] I also find that the claimant did not previously have status in the U.S. substantially similar to that of its nationals for the reasons set out above. The U.S. country documentation with regard to the ability of a U.S. citizen to sponsor a foreign spouse who is under an order of supervision or deportation is scarce10. However, this document indicates that an application for a green card may be made through an adjustment of status application and that a petition to re-open deportation proceedings may not be approved until the alien has resided outside the United States for a 2-year period beginning after the date of marriage11. The evidence demonstrates that the claimant did make an application for an adjustment of his status which was denied. His testimony that he was advised that a sponsorship application could be commenced after he returned to his home country is consistent with the U.S. country documentation.\n[18] In conclusion, the claimant is not excluded pursuant to section 98.\nCredibility\n[19] When a claimant swears that certain facts are true, this creates a presumption that they are true unless there is valid reason to doubt their veracity.\n[20] I find the claimant to be credible on a balance of probabilities.\nThe claimant\u2019s sexual orientation in Ghana\n[21] The claimant testified that when he was about twelve years old, he felt attracted to boys. He testified that he tried to hide these feelings on the outside but inside he felt he could not control his desires. The claimant testified that in Ghana, boys are expected to like girls.\n[22] The claimant testified that two of his maternal uncles were gay and he witnessed one of his uncles stoned to death when he was fifteen years old. The claimant testified that people in his village believed that his mother\u2019s family was cursed because his uncles were homosexual and he demonstrated similar tendencies. He said he was sent to a herbalist, made to wear a necklace and sent to the church pastor all in attempts to \u201ccure\u201d him from his feelings toward men\/boys.\n[23] In the claimant\u2019s BOC12, he states that to avoid suspicion that he was gay, he began a relationship with [XXX] in 2001 and that the community perception of his sexual orientation improved after he had a child with [XXX] in August 2002.\n[24] The claimant testified about a same sex relationship with [XXX], a young man he met. He testified that they met in 2002 or 2003 for sexual encounters at the home he was sharing with [XXX]. The claimant described his recollection of [XXX] and said that he was nice and he remembered [XXX] dimples when he smiled. He was also able to provide details about [XXX] siblings and described him as being patient. The claimant testified that [XXX] discovered him with [XXX] during an intimate encounter and the relationship with [XXX] ended. He testified that he left the village and went to Accra, a large city because he was afraid of being punished if his relationship with [XXX] was discovered in his home town.\n[25] I find the claimant\u2019s testimony regarding his bisexual relationships in Ghana to be credible. His testimony was straight-forward, spontaneous and detailed and was generally consistent in both his BOC narratives. The claimant was tearful during the hearing as he described his experiences related to his sexual orientation and his efforts to conceal his true feelings.\nBOC omission\n[26] The claimant submitted a BOC dated August 20, 201813. He then submitted an amended narrative dated September 19, 201914.\n[27] When asked why the original BOC narrative did not set out all the details, he testified that at the time the first BOC was completed, his state of mind was impaired. He testified about being detained after crossing the border into Canada and said he was given 10 days to complete the BOC. The claimant testified that he believed he attempted self harm and said he could not remember clearly but recollected that he had a belt around his neck and then saw two guards standing beside him. The claimant\u2019s counsel submitted that there were no material inconsistencies between the narratives and the amended narrative only provided more details about the claimant\u2019s sexual orientation.\n[28] I find the claimant\u2019s explanation credible. I agree with counsel that the amended BOC provides more detail about the claimant\u2019s personal history and is consistent with the first BOC. As well, I accept the claimant\u2019s testimony that he was detained and that his state of mind and the short timeframe to complete the BOC would more likely than not affect his ability to provide all the details about his sexual orientation. Despite noting that the claimant had the assistance of counsel at that time, I find the claimant\u2019s explanation reasonable in these circumstances.\nThe claimant\u2019s delay in leaving Ghana is not determinative\n[29] Based on the claimant\u2019s evidence, he left his home village in [XXX] 2004 and was working in Accra until [XXX], 2009 when he obtained his U.S. Fianc\u00e9 Visa and was able to leave Ghana.\n[30] The claimant testified that he was struggling to make ends meet in Accra and worked as a [XXX]. He said he grew his hair long to try to conceal his identity because he feared being recognized by people he knew in his village and worried that his relationship with [XXX] would become known. He said being an openly gay man is illegal in Ghana.\n[31] I find that the claimant\u2019s explanation for the delay in leaving Ghana is reasonable. I accept his evidence that his fianc\u00e9e paid for his air fare and he did not have the means to leave. As well, his actions in leaving his home village and relocating to a larger urban area are indicative of subjective fear.\nFailure to claim in the United States\n[32] The claimant testified that he left Ghana on [XXX] 2009 to marry [XXX] who he met when he was working as a [XXX] in Accra. He testified that XXXX was murdered on [XXX] 2009 a day before their wedding. The claimant testified that he did not tell [XXX] about his bisexual feelings at that time because he did not want to break her trust as she was very kind to him.\n[33] The claimant testified he then began a relationship with [XXX] and they married on [XXX] 2014. He testified that he was alone in the United States and relied on [XXX] for support and repressed his feelings toward men as he did not want to hurt her.\n[34] The claimant testified that in July 2018 he discovered that the two children he had with [XXX] were not his own and that she had been seeing another person. This other person threatened the claimant that if he did not leave, there would be problems since he did not have status in the U.S. According to the claimant\u2019s BOC, he went to a gay bar and had a brief relationship with [XXX]. The claimant testified that he came to Canada because he had no legal status to remain in the U.S., suffered the loss of his fianc\u00e9e and effectively the loss of two daughters who he thought were biologically his own. He testified that he feared returning to Ghana because he no longer wanted to repress his feelings toward men and gay men are not permitted to live openly in Ghana.\n[35] I find the claimant\u2019s testimony regarding his failure to claim in the third country (U.S.) credible. I accept the claimant\u2019s explanation for not making a claim in the United States as reasonable in the circumstances he found himself in.\n[36] In making this finding, I am taking into account the SOGIE guideline. As stated in the guideline, individuals with diverse SOGIE recognize and act on their SOGIE differently. Furthermore, an individual\u2019s self-awareness and self-acceptance of their SOGIE may present as a gradual or non-linear process. As such, there is not standard set of criteria that can be relied upon to establish an individual\u2019s identification with a particular SOGIE.\n[37] With regard to the failure to claim asylum in the U.S. after his fianc\u00e9e died in 2009 and until he married [XXX] in 2014, the claimant stated in his BOC that he felt \u201cdestroyed\u201d and had nowhere to go and felt like he was a \u201cnobody\u201d. The immigration documents from the U.S. indicate that the claimant faced deportation as of January 22, 2016 when a decision was issued about his request to have his status adjusted. However, he was able to obtain a work permit which expired in 2017. Since 2017, the claimant testified he was working underground and the evidence demonstrates that his deportation was not imminent. Taking into account the claimant\u2019s state of mind after the loss of his fianc\u00e9e, the discovery that his daughters were not biologically his own and the absence of evidence that there were active deportation efforts, I find his failure to claim in the U.S. does not demonstrate a lack of subjective fear. Once the claimant was threatened in July 2018 about his immigration status by [XXX] new boyfriend, he took prompt steps to claim protection in Canada. The claimant indicated in his BOC that he did not claim asylum in the U.S. because of his traumatic experiences there with the death of his fianc\u00e9e and the discovery that his daughters were not biologically his own as well as the anti-immigrant policies of the U.S. government.\nClaimant\u2019s involvement with the gay community in Canada\n[38] The claimant testified that since coming to Canada, he wants to live openly as a gay man. He asked to be referred to as gay at the hearing. He said he was tired of hiding his feelings. The claimant testified that he has repressed his feelings for so long that he is not yet ready to commit to a relationship. The claimant testified that he met [XXX] on May 10, 2019 and they have seen each other four to five times. He testified that they have been to a 519 soccer game together and go to Albion mall food court quite often or to a nearby African restaurant. [XXX] testified at the hearing and his evidence was generally consistent with that of the claimant. There was a minor inconsistency regarding the number of times they have seen each other however I do not find this inconsistency to be material.\n[39] The claimant also testified that he has been attending The 519 community centre and has learned about LGBT rights and discrimination. He submitted a statement of membership from 51915. He said talking with the staff about his feelings helped him and at first he was shy about expressing himself but now he is able to talk about things he previously kept inside. The claimant testified that his confidence has improved and he feels he no longer has to hate the feelings he has.\n[40] I find, on a balance of probabilities that the claimant is a gay man based on the totality of the evidence and the SOGIE guidelines.\nWell-Founded Fear\n[41] The country documentation indicates that same sex acts between consenting male adults is criminalized under section 104 of the Ghana Criminal Code. Although same sex acts rarely lead to prosecution, the criminalization of this activity contributes to a climate of frequent discrimination and violence of LGBTQ people in the public and family spheres16.\n[42] Under pressure from various groups, Ghana\u2019s president Akuffo-Addo retracted his stance on the decriminalization of same sex sexual acts and this fomented stigmatisation of sexual and gender minorities17.\n[43] According to a 2018 Human Rights Watch report \u201cGhana is a country of profound contradictions. Despite its status as a liberal democracy, with a constitution that guarantees fundamental human rights to all its citizens, a relatively responsive police force, and an independent national human rights institution, the government has consistently rejected calls by United Nations bodies, including the Human Rights Council during the Universal Periodic Review of Ghana\u2019s human rights record, to repeal the law against \u201cunnatural carnal knowledge.\u201d Ghanaian society is also very religious.\u201d18 This report also indicates that homophobic statements by officials and religious leaders contribute to a culture of homophobia and incites violence against gay people. Despite being a party to several international human rights treaties, Ghana has yet to proactively address violence and discrimination toward LGBT Ghanaians.\n[44] Therefore, the evidence establishes an objective basis for the claimant\u2019s fear of persecution should he live openly as a gay man in Ghana.\nState Protection\n[45] In assessing the issue of state protection, there is a presumption that the state is capable of protecting its citizens except in situations where the state is in complete breakdown. A claimant who alleges that state protection is not available must persuade the Board that, on a balance of probabilities, the evidence establishes that state protection is inadequate. The onus is on the claimant to approach the state for protection in situations where state protection might reasonably be forthcoming.\n[46] The country documentation indicates that LGBTI persons face police harassment and extortion attempts. There were reports police were reluctant to investigate claims of assault or violence against LGBTI persons, although some activists said that police attitudes were slowly changing. Gay men in prison were vulnerable to sexual and other physical abuse. While there were no reported cases of police or government violence against LGBTI persons during the year, stigma, intimidation, and the attitude of the police toward LGBTI persons were factors in preventing victims from reporting incidents of abuse19.\n[47] Country documents further indicate that the police have tried to reach out to LGBT people and ensure their protection however, despite these efforts LGBT people are still frequently subject to various forms of violence. This can be attributed to the government\u2019s reluctance to decriminalize unnatural carnal knowledge20. The 2017\/18 Amnesty International report indicates that LGBTI people continued to face discrimination, police harassment and violence. The Speaker of Parliament said to the media that homosexuality should be completely illegal and punishable by law21.\n[48] I find that the claimant has successfully rebutted the presumption of state protection with clear and convincing evidence.\n[49] As stated in the SOGIE Guideline, a claimant cannot be expected to conceal his SOGIE identity as a way to avoid persecution in his home country. Given the attitudes of the police and government toward LGBT people, the claimant cannot reasonably expect adequate state protection. Therefore, adequate state protection would not be reasonably forthcoming to the claimant in Ghana.\nInternal Flight Alternative (IFA)\n[50] Given the criminalization of same sex sexual activity between males, I find, on a balance of probabilities, that there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout Ghana and therefore a viable IFA does not exist.\nCONCLUSION\n[51] Having considered all of the evidence, I find there is a serious possibility that the claimant would face persecution in Ghana. I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee and I accept his claim.\n(signed) Avril Cardoso\nOctober 15, 2019\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.

Lopes Morey\n\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Meagan Johnston\n\nCountry: Kenya\n\nRPD Number: TB8-18669\n\nATIP Number: A-2021-00256\n\nATIP Pages: 000082-000086\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: So, this is the decision in the claim for refugee protection put forward by, Mr. [XXX], who is claiming refugee protection pursuant to Sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, on the basis of your membership in a particular social group, as a gay man.\n[2] You allege, Sir, that if you return to Kenya, you would be at risk of persecution on the basis of your sexual orientation.\n[3] I find that you are a Convention refugee pursuant to Section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[4] I find that, if you were to return to Kenya, you risk a serious possibility of persecution, on the basis of your sexual orientation.\n[5] I am satisfied you have proven your identity, on a balance of probabilities and I base that finding on the Kenyan passport, a copy of which is found at Exhibit 1.\n[6] I note that you were a credible witness today, during the hearing. Your testimony regarding your sexual orientation, including how you discovered it, how old you were and the relationship that you had in Kenya with, [XXX], was detailed, genuine and spontaneous, in my view.\n[7] Your testimony was consistent with your narrative from your Basis of Claim Form and I noted no omissions or any attempt to embellish your claim.\n[8] You provided credible testimony about your feelings when you discovered your sexual orientation, as well as, your reaction to that discovery. I note you testified with respect to your choice to join a seminary where you would be away from your family and community, in a boarding school, as you tried to overcome the feelings that you discovered you were having.\n[9] I found your most credible testimony to be when you described how [XXX] helped you to change your feelings about yourself and to help you accept who you are and your sexual orientation.\n[10] I note you described the relationship that you had with [XXX], in detail. So, you were able to explain how you met, how your relationship went from a friendship to a romantic relationship, your efforts to keep that relationship secret and what may have led others, especially the students around you, to suspect that you had a romantic relationship.\n[11] I note that testimony was consistent with your narrative and I did, again, find it spontaneous and detailed.\n[12] I find, therefore, you have established that you had a relationship with [XXX] in Kenya, as alleged.\n[13] You\u2019ve also described your life here in Canada since you\u2019ve arrived, including your involvement in various organizations, community organizations and your access to mental health support activities, which are support you to cope with your anxiety.\n[14] Your testimony about why these services are important to you was genuine and credible. I find that you take advantage of mental health services to help you manage that anxiety, as alleged and that your anxiety stems from your experience of threats and physical harm associated with your sexual orientation, in Kenya.\n[15] I note your claim was well documented, overall. First, I note that you have demonstrated you made efforts to contact the hospital where you were admitted in July of 2013, as a result of the physical attack that you underwent. I note the evidence is included in Exhibit 7.\n[16] In addition to that evidence, you were also willing and able to show me your cellphone today, which included an additional e-mail sent on December 1st of this year, again, requesting medical records from that hospital.\n[17] I think you have established that you made reasonable efforts to obtain your medical records in Kenya and I, therefore, draw no negative inference from the fact that they were not provided for the claim.\n[18] Given the circumstances and that you are no longer in touch with your family, as well as, the prevailing attitudes in Kenya towards homosexuals, I do not draw a negative inference from the lack of a letter of support from Kenya or individuals that you know in Kenya.\n[19] I note you were, however, able to provide a number of letters of support from individuals here in Canada who know you and who have met with you at various points on your journey in Canada, whether at community services or just establishing yourself in the community.\n[20] You\u2019ve also included letters and documents corroborating your attendance at various community organizations here, such as, the 519 and Sherbourne Health and I note those documents are found at Exhibits 6 and 7.\n[21] Based on all of these considerations and the totality of the evidence before me, I find you have established that you are, on balance of probabilities, a gay man, as alleged and I find you have established you have a subjective fear.\n[22] The country condition documents before me are consistent with your allegations that there is a serious possibility you would face persecution in Kenya, were you to return, on the basis of your sexual orientation.\n[23] So, I make reference to the National Documentation Package, which is at Exhibit 3, as well as, the documents provided by yourself and your Counsel, which are found at Exhibit 5. I will note that there are consistent reports that individuals who are members of the LGBTQ community, in Kenya, face a serious possibility of persecution.\n[24] Items 2.1 and 6.1 of the NDP in particular indicate that same-sex intimate behaviour is criminalized in Kenya with a maximum penalty of 21 years imprisonment.\n[25] Item 2.1 further confirms that people have been detailed under those laws. There is evidence that from LGBTI organizations in Kenya that, the police more frequently use public order laws to detain people rather than the same-sex legislation. However, they do report that police frequently harass, intimidate or physically abuse LGBTI persons in custody, as well as, the fact that violence and discrimination against such individuals was widespread.\n[26] I find the overwhelming evidence indicates that there is a serious possibility of persecution for individuals of the LGBTI community, in Kenya and having taken those reports into account, I find you have established that your fear is well-founded.\n[27] With respect to state protection, I find that adequate state protection would not be available to you, were you to seek it in Kenya. There is clear evidence that, as mentioned, the police as an agent of the State can be one of the agents of persecution.\n[28] I note again, Item 6.4 of the NDP, reports that the police have harassed LGBTI persons or those believed to be so and have subjected some of these individuals to blackmail and rape.\n[29] I note additional indications in that item from a news report of June 2016, that persons of the LGBT community in Kenya can be legally tortured in order to find out if they are gay and that the high court has ruled that anal probe torture is legal and a reasonable way to prove the crime of homosexuality.\n[30] Therefore, I find that you have rebutted the presumption of state protection and based on your circumstances, as well as, the objective evidence, adequate state protection would not be forthcoming in your case.\n[31] For the same reasons, with respect to the State being one of the agents of persecution, I find that there is no internal flight alternative available to you inside Kenya.\n[32] Consequently, I find that you are a Convention refugee pursuant to Section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act and I accept your claim.\n[33] CLAIMANT: Thank you.\n[34] MEMBER: You\u2019re very welcome, Sir. I wish you all the best in Canada.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2019 RLLR 131\n\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\n\nDate of Decision: September 9, 2019\n\nPanel: M. Schnapp, P. Gueller, D. Willard\n\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Pablo Andres Irribarra Valdes\n\nCountry: Bahamas\n\nRPD Number: TB8-18513\n\nATIP Number: A-2021-00256\n\nATIP Pages: 000077-000081\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: Okay, we are back on the record, counsel I am not going to need any questioning or submissions from you, so I am going to read my decision, just to let you know we have accepted your claim and I am just going to read the decision.\n[2] This is the decision in the claim for refugee protection of [XXX] File Number TB8-18513, you are claiming to be a citizen of the Bahamas and are claiming refugee protection pursuant to Sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act\n[3] The panel has considered your testimony and the other evidence in this case and we are ready to render our decision orally. In assessing your claim, the panel has applied the Chairpersons guidelines, Guideline 9 on sexual orientation and gender identity and expression called the SOGI Guidelines.\nDETERMINATION:\n[4] The panel finds that you are a Convention refugee pursuant to Section 96 of IRPA on the grounds of your membership in a particular social group as a gay man. The panel finds that you would face a serious possibility of persecution in the future if returned to the Bahamas. The panel is accepting your claim.\n[5] Your allegations are set out in detail in your Basis of Claim Form. In summary, you allege a fear of pervasive discrimination including possible acts of violence from the community because of your sexual orientation as a gay man and also due to the community\u2019s perception of you as a gay man.\n[6] You allege that if you return to the Bahamas, you will face stigma, social exclusion discrimination in many aspects of your life and from the community and this would include verbal insults and possible physical violence and that you cannot live openly and freely as a gay man in the Bahamas, without experiencing this kind of harassment, threats and discrimination and there is no safe place for you to live in your country.\n[7] In making this assessment, the panel considered all the evidence including oral testimony and documentary evidence entered as Exhibits.\nIDENTITY:\n[8] The panel finds that your personal and national identity as a citizen of Bahamas has been established on a balance of probabilities by your testimony and the supporting documentation filed in Exhibits 1 and Exhibits 4, in particular the certified copy of your passport which was seized by CBSA when you started your refugee claim.\n[9] The panel finds that there is a link between what you fear on the refugee Convention grounds namely your membership in a particular social group as a gay man and someone who was perceived by the community and family members as being a gay man.\n[10] Therefore your claim falls under Section 96. In terms of your general credibility, the panel finds you to be a credible witness.\n[11] The testimony was straightforward and consistent with your Basis of Claim Form and other forms and there were no significant inconsistencies or omissions that went to the core of your claim.\n[12] You provided spontaneous details of you coming to understand and coming to accept your sexual orientation of being a gay man. You also provided details of the discriminatory and threatening incidents that you experience in the Bahamas. These were details that you would expect of someone who lived the experience as described.\n[13] You provided corroborating documentation including letters from multiple friends who know of your sexual orientation and knew of the negative treatment you experienced in the Bahamas as a result of being a gay man, screenshots and messages being circulated on social media which exposed your sexual orientation and your counsel\u2019s request for police records to the Royal Bahamas Police Force dated August 14th, 2018, Your identity as an HIV positive individual that has been established on the panel\u2019s view on the balance of probabilities by your oral testimony and corroborating medical documentation that was filed as corroborating evidence.\n[14] For someone who is grown up in the society where being on the LGBT spectrum is treated with contempt, ridicule by many as an abomination, the panel finds your testimony to be credible.\n[15] You testified without any obvious embellishments and in a fluid immediate way. Therefore the panel believes your core allegations of your refugee claim and your oral testimony and your Basis of Claim Form on a balance of probabilities.\n[16] The panel believes that you are a gay and due to homophobia in the Bahamas you struggled with this, and cannot lead a free and safe and open life in the Bahamas and that you face a serious possibility of persecution in the future in the Bahamas.\n[17] With respect to your subjective fear and in particular reavailment and delay in making a claim, you have established that you are subjectively fearful of returning to the Bahamas, therefore the panel finds you have a subjective fear of persecution in the Bahamas.\n[18] With respect to the two trips to the United States in 2016 and 2017, you explained that you accompanied your family members, including your mother and that you had not realized at that point that you were able to make an asylum claim in the United States based on sexual orientation.\n[19] With respect to you only claiming refugee status after approximately one month in Canada, your BOC indicated that you were concerned that you did so at the airport, you may be send back to the Bahamas and you needed time to find a lawyer to assist you with the process.\n[20] Therefore the panel accepts your explanations as reasonable and finds that this does not detract in any significant way from you holding a subjected well-founded fear that is forward-looking today and the fear of persecution would exist in the Bahamas.\nOBJECTIVE BASIS OF RISK, PERSECUTION:\n[21] The panel finds that you have an objective basis for your fear because of the documented conditions for the Bahamas as per evidence in Exhibit 3 which is the National Documentation Package for Bahamas.\n[22] It states that based on the evidence in this package, that the claimant has his stated experience and instances of abuse for his sexual orientation in the Bahamas from strangers and homophobic attitudes you have experienced and from family members which is made out in the documentary evidence as well that this is an objective country reports in the situation of the Bahamas.\n[23] You described having to conceal your sexual orientation. Exhibit 3 of the NDP documents that LGBT people in the Bahamas are generally afraid to be open about their sexual orientation or gender identity. They fear if they are open about their sexual orientation they will be subject to ostracism, exclusion, ridicule and possibly violence.\n[24] Physical and psychological violence is typically directed to LGBT persons who lived openly in the Bahamas and LGBT persons have been subjected to violence including killings and physical attacks.\n[25] There are also reports of discrimination in various sectors such as employment and housing in Items 2.1, 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3 of the NDP package.\n[26] Given that the panel finds the claimant credible as a gay man, we find that you will not be able to live freely and openly in the Bahamas without risk of experiencing the above noted harms.\n[27] Further Mr. [XXX] has the additional vulnerability of being an HIV positive man and the NDP speaks of discrimination and some abuse against persons who are HIV positive.\n[28] Item 2.1 which is the United States Human Rights Report, Department of State Report notes that children in Bahamas who are HIV positive face discrimination with authorities often and they often don\u2019t tell teachers the child was HIV positive due to the fear of verbal abuse from both educators and peers.\n[29] Item 5.3 also speaks of discrimination and violence against people of HIV status and Item 6.1 is response to information request throughout the Bahamas which stated that LGBT groups in Bahamas who support people living with HIV have a difficulty getting international funding as it is supposed to be for their programs <inaudible> government does not want to be seen as supporting gay health initiatives.\n[30] This panel finds that as a person as a gay man living with HIV you would be even at heightened risk of discrimination and you may be harassed if you sought medical treatment for your condition.\nSTATE PROTECTION AND INTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE:\n[31] The panel finds that there is a clear and convincing evidence that State protection would not be reasonably forthcoming in your case as per the evidence in Exhibit 3 of the National Documentation Package.\n[32] The NDP indicates that discrimination against LGBTQ members in the Bahamas is common place and the crimes against members of that community are rarely if ever resolved satisfactory.\n[33] Police do not take reporting of anti-LGBTQ crimes seriously, Item 6.1, 6.2 and 6.3 reports that LGBT people often experience difficulties if they turn to the police for protection and the Bahamas because they share strong anti-gay attitudes with the rest of the British Caribbean. The police smirk, ridicule and insult LGBT people if they are open about their sexual orientation.\n[34] So, based on the above the panel finds there is clear and convincing evidence that there is no adequate State protection for you in the Bahamas.\n[35] Lastly, the panel has considered whether there is a viable internal flight alternative available for you and on the evidence before us we find risk of physical harm and homophobic attitudes exist throughout the Bahamas.\n[36] So, there is a possibility of persecution throughout the country, therefore the panel finds there is no viable internal flight alternative available to you.\n[37] So, based on the totality of the evidence, the panel concludes that you are a Convention refugee pursuant to Section 96 of the Act, and we therefore accept your claim, thank you.\n[38] COUNSEL: Thank you.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

Hartslief\n\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Daniel Radin\n\nCountry: Turkey\n\nRPD Number: TB8-17140\n\nAssociated RPD Number(s): TB8-17285\n\nATIP Number: A-2021-00256\n\nATIP Pages: 000072-000076\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: I\u2019ve had an opportunity to review the evidence before me and I have decided to give an oral decision today. You will receive an unedited transcript of this oral decision in the mail in approximately three weeks and your counsel will also receive a copy and he can answer any related questions you may have at that time.\n[2] This is the decision for [XXX], claim number TB8-17140. You are claiming to be a citizen of Turkey and you are claiming refugee protection pursuant to Sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[3] I find that you are a Convention refugee for the reason that you have established, there is a serious possibility of persecution in Turkey based on your membership in a particular social group namely your sexual orientation as a gay man.\n[4] By way of background, you allege the following:\n[5] You realised that you were attracted to men when you were in your late teens although you hid your sexual orientation from your family. You experienced various incidents of negative treatment from members of society and Turkish authorities because of your sexual orientation.\n[6] This negative treatment included experiencing a police raid at a gay bar and getting fired from your job once the police divulged to your boss that you are a gay.\n[7] You also suffered multiple sexual assaults from a senior officer in the military exclusively because he discovered your sexual orientation.\n[8] While engaging in a sexual relationship in Turkey your partner\u2019s brother discovered you together and stabbed your partner.\n[9] After you experienced this violent incident at the hands of your partner\u2019s brother, the prosecutor\u2019s office in Turkey issued a summons requiring you to provide information about the incident.\n[10] When you failed to appear as requested, these same Turkish authorities informed your parents that you are gay. After discovering your sexual orientation, your father who has a violent past verbally threatened your life during a phone conversation and told you never to return to Turkey.\n[11] You say that if you return to Turkey, you will be in danger from your father, your uncle, and the individual who stabbed your former partner. You also say the following:\n[12] The police raid mentioned above, the Turkish police have registered you in their system as a gay man and you will be under constant threat from the Turkish authorities if you return to Turkey.\n[13] Your personal identity as a citizen of Turkey has been established by your testimony and the supporting documents including a copy of your Turkish ID card, your family registry and your passport.\n[14] I therefore find on a balance of probabilities that identity and country of reference have been established for you.\n[15] I find that there is a link between what you fear and one of the five Convention grounds, specifically your membership in a particular social group namely your sexual orientation. This claim is therefore assessed under Section 96 of the Act.\n[16] I have considered all of the documentation before me as well as your testimony and I find that the evidence supports your allegations that there is a serious possibility of persecution by the State if you return to Turkey.\n[17] I am satisfied as to your profile as a gay man. Your Basis of Claim Form included significant details regarding your attraction to men and the ongoing discrimination and ill-treatment you suffered in Turkey because of this.\n[18] At the hearing, you provided detailed testimony regarding your same-sex relationships and the various ways you hid your sexual orientation while living in Turkey.\n[19] You also provided numerous documents in support of your testimony including multiple documents from the 519 organisation, letters of support from a previous partner and your aunt as well as your social media profiles from apps used by the gay community.\n[20] Your testimony on the supporting documentation all established that you are a gay man. You claim that if you return to Turkey you will be killed by your father, your uncle or ex-partner\u2019s brother [XXX](ph).\n[21] You explained that your father has a long history of violence and he has had various brushes with the police. You explained that your uncle is a deeply religious man who thinks he would be rewarded in heaven if he had you killed.\n[22] Finally, your testimony and the documentary evidence confirms that [XXX] (ph) stabbed his own brother after finding you together and for all of these reasons I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities, there is a serious possibility of persecution at the hands of any of these three men if you return to Turkey.\n[23] I have also considered the fact that you will be flagged by the Turkish authorities for failing to obey the summons sent out for you and once you are detained Turkish authorities will likely see in their system that you are a gay man.\n[24] These factors put you at additional risk and for these reasons I find that there is a serious possibility of persecution in your home country.\n[25] However, regardless of any potential harm at the hands of these three individuals, the objective evidence does confirm your allegation that you face a serious possibility of persecution in Turkey as a whole as a gay man should you return.\n[26] I looked at a number of documents in the National Documentation Package dated March 29th of this year, in particular <inaudible> Article 1.17 confirms that Human Rights Organisations have found the police will use legal provisions relating to offenses against public morality, protection of the family and unnatural sexual behaviour to justify harassment of the LGBTQ community.\n[27] Article 6.1 confirms that the Pride Parade has been made illegal. There is widespread discrimination and safety concerns for the gay community across Turkey.\n[28] In fact, ever since pride events were made illegal across Turkey several years ago, the situation for the LGBTQ community appears to be steadily deteriorating in that country.\n[29] The Department of State article 2.1 contains significant information regarding the ongoing violence, discrimination and threats made against the LGBTQ community.\n[30] Crimes against members of the community are often under-reported and when suspects are convicted to these crimes, their sentences are reduced because of the behaviour of the victim.\n[31] The objective evidence is consistent with your allegation that you face a serious possibility of persecution as a gay man should you return to Turkey.\n[32] In Turkey, the objective evidence confirms that State protection is ineffective because it is unwilling to protect members of the LGBTQ community.\n[33] In particular, the Home Office Report at Article 1.14 Section 2.2.4 as well as Sections 2.4.4 states in particular the government does not effectively protect vulnerable LGBTQ persons from social abuse, discrimination or incidence of violence.\n[34] Impunity for crimes against LGBTQ individuals continues to be reported as a problem and in practice law enforcement officials and the judiciary have taken a lenient attitude towards crimes committed against LGBTQ persons.\n[35] For these reasons, I am satisfied that you have rebutted the presumption of State protection in Turkey.\n[36] Furthermore, as you have rebutted the presumption of State protection and based on the Country conditions already outlined, I am satisfied that there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout Turkey and therefore there is no viable internal flight alternative.\n[37] Based on the foregoing analysis, I find that you have established there is a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground namely your membership in a particular social group as a gay man.\n[38] I therefore find that you are a Convention refugee and I accept your claim.\n[38] COUNSEL: Thank you Ms. Madam Member.\n[39] MEMBER: Thank you very much.\n[40] COUNSEL: Thank you Mr. Interpreter.\n[41] MEMBER: Have a wonderful afternoon.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2019 RLLR 129\n\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\n\nDate of Decision: December 16, 2019\n\nPanel: Ellaree Metz\n\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Denis Onek Olwedo\n\nCountry: Uganda\n\nRPD Number: TB8-15381\n\nAssociated RPD Number(s): TB8-17285\n\nATIP Number: A-2021-00256\n\nATIP Pages: 000067-000071\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: These are decisions in the claims of TB8-15381, [XXX] she\u2019s the principal claimant joined with that of her partner [XXX]. They\u2019re citizens of Uganda and are claiming refugee protection pursuant to Section 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refu-, Refugee Protection Act.\n[2] Essentially both the counsel and the Board member has agreed that this is a Section 96 claim. The essence of their allegations or their substantive allegations are contained in Exhibits, in their Basis of Claim forms found starting Exhibit 2 and 3. And essentially, for the principal claimant, she alleges that she is a sexual minority, she\u2019s bisexual, and that she\u2019s facing persecution in Uganda due to her sexual orientation. The associate claimant who is her partner also claims that she is of a sexual minority, that is specifically, that she is lesbian and is facing, also facing persecution due to her sexual orientation.\n[3] With respect to identity, the associate claimant\u2019s identity as a national of Uganda is established by her testimony and supporting documentation filed. I note that she had a certified copy of her true Ugandan passport, that is located at Exhibit 1. With respect to the principal claimants identity she also had a Ugandan passport located at Exhibit 1. Her testimony in chief before the Panel gave rise to concerns about her identity. While the information contained in her visa application to Canada, some of it is incorrect or manufactured and further her testimony was inconsistent regarding material aspects of her identity. Including her inability to properly identify her siblings, the inconsistency regarding the number of brothers and sisters she had, and further her inability to identify her sib-, sibling\u2019s as well as her parents date of births. That coupled with concerns that were raised about what she may or may not have said to the immigration officials regarding whom or who she was traveling with, as is in her story for the TRV or the Temporary Resident Visa application gave the Panel pause. But I did take the time to look at all the evidence per say, and I will get to some of this later. And that her Ugandan passport is not considered to be fraudulent, nothing on the face of it is considered to be fraudulent at least. As examined by this Panel, also looked at documentation that she had with respect to support letters, specifically from the mother, from her mother that was accompanied by the mother\u2019s, or at least a copy of the mother\u2019s national identity card. As such on a balance of probabilities I find that she has met the identity portion of the hearing. I accept her identity that she is who she said she is, and she is a citizen of Uganda.\n[4] The credibility portion, a claimants sworn testimony is presumed truthful unless there are reasons to doubt the truthfulness of their allegation, and I\u2019m cognizant of the many difficulties may arise by claimant in establishing a case. Including nervousness, cultural factors as well as for instance the use of an interpre-, interpreter. As these claims are related to sexual orientation and gender, I have considered the Chairpersons Guidelines, specifically I\u2019ve considered, Chairpersons Guidelines on the SOGIE Guidelines, those are claims that involve, involving Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression. As well as I\u2019ve considered the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 4, with respect to Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender\u00ad Related Persecution. The Guidelines are used to assist or to help to assess the circumstances of claims and to understand and apply added sensitivities necessary, and awareness of circumstances that may affect findings relating to facts and findings of mix facts and law.\n[5] While I did have-, while there were credibility concerns as it related to the principal claimants, on a balance of probabilities I have determined that the claimants are Convention refugees pursuant to Section 96 on the grounds of their membership in a particular social group, that being that their sexual minorities in Uganda. For the principal claimant, as a bisexual, for the associate claimant her partner as a, as a lesbian woman, as such I will, I am accepting both claims for refugee protection.\n[6] The principal claimant along with her same-sex partner, here the associate claimant, they both testified here today. The majority of the testimony came from the principal claimant, they testified today and they also testified in the previous hearing date of September the 5th 2019. The principal claimant departed Uganda on [XXX] 2018 and arrived in Canada the next day. She did not make an application at the airport but later made an in-land claim for protection on June the 6th of 2018. The associate claimant, her partner was initially denied a visa, but later arrived in Canada on [XXX] 2018, and subsequently also made a claim for refugee protection.\n[7] During the hearing date of September, the 5th 2019, issues arose regarding the principal claimants inability to confirm or to properly identify various material aspects of her identity, including or associated with her identity as already indicated. Including particulars of her brothers and sisters, as well as particulars of her parents. Further, there was inconsistency and confusion with regards to her testimony pertaining to her journey to Canada. She re-, she testified upon arrival to Canada, she indicated to immigration officials that her aunt and uncle were traveling separately for the conference and this was the cover story used in their temp-, in her Temporary Resident Visa application. She also testified that she could not recall what she said with respect to the alleged foreperson-, to the alleged foreperson who was supposed to be with traveling her. That\u2019s when I looked at the GCMS notes on file located at Exhibit 1. It indicated that the principal claimant was traveling, or was to be traveling with her mother and father and her mother\u2019s sister. That would, family was not present when they arrived in Canada or present at the immigration official when they requested them, but that certainly would have cause immigration officials to question her further as to the deviation between her TRV application and what she was saying to them that day.\n[8] On September 11th 2019, a letter was sent to the Minister, alerting to them, to the possibilities that the claimants may be misrepresenting or withholding material facts pursuant to Section 27(3)(a) or 27(3)(c) or (3)(d) of the Act. The Minister did not respond or did not intervene, quite frankly the Minister has probably not gotten to the letter as of current date, so it is always open to the Minister after they review these matters to intervene on it afterwards or to challenge the Board\u2019s decision. But based on the evidence that I\u2019ve heard, I\u2019ve accepted the claims.\n[9] Counsel invited me to consider the evidence in totality and to put much weight on the psychological report of Dr. XXXX, that is located at Exhibit 5. As I noted to counsel during his submissions, the report is dated February the 3rd 2019-,\n[10] Member: Are you following along Mam?\n[11] Claimant:\n[12] Member: Okay so they don\u2019t need you to?\n[13] Interpreter: Yes\n[14] Member: Okay, thank you Mr. interpreter.\n[15] The report is dated February the-, February the 3rd 2019, however in the report it indicates that the psychologist saw the principal claimant on January the 20th 2018, which we know could not have been the case, as the principal claimant departed Uganda on [XXX] 2018. The principal claimant during her testimony here today was not able to offer much assistance on this matter as she could not recall when she saw the s-, psychologist, only that she had seen him once. That part at least corresponds with what the psychologist report indicated. So, on a whole 1-, did attach weight to the report, if not to the actual date that the claimant was seen, I did give the over-, the rep-, the overall report weight. It was also significant to the Panel, that the claimant is currently undergoing mental health treatment with her family physician and is on anti-depressant medication. I note there was no corroborative evidence beyond her testimony that put before the board, given the circumstances this will be a matter that there should\u2019ve been medical documentation that was sent to the Board to correspond to-, so the Board can consider everything in totality. But going back to the report from Dr. [XXX]. It indicates that the principal claimant is suffering from [XXX], it requires mental health treatment. Further that she gets nervous and maybe inhib-, maybe inhibited during the hearing process. And the psychologist noted issues of concentration and recollection concerns that was nexus or due to her mental health state. In light of that report and in light of the weight that the Panel had given to the report, I did not make a fatal assessment with respect to her credibility, as those were alleviated by some of the concerns that were raised in the psychological report.\n[16] Then I looked at documentary evidence with support-, with respect to the overall claims. There was a letter from the principal claimant\u2019s mother, regarding the gang rape, and that letter was supported by the mother\u2019s national identity card from Uganda or copy of. There was a letter from the principal claimant\u2019s friend or associate, [XXX]-, first name is-, last name is [XXX] first name is [XXX], regarding his involvement with the principal claimant and her work with assisting sexual minorities in Uganda. There\u2019s also statutory declaration from [XXX], a personal friend of the principal claimant, indicating that she had allowed the principal claimant to seek refuge in her home in 20-, in January of 2018. So, in totality when I reviewed the file, I found that their allegations were supported by the evidence that has been filed and by the country documentation, which indicates that sexual and gender-based viol-, violence is widespread in Uganda.\n[17] According to the National Documentation Package for the country it indicates that same-sex activities are criminalized under Uganda\u2019s Penal Code, and as such they\u2019re deemed to be unnatural offences or acts of gross indecency. There\u2019s also a high level of societal homophobia in Uganda, homosexuality is rejected by most Ugandans on the basis of tradition and culture, religion and moral values. Many in the country perceive homosexuality as un-African and un-Christian. There\u2019s also reports of numerous examples of people suspected of engaging in same-sex activities who has been victims of mob aggressions, public aggressions, and have got no state protection. Thus, in light of the documentary evidence with respect to the treatment of people suspected to engage in same-sex activities in Uganda, as well as gender violence, I find that the fears expressed by the claimants have an objective basis.\n[18] The objective evidence indicate-, demonstrate that there\u2019s no state protection available in Uganda for sexual minorities who are being threatened. It also indicates that sexual minorities have been subject to societal harassment, discrimination, intimidation, threats to their well-being, as well as loss of accommodation and jobs. They\u2019ve also been denied access to health services. Consensual same-sex conduct is illegal in the country and the law provides for penalty of up to life, of up to a lifetime imprisonment. Considering all of this objective evidence, I find that it\u2019s objectively unreasonable to expect the claimants to seek protection from the authorities in Uganda. Therefore, I find that there is no adequate state protection available for the claimants in Uganda based on their personal circumstances.\n[19] As I\u2019ve found or accepted the claimants\u2019 identities of sexual mi-, as sexual minorities in Uganda, I find that they would face a risk of being persecuted anywhere in that country. Thus, there\u2019s no viable internal flight alternative for them.\n[20] So as such, I have accepted their claims for refugee protection pursuant to Section 96 of the Act.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

Charow\n\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): El-Farouk Khaki\n\nCountry: Ghana\n\nRPD Number: TB8-14776\n\nATIP Number: A-2021-00256\n\nATIP Pages: 000062-000066\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: This is the decision for [XXX] file TB8-14776.\n[2] I\u2019ve considered your testimony and the other evidence in this case and I\u2019m ready to render my decision orally.\n[3] In making this decision I\u2019ve considered and applied the guidelines for sexual orientation.\n[4] You\u2019re claiming to be a citizen of Ghana and are claiming refugee protection pursuant to Sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[5] I find that you are a Convention refugee for the following reasons.\n[6] The allegation of your claim can be found in your Basis of Claim Form at Exhibit 2. In short, you allege persecution as a member of a particular social group, namely that you are in danger of being harmed because of your identity as a gay man, as being gay is illegal in Ghana.\n[7] You also allege that you cannot live freely as a gay man in Ghana and that your community may harm you because of your sexual orientation. You\u2019ve alleged that your community has attempted to harm you after you were discovered with your same sex partner shortly before leaving Ghana.\n[8] Your personal identity as a citizen of Ghana has been established by your Ghanaian passport at Exhibit 1. I find that, on a balance of probabilities, identity and country of reference have been established.\n[9] In terms of your general credibility, I have found you to be a credible witness and I therefore accept what you\u2019ve alleged in your oral testimony and in your Basis of Claim Form at Exhibit 1.\n[10] You testified in a straightforward manner about your fears without any embellishment and there were no inconsistencies that went to the core of the claim that were not explained. Your testimony was spontaneous, including being able to provide details about your previous experience of harassment and violence after your sexual orientation was revealed to your community.\n[11] You also provided credible testimony about the interactions that you had with your family after they learned about your sexual orientation. You also testified credibly about the fears that you have about the harm that may come to you should you return to Ghana.\n[12] I noted that there was extensive and detailed testimony about your previous same sex partner in Ghana, including the how the relationship developed, what you liked about your partner, and you were able to give personal information about your partner that was consistent with the level of the relationship alleged.\n[13] I also noted that in support of your claim you provided numerous credible documents, including an affidavit or \u2026 or a statutory declaration from your mother who was the person that you told in Ghana about your sexual orientation. You provided a statutory declaration from a family friend who was the person you hid with after you escaped from your community when they found out about your sexual orientation.\n[14] I also noted extensive and multiple correspondence over the app gay Romeo. I noted that this correspondence was detailed, wasn\u2019t just a hi how are you with a back and forth conversation between multiple people. I noted that this correspondence went further back than just in the timeframe immediately prior to your hearing. I noted that when we discussed gay Romeo you were able to describe how you chose your profile photos, how you choose who to correspondent with, and what you\u2019re looking for from this application.\n[15] In terms of the evidence, I note that it\u2019s available at Exhibits 6 though 8.\n[16] I did have some concerns about your failure to claim asylum in the United States. You had been three times after you first understood yourself to be gay. Twice for student work programs and then once after your sexual orientation had been revealed in Ghana.\n[17] You explained that you did not claim on the first two occasions that you had been there because your life was not in danger at that time. You wanted to go back to Ghana and be with your family. I do find this explanation to be reasonable.\n[18] However, you explained that on your third trip to the United States after your life was in danger in Ghana, you did not file a claim for asylum based on a discussion with someone you met in a hostile in New York. You said that talking with this person made you scared that you would have to return to Ghana because of the attitudes of the current administration, specifically the \u2026 the attitudes that they have towards immigrants and asylum seekers. However, when you told me about this conversation that you had you didn\u2019t know the last name of the person you had talked with.\n[19] You didn\u2019t do any of your own research into the situation for immigrants or asylum seekers in the United States, and you didn\u2019t meet with a lawyer in the United States to assess your options. You did have valid visitor status at that time and yet you still crossed irregularly into Canada.\n[20] While I\u2019m not commenting on what the actual attitudes towards immigrants or asylum seekers is in the United States, I don\u2019t think that you specifically have provided a reasonable explanation for your failure to claim asylum in the United States, and this does negatively impact your credibility. However, this issue is not determinative in your case, and I make this finding based on the strength of your evidence, including your testimony and your supporting documents.\n[21] Even with one noted omission and an inconsistency as per my earlier questioning in this hearing, I do find that the overall credibility of your testimony and your supporting documents outweighs my other concerns. I do find you to be credible.\n[22] I\u2019m therefore satisfied that you are a gay man, that the events have occurred as alleged in your testimony and in your Basis of Claim Form, and that there is a serious possibility that you would face persecution at the hands of either the Government of Ghana or your community should you return to Ghana.\n[23] I find that you\u2019ve established your subjective fear. I find that there is a link between what you fear and one of the five Convention grounds. Specifically, that as a gay man from Ghana you are a member of a particular social group because of your sexual orientation. Therefore, your claim has been assessed under Section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[24] I further find that you have an objective basis for your fear because of the documented country conditions for Ghana as per the evidence in the Exhibit 3, the National Documentation Package for Ghana.\n[25] I note Sections 6.2, 6.3, and 2.1. I\u2019ll summarize them. Under the Criminal Code same sex sexual conduct is a criminal offence. This \u2026 this law is used to threaten, arrest, and punish individuals for engaging in same sex sexual conduct.\n[26] There is stigma, intimidation, and negative attitudes towards people in the LGBT community. Dozens of LGBT people have, on numerous occasions, been attacked by mobs or members of their own families or subject to assault, intimidation, or extortion.\n[27] And I also note that there are homophobic statements in public support of the criminalization of same sex sexual conduct by public officials and religious leaders, which serve to perpetrate or perpetuate societal prejudices against gay and bisexual individuals and even encourage more hate speech, hate crimes, and discrimination by both State and non-State actors.\n[28] In consideration of this I find that your subjective fear has an objective basis. I find that you have a well-founded fear of persecution due to your sexual orientation.\n[29] Due to his evidence, I also find that there is clear and convincing evidence that State protection would not be reasonably forthcoming in your case, and it wouldn\u2019t be reasonable to ask you to seek such protection as the State is a possible agent of persecution.\n[30] As well, given these conditions and the circumstances you\u2019ve described in your claim, I further find that there would be a serious possibility of persecution anywhere in Ghana, as same sex sexual activity is criminalized throughout the country.\n[31] As the test for an internal flight alternative fails on the first prong, I find there is no viable internal flight alternative for you anywhere in Ghana.\n[32] Based on the totality of the evidence I find the claimant to be a Convention refugee. Your claim is therefore accepted.\n[33] So, this will conclude today\u2019s hearing. I\u2019d like to thank everyone for their participation. Thank you, counsel and thank you, sir.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

In making this decision I\u2019ve considered the guidelines for sexual orientation, gender identity and expression.\n[3] You\u2019re claiming to be a citizen of Tanzania and are claiming refugee protection pursuant to Sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[4] I find that you are Convention refugee for the following reasons.\n[5] The allegations of your claim can be found in your basis of claim form at Exhibit 2. In short, you allege persecution as a member of a particular social group, namely that you\u2019re in danger of being harmed because of your identity as a bisexual Tanzanian man. A same sex sexual activity is illegal in Tanzania. You fear the police, as you\u2019ve alleged that you had previously been attacked, kidnapped, and imprisoned for three months without facing any charges before your parents had arranged for your escape.\n[6] Your personal identity as a citizen of Tanzania has been established by your testimony about yourself and your family and the supporting documents filed in Exhibit 1 and 5, namely your birth certificate and your membership in the Zanzibar Football Association card.\n[7] In considering that with your otherwise or overall credible testimony, I find that you have established, on a balance of probabilities, your identity and country of reference.\n[8] Now, in terms of your general credibility, I have found you to be a very credible witness and I therefore accept what you\u2019ve alleged in your oral testimony and in your basis of claim form. You testified in a straightforward manner about your fears without embellishment and there were no inconsistencies that went to the core of the claim that were not explained. Your testimony was spontaneous and you comfortably answered questions about events or emotions not described in your basis of claim form.\n[9] You also were able to describe in detail your previous same sex sexual experience in Tanzania, including how you met your partner, how the relationship progressed, and what you liked about your partner, as well as the struggles you faced while keeping your relationship secret and the subsequent negative interactions you had when people in your community suspected that you were gay and told your parents.\n[10] You were also able to give detailed testimony about being attacked, kidnapped, and imprisoned because of your sexual orientation. The evidence you gave was consistent with your previous description but added more detail in a way that I found to be very credible.\n[11] You also provided a letter from your mother who wrote about how you cannot come back to Tanzania and about your sexual orientation, and this letter can be found in Exhibit 5.\n[12] However, one of the things that I must consider is your delay in leaving Tanzania. You said that you had been released from prison in [XXX] 2016 but you did not leave for Canada until [XXX] 2017. When I asked you about this delay you explained that it had been your father who had been making the arrangements for you. I have considered this explanation in the context of your age, which is very young, you are 19 at this time, and your relative lack of sophistication, as you had not completed high school and had not travelled outside of the country before. When considering all of these factors together, I find that you\u2019ve provided a reasonable explanation for this delay and I will not draw any negative inference about your credibility accordingly.\n[13] In consideration of all of that, I am therefore satisfied that you\u2019ve established your sexual orientation as a bisexual man and that you would face persecution at the hands of either the Tanzanian government or your community should you return to Tanzania. I find that you\u2019ve established your subjective fear.\n[14] I find that there is a link between what you fear and one of the five Convention grounds specifically that as a Tanzanian bisexual man you are a member of a particular social group because of your sexual orientation and therefore your claim has been assessed under Section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[15] I further find that you have an objective basis for your fear because of the documented conditions for a Tanzanian. I refer to the national documentation package for Tanzania in Exhibit 3 specifically Section 6.1 and 6.3 which state that sexual acts between same sex couples are illegal in Tanzania.\n[16] Sources indicate that LGBT people in Tanzania have been subject to violence because of their sexual orientation or gender identity and that LGBTI people in Tanzania are vulnerable to various human rights violations, including but not limited to physical, sexual, and verbal abuse, arbitrary arrest and detention, and are denied access to justice, there\u2019s eviction from housing and unfair dismissal from places of employment.\n[17] I further find that state protection would not be reasonably forthcoming in your case as same sex sexual activity is illegal in Tanzania. There is clear and convincing evidence that you could not access such state protection, nor would it be reasonable for you to request such state protection.\n[18] As well, given these conditions and the circumstances you\u2019ve described in your claim, I further find that as homosexuality or same sex sexual activity is criminalized throughout the country there would be no safe place for you to be considering your sexual orientation.\n[19] As the test for an internal flight alternative fails on the first prong I find that there is no viable internal flight alternative for you anywhere in Tanzania based on the serious possibility of persecution anywhere in Tanzania.\n[20] Based on the totality of the evidence, I find the claimant to be a Convention refugee. Your claim is therefore accepted.\n\u2014 DECISION CONCLUDED \u2014\n",

        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2019 RLLR 125\n\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\n\nDate of Decision: June 25, 2019\n\nPanel: E. Joanne Sajtos\n\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Jeffrey L. Goldman\n\nCountry: Albania\n\nRPD Number: TB8-06714\n\nATIP Number: A-2021-00256\n\nATIP Pages: 000045-000053\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] These are the reasons for the decision in the claim of [XXX] who claims to be a citizen of Albania, and who is claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.1\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] The claimant\u2019s allegations are set out in his Basis of Claim Form.2\n[3] In summary, the claimant claims that he is a homosexual. His father relocated from Albania to Greece when the claimant was young, and as a result, the claimant was raised by his uncle, [XXX]. The claimant engaged in his first same-sex relationship in 2009. In January 2018, the claimant was in a bar. When he went to the washroom, the bartender, who knew the claimant, picked up the claimant\u2019s phone and saw messages that he had exchanged with his same-sex partner. He was confronted with the messages and told to leave the bar without being given his phone back.\n[4] In February 2018, the claimant\u2019s uncle confronted him about his sexuality, but the claimant denied that he was a homosexual. He was told that if the rumours were true, his uncle would kill him. The claimant, who worked in construction with his uncle, learned that the construction jobs where he had worked were being cancelled based on his homosexuality.\n[5] The claimant travelled through Greece en route to Canada, to live with his cousin, who is also a member of the lesbian, gay, bi-sexual, transgender, queer (LGBTQ) community. Since coming to Canada, the claimant has learned that his uncle, [XXX], has relocated to Greece because of the shame he faced in Albania, given that he has relatives who are homosexual.\nDETERMINATION\n[6] The panel finds that the claimant is a Convention refugee because he has established a serious possibility of persecution on account of his membership in a particular social group, namely, homosexuals.\nANALYSIS\n[7] The determinative issues in this case are credibility, state protection, and internal flight alternative.\nIdentity\n[8] The claimant established his personal identity and Albanian nationality based on a certified true copy of his passport3 and his national identity card.4\nCredibility\n[9] Credibility is an issue to be considered in all claims before the Refugee Protection Division. To determine whether a claim is well-founded, the panel must find, on a balance of probabilities, that the evidence is credible and trustworthy. A claimant\u2019s testimony is presumed to be true, unless there are valid reasons to doubt its truthfulness.5 The existence of contradictions, discrepancies, and implausibility in the evidence of a claimant is a well-accepted basis for finding a lack of credibility. The panel can also use common sense when assessing credibility.6\n[10] In determining this claim, the panel has been guided by Guideline 9.7 The purpose of Guideline 98 is to promote greater understanding in cases that involve sexual orientation and gender identity and expression (SOGIE) and of the harm that individuals may face because of their non-conformity with socially-accepted SOGIE norms. This Guideline addresses the particular challenges that individuals with diverse SOGIE may face when presenting their cases before the Refugee Protection Division and it establishes guiding principles for decision-makers who adjudicate cases involving SOGIE.\n[11] The claimant and his witness testified in a straightforward manner, and there were no relevant inconsistencies in their testimony or contradictions between their oral testimony and the written evidence, which were not satisfactorily explained.\n[12] According to the claimant, he was able to successfully hide his homosexuality until January 2018 when a bartender in his community discovered messages on his phone that referred to a same-sex relationship in which he was engaged. The bartender told other members of the community, and the claimant was confronted by his uncle, who was also his employer. A threat to his life was made and the claimant, who recognized that his life was in danger, immediately left his home and stayed in a hotel for two days before travelling to Greece en route to Canada. He was also threatened by his father, who has a history of being violent towards his family members. A witness, who is the claimant\u2019s current partner, testified to knowing about some of the hardships that the claimant endured with his family and his fear for his safety in Albania. The panel is satisfied that the claimant received death threats from his family members, including messages posted on his Facebook page after he had arrived in Canada, which resulted in him fearing for his safety.\n[13] The claimant is no longer in communication with his immediate family members with the exception of one of his brothers, who remains in Albania. His other family members refuse to speak to him because of his sexuality. According to his brother, his uncle, [XXX], left Albania because of the shame he feels given that he has homosexual relatives. The claimant, however, continues to fear that his uncle may return to Albania, and he feels that his uncle\u2019s anger will have been further fueled by his shame and \u201chonour\u201d. When questioned as to why he did not report his uncle to the police, the claimant testified that he has a friend who is a police officer. The officer told the claimant that the police would probably assault a member of the LGBTQ community as opposed to protecting him. The evidence was that members of the LGBTQ community are perceived in Albania as being sick, or that they should be killed because of the way that they affect other people. Given the claimant\u2019s quick exit from Albania following the threat he received from his uncle, and the fact that he left all of his possessions behind with the exception of a few clothes, the panel is satisfied that his actions were those of someone who is fearful for his safety.\n[14] By way of affirmation of the claimant\u2019s homosexual status, he testified to participating in the Toronto LGBTQ community. He presented receipts9 from bars that he attends in the \u201cgay village.\u201d The claimant\u2019s current same-sex partner testified to the claimant\u2019s personal likes and habits, which were entirely consistent with the claimant\u2019s testimony. In addition, correspondence provided from the 519 Community Centre,10 indicates that the claimant had participated in two programs there, one of which is a support group for LGBTQ refugee claimants. Based on the combination of the written and the oral evidence, the panel is satisfied that the claimant is a homosexual and that he is an active participant in the LGBTQ community in Toronto.\n[15] Based on the totality of the evidence, the claimant has established that he has a well\u00ad founded fear of persecution should he return to Albania, based on his sexuality.\nState protection\n[16] With respect to state protection, the panel must consider whether there is adequate state protection in Albania, whether the claimant took all reasonable steps to avail himself of that protection, and whether there is clear and convincing evidence of the state\u2019s inability to offer adequate state protection.\n[17] States are presumed to be capable of protecting their citizens, except in situations where a state is in complete breakdown. The responsibility to provide international (or surrogate) protection only becomes engaged when national or state protection is unavailable to the claimant. To rebut the presumption of state protection, a claimant must provide \u201cclear and convincing\u201d evidence of the state\u2019s inability to protect its citizens. A claimant is required to approach the state for protection if protection might reasonably be forthcoming. However, a claimant is not required to risk their life seeking the ineffective protection of a state, merely to demonstrate that ineffectiveness.11\n[18] A guarantee of protection for all citizens at all times is not to be expected. Nor is perfect protection. Where a state is in effective control of its territory, has military, police, and civil authorities in place, and it makes serious efforts to protect its citizens, the mere fact that it is not always successful will not justify a claim that the state is not providing protection.12 To require full effectiveness of foreign police and judicial systems would be to insist on a standard for other states which we, in Canada, are not always able to achieve ourselves.13 Further, it is not enough for there to be an existing relevant legislative or procedural framework for protection if the police or other authorities are not able or willing to effectively implement those protective provisions.14\n[19] The United States Department of State report for Albania, which is dated March 13, 2019,15 indicates that Albania is a parliamentary democracy. In June 2017, the country held parliamentary elections that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) reported respected fundamental freedoms but were marred by allegations of vote buying and pressure on voters.16 Human rights issues included pervasive corruption in all branches of government.\n[20] The report further notes that although Albanian law prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation, enforcement of the law was weak. Despite sexual orientation and gender identity being protected by hate-crime law, public officials sometimes made homophobic statements.17 Social and traditional media have criticized a recent anti-bullying campaign and accused the LGBTI community of attempting to influence young people inappropriately.18 In 2017, police requested that a transgender woman withdraw her complaint of having suffered physical violence.19 Two weeks later, she was attacked by the same perpetrator and sent to the hospital.20 As of August 2017, the Commission for Protection against Discrimination (CPD) received two complaints alleging discrimination based on sexual orientation. The CPD ruled against the complainants in both cases.21\n[21] In a report entitled Being LGBTI in Eastern Europe: Albania Country Report, which is dated November 28, 2017,22 it was noted that Albania has adopted a National Action Plan 2016- 2020 for protecting and advancing LGBTI rights. During the course of his testimony, the claimant stated that because Albania wants to join the European Union, it has attempted to create an appearance of LGBTQ rights that is not based on the reality of the conditions faced by LGBTQ people in Albania. His testimony was corroborated by the authors of the above referenced report, who note that:\n\u2026 These achievements in policy and legislation have led to a contradictory situation combining an outward appearance of legal protection and higher visibility of LGBTI people with hostility and discrimination still prevalent within key institutions\u2026..23\nAlthough the institutional environment is changing in positive ways, the effects of legal and policy improvements are not yet visible, because they are not being applied in practice. The lack of enactment of legal and institutional measures shows that the government has endorsed its responsibility to protect the rights of LGBTI people more to satisfy the demands of the international community \u2013 and in order to meet the requirements for EU membership in particular- rather than as a civil duty towards LGBTI citizens.24\n[22] The report states that rigid gender stereotypes and cultural expectations mean that men and women are expected to conform to rather inflexible concepts of masculinity and femininity in their behaviour and appearance in Albania. To deviate from these binary gender stereotypes is considered by some to be morally wrong. As a patriarchal society, there are high levels of social disapproval for any form of sexuality that falls outside heterosexual norms. Surveys have found that Albanians hold very negative perceptions of LGBTI people.25 A community may be unaware of a difficult family situation that involves LGBTI people. Parents of LGBTI people tend to keep their children\u2019s sexuality secret to avoid \u201closing their honour\u201d, and they often force their children to suppress their LGBTI identity. Sometimes families break off relations with the LGBTI person, or they force them to move away from home. Physical violence is considered to be an effective form of discipline and it is pervasive.26 In Albania, the perception that LGBTI people are sick and in need of a medical cure for their sexuality is very widespread among both the general public and health professionals.27 Due to the widespread prejudice and homophobia, most LGBTI people live in secrecy.28\n[23] The panel notes that the claimant\u2019s testimony as to the lack of availability of state protection and the conditions in Albania is entirely consistent with the country condition documentation.\n[24] In view of the above analysis, the panel finds that the claimant has provided clear and convincing evidence that, on a balance of probabilities, state protection is inadequate. Thus, he has rebutted the presumption of state protection.\nInternal flight alternative\n[25] The panel has considered whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for the claimant. Based on the totality of the evidence, the panel finds that there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout Albania. As noted in Being LGBTI in Eastern Europe: Albania Country Report:29\nDeep-rooted prejudices among the majority of the population and a lack of awareness on the part of state officials impede the effective application of legislation and prevent its further improvement. They continue to experience a lack of support and violence from their families, neighbourhoods, political and religious leaders, law enforcement officials, employers, and health and education service providers.30\nThus, the panel is satisfied that the claimant would suffer a well-founded fear of persecution in all parts of Albania.\nCONCLUSION\n[26] Based on the totality of the evidence, the panel concludes that the claimant is a Convention refugee in accordance with section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.31 Therefore, the claim for refugee protection is allowed.\n(signed) E.

Addinall\n\nCountry: Peru\n\nRPD Number: TB7-25047\n\nATIP Number: A-2021-00256\n\nATIP Pages: 000034-000044\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] The claimant, [XXX], claims to be a citizen of Peru, who is seeking refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).1\n[2] The claimant alleges that he fears returning to Peru due to his membership in a particular social group, as a homosexual man.\n[3] The panel has carefully considered the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline Number 9: Proceedings before the IRB Involving Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Expression (SOGIE Guidelines)2 prior to assessing the merits of this claim.\nALLEGATIONS\n[4] The details of the allegations are outlined in the claimant\u2019s Basis of Claim (BOC) Form.3 A synopsis of the allegations is as follows.\n[5] The claimant is a gay man, who was born and raised in Trujillo, Peru. The claimant testified that he realized at the age of 8 that he was attracted to boys. He had his first same-sex encounter with his classmate, [XXX],4 when he was 16 and had his first relationship when he was 18 with [XXX].5 The claimant explained that he was in love with [XXX], but two years into their relationship, [XXX] began to assault and humiliate the claimant in front of his friends. He became verbally and physically abusive. The claimant explained that when he threatened to terminate their relationship, [XXX] promised to change, but his violent behaviour continued.\n[6] The claimant testified that, at age 20, while he was intoxicated, he had a sexual relationship with a woman named [XXX]. It resulted in a pregnancy and the birth of their son, [XXX].6 The claimant explained that he was prohibited from having any contact with their son when he disclosed to [XXX] that he was gay, as she did not want their son to know that his father is gay. She wanted the claimant completely out of both their lives.\n[7] The claimant testified that on September 23, 2010, [XXX] pleaded with him to join him for dinner and the claimant accepted, in hope that the issues between them could be resolved and the violent behaviour would be terminated. After dinner, the claimant was driven by [XXX] to his home. At [XXX] home, there were two men there that the claimant did not recognize. [XXX] and the two men beat the claimant and sexually assaulted him. He was stripped naked and forcibly confined to a room, where he was locked for a week and mistreated. On September 30, 2010, the claimant managed to escape through the window and attempted to file a report with the San Juan de Lurigancho police.7 The police, upon discovering the claimant to be a gay man, punched him, insulted him and called his a \u201crosquete,\u201d a derogatory expression for a gay person in Peru.8 The police threatened to \u201cdisappear\u201d him and remarked that \u201call rosquetes should die.\u201d9 They spat on his face and demanded he leave. The claimant testified that he was frightened by the police. The claimant further explained that he went to the hospital, seeking medical treatment, and he was denied any access to medical assistance due to his sexual orientation.\n[8] On May 12, 2011, the claimant testified that [XXX] came to his family home and physically assaulted him and threatened his father. Both the claimant and his father went to the police station to file a report and the police ridiculed his father for bringing a \u201cdaughter\u201d into the world.10\n[9] Fearing further reprisals by [XXX] against his family, the claimant permanently left his family home and tried to hide from his assailant by moving to different states within Peru.11\n[10] On March 3, 2013, [XXX] approached the claimant in Ayacucho and injured him by hitting him on the head with a hammer,12 causing the claimant to lose consciousness.\n[11] On November 28, 2015, [XXX] approached the claimant in Pucallpa and hit him on the forehead with a gun. The claimant fell on the street. He feared that he was going to be shot by [XXX] and screamed for help. [XXX] fled and the claimant was assisted by two women who took him to the hospital. The claimant received medical attention and made a police report.13\n[12] On April 1, 2017, the claimant was forcibly removed by three men from his uncle\u2019s home, who punched him and hit him with the butt of a gun. The claimant recognized two of the men from the incident on September 23, 2010, at [XXX] home. The claimant stated that he was fearful for his life and resisted, but he was overpowered by the three men. They dragged the claimant to the car where [XXX] was seated. The men placed a plastic bag on his head and forcibly tied his hands and legs. After a long journey by car, he was taken to a room and savagely beaten and raped. They forced a piece of wood into his anus.14 The claimant lost consciousness.15\n[13] The claimant testified that he gained consciousness at the hospital and he was informed by the attending nurse that he was found naked near the recycling garbage bin, by workers who thought he was dead. He was brought for medical attention when they discovered he was still breathing and the treating physician contacted the police and a medical report and a police report were made.16 The claimant testified that the police stated that they would pursue [XXX] but they failed. [XXX] continued to threaten the claimant by telephone. He stated that he is now HIV positive. He does not know whether he was infected by [XXX] or his three friends.\n[14] The claimant testified that [XXX] is a [XXX]. His family owns and operates three [XXX] in different regions in Peru, such as San Juan del Lurigancho and Santa Anita. The claimant further testified that the police are homophobic and susceptible to bribery and corruption. He believes that [XXX] is able to locate the claimant, through financial rewards to the police, who would know his location through his national identity card.\n[15] The claimant relocated to several different states in Peru and he was always discovered by [XXX]. He stated that there is a societal stigma against homosexuality and the police and members of the community are homophobic; thus, he is vulnerable as a homosexual man with HIV. He further stated that there is no safe place for him within Peru. Therefore, fearing for his life, the claimant fled Peru and sought protection in Canada.\nDETERMINATION\n[16] The panel finds the claimant to be a Convention refugee. The panel\u2019s reasons are as follows.\nIDENTITY\n[17] In Exhibit 1,17 the claimant has provided a copy of his National Identity Card issued by the Republic of Peru and certified to be a true copy on December 16, 2017.\n[18] In Exhibit 7, the claimant has submitted a copy of his passport issued by the Republic of Peru.18\n[19] In Exhibit 5, the claimant has provided a copy of his Birth Certificate which indicates that he was born at Central Hospital no. I, in the District Council of La Victoria, in the province of Lima and the Republic of Peru, to parents who are both nationals of Peru.19\n[20] In Exhibit 6, the claimant has provided photographs with his friends from the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) community20. Furthermore, the Immigration Referral Form, certified to be true on December 18, 2017, by the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) officer in Exhibit 1,21 indicates that the claimant is HIV positive. The claimant was referred for medical treatment by the CBSA through the Interim Federal Health Program, and it was provided.22\n[21] The panel finds the claimant to be a HIV positive, gay man who is a national of Peru.\nCREDIBILITY\n[22] The panel is cognizant of the leading jurisprudence on the issue of credibility. Maldonado23 stands for the principle that when a claimant swears to the truth of certain allegations, this creates a presumption that those allegations are true, unless there is reason to doubt their truthfulness.\n[23] The claimant responded to all questions posed by the panel and his counsel, clearly and directly. His testimony was straightforward. His responses were consistent with his Basis of Claim Form (BOC),24 the medical report,25 the police report,26 photographs,27 and affidavit.28\n[24] The panel finds the claimant to be a credible and trustworthy witness. Accordingly, the claimant has established his subjective fear.\nWELL-FOUNDED FEAR OF PERSECUTION\nObjective Fear \u2013 Sexual Orientation and HIV positive\n[25] Counsel for the claimant, in his oral submissions, indicated that the claimant is vulnerable to persecution based on three factors: (i) the claimant is a homosexual; (ii) he has been pursued by [XXX], his assailant, for almost a decade; and (iii) the claimant is HIV positive.\n[26] The United States Department of State\u2019s (DOS) \u201cPeru 2018 Human Rights Report\u201d indicates as follows:29\nGovernment officials, NGOs [non-governmental organizations], journalists, and civil society leaders reported widespread official and societal discrimination against LGBTI [lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex] persons in employment, housing, education, and health care on the basis of their sexual orientation or gender identity. NGOs continued to report that law enforcement authorities repeatedly failed to protect, and on occasion violated, the rights of the LGBTI citizens\u2026\n[27] The DOS report further states that \u201c[p]ersons with HIV\/AIDS faced discrimination and harassment, including societal discrimination for employment, housing, and general social inclusion.\u201d30\n[28] The 2017\/2018 Amnesty International Report indicates that \u201cPeru continued to lack specific legislation recognizing and protecting the rights of LGBTI people, who continued to face discrimination and violence based on their sexual orientation or gender identity.\u201d31\n[29] The claimant testified that he has been bullied in school by his peers for \u201cbeing homosexual.\u201d32 His family blamed his misfortune on his sexual orientation, and the police told the claimant that he and other members of the LGBT community deserve to die.33\n[30] The claimant explained that he was in love with [XXX] and he initially considered him to be his partner for about two years, until he became physically violent and psychologically abusive towards him. The claimant testified that [XXX] vehemently pursued him for over a decade, since his male, \u201cmacho\u201d ego was bruised that \u201ca faggot would leave him.\u201d The claimant believes that out of revenge, [XXX] actively engaged in violent acts such as severe beatings, hitting his head with a hammer,34 hitting his head with the butt of a gun,35 and heinous crimes including gang rape and threatening the claimant with death.36 Despite this atrocious and odious victimization, the police turned a blind eye; this indicates that homosexuality carries a strong social stigma in Peru.\n[31] The medical report for the claimant dated April 15, 2017, from Emergency Services at the San Jose Del Callao Hospital corroborates the claimant\u2019s allegations of gang rape and severe abuse.37 The report by the treating physician-surgeon, Dr [XXX] indicates that the claimant suffered: \u201cPeri-anal rectum tear caused by a great degree of violence. Uncontrollable hemorrhaging due to tear or rupture of the rectal anal walls. Presence of peri-anal retraction type hemorrhaging, ecchymosis, swelling, edema on the right external side and the thighs of both legs.\u201d38 The physician-surgeon also referred the claimant to be \u201csent to the Psychology Department for trauma due to physical and sexual attack.\u201d39\n[32] The Human Rights Watch report found that according to a March 2018 Peru\u2019s National Institute of Statistics survey, \u201cover 60 percent of LGBT people surveyed had suffered some type of discrimination or violence.\u201d40\n[33] The panel finds that if the claimant were to return to Peru, he would be susceptible to continued abuse and even death, at the hands of [XXX] and that the police will be complicit in this violence, due to their homophobic attitudes towards the claimant\u2019s sexual orientation.\n[34] The panel finds that the claimant has established his objective basis for his well-founded fear of persecution.\nSTATE PROTECTION\n[35] There is a presumption that except in situations where the state is in complete breakdown, the state is capable of protecting its citizens.41 To rebut the presumption of state protection, a claimant must provide clear and convincing evidence of the state\u2019s inability to protect its citizens.42\n[36] The claimant testified that state protection would not be forthcoming because his agent of persecution, [XXX], has the financial resources to bribe and influence the police. The police threatened to make him \u201cdisappear.\u201d43 He fears returning to the police because he would be further victimized by the police, who are homophobic. The claimant further testified that he is disadvantaged as a HIV positive, homosexual man.\n[37] A report by an NGO on the violence and discrimination against LGBT persons in Peru, found that during the period of 2015 and 2016, \u201cthere were cases of discrimination perpetrated by police officers and municipal security agents in public places, in order to expel non-heterosexual couples and repress their display of affection\u2026\u201d44\n[38] The 2019 Freedom in the World Report for Peru indicates that \u201c[g]overnment corruption remains a critical problem in Peru, though law enforcement authorities frequently investigate and prosecute corruption allegations.\u201d45\n[39] The report further states that \u201ca Peruvian market research company, found that 94 percent of the respondents viewed corruption as being widespread in Peru, and 82 percent believe it had increased in the last five years.\u201d46\n[40] On the issue of the application of the rule oflaw, the report found that \u201c[t]he judiciary is perceived as one of the most corrupt institutions in the country. In July 2018, secretly recorded tapes revealed five judges trading reduced sentences or judicial appointments in exchange for bribes.\u201d47\n[41] In addition, the report found that \u201c[c]onstitutional guarantees of due process are unevenly upheld. Lawyers provided to indigent defendants are often poorly trained.\u201d48\n[42] The current NDP49 provides clear and convincing evidence that homosexuality is heavily stigmatized in Peru and the police are among the agents of persecution. Thus, in these circumstances, the state is unable or unwilling to protect the claimant.\n[43] Accordingly, the panel finds that the claimant has met the burden of proof, on a balance of probabilities, and the presumption of state protection has been rebutted.\nINTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE (IFA)\n[44] The Federal Court of Appeal established a two-part test for assessing an IFA in Rasaratnam and Thirunavukkarasu:\n(1) As per Rasaratnam, \u201cthe Board must be satisfied on a balance of probabilities that there is no serious possibility of the claimant being persecuted in the part of the country to which it finds an IFA exists\u201d50 and\/or the claimant would not be personally subject to a risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture in the IFA.\n(2) Moreover, the conditions in the part of the country considered to be an IFA must be such that it would not be unreasonable in all the circumstances including those particular to the claim, for him to seek refuge there.51\n[45] The claimant bears the burden of proof to demonstrate that he would be persecuted on a Convention ground, or subject personally, on a balance of probabilities, to a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in all of Peru.\n[46] The claimant testified that after [XXX] threatened his father in their family home,52 he left his hometown of Lima and relocated to different areas including Trujillo,53 Ayacucho,54 Pucallpa,55 and El Callao.56 The claimant further testified that [XXX] had approached his friends in Lima, in search of him and offering money as compensation.57\n[47] The claimant made a valiant effort to relocate to different regions within Peru and he was discovered and brutally assaulted on each occasion, leaving the claimant seriously injured requiring medical attention. The claimant attempted to make police reports in the different regions and the police ignored his concerns, and ridiculed and humiliated him for his sexual orientation.\n[48] The panel finds that the claimant, as a homosexual man, would be vulnerable to persecution throughout Peru where homosexuality is condemned by society and the police.\n[49] Having carefully considered the totality of the evidence, the panel finds that there is a serious risk of persecution throughout Peru. Thus, in the particular circumstances of the claimant, who is a homosexual man, an internal flight alternative is unavailable.\nCONCLUSION\n[50] For the above reasons, the panel finds [XXX] to be a Convention refugee. The claimant has established that there is a reasonable chance of persecution due to his membership in a particular social group, as a homosexual man, if he were to return to Peru today.\n(signed) S.

In coming to this determination, the panel has considered and applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9: Proceedings Before the IRB Involving Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression.3\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[4] The claimant\u2019s identity has been established through a copy of his passport found in Exhibit 1.4 The panel is satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant is who he says he is, and is a citizen of Russia.\nCredibility & well-founded fear\n[5] Assessed in totality, the panel found the claimant to be a credible witness who testified in a straightforward manner. Looking at the totality of the evidence the panel finds there is sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence establishing that the claimant is a gay man, on a balance of probabilities. In coming to this determination, the panel has considered the following. As the Court explained in Maldonado, the sworn testimony of the claimant is presumed to be true unless a valid reason exists to doubt its truthfulness.5 He testified to his relationship with his spouse, who also attended the hearing, and provided testimony. Several corroborative documents are found in Exhibits 6 and 7 including (but not limited to) a letter from the claimant\u2019s spouse, the claimant\u2019s US asylum application, and his marriage license.6 The panel has further reviewed the US biometrics which were returned with \u201cno match\u201d.7 In light of the documentation before the panel including the claimant\u2019s US asylum application, the panel places little weight on the biometrics. The panel has reviewed the two letters from the claimant\u2019s US counsel indicating his written request made by his US counsel on his behalf to withdraw his US asylum application8. The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant currently does not have permanent residence in the United States, and that exclusion under article 1E of the United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees (article lE) is not an issue in these particular circumstances.\n[6] Objectively, as indicated in item 2.1 of the National Documentation Package (NDP) for Russia, \u201c[o]penly gay men were particular targets of societal violence, and police often failed to respond adequately to such incidents.\u201d Further, \u201cLGBTI persons reported significant societal stigma and discrimination, which some attributed to official promotion of intolerance and homophobia.\u201d9 The panel finds there is a serious possibility of persecution should the claimant return to Russia.\nState protection and internal flight alternative\n[7] The panel finds state protection would not be reasonably forthcoming in the claimant\u2019s circumstances. As indicated in item 6.1 of the NDP, sources indicate that \u201cpolice officers are not trained on LGBT issues and \u201cmost of them have the same stereotypes about LGBT people as the majority of the Russian citizens\u201d (23 Oct. 2013). Further, as indicated in item 6.7 of the NDP, \u201c[d]iscrimination against the LGBT community in Russia is widespread and severe, including by the authorities.\u201d10 The panel finds that there is not a viable internal flight alternative, and that these conditions exist throughout Russia.\nCONCLUSION\n[8] The panel concludes that the claimant is a Convention refugee and accepts his claim.\n(signed) Z.

Jackson\n\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Solomon Orjiwuru\n\nCountry: Cameroon\n\nRPD Number: TB7-12430\n\nATIP Number: A-2021-00256\n\nATIP Pages: 000026-000029\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: This is the decision of [XXX], who claims to be a citizen of Cameroon and is claiming refugee protection pursuant to Sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[2] The panel finds the claimant is a Convention Refugee on the grounds of his membership in a particular social group, that of bisexual man in Cameroon, for the following reasons.\n[3] In rendering its reasons, the panel has considered the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline Number 9 proceedings before the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada involving sexual orientation and gender identity and expression.\n[4] The claimant has alleged that he identifies as bisexual. He alleges he has had a few same-sex relationships in Cameroon. He was married to a woman in Canada and they have divorced because she discovered that he had been carrying on a same-sex relationship in Canada.\n[5] He claimed refugee protection as he cannot live openly as a bisexual in Cameroon and fears persecution, arrest and discrimination at the hands of the family of his ex-wife, the community and the government due to his sexual orientation.\n[6] The claimant\u2019s identity as a national of Cameroon is established by his testimony and the supporting documentation filed including a certified true copy of his passport in Exhibit 1.\n[7] His identity as a bisexual is established by his credible testimony and the supporting documentation filed including a letter from the claimant\u2019s mother, a copy of her identity card, a letter from the claimant\u2019s former landlord as well as the claimant\u2019s divorce documents, wherein his sexual orientation is discussed. The supporting documentation does not establish the claimant\u2019s sexual orientation all by itself, but it does support his allegations in that regard.\n[8] The claimant\u2019s testimony regarding his sexual orientation was believable including how he described his relationships with his same-sex partners in Cameroon and in Canada.\n[9] The panel accepts that the claimant is bisexual because, in that regard, his testimony was coherent, spontaneous and he generally provided a sufficient level of detail when explaining his same-sex relationships with men. For these reasons, the panel finds that he has established his identity as a bisexual man on a balance of probabilities.\n[10] The panel also finds that his allegations are supported by the country documentation, which is found at the National Documentation Package for Cameroon, Items 2.1, 6.1, 6.4 and 6.6, which indicate that consensual same-sex sexual activity is illegal and punishable by a prison sentence of 6 months to 5 years and a fine.\n[11] Cameroon prosecutes people for consensual same-sex conduct more aggressively than almost any country in the world. Cameroon\u2019s anti-homosexuality law is easily subject to abuse and can be used by virtually anyone as a method of settling scores.\n[12] It is also a recipe for extortion. There are numerous examples of sexual minorities who were arrested or who were victims of violence, similarly grave violations of human rights because of a person\u2019s real or perceived sexual orientation has become common in Cameroon.\n[13] The climate in that country is marked by pervasive homophobia. Ordinary citizens often express extreme hatred towards LGBT individuals. In Cameroon, it is common to link homosexuality to witchcraft.\n[14] Given the claimant\u2019s credible testimony, the objective country condition evidence and the supporting documents the claimant filed, the panel finds that the claimant would face a serious possibility of persecution in Cameroon based on his sexual orientation.\n[15] Based on his personal circumstances, the panel finds that it would be objectively unreasonable for him to seek the protection of the State, and in any event the State protection would not be reasonably forthcoming; the police are one of the agents of persecution.\n[16] It is very clear from the objective documentation that there is no State protection available to sexual minorities in Cameroon, same-sex acts are illegal in Cameroon and the NDP indicates that police do arrest people for engaging in consensual same-sex sexual activity.\n[17] A report by the Finnish Immigration Service at Item 6.4 states that when LGBTI people seek protection from abuse in their communities, police officers fail to protect these individuals.\n[18] Police officers not only discriminate against LGBTI individuals, but also engage in harassment and violence against them. The threat of arrest for homosexual conduct can deter LGBTI individuals from reporting crimes committed against them, and those committing the abuse have done so with impunity.\n[19] Given the documentary evidence, the panel finds there is clear and convincing evidence that adequate State protection is not available to the claimant.\n[20] The panel has considered whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for the claimant. On the evidence before the panel, there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout Cameroon.\n[21] Given that homophobia is widespread in Cameroon, the homosexual acts are illegal throughout all of Cameroon and there is no State protection throughout the whole of Cameroon, the panel finds there is no place the claimant could go in Cameroon where he could live openly as a bisexual man. For these reasons, the panel finds there is no viable internal flight alternative for him.\n[22] So, in conclusion, the panel finds that he is a Convention refugee and therefore accepts his claim.\n[23] This hearing is now concluded. So, thank you both for your participation today.\n[24] COUNSEL: Thank you so much.\n[25] CLAIMANT: Thank you.\n[26] MEMBER: You\u2019re welcome.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

Short\n\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Pablo Andres Irribarra Valdes\n\nCountry: Cameroon\n\nRPD Number: TB7-23504\n\nATIP Number: A-2021-00256\n\nATIP Pages: 000023-000025\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: This is my decision with respect to the claim of [XXX]. This is a 22-year-old man who is a citizen of Cameroon and he claims to be a Convention Refugee or a person in need of protection pursuant to the provisions of Section 96 and Subsection 97.1 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[2] The claimant alleges that should he return to Cameroon he would be in danger of his life and safety because of his sexual orientation as a gay man.\n[3] The claimant alleges that he became aware of his sexuality at around the age of 15 when he discovered while participating in sports he was much more attracted to his fellow male players and he was not attracted at all to females.\n[4] His problems became manifest when he was caught having an affair according to his evidence with a student teacher. He has also given oral evidence today as to how he was attacked by a mob and was rescued by the police but he was also arrested and he was put in hospital and the police checked on him every day.\n[5] He has testified to the fact that he has a couple of friends, male friends in Canada and I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the individual is a gay man.\n[6] I noticed that he arrived in Canada on [XXX], 2017 but did not claim refugee protection until two months later. When he was in Canada at first he was on a student visa.\n[7] Now, the student visa had been illegally obtained but I still take the approach that since it would have been difficult for the authorities to have deported the claimant during those two months he should be forgiven for the delay. He also said that he did not realize that he would apply immediately for refugee protection but was advised so by the gay help group, 519.\n[8] Therefore, I have determined that should the claimant return to Cameroon he would face more than a mere possibility of persecution on account of his sexuality which is a connection to one of the five grounds which define a Convention Refugee.\n[9] I am looking at Item 6.1 of the National Documentation Package. This is response to information request by this board and it is CMR106270.FE, it is dated May 8, 2019 and it says according to sources homosexual acts are illegal in Cameroon and the Penal Code provides for up to five years in prison for sexual activity with a same-sex partner.\n[10] Sources report that the section of the law penalizing homosexuality was retained during a reform of the Penal Code adopted in 2016. The Penal Code provides that whoever has sexual relations with a person of the same sex shall be punished by imprisonment from six months to five years and to a fine. Sources report that sexual minorities are subject to arrest and prosecution.\n[11] Cameroon prosecutes people with consensual same-sex conduct more aggressively than almost any other country in the word this report says; quoting an NGO. According to sources arrests and prosecution are based on suspicion rather than evidence and the Cameroonian authorities are in the main (inaudible) sexual gender and minorities instead of performing their function of protecting their citizens.\n[12] Not only that but the claimant\u2019s testimony indicates that the attitude of the populous at large is very, very homophobic and it would be dangerous for him to be exposed to these individuals and he could expect no help whatsoever or protection from the police.\n[13] For these reasons I believe that the claimant has made out his case.\n[14] I find that he therefore is a Convention Refugee and his claim for refugee protection is accepted.\n[15] This oral decision will be transcribed into writing and it may be edited for grammar and syntax and we are now off the record.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

Andrachuk\n\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Maureen Silcoff\n\nCountry: Venezuela\n\nRPD Number: TB7-22939\n\nATIP Number: A-2021-00256\n\nATIP Pages: 000004-000008\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: Mr. [XXX], I have considered all your evidence, your documentary evidence and your evidence and I am ready to render my decision orally.\n[2] You, Mr. [XXX], claim to be a citizen on Venezuela and you seek refugee protection pursuant to Sections 96 and Section 97 (1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[3] And, in considering your claim for protection, I have considered the Chairperson\u2019s Guidelines, Guideline Number 9, on proceeding before the IRB involving sexual orientation and gender identity and expression.\n[4] In regard to your identity as a citizen of Venezuela, I find that I am satisfied that you are a citizen of Venezuela and I am most satisfied with your personal identity based on the certified copy of your passport the original of which is being held by the CBSA.\n[5] The details of your allegations appear in your Basis of Claim Form and in your oral testimony. The main allegations are that you are afraid to return to your country of nationality Venezuela because you fear persecution based on your sexual orientation of being a homosexual.\n[6] You claim that you are a gay and you\u2019ve known of your sexual orientation, you\u2019ve known that you were different from childhood and knew about your sexual orientation from above the age of 13.\n[7] You didn\u2019t appear to have experienced serious persecution, discrimination or persecution in Venezuela basically because you didn\u2019t live openly as a gay man.\n[8] The only people that you came out to were apparently at the age of 15 when you admitted that you are a gay too, two of your best friends who were also gay and a year before coming to Canada you told your mother about your sexual orientation.\n[9] However, many people suspected that you are a gay because of the way you acted first as a child playing with girls mainly and later on for a variety of reasons they suspected that you were not heterosexual and you experienced a lot of verbal harassment.\n[10] However, you were able to attend school and complete university and there were no physical attacks on you except once in grade 6.\n[11] However, when you had a relationship with your boyfriend [XXX] which began when you were 17 and which lasted until you came to Canada there were two occasions when you were stopped or when you were accosted by police because in the first occasion you were kissing in the car and the police basically extorted a camera and a computer from you for releasing you. Otherwise, they would have caused you problems because of public demonstration of sexual behaviour or alleged public demonstrations of sexual behaviour and there was a second time when the policemen also accosted you and extorted money from you.\n[12] Since coming to Canada you have come out of the closet and lived openly as a gay man. You believe that if you return to Venezuela or you fear that if you return to Venezuela that you will face a serious possibility of persecution because of your sexual orientation and if you were to live there openly as a gay man.\n[13] My determination is that you are a Convention refugee for the following reasons:\n[14] In regard to credibility I find that your testimony was internally consistent with the other evidence that you presented, in particular the documentary evidence that you presented as well is also consistent with the documentary evidence and country conditions.\n[15] In fact, your homosexual orientation and the rest of your allegation are corroborated by documents in Exhibit 4 which you provided in support of your claim and I have no reason to discount them, as well as you presented a persuasive psychological report in Exhibit 6.\n[16] You also presented evidence from your boyfriend, your former boyfriend in Venezuela, and also letters from your current boyfriend in Canada, [XXX] (ph). I note that [XXX] (ph) was listed as a witness and appeared here today ready to testify on your behalf.\n[17] I therefore find that you are a credible witness and I find that you have established that you are a gay and I find on the balance of probabilities the rest of your allegations are also true.\n[18] I also find that you have established that you continue to, that live a gay lifestyle in Canada and that you are involved in LGBTQ activities. The documentary evidence before me and country conditions establish that Venezuela is a seriously dangerous place for LGBTQ persons.\n[19] I note particularly the RIR from 2014 which is reprinted in the Exhibit, in the current NDP Package in Exhibit 3, referenced in Exhibit 3.\n[20] I did note one concern which is the delay in claiming but I accept your explanation as to why you didn\u2019t make an immediate refugee claim when you came to Canada.\n[21] For you to be found a refugee you must demonstrate that there is a serious possibility of persecution if you return to a country of origin as well as that there is no, that you wouldn\u2019t receive adequate State protection there.\n[22] In considering your prospective return to Venezuela, I have taken into consider your personal profile and your particular situation at the present time, also taking into consideration the objective evidence regarding the current situation in Venezuela particularly for homosexual men in Exhibit 3 which is the National Documentation Package, I note that Tabs 2.1, 2.4, 2.8, 6.1 and 6.2, I find that your allegations are consistent with the objective evidence on the file which confirms that there is a violence and discrimination against the LGBTQ community in Venezuela, and that members of sexual minorities in Venezuela are subject to social stigma, prejudice, acts of violence, discrimination, exclusion, threats and ill treatment.\n[23] They are also subject to discrimination when they seek healthcare in the field of employment and in public places.\n[24] Although I do note that there is evidence that there is certain gay infrastructure in Venezuela; however, the objective evidence also indicates that there is no general openness about demonstrating a person\u2019s sexual orientation in public if that person is homosexual.\n[25] I also note that homosexuality is not illegal in Venezuela. However, there is no specific law which protects against crimes based on sexual orientation or sexual identity although everyone according to the law is to be treated equally no matter what their sexual identity.\n[26] There is, as I said equality before the law for all persons and the law prohibits discrimination based on sex or social condition, but the law does not explicitly prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity.\n[27] And, there is evidence that the Supreme Court ruling in Venezuela states that no individual may be discriminated against because of sexual orientation has rarely been enforced.\n[28] Considering the entirety of the evidence I find that the treatments suffered by the persons of the LGBT community in Venezuela may constitute persecution.\n[29] As your counsel pointed out, in your particular case your occupation makes you more visible to the public and therefore would attract more notice for you as a gay man and then may lead to more discrimination and persecution.\n[30] You are not expected to hide your sexual orientation in order to ensure your safety and security. And, I find that based on the objective evidence, it demonstrates that if you, that you may suffer discrimination, violence amounting to persecution if you were to live as openly as a gay man.\n[31] Therefore I conclude that you have met your burden of proof and have demonstrated that you face a serious possibility of persecution based on a Convention ground if you return to Venezuela which is a membership in a particular social group, persons who fear discrimination persecution based on their sexual orientation or gender identity.\n[32] I find that there is not adequate State protection for you in Venezuela. In coming to this conclusion I have taken into consideration of your personal profile and your particular situation at this time.\n[33] Also the interaction you experienced on two occasions with the police indicates that you yourself already found that the police themselves are involved in some cases in persecuting LGBTQ minority and therefore it would be difficult to expect they would also provide protection for you.\n[34] As indicated, the reports indicate that although discrimination based on sexual orientation is barred, LGBTQ community members faced widespread discrimination and are occasionally subjected to violence.\n[35] So, therefore considering the entirety of the evidence, I find that there is clear and convincing evidence that at this time that Venezuelan authorities are unable or unwilling to provide you with adequate protection and therefore I find that the presumption of State protection has been rebutted in your particular circumstances.\n[36] So, considering your personal situation and the current situation for the LGBT community in Venezuela, I find that there is a serious possibility of persecution for you throughout the country of Venezuela.\n[37] In conclusion, based on all these reasons, I conclude that you are a Convention refugee and the Refugee Protection Division accepts your claim. Congratulations, and I hope you lead a happy life in Canada.\n[38] CLAIMANT: Thank you so much. Thank you.\n[39] COUNSEL: Thank you.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

I would like to add that written reasons will be issued, and the written form of these reasons may be edited for spelling, syntax, and grammar, and references to the applicable case law and documentary evidence may also be included.\n[2] You, the Claimant, [XXX] you claim to be a male citizen of Iran, and you are claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[3] Determination: I find that you are a Convention refugee for the following reasons:\n[4] I find that you have established a serious possibility of persecution based upon the Convention ground of membership in a particular social group based on your sexual orientation as a gay man.\n[5] Allegations: Your allegations are contained in your Basis of Claim form, and I won\u2019t repeat them all here, but in summary, you allege the following:\n[6] You fear returning to Iran because you identify as a gay man, which is illegal in Iran.\n[7] Analysis\/Identity: Your identity as a national of Iran is established by your testimony and a certified true copy of your Iranian passport found in Exhibit 1.\n[8] Credibility: Although I had some minor credibility concerns with your testimony, overall, I have found you to be a credible witness on a balance of probabilities and therefore believe what you have alleged in support of your claim. You testified in a straightforward manner without embellishment and there were no relevant inconsistencies in your testimony or contradictions between your testimony and the other evidence before me that were not satisfactorily explained.\n[9] Well-founded fear, state protection, and internal flight alternative: As it relates to the well-foundedness of your fear of persecution, I find that your subjective fear has an objective basis based on the objective documentary evidence before me. In the National Documentation Package, which is Exhibit 3, it confirms that same sex acts are criminalized in Iran, and gay men who are arrested are reported to suffer a range of human rights violations in detention, which range from harassment to physical torture. The test in assessing your risk of harm is forward-looking. You testified credibly about your fears regarding returning to Iran and the treatment you would receive. Your testimony was consistent with the country conditions in Iran, as reported in the documentary evidence. Thus, there is an objective basis to support your fears based upon your sexual orientation.\n[10] So having considered all this evidence before me, and your testimony which I believe to be credible on a balance of probabilities, I find that your fear of persecution is well-founded and you face a serious possibility of persecution in Iran due to your sexual orientation. Given that it\u2019s the Iranian Government and authorities that you fear, I find it would be objectively unreasonable for you to seek the protection of the Iranian Government in light of your particular circumstances. I also find that you face a serious possibility of persecution throughout Iran, given that the documentary evidence shows the state authorities operate similarly throughout Iran. Therefore, I do not find that you have a viable internal flight alternative within Iran.\n[11] Conclusion: I conclude that you are a Convention refugee, and I therefore accept your claim.\n[12] And that concludes the decision and the hearing.\n\u2014 DECISION CONCLUDED\n",

I have also considered the claimant\u2019s level of education and life experiences.\nAllegations\n[3] The claimant was married by her father\u2019s arrangement to the son of a [XXX] in Korlari (ph) in December of 2016. She was about 16 years old when this marriage was arranged. Her husband was abusive and on April 7th of 2018 while they visited her parents\u2019 house an al-Shabaab raid on the home took her father and her husband and the al\u00ad Shabaab later killed them.\n[4] After this her father-in-law attempted to force the claimant to marry his other son. As a minority clan member, she had no protection from this and she fled the country with the assistance of her family. If she returns to Somalia, her father-in-law will find her and force her to marry his other son who she fears will also abuse her.\n[5] I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee as she\u2019s established a well-founded fear of persecution based on a Convention ground.\n[6] In terms of identity, the claimant does not have a passport or a birth certificate. She spoke Somali as would be expected of a person of Somali origin. She provided a number of documents to support her identity. Exhibit 4, page 2 is a letter from the Manitoba Somali Association and it describes the lengths that they went to confirm her membership in the minority Shanshee (ph) clan as well as her origins in the Qoryoley town area in Somalia.\n[7] This Manitoba Somali Association described interviewing a Mr. [XXX] (ph) who had known her family in Somalia and they lived in the same area. The committee compared notes on this interview with Mr. [XXX] and with responses to questions they\u2019d asked the claimant, found them consistent. They also interviewed other Somalis from the same area with respect to descriptions and landmarks. Based on all their research they were able to confirm the claimant is a Shanshee clan member and a citizen of Somalia.\n[8] At Exhibit 4, page 3, the Winnipeg Somali Community president confirms that elders also interviewed the claimant and found she had knowledge consistent with a Shanshee person from Qoryoley.\n[9] Exhibit 4, page 8 is a statement from [XXX] himself who also became a witness to this hearing. He testified that he lived in the same neighbourhood and that he\u2019d known her parents better than her but he knew her briefly when he was a child and she was a child.\n[10] He testified that he was from Qoryoley and he remembered the parents a little because he\u2019d left when he was young and he did confirm that she was of the minority clan Shanshee.\n[11] Exhibit 4, page 5 is from the claimant\u2019s mother who provided an affidavit from an advocate in Nairobi dated July 9th of 2019 and her affidavit confirmed that her daughter was of the Shanshee clan.\n[12] The claimant said that she didn\u2019t have any identity documents because she was from a minority clan and it was very difficult to get documents in Somalia, particularly with respect to being a minority clan as what documents that you were able to get was pretty much controlled by the majority clans and that if anything is to be issued, it\u2019s a very long process and she didn\u2019t have much time. She needed to leave the country in a hurry.\n[13] The country documents state consistently that record-keeping where it exists is poor in Somalia. The Executive Director of the Somali Canadian Association of Etobicoke in the NDP 3.9 actually stated that due to the civil war all personal records had been destroyed. Seen in this light, the claimant\u2019s lack of formal identity documents appears consistent with country conditions.\n[14] It\u2019s pretty easy in Somalia, according to the country documents, to obtain fraudulent passports and fraudulent identity cards so the fact that the claimant has neither a passport nor any other identification card is not necessarily detrimental to her claim.\n[15] Based on the evidence before me, I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the claimant is who she says she is and that she is a member of the Shanshee minority clan and a citizen of Somalia.\nCredibility\n[16] When a claimant swears to the truthfulness of certain facts, there is a presumption that what the claimant has said is true unless there is sufficient reason to doubt its truthfulness. The presumption before me is that your testimony is true; however, this could be rebutted in appropriate circumstances such as inconsistencies, contradictions, omissions and undetailed testimony.\n[17] That was not the case here. In this case, the claimant was straightforward and forthcoming. She provided detailed testimony on many aspects of her life and experiences and why she had to leave Somalia.\n[18] There were no relevant inconsistencies in her testimony or contradictions between her testimony and other evidence before me. She didn\u2019t seem to embellish events and actions even when it could have appeared favourable to her claim.\n[19] I found her to be a credible witness and therefore I believe what she has alleged in support of her claim.\n[20] As well she provided a number of relevant and probative documents. As previously discussed, there were statements verifying her identity in Exhibit 4. As well, Exhibit 4, page 8 was the witness statement which confirmed the forced marriages and some of the risks that minority clan members face.\n[21] As well, her uncle and her mother both verified in their affidavits that the father-in-law had been trying to force the claimant to marry the brother of her deceased husband and both of them, I note, have now escaped to Kenya as a result of the claimant\u2019s actions it became dangerous for them to remain as the majority clan had insisted that the claimant stay and get married. When she didn\u2019t do that it put her family at risk and they fled to Kenya.\n[22] So I found these documents were relevant and helpful in confirming and corroborating the claimant\u2019s documents and testimony.\n[23] In terms of a nexus, I found the persecution that the claimant faces has a nexus to one of the Convention grounds, that of membership in a particular social group as a woman, as well specifically she is a minority clan woman and she\u2019s at risk of forced marriage and, in fact, has already experienced that one time.\n[24] Therefore, I have assessed this claim under section 96.\nWell-founded fear\n[25] In order to be considered a Convention refugee, a claimant must demonstrate that they have a well-founded fear of persecution. This includes a subjective basis and an objective basis for this fear and I note also that it must be forward-looking.\n[26] Based on the claimant\u2019s testimony, supporting documents, the witness testimony, the country condition documents, I find the claimant has a well-founded fear of persecution for the following reasons.\n[27] In terms of the subjective basis, her abusive husband was killed by al-Shabaab around the 18th of April, 2018. Shortly after this, her father-in-law demanded that she marry his other son who she had seen was equally abusive. Shortly after that, she fled to Mogadishu, hiding while she was making arrangements to leave. She left the country on [XXX] for Ethiopia initially, stayed there until [XXX] of 2018 under the advice of an agent who she\u2019d employed to assist her.\n[28] She left Ethiopia and arrived in Toronto on [XXX], 2018 and from there drove to Winnipeg and claimed asylum, signing her Basis of Claim form on the 28th of August of 2018.\n[29] I find the claimant has adduced sufficient credible evidence by her testimony as well as by her actions to establish a subjective fear of persecution in Somalia.\n[30] I asked the claimant what made her leave the country and she said that she\u2019d explained to her uncle that she did not want to marry the brother of her husband. Her uncle told her that if she refused they would be killed together.\n[31] I asked her then, so why did you go and she said: I felt that he could torture, or abuse or beat me \u2013 referring to this brother \u2013 and I was escaping to avoid this. She said very clearly, I wasn\u2019t going to undergo a forced marriage.\n[32] She told me that a female is always the victim and that if you were in the minority and you were a female you are even more at risk. She described her life in Somalia, how she\u2019d been forced to marry at about age 16, the abuse that she\u2019d endured and that she had no recourse but to suffer this abuse.\n[33] She spoke of her escape and what she did staying under the radar while she was in Mogadishu and her efforts to find a way out of the country.\n[34] The witness offered testimony and he described the situation in Somalia for women with an experience that he had had, where a sister-in-law had been married to his cousin. Now, the witness was also from a minority clan, a different one from the claimant but he was from a minority clan. He said that majority clan people came and took the sister-in-law by force from her cousin, to whom she was married, and they married her to one of their members. After the sister-in-law died, they came and took her younger sister and they also forcibly married her. He said this is like a normal thing and there was nothing that anyone can do. He said it is like that everywhere.\n[35] The country documentation is consistent with the claimant and the witness\u2019s testimony of persecution and the risks in Somalia. Forced marriage is deeply rooted in Somali culture and its interpretation of Islamic practices according to the NDP 5.2. Harmful practices such as forced marriages are still taking place and are common although they are constitutionally against the law.\n[36] Women\u2019s rights and physical integrity are challenged by religious and customary practices, including polygamy, forced marriage and wife-inheritance. Gender-based violence is widespread in Somalia according to Human Rights Watch.\n[37] In terms of widow inheritance, there\u2019s actually a name for that, duma (ph), and it means that a widow marries her deceased husband\u2019s brother. Apparently there\u2019s a report in a book called Culture and Customs of Somalia that this tradition is dying out but that it is probably more frequent in rural areas than in towns.\n[38] I asked the claimant what her place of residence was like and she described a place where there were farms even within the town as well as farms around the town. She described livestock. In fact, her bride price was ten goats paid to her father. As a minority clan member, she said she was only worth ten goats to them. If she\u2019d been of a majority clan, it would have involved large sums of money and goats and camels as well.\n[39] So, while the tradition may be dying out according to that one source, I\u2019ve heard the credible claimant\u2019s testimony as well as corroboration and documents from the uncle who was involved with this second marriage that was to be arranged as well as the mother and, of course, there is the testimony of the witness who said that this type of thing is very common in that part of Somalia and generally in Somalia.\n[40] Again, as I said the country documents confirm that sexual and gender-based violence are serious concerns throughout Somalia and a woman without family, friends or clan connections or without resources in general is likely to be at risk of sexual and gender\u00ad based violence upon her return.\n[41] There\u2019s a report called No One Cries for Them: The Predicament Faces Somalia\u2019s Minority Women. This report paints a grim picture of the human rights situation affecting women generally in Somalia and minority women in particular based on the various historical, social, economic, and political factors, including traditional religious and clan structures compounded by years of violence, poverty and famine. This has made Somalia one of the worst places in the world for women, according to this report.\n[42] The report highlights how women\u2019s rights and those of minority women in particular are ignored by the majority population, how they are violated with impunity. The plight of women during the last two decades of conflict has been characterized by displacement, rape, gender-based violence, etcetera, etcetera, inadequate or non-existent political representation and lack of access to economic and social rights and these are some of the grim realities that women of Somalia in general and especially minority women continue to endure today.\n[43] Based on all the evidence before me, I find that the claimant would face a senous possibility of persecution if she were to return to Somalia.\nState protection\n[44] Except in situations where the state is in complete breakdown, states must be presumed capable of protecting their citizens. To rebut this presumption there is an onus on the claimant to establish on a balance of probabilities with clear and convincing evidence that their state\u2019s protection is inadequate.\n[45] I find that adequate state protection would not be forthcoming in this particular case and there is clear and convincing evidence that rebuts on a balance of probabilities a presumption of state protection.\n[46] Women in Somalia do not have the same rights as men and they\u2019ve experienced systematic subordination to men despite provisions in the federal constitution, a weak judiciary, as well as misogynist traditional and tribal laws and practices work against women. In general, a woman fearing sexual or gender-based violence is unlikely to be able to access effective protection from the state according to the NDP 5.5 which is from the United Kingdom Home Office.\n[47] Gender-based violence is widespread. Constitutional protections are largely limited to the paper that they are written on and they are not available in practice. Most incidents go unreported. There is a culture of impunity. It is a serious and according to recent reports increasing problem.\n[48] Domestic violence such as the claimant experienced is generally accepted with 76% of women aged 15 to 49 believing that a husband is justified in beating his wife for burning the food, refusing sexual relations, or arguing with him. Thus, the claimant who endured domestic violence from her late husband and was then faced with forced marriage to her equally abusive brother-in-law is in the minority. She\u2019s a woman who did not agree with this and she actually fled the situation in disagreement with her in-law\u2019s demands and the cultural expectations.\n[49] Thus I find there is clear and convincing evidence demonstrating on a balance of probabilities the state is unable or unwilling to provide this claimant with adequate protection and the presumption of state protection has been rebutted.\n[50] An internal flight alternative arises when someone who meets all the elements of the definition of a Convention refugee in their home area of the country nevertheless is not a Convention refugee because they could live safely elsewhere in the country.\n[51] The test for this has two prongs. I\u2019d have to be satisfied on a balance of probabilities that there would be no serious possibility of persecution in the part of the country to which I found an IFA exists; and, conditions in the part of the country considered to be an IFA must be such that it would not be unreasonable in all circumstances, including those particular to the claimant for her to seek refuge there.\n[52] Looking at this second part, I do find that it would be unreasonable in all circumstances, including those particular to the claimant, for her to seek refuge there, anywhere, in Somalia and this is why.\n[53] First off, the claimant testified that if you\u2019re seen as Westernized, i.e. you\u2019ve lived in a Western country for any period of time as the claimant has now done for over a year, you can be seen as a spy and be treated very poorly.\n[54] I asked the witness as well if there was anywhere in all of Somalia that the claimant could be safe and he said that she wouldn\u2019t be able to survive anywhere else if her clan was not there and that she\u2019s from a minority clan and it\u2019s only in that general area. As she testified earlier there are some clan members in Mogadishu and in Qoryoley area.\n[55] The witness said that if the claimant goes back she\u201911 end up right back in the hands of the people that she was running from.\n[56] Country documentation notes there\u2019s ongoing insecurity and severe drought in Somalia which poses a major risk to the viability of any repatriation process. That\u2019s NDP 14.6.\n[57] Somalia is a far from stable state. There are more than five million people, that is 40% of the population who are in need humanitarian assistance, according to NDP 5.7. Access to water is a major issue according to Amnesty International and this leads to illness and disease widespread. Even simple access to shelter is problematic and when and if shelter is found, returnees are at risk of regular and ongoing forced evictions.\n[58] The situation for internally displaced women, which is what this claimant would be if she returned to an IFA in Somalia, is grim. The Response to Information Report from the IRB states that according to sources due to the need for male protection in Somali society, women without a support network face extreme hardship and difficulties accessing housing or employment.\n[59] The gender advisor similarly explained that even for women with clan protection that women\u2019s rights are not protected, especially in cases of rape or sexual violence. Perpetrators can even be from the same clan and clan elders can resolve cases such as this in traditional ways which can result in forcing a woman to marry the person who has been harming in order to protect their family honour.\n[60] Minority women lack any such protection and experience most pronounced forms of social, cultural and economic discrimination including exclusion from basic services, difficulties accessing support.\n[61] I mentioned the forced evictions of internally displaced people. Mass evictions are not uncommon.\n[62] The documents are clear that any women need to have established clan network support and endorsement from clan elders in order to survive and with no connections this would be difficult.\n[63] It would be unreasonable to expect the claimant to return to the area where she\u2019s from where her father-in-law and his son, who he plans to make her marry, are living and if she were to go anywhere else she would not have access to clan support.\n[64] The UK Home Office at NDP 1.12 also says that travel by land across southern and central Somalia to a proposed place of relocation may well in general pose real risk of serious harm, particularly the al-Shabaab checkpoints. The claimant herself described traveling just to Mogadishu, hiding in among the sheep and the goats in the back of a truck, hoping at every checkpoint that she would not be discovered.\n[65] There are checkpoints all over Somalia operated by government forces, allied groups, armed militias, clan factions and al-Shabaab. These checkpoints have inhibited movement, exposed citizens to looting, extortion, harassment and violence according to the US Department of State report.\n[66] So, even just relocating to another place in Somalia would put the claimant at great risk.\n[67] When you\u2019re looking at the test for an internal flight alternative if either prong of the test is not met, then there is no viable internal alternative in the country. I\u2019ve considered the second prong which requires nothing less than the existence of conditions that would jeopardize the life and safety of the claimant in relocating to any safe area and it would have required actual and concrete evidence of adverse condition and I have now considered the conditions throughout Somalia. I have reviewed the country documentation. I\u2019ve considered the circumstances of this claimant and I find it is objectively unreasonable and unduly harsh as understood in Canadian jurisprudence for this claimant to seek refuge anywhere in Somalia; therefore, there is no internal flight alternative.\n[68] I find that there is a serious possibility the claimant would be persecuted up on her return to Somalia throughout the entire country. Based on the totality of the evidence I have concluded the claimant is a Convention refugee and accordingly I\u2019ve accepted her claim.\n\u2014PROCEEDINGS CONCLUDED\n",

I have considered your testimony and the other evidence in the case and I\u2019m ready to tender my decision orally. I would like to add that in the event that written Reasons are issued, a written form of these Reasons may be edited for spelling, syntax and grammar and references to the applicable case law and documentary evidence may also be included.\n[2] The claimant claims to be a citizen of Rwanda and is claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee as the claimant does have a well-founded fear of persecution on a Convention ground in Rwanda. My reasons are as follows.\n[3] The claimant\u2019s complete allegations are set out in the Basis of Claim Form at Exhibit 2 and need not be repeated here in detail. To summarize briefly, the claimant is a woman born in 1979. She left her country on [XXX], 2018. She left behind her three children, her siblings and her mother. Her claim is based on gender-related abuse from her husband, [XXX] (phonetic). The abuse was sexual and physical in nature. The certainly sought state protection to no avail. She suffered a miscarriage as a result of her husband\u2019s abuse. She was repeatedly raped by her husband in the course of their marriage. Her husband is employed by the [XXX] and is associated with the [XXX].\n[4] The claimant alleges that neither state protection nor safe and reasonable internal flight alternatives are available in her country of nationality. The main issue is state protection.\nIDENTITY\n[5] The claimant\u2019s national identity has been established by the testimony and the supporting documentation filed and entered in the proceeding. The current passport is on file, along with other documents. I\u2019m satisfied of the claimant\u2019s identity.\nNEXUS\n[6] For the claimant to be a Convention refugee, the fear of persecution must be by reason of one of the five grounds enumerated in the Convention refugee definition. In other words, the claimants must have a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion. I find that the harm feared by the claimant is by reason of one of the five grounds enumerated in the Convention refugee definition, namely, as a woman victim of domestic abuse, i.e. membership in a particular social group.\n[7] Turning to credibility, when credibility is assessed there are two principles that are followed. Firstly, when the claimant swears to the truthfulness of certain facts there is a presumption that what she is saying is true unless there\u2019s reason to doubt it. Secondly, when assessing credibility, the panel is entitled to rely on rationality and commonsense. The determination as to whether the claimant\u2019s evidence is credible is made on a balance of probabilities.\n[8] I had concerns regarding credibility because of the significance of some of the Basis of Claim Form amendments and very specifically the amendment relating to the claimant\u2019s husband\u2019s association with the DMI. DMI is the [XXX]. I also had credibility concerns regarding a certain lack of corroborating evidence in support of her allegations.\n[9] Having heard the claimant\u2019s testimony and having observed her in person, I find her credible. Her demeanour was very credible. Her face was very expressive and was a direct and contemporaneous expression of emotions that her testimony conveyed. There was a lack of embellishment to her testimony. She many times simply said, \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d when asked questions. Her testimony was direct. Her explanation for some of the omissions from the original Basis of Claim Form were reasonable. She explained that she had so many things in her head and I found that her explanation for what she meant by that was very credible and directly supported the subject matter of the Chairperson\u2019s Gender Guidelines in terms of what one can reasonably surmise and expect in the testimony of gender-related persecution, which in this case is a history of horrific abuse at the hands of her husband. So I draw you negative inference from the fact that certain aspects of the claimant\u2019s material allegations were not in her original Basis of Claim Form.\n[10] In addition, she added credible testimony in her hearing which was not in the Basis of Claim Form, for example, explaining that she had considered divorce and she provided a reasonable explanation for why she did not go ahead and actively take steps to obtain a divorce from her husband and she also said that her husband threatened her and said that she would only leave the house dead.\n[11] The claimant was able to reasonably and consistently explain why she had failed to mention the DMI in her original Basis of Claim Form and she was able to credibly testify to her husband\u2019s employment history. Given the relatively secretive nature of [XXX], I found her lack of detail on his employment with the DMI and how he combined that with his [XXX] to be credible. To draw a parallel, unless the spouse worked for the [XXX] in the case of Americans, I would not reasonably expect the spouse to know a lot about what the other spouse in the marriage did while employed by the [XXX], for example.\n[12] I further note that the claimant, who has 12 years of education, came across as relatively unsophisticated and that this helped me to understand certain perceived gaps in the credibility which she was able to resolve to my satisfaction at the hearing.\n[13] Moving on to the question of subjective fear, I found her credibility in this regard to be -\u00ad her testimony in this regard to be credible and she provided reasonable explanations for why she had not sought refugee status in the United States. She explained in a spontaneous way why she had decided to come to Canada and why she had chosen Vancouver specifically. Her explanation had to do with the lack of a significant Rwandan population here and the fact that she knew no one in Canada, unlike the situation of the people she was visiting with in the United States. So I found that that aspect of her oral testimony added to her credibility and actually positively contributed to a finding that she does have a subjective fear.\n[14] Turning to the determinative question of state protection, it was open to the claimant, according to the law, to rebut the presumption of state protection with clear and convincing evidence. Individual police figures do not prove that state protection is inadequate and it is unclear to me whether the claimant reasonably tested the effectiveness of state protection in Rwanda. I disagree with counsel as to whether there is adequate state protection for domestic violence in Rwanda but, ultimately, that\u2019s neither here nor there because I agree with counsel that the claimant, in her specific case, is unable to access effective adequate state protection and I will start the analysis by assuming, for the purposes of analysis, that there is acceptable enough or adequate enough state protection for domestic violence in Rwanda that one needs to try to understand why the claimant did not make further efforts to obtain state protection.\n[15] I note in this regard that the Response to Information Request, RWA104588.E, which is item 5.1 of the National Documentation Package at Exhibit 3, provides detailed information on the existence of hotlines and of one-stop centres and on the fact that there are gender desks at the police station and that there is a gender desk within the Rwandan Defence Force and Ministry of Defence.\n[16] I note, and I agree with counsel, that there are shortcomings to the state protection measures in place in Rwanda for domestic violence, but I do note, for example, still from this Response to Information Request, that there have been several convictions perpetrated of domestic violence. For example, there was a conviction of 115 perpetrators of spousal harassment and there was a conviction of 53 perpetrators of adult rape. I note that the possible sentence for spousal rape is notably lower than that of adult rape outside of marriage and I note that, in general, the attitude in Rwanda appears to be that this is often a private matter which should be resolved, probably to the detriment of the victim, within the family. But all the same, when I look at the extensive information in this Response to Information Request, I found that there were more avenues that the claimant could have pursued and did not.\n[17] However, I find that in her case she would not have been able to access adequate state protection, not because of a problem with the Rwandan Police, who are the first level of response to complaints of domestic abuse, but rather because of her husband\u2019s association with the DMT. This matters not only because of what I find is objective evidence supportive of an adequate level of state protection for domestic violence in Rwanda, but also because the claimant twice testified that had her husband not worked for the DMI, she would have been able to get state protection. I can\u2019t ignore that testimony and even less so when it was clear and direct, unsolicited. It was not in response to a direct question and it came twice during the hearing.\n[18] Now, turning to the DMI, as was well argued by counsel, it\u2019s not surprising that there\u2019s little information on the DMI, given the nature of its work. I find that the DMI does exist. As is indicated by Exhibit 6, it is a notorious agency and I find that, on a balance of probability, it is an agency with malevolent goals and practices. Unlike the evidence on the Rwandan Police, which seems to be more mixed, the evidence on the DMI would point to an agency which has specialized in human rights abuses conducted in a covert way and, as the claimant\u2019s testimony on what little she knew of her husband\u2019s work, fully supported this. She said that she went out at night. She said that he came back with bloodstained clothes and she provided during the hearing testimony that was shocking with regards to what the DMI seem to do, which in that case was to blow up the home with the family inside the home of people who are political opponents of the Rwandan government, and this was in addition to information that she had already provided in her Basis of Claim Form of people being persecuted in front of her and her husband showing her the abuse as a way of further intimidating her.\n[19] In addition to her husband working for the DMI, she has established that he is someone who is evil and who continues to want to harm her and her family members. Her testimony on what has happened to her family members since she left was credible. I note that at one point he was sentenced to a criminal sentence, but I found that that is not enough for me to conclude that he no longer has the profile or the motivation or the capacity to persecute her should she return to Rwanda and I further find that this profile of his is such that I find that he would thwart any serious attempt on the claimant\u2019s part to obtain state protection.\n[20] When asked why she did not complain at a police station where her husband was not employed, the claimant spontaneously testified that that is not how it works and that it\u2019s not possible to do so. I accept that explanation and I accept that she did complain twice to the police of her husband\u2019s domestic abuse and that there was an utter failure of state protection in response to this. So given all of this, I find that the claimant has rebutted the presumption of state protection with clear and convincing evidence.\n[21] Turning to the last question, which is that of internal flight alternative, it was not canvassed at the hearing, but I find that, given her husband\u2019s profile and the fact that he is employed by the DMI, I find that the claimant faces a serious possibility of persecution throughout Rwanda as the state is in control of the entire territory and it would not be difficult for the claimant to locate her should she return. It\u2019s clear that he\u2019s motivated to do so and, in addition, Rwanda is a geographically quite small country.\n[22] In conclusion, having considered all of the evidence, I determine that there\u2019s a serious possibility that the claimant would be persecuted in Rwanda for one of the five grounds enumerated in the Refugee Convention. I find that the claimant is credible. She has established that her husband works for the DMI and has the motivation and capacity to continue to persecute her should she return to Rwanda. This matters, as it relates to the determinative issue of state protection.\n[23] Having come to this conclusion, I have not conducted further assessment under section 97(1) of the Act. I conclude that the claimant, Mrs. [XXX], is a Convention refugee and I, therefore, accept her claim.\n\u2014 DECISION CONCLUDED\n",

        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2019 RLLR 116\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: July 31, 2019\n\nPanel: Chad Prowse\nCountry: Palestine\nRPD Number: VB8-02564\nATIP Number: A-2020-01459\nATIP Pages: 000221-000227\n\u2014 DECISION\n[1] PRESIDING MEMBER: Mr. [XXX], I\u2019ve considered your testimony and the other evidence in your case, I\u2019m ready to render my decision orally. I would like to add that in the event that written reasons are issued they will reflect those that I\u2019m giving you know.\n[2] Mr. [XXX] and his spouse Mrs. [XXX] and their child [XXX] are stateless persons from Gaza in the occupied Palestinian territory, who claim refugee protection pursuant to ss. 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[3] Mr. [XXX] is the designated representative for his daughter [XXX].\n[4] The claimants\u2019 complete allegations are contained in the principal claimant\u2019s basis of claim form and narrative. In brief, they allege the following: The principal claimant was raised Muslim but has considered himself to be an atheist or agnostic for the past four to five years.\n[5] In June 2010, the principal claimant completed his undergraduate degree in Gaza graduating at the top of his class. Although it is a long-standing tradition in Palestine that the top graduate of each class goes on to work for the government. He was told that he was not ethically fit to work for the government as he did not attend mosque or answer their questions about his religion appropriately. The principal claimant went on to work in the non-profit sector including at the [XXX] from June 2012 to June 2013, and for the [XXX]. He worked as a [XXX].\n[6] Around February or March 2013, the claimant received his first threat, a neighbour associated with Hamas approached him and politely advised him to stop taking a position as part of his work that abusers of disabled women should be prosecuted. A neighbour told him that Hamas would otherwise take action against him. As a result of this threat, the claimant kept a lower profile at work. He left his employment a few months later.\n[7] In February 2014, the claimant was kidnapped the day after discussing his UNESCO project with youth during which he had inadvertently spoke about the problem of military recruitment of children by Hamas, and expressed his view that the problems in Palestinian are due to land seizure and are not about religion or ethnicity, and that children should not be taught to hate Jews. The claimant was beaten and told that what he said at the round table discussion with youth was inappropriate that Jews were the enemy, and that those who had kidnapped were angry with him or angry with him. He was dropped off at night a long ways from his house. The claimant believes that he was kidnapped by the internal security wing of Hamas.\n[8] September 2015, the claimant received a letter from Hamas at his home informing him that he was required to attend the Hamas police station on 7th September 2015. He attended this meeting. The Hamas police officer told him that he was disturbing the public calm for having voiced his opinion about a schoolgirl who was dismissed from class for refusing to wear a headscarf. His opinion was that persons should be free to wear whatever they wish. While he was being interviewed by the police his phone was searched, they found a conversation with other secular atheists there and discovered that he was working as a volunteer with a human rights organization called [XXX]. The officer was angry and threatened to kill him and tell everyone after he was an Israeli spy if he peeped one peep.\n[9] The claimant became ostracized in his community and decided to leave Gaza permanently as he feared for his life. He applied for and obtained a Fulbright scholarship which allowed him to obtain all four permits required to leave Gaza. On [XXX] 2016, the claimants departed Gaza. The principal claimant was questioned for three hours at Erez cross point by Hamas security forces. The officer told him that he would do well not to return to Gaza.\n[10] The principal claimant completed his graduate studies in Kansas on 10th May 2018. He considered making an asylum claim in the US but did not do so because of what he refers to as the US president\u2019s bigoted and racist comments towards Muslims, and personal encounters with racism in the US. The claimants decided to seek asylum in Canada and entered Canada on [XXX] 2018, shortly before the expiry of their status in the US.\n[11] The principal claimant fears that he will be killed or harmed by Hamas as a secular western educated liberal who values freedom of thought and speech. Particularly as he has been critical of Hamas already and he\u2019s experienced threats and violence from them or persons allegedly acting in concert with them.\n[12] In order to find that the claimants are Convention refugees or persons in need of protection, I must find if there\u2019s sufficient credible or trustworthy evidence to determine that there is a serious possibility that they would be persecuted on Convention ground, or that on a balance of probabilities there is substantial grounds to believe they would be tortured or at risk of losing their life or being subjected to cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if they return to the Palestinian occupied territory.\n[13] Additionally, there must be clear and convincing evidence that state authorities there cannot adequately protect them from this persecution or risk. Furthermore, there must not be another place within the Palestinian occupied territory where they could live safely and where it would be reasonable to do so under the circumstances. I find that the claimants are Convention refugees on the grounds of political opinion as perceived traitors or enemies of Hamas.\n[14] The determinative issues, in this case, are identity and credibility. Where stateless persons of multiple countries of former habitual residence they must demonstrate on a balance of probabilities that there is a serious possibility that they would be persecuted than any country of former habitual residence, and that they cannot return to any other country of former habitual residence where they would not face persecution.\n[15] The claimants\u2019 identity as stateless former habitual residents of Gaza is established by their testimony, and the supporting documentation filed including their Palestinian authority passports, certified copies of which are on file.\n[16] Although the claimant resided in the US for one to two years while the principal claimant completed his graduate studies there, and the principal claimant also briefly studied in Egypt prior to marriage, I find that neither country is a country of former habitual residence for the purpose of this analysis. Notwithstanding this, the claimants are unable to return to either the US or Egypt where the claimants only possessed temporary status that has since expired.\n[17] When a claimant swears to the truth of certain allegations this creates a presumption that those allegations are true unless there\u2019s a reason to doubt their truthfulness. I found the principal claimant to be a credible witness. He testified in a straightforward manner and there were no material inconstancies in his testimony or contradictions between his testimony and the other evidence before me that have not been explained. He provided a spontaneous and detailed account of his former employment in Gaza on community and youth development issues, and was able to articulate his thoughts on the Hamas lead government in Gaza, Hamas affiliated military camps for youth and children and related challenges and obstacles affecting youth in Gaza in a manner that suggested that these were deeply held and considered views.\n[18] The claimants supported their claim with considerable probative and reliable documents including but not limited to documentary evidence of the principal claimant\u2019s employment and volunteer experience with non-profit and human rights originations in Gaza. Evidence of his social media posts on Facebook in which he is clearly criticizing Hamas and personal letters of support.\n[19] Although the claimants did not make a refugee claim in the US, I do not draw a negative inference from this. The claimants did not delay in leaving Gaza considering that logistical difficulties involved in exiting the territory. The claimants maintained valid temporary resident status in the US for the duration of their stay. They applied for refugee protection promptly upon their arrival in Canada. Moreover, as per case law, the mere fact that the claimant failed to seek asylum in the US is not fatal to their claim.\n[20] The claimants\u2019 fear of persecution in the Palestinian occupied territory is supported by the objective evidence. Firstly, on the issue of the treatment of perceived or actual political opponents of Hamas, according to a report by Human Rights Watch in the NDP:\nSince it seized control of Gaza in June 2007, Hamas authorities have harassed critics and abused those in its custody. Hamas authorities have also carried out 25 executions since they took control in Gaza in June 2017 including six in 2017. Following trials that lacked appropriate due process protections and courts in Gaza have sentenced 117 people to death according to the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights.\n[21] Similarly, according to the United States Department of State report on Israel, Golan Heights, West Bank, and Gaza for 2018:\nHuman right issues with respect to Hamas include: reports of unlawful or arbitrary killings, reports of systematic torture, reports of arbitrary detention, political prisoners, arbitrary or unlawful interference with privacy, family and home, undue restrictions on free expression the press and the internet, including the detention of journalists, censorship and site blocking, substantial inference with the rights of peaceful assembly and freedom of association. Significant restrictions on freedom of movement including the requirement of exit permits, restrictions on political participation as there has been no national election since 2006. Corruption unlawful recruitment or use of child soldiers, threats of violence motivated by anti-systematism and the use of forced or compulsory child labour.\n[22] Similarly, according to the 2018 Freedom House report for the Gaza Strip:\nHamas continues to persecute critical journalists and other perceived opponents during the year and persisted in its application of the death penalty without due process.\n[23] On the issue of the forced recruitment and mistreatment of children, according to a report from the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade titled, \u201cDFAT Thematic Report: Palestinian Territories\u201d for March 2017:\nStatistics on forced recruitment in Gaza are not available and it is difficult to build a complete picture of the prevalence and nature of this practice. However, Hamas runs summer camps for schoolchildren and based on various reports, these camps involve some level of militant training, including weapons handling and lessons on Hamas doctrine but do not result in forced recruitment. About 100,000 children attend Hamas\u2019 summer camps; 50,000 attend the alternative camps run by Palestinian Islamic Jihad, but the majority, around 250,000, attend the more popular UNRWA summer camps.\n[24] However, according to the latest US DOS report already referenced:\nThere are reports Hamas trained children as combatants as recently as 2018. Hamas reportedly did not enforce child labour laws in Gaza either and reportedly encouraged children to work gathering gravel and scrap metal from bombed sites to sell to recycling merchants and increased recruitment of youth for tunnel digging activities.\n[25] During the hearing, the principal claimant also expressed his fear that his daughter will face discrimination accumulatively amounting to persecution or gender-based violence as a female in Gaza.\n[26] According to a UN report titled, \u201cGaza Ten Years Later\u201d:\nOver the past decade, Gaza has also seen rising levels of gender\u00ad based violence, and child protection violations. While accurate reporting on these issues remains difficult, a recent report suggests that more than 148,000 women in Gaza are exposed to gender\u00ad based violence. Between 2011 and 2014 UNRWA identified 3,160 survivors of gender-based violence in Gaza and provided a range of different services. Moreover, the Women\u2019s Centre for Legal Aid and Counselling has documented 27 killings of women and girls in 2014, 15 cases in 2015 and 18 cases in the first eight months of 2016.\n[27] On a balance of probabilities, I find that the principal claimant genuinely holds views and has undertaken paid or unpaid activities that make him a perceived political opponent of Hamas. Including his opposition to the recruitment of children and youth by Hamas that on the basis of his testimony which I have found to be reliable. He has already been the target of both official and unofficial targeting by Hamas and its affiliates as a result of these views and actions. Country documents show that he faces more than a mere possibility of persecution on the basis of a Convention ground on this basis.\n[28] Leaving aside the question of whether or not his wife and daughter have a well-founded fear of persecution solely on the basis of gender-based violence and discrimination in Gaza an allegation that finds some support in the country documents, I find that they too have a well-founded fear of persecution by virtue of their dependence on the principal claimant. The principal claimant\u2019s daughter is a five-year-old girl.\n[29] I find that there\u2019s no \u2014 there is no adequate expectation of state protection for the claimants and they have rebutted the presumption of state protection. In this case, the agent of harm is the de facto state in Gaza which is effectively run by Hamas.\n[30] Additionally, I find that the claimants do not have a viable flight alternative \u2014 internal flight alternative as relocation is effectively impossible without alerting the de facto authorities in Gaza. Furthermore, the current severe restrictions on the movement of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip in the West Bank will make internal relocation extremely difficult for many. I find that it would not be possible for the claimants to safely relocate to the West Bank or within the Palestinian territory.\n[31] Therefore, having considered all of the evidence before me, I determine that the claimants are Convention refugees on the basis of the grounds enumerated above. Your claims are approved. Congratulations.\n\u2014 DECISION CONCLUDED\n",

        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2019 RLLR 115\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: January 7, 2019\n\nPanel: Jennifer Ellis\nCountry: Venezuela\nRPD Number: VB8-02306\nATIP Number: A-2020-01459\nATIP Pages: 000212-000220\nThis unedited transcript constitutes the member\u2019s written reasons for decision.\n\u2014 PROCEEDINGS COMMENCED\n[1] PRESIDING MEMBER: This is a decision of the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board in the joined claims of a family from Venezuela. The principal claimant is [XXX]. The associated claimants are [XXX], spouse of the principal claimant, and [XXX], minor child of the principal claimant. This transcript constitutes the Member\u2019s written reasons for decision, as the decision was not rendered orally at a hearing.\n[2] The hearing was held via videoconference on December 11, 2018. The claimants, their counsel, and the interpreter were all in Calgary, while I presided over the hearing from Vancouver. At the start of the hearing the principal claimant was designated as the representative for the minor claimant. The claimants are citizens of Venezuela and are seeking refugee protection pursuant to Sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[3] Allegations: The detailed allegations of the claimants are set out in their respective basis of claim forms and can be summarized as follows.\n[4] The principal claimant is a citizen of Venezuela and no other country. The associated claimants are citizens of both Venezuela and Italy. The principal claimant fears returning to Venezuela because of his opposition to the current regime and his status as a member of an opposition party, namely, the Alianza Bravo Pueblo. The associated claimants fear returning to Venezuela as the family members of the principal claimant.\n[5] Determination: I find that the principal claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to Section 96 of the Act on the grounds of his political opinion. I find that the two associated claimants [XXX] and [XXX] are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection.\n[6] Analysis: Identity: The identity of the principal claimant as a citizen of Venezuela is established by his testimony and the identification documents on file, namely, his valid Venezuelan passport. The identity of the minor claimant as a citizen of both Venezuela and Italy is established by the documents on file, namely, his valid Venezuelan and Italian passport. The same is true for the adult associated claimant; I find that her identity is established as a citizen of both Venezuela and Italy based on the documents on file, namely, her valid Venezuelan and Italian passports.\n[7] Exclusion: It\u2019s the claimant\u2019s evidence that he resided with his wife and son in Chile from January 2017 to October 2017 and that they all had valid status while there. Nevertheless, I do not find that exclusion pursuant to Article 1E of the UN Convention on the Status of Refugees is engaged. The claimant testified that they only ever had temporary status in Chile and their application for permanent status was rejected in October 2017. I have found the claimant\u2019s evidence on this point to be both straightforward and spontaneous. While they do not have any documentary evidence confirming the rejection of this application, I also have no reason to disbelieve the claimant\u2019s testimony on this point. As such, I accept that at the time the claimants came to Canada in [XXX] 2018 they no longer had any status in Chile.\n[8] Countries of reference: In order for a claim for refugee protection to be successful the Act requires that the claimant must establish a claim against each of their countries of nationality.\n[9] Principal claimant; although there is no evidence before me that the principal claimant is an Italian citizen, I must nevertheless determine whether Italy is a country of reference with respect to his claim.\n[10] Indeed, the term \u201ccountries of nationality\u201d in Section 96(a) of the Act includes potential countries of nationality. Where citizenship in another country is available the claimant is expected to make attempts to acquire it and will be denied refugee status if it is shown that it is within his or her power to acquire that other citizenship. Consequently, a person who is able to obtain citizenship in another country by complying with mere formalities is not entitled to avail him or herself of protection in Canada.\n[11] The issue of the right to citizenship was explored by the Federal Court of Appeal in Williams v. Canada 2005 FCA 126. In this decision the Court of Appeal found that refugee protection will be denied where the evidence shows at the time of the hearing that is within control of the claimant to acquire the citizenship of a particular country with respect to which the claimant has no well-founded fear of persecution. The Court of Appeal explained that the appropriate test is whether it is in the control of the person concerned to acquire the citizenship of a country with respect to which he has no well\u00ad founded fear of persecution, if yes the claim will be denied. In other words, I must consider whether it is in the claimant\u2019s control to acquire Italian citizenship.\n[12] I have found a number of documents contained in the national documentation package for Italy to be of great assistance to this issue. For example, Item 3.2 of the national documentation package is a document from the United States Library of Congress entitled \u201cCitizenship Pathways and Border Protection Italy\u201d and Item 3.4 is a European University Institute document from 2013 which also directly addresses citizenship law in Italy. According to these two documents there are only four ways in which Italian citizenship is automatically acquired, the first is by dissent from an Italian citizen, by birth in the Italian territory, by judicial recognition, affiliation, by an Italian citizen while the child is a minor, and through adoption. In other words, individuals are not able to acquire Italian citizenship automatically simply by nature of having an Italian citizen spouse.\n[13] Indeed, the document at 3.2 of the national documentation package goes on to explain that the foreign spouse of an Italian citizen may acquire Italian citizenship subject to a number of requirements, including the somewhat vague absence of impediments concerning the security of the republic. In other words, there is some discretion at the hands of Italian authorities.\n[14] As is explained in the Federal Court\u2019s decision in Khan v. Canada 2008 FC 583, if the circumstances are not within a claimant\u2019s control and the authorities are not compelled to grant citizenship the Board should not consider how the authorities might exercise their discretion.\n[15] Additionally, I note that the Federal Court has also held that a claimant is not required to demonstrate that it was more likely than not if they applied that they would be granted citizenship. See, for example, Hua Ma v. Canada 2009 FC 779.\n[16] Based on the evidence before me, I find that Italy is not a country of reference with respect to the principal claimant. As such, I will only be considering his claim against Venezuela.\n[17] Associated claimants: As citizens of Italy and Venezuela the associated claimants must establish a claim against both of those countries of nationality in order to obtain refugee protection. Neither of the associated claimants advanced a claim against Italy. Nonetheless, I have examined all of the evidence before me to determine whether or not the associated claimants satisfy the requirements under Section 96 or 97(1) of the Act as against Italy and I conclude they do not. Accordingly, it is unnecessary to examine the risk they face in Venezuela and their claims for refugee protection must be rejected.\n[18] For the remainder of these reasons I turn to the claim of the principal claimant alone.\n[19] Credibility: Pursuant to the Moldonado principle it is presumed that sworn testimony is true unless there is sufficient reason to doubt its trustworthiness. I have found the claimants to be credible witnesses and I believe what they have alleged. The adult claimants\u2019 testified in a straightforward manner and did not exaggerate in any way. They were clear when they did not know the answer to my questions and appropriately asked for clarification when necessary. There were no relevant inconsistencies in their testimony or contradictions between their testimony and the other evidence before me.\n[20] During the hearing the principal claimant was asked a number of questions about his membership with the Alianza Bravo Pueblo, the ABP. He explained that he became a member of the party because he identified with the party\u2019s founder and leader Antonio Ledezma. He explained that the ABP was a new group founded in 2000 that has fought for human rights and democracy in Venezuela since its inception.\n[21] The IRB document found at Item 4.10 of the national documentation package, namely, VEN104851, confirms that the Alianza Bravo Pueblo is a political party in Venezuela that seeks to improve public governance through democratic processes and is focussed on developing social justice, freedom, peace, solidarity, equality of opportunities and progress. This document confirms that the ABP was founded by Anthony Ledezma in 2000 and also indicates that party members have been subject to politically motivated arrests in Venezuela.\n[22] With respect to his specific role in the ABP, the principal claimant testified that he worked as a [XXX] and [XXX]. He participated in various rallies and demonstrations in opposition to the government over a period of several years. Sometimes his participation involved driving protestors to different places and bringing supplies to protests.\n[23] I note that at pages 11 and 12 of Exhibit 5 the claimant has provided a letter from the ABP confirming his membership with the party since 2005 and setting out the details of his activities as a human rights defender and activist. He\u2019s described as a [XXX] and a [XXX] for the rescue of the democratic system. This letter is printed on party letterhead and has been affixed with the party stamp. I have no reason to believe that this document is not genuine.\n[24] In addition, the claimant has provided a number of support letters from friends and activists attesting to the claimant\u2019s vocal opposition to the current regime in Venezuela. In my view, these letters contain what are essentially witness statements relating to a number of the attacks that the claimant experienced while engaging in political activities. These letters are all included in Exhibit 5.\n[25] For example, letters found at pages 25 through 29 and 33 through 36 confirm that the claimant was attacked and threatened by government supporters on May 18, 2016. A medical report documenting head injuries sustained by the claimant on that date can be found at pages 13 through 15 of Exhibit 5.\n[26] There\u2019s also a support letter at pages 16 through 20 which corroborates the claimant\u2019s evidence that he was again attacked on December 10, 2017 by a number of collectivos because of his political activities. A second medical report dated March 5, 2018 corroborates the claimant\u2019s evidence that he again suffered head injuries from an attack at the hands of the same group of government supporters on this date.\n[27] The IRB\u2019s document VEN106030 found at Item 4.6 of the NDP discusses the pro\u00ad government groups known as collectivos and specifically states that they function like gangs that are integrated into the state\u2019s policing apparatus.\n[28] Furthermore, a November 2017 report by Human Rights Watch found at Item 2.10 of the national documentation package documents the way that these groups are responsible for \u201cviolent attacks or detentions that appear to be motivated by loyalty to the government\u201d.\n[29] In addition, I note that there is a document contained in Exhibit 5 at pages 41 through 46, the title of which has been translated as \u201cRequest for an Arrest Warrant\u201d and which has been prepared by the national prosecutor\u2019s office in Venezuela. This document, which is dated September 22, 2018, appears to be requesting that the authority be given for the principal claimant to be arrested on the grounds that he has been engaged in war propaganda and messages of national hate.\n[30] The claimant clarified during the hearing that this document was obtained by his sister in Venezuela with the assistance of a lawyer after state officials came looking for him at his parents\u2019 home following his flight from the country. The claimant testified that he was unsure as to whether or not an arrest warrant was ever issued against him after this request was submitted by the prosecutor\u2019s office but he indicated that it frightened him nonetheless.\n[31] According to a January 2018 Human Rights Watch report found at Item 2.3 of the national documentation package, while authorities repeatedly arrest and prosecute political opponents they also bring charges or threaten to bring criminal charges against protestors and even many regular Venezuelans simply for criticizing the government.\n[32] Similarly, the Freedom House report found at Item 2.4 of the NDP indicates that Venezuelans democratic institutions have deteriorated since 1999 but conditions have grown sharply worse in recent years due to a concentration of power in the executive and harsher crackdowns on the opposition.\n[33] Indeed, the U.S. Department of State human rights report found at Item 2.1 confirms that the law criminalized criticism of the government.\n[34] Based on the claimant\u2019s own evidence and the supporting documentation he has provided, as well as the independent country evidence contained in the national documentation package, I accept that he was an active member of the Alianza Bravo Pueblo when he was residing in Venezuela; that he received a number of threats and suffered a number of physical attacks as a result of his political views, and that he continues to be opposed to the current regime in Venezuela.\n[35] Additionally, I accept that the request for an arrest warrant was a tool used by the government to intimidate the claimant to cease his political activities and that his political activism would have been protected under the Charter and would not have constituted a crime in Canada under the Criminal Code.\n[36] Accordingly, I find that the claimant is not excluded under Article l(f)(b) of the UN Convention.\n[37] Subjective fear: While some of the claimant\u2019s actions could be viewed as evidence of a lack of subjective fear, the claimant has provided reasonable explanations for each of them.\n[38] For example, I note that the claimant was attacked by government supporters on May 18, 2016. During this altercation the attackers advised the principal claimant that they knew who he was, where he lived, and that he had a wife and a son. He was threatened that if he continued on with his opposition work his family would be harmed.\n[39] In his basis of claim form he explained that as a consequence of this attack his wife and son travelled to Canada for a few months beginning in [XXX] 2016. During the claimant\u2019s testimony he explained that he wanted his wife and son to leave earlier but given the challenges they had in scheduling flights because of the current crisis in Venezuela they were unable to do so.\n[40] While they awaited their departure from Venezuela, the associated claimants did not leave the family home even to purchase groceries, and the principal claimant himself kept a very low profile. It\u2019s the claimant\u2019s evidence that he remained hopeful that the political and humanitarian situation in Venezuela would improve and that the opposition groups would be successful in their endeavours against the current regime. Indeed, he continued fighting for what he believed in because of his deeply held beliefs regarding the importance of standing up to injustice. After several months of laying low the claimant continued his opposition activities as he felt compelled to do.\n[41] I also note that the claimants travelled to the United States for one month beginning in [XXX] 2016 and that they then went to Chile for approximately nine months after that. They did not seek refugee protection in either country and ultimately returned to Venezuela at the end of [XXX] 2017.\n[42] With respect to the United States, it was the claimant\u2019s evidence that they sought legal advice but were advised that seeking asylum was very risky given the current administration.\n[43] While the claimants did not seek protection in Chile they did obtain temporary work permits and made an application for permanent status. This application was denied and the claimants returned to Venezuela. It\u2019s the claimant\u2019s evidence that they returned with the hope of finding a calmer Venezuela and indeed they had no problems until December 2017.\n[44] I note that following the attack suffered by the principal claimant in December 2017 he and the associated claimants moved to his parents\u2019 home approximately 30 kilometres away. Again the claimant remained hopeful, if not somewhat na\u00efve, and when things appeared to calm down he and his family moved back to the family home a month later.\n[45] It was not until March 5, 2018 that the claimant was again attacked, this time with a gun to his head in front of both his wife and his son. It was then that the claimant accepted that he was no longer safe in Venezuela and the family left as soon as they were able in [XXX] 2018.\n[46] Under the circumstances, I find that the claimants\u2019 explanations are reasonable. The claimants had valid status in the United States while they were there and did not face an imminent risk of being removed to Venezuela. The claimants also took steps to obtain permanent status in Chile albeit through an economic route and were unsuccessful. Throughout this time, however, they remained hopeful that the situation in Venezuela would improve. Indeed, the commitment of the principal claimant to his political values and to the ABP were what drove him to continue fighting for change despite the risks. I do not find that the claimant\u2019s failure to claim elsewhere or his return to Venezuela to be indicative of a lack of subjective fear.\n[47] In addition, given their personal circumstances and the current anti-refugee rhetoric and realities in the United States, I find that the claimants\u2019 decision to come to Canada to find a more permanent solution by making a refugee claim to be consistent with a subjective fear.\n[48] As such, I find that the principal claimant has established his subjective fear of persecution on a balance of probabilities.\n[49] Objectively well-founded fear: I find that the country conditions, in light of the principal claimant\u2019s personal profile, demonstrate that his fear of persecution in Venezuela is well\u00ad founded. The principal claimant has established, on a balance of probabilities, that he holds opinions contrary to the current regime in Venezuela and that he has expressed these opinions publicly on a number of occasions. Based on the available country condition evidence, I find he does face a serious possibility of persecution in Venezuela by reason of his political opinion.\n[50] In addition to the documents I have already cited, I note that Item 1.4 of the national documentation package, which is a background and policy report prepared by the United States Congressional Research Service, indicates that Venezuela remains in a deep political crisis under the authoritarian rule of President Nicolas Maduro of the United Socialist Party of Venezuela. Despite his unpopularity, President Maduro has successfully used the courts, security forces, and electoral council to repress the opposition.\n[51] This Human Rights Watch report also documents that tens of thousands of people took to the streets in Venezuela to protest against the government controlled Supreme Court\u2019s attempt to usurp the powers of the country\u2019s legislative branch in April 2017. Demonstrations quickly spread throughout the country and continued for months fueled by widespread discontent with the authoritarian practices of President Nicolas Maduro and the humanitarian crisis that has devastated the country under his watch. According to the report, the government responded with widespread violence and brutality against anti\u00ad government protestors and detainees and has denied detainees due process rights. While it was not the first crackdown on dissent under Maduro the scope and severity of their oppression in 2017 reached levels unseen in Venezuela in recent memory.\n[52] The 2017 U.S. Department of State Human Rights report found in the national documentation package as Item 2.1 explains that democratic governance and human rights deteriorated dramatically during the year as the result of a campaign of the Maduro administration to consolidate its power. Security forces and armed pro-government paramilitary groups known as collectivos, at times, use excessive force against protestors.\n[53] According to the report, credible non-governmental organizations documented indiscriminate household raids, arbitrary arrests, and the use of torture to deter protestors. The government arrested thousands of individuals and tried hundreds of civilians in military tribunals. The government routinely block signals, interfered with operations, or shutdown privately owned television, radio, and other media outlets.\n[54] In my view, the principal claimant has established that he does indeed have an objectively well-founded fear of persecution on the grounds of his political opinion.\n[55] State protection: As the state is the agent of persecution, or at least is heavily complicit in such acts of persecution, it is clear that state protection would not be reasonably forthcoming to individuals in the position of the claimants. As such, I find that there is no state protection available to the principal claimant were he to return to Venezuela.\n[56] Internal flight alternative: The independent country documentation also shows that the Venezuelan authorities have effective control of the country\u2019s entire territory. Therefore, there is nowhere in Venezuela where the principal claimant could go without a serious possibility of persecution. He therefore has no viable internal flight alternative available to him.\n[56] Conclusion: For the foregoing reasons, I conclude that the principal claimant is a Convention refugee and I therefore accept his claim. I further conclude that the two associated claimants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection and I therefore reject their claims.\n\u2014 DECISION CONCLUDED\n(signed) Jennifer Ellis\nJanuary 7, 2019\n",

You claim refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[2] I have considered your testimony and the other evidence in the case and I am ready to render my decision orally. Written reasons will be provided to you and your counsel. The written reasons will be a transcript of what I\u2019m saying now.\n[3] I find that you are a Convention refugee as you have a well-founded fear of persecution.\n[4] I will summarize your allegations as follows. You are a 25 year old male citizen of Afghanistan. You are originally from Ghazni but you resided in Kabul most recently with your family. Your father was a [XXX] for American residents and businesses in Kabul; however, he quit his job in 2014 because the work was risky and dangerous.\n[5] You joined the [XXX] after you completed high school. In 2013, you attended [XXX] from June to October 2013. You first worked as a [XXX] in Sharana, Paktika Province for about one year and then in October 2014 you were transferred to Kabul where you worked in the [XXX] in Kabul.\n[6] You received a number of threats from someone who identified himself as [XXX] (ph) because you worked for the [XXX] and your father also worked for what the caller called the infidel government. You received a number of phone calls in 2015 when- sorry, 2014 in Kabul. You changed your number. You told your commander in the [XXX] about the threats after receiving the first two calls. Your commander dismissed your complaint as not being very serious.\n[7] The caller threatened you and your family. Your family moved from Ghazni to Kabul as they felt they would be more safe there.\n[8] In early 2016 \u2013 sorry, the caller at certain times demanded that you and your family move back to Ghazni to repent for your sins and to work for the Taliban. You changed your phone number again and changed your SIM card.\n[9] You and your family moved to four different residents in Darul Aman neighbourhood of Kabul to avert risks of harm from the Taliban.\n[10] You left Afghanistan on [XXX], 2017 to go the United States for some training. Sometime after you went to the United States your family received a letter dated August 16th, 2017 from the Taliban in Ghazni at their residence in Kabul. The Taliban said that they knew that you\u2019d gone to the United States and threatened to punish you for that if you ever returned to Afghanistan.\n[11] You entered Canada on [XXX], 2017 by eluding a Port of Entry and you made a refugee claim in September 2017.\n[12] I find that you have established your identity as an Afghan citizen through your passport, tazkira and school documents which are in Exhibit 4.\n[13] I find that you are a credible witness. The Federal Court of Appeal stated in Maldonado that when a claimant swears that certain facts are true this creates a presumption that they are true unless there is a valid reason to doubt their truthfulness.\n[14] I have found you to be a credible witness and I therefore believe what you have alleged in support of your claim. You testified in a straightforward manner and there were no material inconsistencies in your testimony or contradictions between your testimony and the other evidence before me that has not been satisfactorily explained, either before the hearing or during the hearing.\n[15] You have provided documentary evidence to support your claim. I find that you have established that you were a [XXX] in the [XXX]. Your testimony was spontaneous and detailed. You provided documents to corroborate your work as a [XXX]. In Exhibit 4 you provided your [XXX] document and an identity document from the [XXX] in the United States to show that you did training there.\n[16] You have provided a personnel transfer document in Exhibit 7 corroborating your transfer from Paktika Province to Kabul. Your US visa also indicates that you were a [XXX]. In Exhibit 6 the Minister has provided your visa application and this also supports your employment as a [XXX] in the [XXX].\n[17] You have also provided -you have provided some documents to corroborate your father\u2019s employment in the [XXX] field. You provided his training certificates that your father received for completing training on [XXX]. You have provided a letter your family received from the Taliban and rental agreements to corroborate other elements of your claim.\n[18] I have also considered your interview with CBSA regarding your work as a [XXX] and find that your evidence generally has been consistent with that interview as well.\n[19] I noted that in Exhibit 16 the Minister has provided a letter and indicated that CBSA did not refer you to an inadmissibility hearing after investigating your work as a [XXX]. They found that you were responsible for [XXX] to prison facilities. You did not generally deal with prisoners directly and there was insufficient evidence in the Minister\u2019s view to find that you were inadmissible or excluded. There is no other evidence before me that would lead me to a different conclusion so I do not find that article 1(f)(a) exclusion is relevant to this claim.\n[20] I find that there is an objective basis to your claim. The UK Country Information Guide on Afghanistan NDP item 1.16 cites a variety of sources that conclude that government officials and civil servants and civilians associated with or perceived as supporting the government face significant risks of intimidation and targeted violence by Taliban and other insurgents.\n[21] This assessment is consistent with the UNHCR Eligibility Guidelines which state that security forces, particularly the Afghan National Police continue to be the object of targeted campaigns from anti-government elements including the Taliban. It states that both ALP \u2013 Afghan Local Police \u2013 and ANP officers have been targeted both on-duty and off-duty. AGEs are also reported to target officers of other police forces in Afghanistan as well as former members of the Afghan \u2013 the ANDSF.\n[22] I find that the harm you face, which includes death, bodily injury and the threat of these things, are sufficiently serious to constitute persecution.\n[23] I also find that your profile in and of itself is sufficient to ground your refugee claim. I find that your fear of persecution has a nexus to the Convention ground of political opinion or imputed political opinion as the Taliban and perhaps other insurgents view you as being aligned to the Afghan government as a [XXX].\n[24] I find that state protection is not available to you in Afghanistan. The documentary evidence before me illustrates that state protection mechanisms in Afghanistan are ineffective in protecting persons with your profile from harm. The UNHCR Eligibility Guidelines, NDP item 1.5 indicate that the rule of law is particularly weak in Afghanistan and the government has a limited capacity to respond to anti-government elements given the number and the scope of attacks by the Taliban and other insurgent groups.\n[25] The Guidelines state that the conflict continues to affect all parts of the country since the government\u2019s decision to defend population centers and strategic rural areas, fighting between AGEs and the Afghan government has intensified. AGEs are reported to have engaged in an increasing number of attacks deliberately targeting civilians particularly suicide, IED and complex attacks. AGEs continue to carry out large-scale attacks in Kabul and other cities and to consolidate their control across rural areas. Concerns have been expressed about the ANDSF\u2019s capability and effectiveness in ensuring security and stability across Afghanistan.\n[26] The Guidelines further state that even where the legal framework provides for the protection of human rights, the implementation of Afghanistan\u2019s commitments under national and international law to promote and protect these rights in practice frequently remains a challenge.\n[27] Afghan governance and the adherence to the rule of law are perceived to be as particularly weak. High levels of corruption challenges to effective governance and a climate of impunity are all reported by observers as factors that weaken the rule of law and undermine the ability of the state to provide protection from human rights violations.\n[28] Corruption is reported to affect many parts of the state apparatus on the national, provincial and local levels. Afghan citizens reportedly have to pay bribes to access public services such as to the provincial governor\u2019s office and the municipal governor\u2019s office and the custom\u2019s offices. Within the police, corruption is reported to be endemic as is the abuse of power and extortion.\n[29] The justice system is similarly reported to suffer from widespread corruption. The most recent US Department of State report on Afghanistan NDP item 2.1 observes that widespread disregard for the rule of law and official impunity for those who committed human rights abuses were serious problems.\n[30] I find that state protection would not be reasonably forthcoming to you in Afghanistan. The presumption of state protection has been rebutted by clear and convincing evidence.\n[31] I have also considered your failure to claim in the United States. You went there for training. You explained that you did not claim there because you understood that there was an understanding that you were to return to Afghanistan after training and you also believed, based on anecdotal information, that the US refugee system was quite slow and it would take a very, very long time for your claim to be heard and you are very concerned about the safety of your family and you did not want to wait for a very long time to re\u00ad unite with your family.\n[32] I find that your explanation generally is reasonable and I do not draw an negative inference based on your failure to claim in the United States.\n[33] I find that no viable internal flight alternative or IFA exists for you in Afghanistan. You were living in Kabul prior to leaving Afghanistan. Kabul is considered to be one of the safer parts of Afghanistan especially for lower profile targets. However, given the Taliban\u2019s extensive networks and the tribal and interconnecting nature of Afghan society, I do not find that there is a viable internal flight alternative for you in Afghanistan.\n[34] I have considered a Response to Information Request, NDP item 4.1 about internal relocation in Afghanistan. One source, a professor, explained that the Taliban may be able to find a person who relocates to a different area and that they have been successful in doing so particularly when targeting their well-known or well-positioned opponents.\n[35] Another source states that the Taliban generally has the capability to track individuals through the use of formal and informal communication networks to obtain information about a person\u2019s whereabouts. Various sources in this RIR describe the tribal and interconnected nature of Afghan society. People, especially in rural areas, are extremely perceptive of their environments and know when a new person comes into the village or travels through it.\n[36] According to the professor, it is more difficult to track people who have moved into urban environments, but even there the Taliban have spies and members who can gather considerable information. Tribal networks still operate in urban areas and he gives the example of the Taliban infiltrating and obtaining information from large refugee camps near Kabul.\n[37] Afghans are a tribal people and this allows them to, in part, know the circumstances of the people in their tribe or ethno-linguistic group. This is obviously easy to do at the local, district, and provincial level of their home locality but because of extended families or other dynamics one\u2019s identity is often hard to hide even when an Afghan leaves their home locality.\n[38] Accordingly, I find that you do not have an internal flight alternative in Afghanistan.\n[39] For the foregoing reasons, I find that you are a Convention refugee and I therefore accept your claim.\n\u2014PROCEEDINGS CONCLUDED\n",

It is the claim of Mr. [XXX]. The hearing took place on July 8, 2019, and the claimant was represented by counsel, Mr. Odaro Omonuwa. This was a return from the Refugee Appeal Division as the claimant had previously been denied on his refugee claim by a differently constituted Refugee Protection Division panel back in 2017.\n[2] I have considered your testimony and the other evidence in the case and I\u2019m ready to render my decision orally. When you receive a written form of these Reasons, they may be edited for spelling, syntax and grammar and references to the applicable case law and documentary evidence may also be included.\n[3] The claimant, Mr. [XXX], claims to be a citizen of Djibouti and is claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nDETERMINATION\n[4] I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee as the claimant does have a well-founded fear of persecution on a Convention ground in Djibouti. The nexus is his political opinion as a [XXX] of the RADDE Party, RADDE being the Rally for Action Democracy and Ecological Development and his claim was established on a sur place ground as the testimony focused entirely on the question of his political activity since leaving Djibouti. The testimony did not examine the allegations as they relate to the claimant\u2019s life before he left Djibouti for Canada. The main issue is credibility.\nIdentity\n[5] The claimant\u2019s national identity has been established by the testimony and the supporting documentation filed and entered in these proceedings. The current passport is on file, along with other documents. I am satisfied of the cm\u2019s identity.\nCredibility\n[6] I found the claimant to be a credible witness. He was able to reasonably explain why he had not amended his Basis of Claim Form sooner in his process. His explanations had to do with the lack of support that he had received up until very recently and that focused on the interpretation help he had at the time of the filing of his Basis of Claim Form, the limited and casual help that he had from a friend after that and what he described as deficient legal assistance up until recently, when he retained Counsel Omonuwa.\n[7] The three-page Basis of Claim Form amendment was accepted today and I note in finding that the claimant\u2019s explanations were credible that although some of the amendments were material to the allegations, such as a specific detention in Djibouti or how the claimant was able to leave the airport. Others were much less material, such as the correct date of birth of his parents or the vast number of siblings, only two of whom play a part in his Basis of Claim Form.\n[8] I find that the claimant was credibility established that he is a [XXX] of the RADDE group. He testified in a manner consistent with that. At Exhibit 5 he has provided documentary evidence in support of this. He was able to spontaneously testify on what has happened to the President of the RADDE in recent years and I note that his demeanour while testifying on these matters was notably relaxed, which went toward my favourable appreciation of his credibility. He did not have the body language of someone who was fabricating evidence.\n[9] I chose to focus on the sur place aspect of the claim as I found it was an efficient way of dealing with the vast material on file and the fact that this is now his second hearing and his insinuation that he was inadequately represented until he returned Counsel Omonuwa. His testimony on his political activities in Canada consisted of regular, but limited, due to restricted availability, and activities on Facebook where the claimant follows the posts of his political group and then shares those postings with other Djiboutians, who then to go on to share it with yet other people. The claimant was able to credibly explain who he shared this with and how he knew that they, in tum, shared it with others.\n[10] The claimant did not provide direct proof of his Facebook activities in this regard, but I believe him when he says he did post those opinions by sharing his party\u2019s posts as I found that his testimony on this was credible and his testimony on the fact that he is terribly busy as he works an awful lot in order to support his six children and his wife, all of whom are in Djibouti, makes sense to me in terms of explaining why he has not taken the time to provide direct proof of this and I\u2019ll note that his counsel, Mr. Omonuwa, had only been very recently retained, less than two weeks ago.\n[11] The claimant had already disclosed at Exhibit 8, page 2, a letter in support of his claim (indiscernible) submitting in his appeal to the Refugee Appeal Division. It is a letter in French issued by the Djiboutian Women for Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The organization is UDDESC (phonetic) and it seems to add civil and political rights among those in its letterhead. The claimant did not embellish by alleging that he knew everything that was in this letter, but he was able to credibly testify as to how he obtained the letter, stating that he had contacted his group, the RADDE, who had given him the name of this person who, according to him, is in Belgium, and that he had contacted this person and the letter is consistent with the claimant\u2019s oral testimony today and the letter does state that he is continuing his fight on social media. So I give weight to this letter in support of the claimant\u2019s allegations. I note that the reason for the claimant\u2019s lack of in-person political activity since he arrived in Canada has to do with the fact that his group, the RADDE, does not have an office or physical presence in Canada or North America and that is consistent with the objective country conditions evidence before me.\n[12] I find that the claimant has a well-founded fear of persecution based on the specific evidence of his Facebook activity and his continuing interest in the RADDE group. The monitoring of social media by Djiboutian authorities is established via the United States Department of State Report for Djibouti, which is at item 2.1 of the National Documentation Package, as well as in the Freedom House Report, which is at item 2.3 of the National Documentation Package, which is at Exhibit 3.\n[13] Both these documents also contribute to establishing the targeting and persecution of members of the opposition through the form of the surveillance of perceived opponents and harassment and arbitrary detention. Just to stay with the question of the monitoring of social media, the United States Department of State Report at item 2.1 explains that personnel from the security forces arrested two men in separate instances for posting (indiscernible) criticizing the government on Facebook and that one of them was arrested again for publishing a post on Facebook that criticized the government\u2019s decision to mandate school uniforms for public schools.\n[14] This targeting of opposition members takes the form of seizing of passports or refusal to renew passports. The claimant testified that the president of his party had significant and enduring problems with his passport. That is borne out by the objective country conditions evidence and the Department of State Report on Human Rights also indicates that opposition members reported immigration officials refused to renew their passports and prevented them from boarding international flights.\n[15] In terms of the fate that awaits the claimant, I note that the Freedom House Report states that in April 2018, so relatively recently, a human rights defender, [XXX], who is also the [XXX] of an unrecognized opposition movement called Movement for Development and Liberty, was arbitrarily detained and had his passport confiscated and his home searched upon return U.N. related human rights activities abroad. I note that the claimant\u2019s group, the RADDE, has also not been officially registered in Djibouti in spite of having attempted regularly to be registered and the authorities of Djibouti refuse to do so.\n[16] There is further evidence of relatively recent targeting of the RADDE group. For example, in the Freedom House Report it says that in March 2018 the police raided the headquarters of the unrecognised group RADDE, confiscated their equipment and arrested one person as the party was preparing non-violent demonstrations. The U.S. Department of State Report has stated government authorities refused to renew the passport of opposition leader of the RADDE.\n[17] The U.S. Department of State Report states that the Ministry of Interior refused to recognize three opposition political parties, among them the RADDE, and that members of those political parties were routinely arrested and detained for illegal political activity and that on March 23, 2018, authorities arrested a security guard at an annex of the RADDE opposition party and he was detained for one day and released with instructions to evacuate the space and that the youth delegate for the RADDE Party, a man called [XXX] was arrested on October 21 and remained detained.\n[18] So I find that there\u2019s objective country condition evidence to establish that, as a returnee, a supporter of the RADDE who has posted information on Facebook or forwarded or shared information on Facebook that is critical of the Djiboutian government and that was produced by a group that the government continues to refuse to recognize and the government regularly targets, the claimant has established a well-founded fear of persecution. I note that arbitrary arrests and detain amount to persecution, as is the confiscation of one\u2019s passport or refusal to renew the passport as a result of political opinion.\n[19] That leads me to the last two questions, state protection and internal flight alternative. Given that the alleged agent of persecution is the state, I find that state protection in Djibouti would not be particularly forthcoming in this case and that the presumption of state protection is rebutted by the objective country conditions evidence. As the Djiboutian state is in control of the entire territory of Djibouti, I find that there is no internal flight alternative for the claimant and that he faces a serious possibility of persecution throughout Djibouti.\n[20] In conclusion, having considered all of the evidence, I determine that there is a serious possibility that the claimant would be persecuted in Djibouti for his political opinion. The claimant was credible. Having come to this conclusion, I have not conducted further assessment under section 97(1). I conclude that the claimant is a Convention refugee and I therefore accept his claim.\n\u2014 DECISION CONCLUDED\n",

Hayes\n\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Sarah Jamali\n\nCountry: Saudi Arabia\n\nRPD Number: TB9-13037\n\nATIP Number: A-2020-01459\n\nATIP Pages: 000197-000200\nREASONS FOR DECISION\nOn November 21, 2019, the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) heard the claim of [XXX] who claims refugee protection under sections 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA). On that same day, the panel rendered its oral positive decision and Reasons for decision. This is the written version of the oral decision and Reasons that have been edited for clarity, spelling, grammar and syntax with added references to the documentary evidence and relevant case law where appropriate.\nINTRODUCTION\n[1] I have considered your testimony, and the other evidence in the case, and I am ready to render my decision orally.\n[2] These are the reasons for the decision in the claim of [XXX], who claims to be a citizen of Saudi Arabia, and is claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[3] In rendering my reasons, I have considered and applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guidelines on Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution.\nALLEGATIONS\n[4] The allegations of your claim are fully set out in your Basis of Claim (BOC) form. Very briefly, you have suffered extreme physical and emotional abuse from your mother all your life. As well, your brothers and your ex-husband were very emotionally and physically abusive towards you, and your ex-husband is abusive towards your four minor children. You sought police protection, but protection was not forthcoming. You fear returning to Saudi Arabia where you will continue to face violent mistreatment, death threats, and emotional abuse at the hands of the agents of persecution. You were able to escape from Saudi Arabia to come to Canada to make a refugee claim. Despite efforts to date to bring your four minor children to Canada, you were forced to leave them in Saudi Arabia in the circumstances.\nDETERMINATION\n[5] I find that you are a Convention refugee as you have established a serious possibility of persecution should you return to Saudi Arabia based on the grounds in section 96.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[6] I find that your identity as a national of Saudi Arabia is established by a certified true copy of your Saudi passport, as well as by your testimony.\nNexus\n[7] I find that you have established a nexus to section 96 by reason of your membership in a particular social group, that being your gender.\nCredibility\n[8] I find that you were a credible witness and I accept the allegations in your claim. You testified in a straightforward manner and there were no inconsistencies between your testimony and the documents before me, such as the Port of Entry notes and your 151 paragraph BOC narrative and amendments that detail the lifetime of domestic torture and abuse you have suffered as a woman in Saudi Arabia. I was concerned that you did not take more steps to obtain additional documentary evidence such as your children\u2019s Birth Certificates. However, I accept your explanation that trying to obtain those documents would likely cause problems with your children\u2019s father. You did submit a recent medical report that corroborates the burn scars all over your body are consistent with the injuries inflicted on you by your mother when you were a child, as you describe in your BOC; a letter from the Refugee Law Office that corroborates that you obtained legal advice earlier this year regarding the legal risks of re-availing to Turkey to bring your children back to Canada; the custody order obtained by your ex-husband, and the custody order obtained by you, which describes the harm your children suffered at the hands of your ex-husband. I have no reasons to doubt the authenticity of the evidence you submitted and find that the evidence supports and corroborates the allegations in your claim.\nObjective basis of future risk\n[9] Based on the credibility of your allegations, and the objective country condition evidence, I find that you have established a well founded fear and a future risk that you will be subjected to mistreatment and violence at the hands of the agents of persecution, in a country where women have limited rights, and there are reports of judges and police returning women to their abusers.1 The fact that you face these risks is corroborated by the documents submitted by you in Exhibit 5, as well as numerous documents in the National Documentation Package (NDP) for Saudi Arabia (March 29, 2019), including Items 2.1, 2.2, 2.4, and 5.6.\nNature of the harm\n[10] The harm you have faced, and would face upon return to Saudi Arabia, clearly amounts to persecution.\nState protection\n[11] I accept that you sought state protection, but protection was not forthcoming. Your experience is consistent with the country conditions described in the above cited documentary evidence. As such, I find that you have rebutted the presumption of state protection, as there is clear and convincing evidence before me that the state is unable to provide you with adequate protection.\nInternal flight alternative (IFA)\n[12] With regards to an IFA, I find that there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout Saudi Arabia, as one of the agents of persecution is the father of your children, and this close family connection means that he could likely locate you anywhere in the country.\nCONCLUSION\n[13] Based on this analysis I conclude that you are a Convention refugee and accept your claim.\n1 Exhibit 3, National Documentation Package (NDP) for Saudi Arabia (March 29, 2019), Item 2.1.\n",

Cortes Diaz\n\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Daniel Tilahun Kebede\n\nCountry: Ethiopia\n\nRPD Number: TB9-12020\n\nATIP Number: A-2020-01459\n\nATIP Pages: 000193-000196\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: So, I have considered your testimony and the other evidence in the case and I am ready to render my oral decision.\n[2] I would like to add that when written decisions are issued, a written form of these reasons may be edited for spellings, syntax, and grammar and references to the applicable case law and documentary evidence may also be included.\n[3] So, the principal claimant [XXX] claims to be citizen of Ethiopia and is claiming refugee protection pursuant to Sections 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[4] I find that you are a Convention refugee pursuant to Section 96 of the IRPA.\n[5] The claimant fears for her safety at the hands of Ethiopian authorities due to her perceived anti\u00ad government profile and her profile as an Oromo.\n[6] She is perceived by the State to hold anti-State political views and view as a supporter of member of the OLF, Oromo Liberation Front. The details of your claims are documented in your Basis of Claim Form and were elaborated by you orally during the hearing.\nIDENTITY:\n[7] Your personal and national identity as a national of Ethiopia has been established on a balance of probabilities through the passport on File at Exhibit 1 in your oral testimony.\nCREDIBILITY:\n[8] With regard to credibility, I have found you to be a credible witness even though you were very general in the way that you answered the questions.\n[9] I found no relevant inconsistencies in your testimony or contradictions between your testimony and the other evidence before me. Given that I have found you to be a credible witness, I also accept what you have alleged in support of your claim including the following.\n[10] You work in Ethiopia in the [XXX] and you were subjected to discriminatory attitudes because of your ethnicity, reluctance to join the government party and for being a woman.\n[11] You were perceived as a supporter or member of the OLF, this is in part due to your friendship and closeness with Mr. [XXX] (ph), your reluctance join the EPRDF and your Oromo ethnicity.\n[12] Mr. [XXX] (ph) was incarcerated for his political beliefs and you visited him three times in the month of August in 2018.\n[13] Soon after you were detained, interrogated and beaten during these three interviews with the police where they accused you of having anti-government views. You were released with conditions to report to the police every week.\n[14] You also presented documents in support of your claim, I wont go through everything but includes the supporting letter your sister wrote, the letter from [XXX] (ph) and your [XXX] that attests your profession in [XXX], the harassment you experienced in Ethiopia and your incarceration.\n[15] Given your general credibility, I have no reasons to doubt the authenticity of the documentary evidence.\nOBJECTIVE BASIS:\n[16] The overall objective evidence supports the claim. Items 1.5 and 2.1 among other indicate that in the past Ethiopian authorities regularly arrested, detained, and harassed persons including journalists in particular and their family members for criticising the government or for being supporters or perceived supporters of opposition groups.\n[17] In April 2018, there was a significant change in the political landscape of Ethiopia when Abiy Ahmed Ali became Prime Minister. Item 2.1 indicates that Abiy\u2019s assumption of office was followed by positive changes in the human rights climate.\n[18] The government decriminalize political movements that had been accused of treason in the past, invited opposition leaders to return to the country and resume political activities, allow peaceful rallies and demonstration, enable the formation of new political parties and media outlets, continued steps to release thousands of political prisoner and <inaudible> provisions or repressive law.\n[19] However, objective evidence at Exhibit 4 indicated that despite these positive changes, there is not yet any fundamental and structural change in Ethiopian politics and the political atmosphere remains oppressive.\n[20] For example, we have the report from Ethiopian Human Rights Council dated July 18th, 2019, which your counsel submitted, which talks about the Ethiopian Government arresting and killing all suspects of having participate in the failed coup attempt which happened in the same year, 182 Ethiopians were arrested and many were killed as suspected of supporting this effort.\nSTATE PROTECTION:\n[21] With regard to State protection, given that the State is the agent of persecution, I find it will be objectively unreasonable for you to seek protection of the State in your circumstances.\n[22] With regard to internal flight alternative, given that the State is an agent of persecution with control over the entire country, I find there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout Ethiopia and therefore a viable internal flight alternative does not exist.\n[23] My conclusion is having considered all the evidence I find there is a serious possibility that you will face persecution in Ethiopia.\n[24] I conclude that you are a Convention refugee and therefore I accept your claim. Welcome to Canada, thank you, counsel good work.\n[25] COUNSEL: Thank you.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

Loebach\n\nCountry: Iraq\n\nRPD Number: TB8-32936\n\nAssociated RPD Number(s): TB8-33006, TB8-33007\n\nATIP Number: A-2020-01459\n\nATIP Pages: 000183-000192\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: We are back on the record now, I\u2019ve had an opportunity to carefully consider, examine, and weigh all the totality of the evidence which is before me.\n[2] I find that there is sufficient, credible, and trustworthy evidence before me to establish that the claimant has a well founded fear of persecution in Iraq. I am going to be delivering my oral reasons from the bench providing analysis of how I came to this decision.\n[3] I did ask madam interpreter to do simultaneous translation and she will do that to the best of her ability.\n[4] INTERPRETER: I just don\u2019t want to interrupt.\n[5] MEMBER: Yeah, that\u2019s fine. She will do that to the best of her ability, so she is going to go to the back of the hearing room and then what I am going to do is just, in the interim I am going to return all the original documents to counsel on the record so that she has all her documents.\n[6] Okay, the claimant, Ms. [XXX] and her two minor children [XXX] and [XXX] are claiming to be citizens of Iraq and are claiming refugee protection pursuant to Sections 96 and 97of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[7] I find that the claimants are Convention refugees for the following reason:\n[8] Firstly, with respect to my analysis, I am going to address the issue of the claimants\u2019 identity.\n[9] I have before me true certified copies of all of claimants\u2019 Iraqi passports are which are in Exhibit 1 which is in evidence before. I find based on those documents alone that there is sufficient, credible, and trustworthy evidence to establish on a balance of probabilities that they are who they claim to be and that they are citizens of Iraq and no other country.\n[10] So, I have assessed this claim only against the country of Iraq. In terms of the issues as I mentioned at the outset of the hearing, for me the determinative issue was the claimants\u2019 credibility.\n[11] Of course the principal claimant was the one who testified here this afternoon and overall I found that her testimony was credible.\n[12] It was generally consistent with all the very detailed information that she provided in her Basis of Claim Form, the original narrative, the amended narrative along with the addendums that were also filed into evidence.\n[13] The claimant, in addition to her testimony, did provide supporting documents to corroborate key aspects of her refugee claim that really substantiate and go to the heart of this refugee claim.\n[14] Especially as it relates to the aspect of this claim regarding the domestic violence which the claimant was subjected to at the hands of her ex-husbands [XXX] and [XXX] (ph) who was her second husband.\n[15] In the claimants\u2019 supporting documents, she provided some key pieces of evidence, these are witness statements. There is one in Exhibit C15 from counsel\u2019s disclosure which again corroborates that she was married to [XXX] who was [XXX], her first husband and that he was abusing her and beating her, that he was also abusive towards her daughter [XXX] and it confirms that her second husband was [XXX] (ph) and that he is a Shia Muslim who is influential with the government of Iraq and that he too subjected her to violence and beatings and also was abusive towards her eldest daughter [XXX], this is Exhibit C15 and this is page 3.\n[16] Identification documentation has been attached to this witness statement to verify the person who has written this statement.\n[17] There was also another witness statement and it is at page 15 of Exhibit C14, again which corroborates central aspects of this refugee claim namely that she was in two marriages and they were abusive marriages, she suffered at the hands of her first husband and her second husband, that she also was threatened by both husbands and this is at page 15.\n[18] There is also a transcription of some recorded information messages that were received by the claimant and again it corroborates the fact that her ex-husband [XXX] (ph) as recent as May of 2018 made a very serious threat against her, also not only threatening her personally but also threatening her daughter [XXX] and in this message he is boasting saying how powerful and how influential he is and that he knows people all over the world and that nothing will stop him in terms of achieving his own aims and goals.\n[19] He is also threatening to, he alleges also that he has got connections with ISIS and that he will seek retribution against her daughters through ISIS and this is found in Exhibit again Cl4 and it\u2019s page 8.\n[20] There is a further documentation page 3, it\u2019s a receipt and what this document is that it\u2019s a receipt of monies that she had to repay her ex-husband [XXX] (ph) in order to get a divorce from him and this is also outlined in her narrative and this document corroborates that.\n[21] She had to pay a very large sum of money in order to facilitate getting a divorce from him.\n[22] The claimant also provided a lot of documentation that confirms and corroborates the fact that she was in a relationship, she was married to two different men, there are marriage certificate for her first husband, marriage certificate for her second husband along with the divorce certificates for both ex\u00ad husbands and those are at Exhibit CS of counsel\u2019s materials and that information is consistent with the information we have in the claimants Basis of Claim Form, the addendums, the amendments that were made, that information is consistent.\n[23] The claimant also corroborated another element of her refugee claim that is central. She has indicated, has been very specific about her profile.\n[24] She said that she is a [XXX], trained as a [XXX]. She upgraded her skills and underwent further training and schooling and is now [XXX], a [XXX], she was practicing in Iraq.\n[25] There is a lot of supporting documentation that establishes that in fact she was a [XXX], a [XXX], a [XXX], an [XXX] and this is at Exhibit C7 of counsel\u2019s materials.\n[26] There are numerous school documents, school transcripts from various schools, from various medical associations, from various professional boards that again corroborate her background as [XXX].\n[27] There was one other document, I wanted to mention which is again part of C14, this is a very detailed letter from her brother-in-law [XXX] (ph) where again he corroborates the fact that she has been married twice, had been abused twice by her ex-husbands.\n[28] She has been threatened by them, beaten up by them, they have been abusive to her children as well in particular, [XXX], and that the claimant has received threats and that\u2019s page 11 of Exhibit C14 and there was a correction made and we have an affidavit of correction that was provided this afternoon and that is before me as well and there was a change in the date.\n[29] I also find that there were no major contradictions or inconsistencies or discrepancies internal to her testimony or between her testimony and all other evidence which is before me.\n[30] I find that her testimony is also credible in the context of the objective country information on Iraq. Domestic violence is very prevalent, it is widespread. The authorities don\u2019t provide adequate or effective State protection to victims of domestic violence.\n[31] The women who are medical practitioners in the public domain are also targets and they receive threats from militants from extremists be they Shia, Sunni extremists because of the fact that they are women and they are professionals, they are doctors.\n[32] So, the fact that she was threatened by extremists is not surprising in light of the objective country information is entirely plausible.\n[33] I also find that the claimant has established on balance of probabilities a nexus, actually to several grounds in the Convention refugee definition under Section 96. There is a nexus to her gender and I have taken into consideration the Chairperson\u2019s guidelines on gender based persecution.\n[34] There is another aspect, another nexus she has established. She is a [XXX], that is another ground, I find that this claim is also based on that ground, which is membership in a particular social group.\n[35] And then I also find there is a further nexus which is victim of domestic violence which again is a particular social group.\n[36] So, really there are three different grounds upon which I find the claimant has established a nexus under Section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[37] Now, I find that taking into consideration all those evidence that clearly the claimant has been able to establish that she has subjective fear of extremists, terrorists, be they Sunni, Shia, and also fear of her ex-husbands at whose hands she was subjected to horrendous and appalling physical, emotional and psychological violence.\n[38] Turning to the objective basis, I find that there is also sufficient objective evidence to demonstrate that her subjective fear as a woman, as a [XXX], and as a victim of domestic violence, is well founded and I am going to refer to some of the documentation found in the National Documentation Package which I find demonstrates that the claimant\u2019s fear of persecution is based on good grounds and that it is objectively well-founded.\n[39] There is a UNHCR Report in the National Documentation Package Item 1.7 which makes it very clear that doctors and medical professionals are one of the groups who are at risk in Iraq.\n[40] It is individuals that have this particular profile that are subjected to targeted attacks and Item 1.7 has a section that outlines these different risk profiles, one of them is doctors and medical professionals and the report goes on and states that health professionals have been killed, maimed, and kidnapped and thousands of armed Sunni and Shia groups and criminal gangs since the fall of the former regime of Saddam Hussain.\n[41] According to the Iraqi Ministry of Health, more than 600 medical personnel were killed between 2003 and 2008 and 8000 of Iraq\u2019s 15,500 doctors resigned in the same period with many having left Iraq subsequently.\n[42] The Iraqi Medical Association has estimated the number of doctors killed since 2003 are closer to 2000.\n[43] The reports goes on and talks about the motivation behind some of these targeted attacks and it goes on and states the exact motives for attacks on medical professionals are difficult to establish and is rare for identified perpetrators to be charged or convicted.\n[44] There is speculation that victims are targeted on the basis of their ethnic, religious background, their social status or perceived political opinion, criminal motivations, or personal, or tribal acts of revenge may be relevant factors.\n[45] However, even in such cases, elements such as a victim\u2019s religion or ethnic identity may also be relevant. And as the claimant testified this afternoon, she was [XXX], [XXX] at a hospital and then she received a letter that was threatening her personally and she said that her understanding of why this happened and what the motive was is that she is Sunni practicing in an area which is predominantly Shia, so it was her belief that\u2019s what really motivated the attack by way of this threat, that was received in written form when she was [XXX].\n[46] And this is supported as I just referred to. the documents support what is saying that\u2019s probably more likely than not the motivation behind that targeted attack on her and that\u2019s the reason why they issued this threat against her because she is a member of a minority religion, the Sunni religion practicing in an area in Baghdad which is predominantly Shia and we know from the documents also there has been a lot of Sectarian violence between Shia and Sunni Muslims and the government that\u2019s in place in Baghdad is a Shia Government and through these various Shia militias the government has essentially carried out a campaign of ethnic cleansing wanting to push out any Sunnis.\n[47] There is also problem become the authorities perceive Sunnis to be terrorists, supporters of ISIS, the Islamic State, so clearly I find that in this case which is supported by the objective documents, this attack on the claimant when she received this threat is clearly motivated in part by her religion, the fact that she is a Sunni practicing medicine in an area that is predominantly Shia.\n[48] This very same report talks about and it confirms what I just, as it talks about Sunni Arabs who are living in essentially a majority Shia area and it says that even the demographics of Baghdad have changed over time.\n[49] Initially Shias lived peacefully next to Sunnis and there was harmony and there was tranquillity and people got along with one another with one another and after the fall of the Iraqi regime under Saddam Hussain everything changed and violence flared up between Sunni groups and Shia groups and there have been many attacks by Shia extremists including militias on members of the Sunni religion and this is supported again by the objective documents that I was just referring to in the UNHCR Report.\n[50] There is another section in this report that says that not only are doctors and professionals at risk in Iraq but women also that have specific profiles or that face particular circumstances are also at risk and it goes onto state that while those killed and maimed in violence since 2003 have mostly been men, women are also caught up in indiscriminate attacks including in attacks aimed at their husbands or other male family members for example work as policemen, politicians, or government officials.\n[51] Women have also been singled out for attacks in particular, if they have assumed a public role as politicians, government officials, rights activists, or professionals such as the claimant others including women of religious minority groups which is also the claimant, she is Sunni, have been targeted for not conforming to conservative Islamic or traditional norms, for example concerning their dress or because they have considered to have brought shame to their family\u2019s honour.\n[52] And if we think back to the claimant\u2019s testimony in evidence about her second husband [XXX] (ph), he was a Shia, and he didn\u2019t like the fact that his wife was Sunni and he tried to force her to convert from the Sunni religion to the Shia religion.\n[53] He also many times tried to force her to wear the hijab even though she didn\u2019t want to. The report goes on and says that violence against women, this is another profile, people who are at risk in Iraq, violence against women and girls have reportedly increased since 2003 and according to most observers continued unabated.\n[54] Women and girls in Iraq are victims of societal, legal, and economic discriminations, abductions, and killings for political, sectarian or criminal reasons, sexual violence, forced displacement, domestic violence, honour killings, and other harmful traditional practices as well as sex trafficking and forced prostitution.\n[55] Iraqi women and girls are reported to face violence at the hands of range of actors including armed groups, members of law enforcement agencies, and their extended families and community and most violence against women and girls notably appears to be perpetrated with impunity.\n[56] According to the reports, the main reasons why victims of gender based violence refrain from reporting sexual abuse and rape, forced marriage, and domestic violence, as well as FGM, is their fear of retaliation by the perpetrator or the family community for tainting their honour.\n[57] Reports further indicate that women often fear that would not receive protection from law enforcement agencies and courts given that gender based violence often treated leniently while certain forms of violence including domestic violence, trafficking and FGM are not criminalized by Iraqi law.\n[58] The reports goes onto state that generally speaking the authorities have only very limited capacity to prevent, protect, and prosecute in cases of violence against women.\n[59] So, clearly the documents speak volumes when it comes to victims of domestic violence, not only that they are their targets but that the response from the State is largely inadequate and ineffective.\n[60] The report goes on and states that law enforcement and judicial personnel often disregard domestic violence cases and merely focus on criminal charges brought against women.\n[61] What also I find makes the claimant\u2019s situation even more vulnerable and puts her at even greater risk as a woman facing gender based persecution is the fact that she was married twice, she is divorced twice, she has two young children and essentially she is on her own, she is a single parent with two young kids.\n[62] The report speaks to that as well and it goes onto say that women without male support including widows, women whose husbands are missing or detained and divorcees are most affected.\n[63] Traditionally they would move in with their families or their in-laws after the loss of their husbands; however, these relatives are often unable to provide substantial support given their own economic destitution.\n[64] In addition many female headed households have been displaced and as a result have been separated from their extended families and traditional support networks, most women headed households in central and southern Iraq do not receive government welfare.\n[65] It goes on to say that overall many females headed households are lacking the means to provide for themselves and their children and remain among the most vulnerable in the country.\n[66] Women without support and protection provided by their family or travel network are particularly vulnerable to being harassed, kidnapped, or sexually assaulted.\n[67] There is another report that talks about the situation facing Sunni Arab Muslims in Iraq and that\u2019s at Item 1.20 of the National Documentation Package which is a British Home Office Report and it gives numerous examples of were Sunnis have been arbitrarily detained, tortured, and even killed at the hands of Shia extremists, at the hands of the Iraqi security forces and the report goes onto say that essentially the authorities are in no position to be able to protect Sunnis from this type of violence that they are either unwilling, some of the documents suggest they are either unwilling or they are simply unable to provide adequate protection.\n[68] This is not surprising when you consider that in many cases the perpetrators are these Shia militias which seem to have free reign in the country and seem to be able to operate independently of the Iraqi Forces.\n[69] The documents to a great extent indicate that not only do they support the central government in Baghdad, but that the central government supports them and supports what they are doing which is to a large extent ethnic cleansing, trying to eliminating, get rid of Sunnis from the area of Baghdad, so that it becomes predominantly a Shia area.\n[70] So, there are many references in this report to attacks on Sunnis by Shia militias and Shia extremists in the central Baghdad, because they are members of minority religion and that this continues to happen in the country and in this report there is reference to a passage were it states within majority Shia community, Abadi continues to struggle politically against the growing influence of Shia militia commanders who operate independently of the official military chain of command, have close ties to Iranian leaders and question the Abadi Government\u2019s alliance with the United States.\n[71] The government has needed to rely on militias in some battles against the Islamic State.\n[72] Some of the Shia militia leaders seem to combat the Islamic State without the participation of Sunni fighters who many experts assert are key to completely defeating Islamic State Forces and in Section 7 of this report, there is a heading, Shia militia abuses which give many examples of targeted attacks against members of the Sunni community which includes forced displacement, kidnappings, abductions, and killings.\n[73] Now, so I find that given that these Shia militias are in fact connected to central government of Iraq and the central government of Iraq acquiesces and lets them do pretty much whatever they want to do, I find that it would be objectively unreasonable in the particular circumstances of the claimant to expect her to go to the Iraqi central authorities to ask for protection.\n[74] This is a government that does not support Sunnis. This is a government that allows Shia militia\u2019s which are essentially extremist groups to carry out their own agendas and to target, detain, torture, and kill members of a minority religious groups which are the Sunnis.\n[75] I find that even if the claimant could approach the authority\u2019s protection, I find objectively speaking that it would not reasonably be forthcoming given the fact that there is a strong alliance between the central authorities in Baghdad and these Shia militias.\n[76] The other issue that I turn my mind to is the issue of internal flight alternative, I find that in the particular circumstances of these claimants that there is no realistic or viable or attainable internal flight alternative in any other part of the country outside of Baghdad and this is for several reasons.\n[77] We are talking about a woman who is essentially for all intents and purposes a single mother, two young children, she has been divorced.\n[78] The documents say that women divorcees are highly stigmatized. It also mentions there are significant legal restrictions that prevent freedom of movement for women, especially when they are own their own, they are single, they don\u2019t have a male guardian, so that also would make an internal flight alternative not feasible given that the claimant\u2019s particular circumstances.\n[79] Also important to note that throughout the country outside of Baghdad, there are checkpoints everywhere, there is Islamic State and ISIS, there is Shia militias that are operating at their own checkpoints.\n[80] The claimant finds herself in a very precarious and very dangerous situation, because even if she try to go to any of these areas, she could very well encounter these checkpoints which are manned by ISIS.\n[81] ISIS is an extremists group, they are terrorists, they target professionals, they target women who are in the public domain working as medical practitioners, the same applies to Shia militias.\n[82] The claimant is working and is a woman and in an area that used to be male dominated profession and in the sense in that respect is transgressing Islamic norms and values and Sharia law and that also puts her in as situation were she could face serious peril if she tried to move around the country to try to find a safe place.\n[83] I find that it wouldn\u2019t reasonable to expect that she could go to some of these other locations without any obstacles or any obstructions, I find that on a contrary I think it would be unduly harsh to expect her to be able to move around as a single woman who is highly stigmatized, who has been divorced, who doesn\u2019t have a male guardian or support figure and who has been targeted by way of domestic violence, has been threatened by extremist groups because she was working as a [XXX], as a [XXX].\n[84] So, I find that given these particular circumstances that the claimants do not have a viable internal flight alternative anywhere else in the country outside of Baghdad.\n[85] It is also important to know with respect to my analysis of the internal flight alternative that we also have evidence that her ex-husband [XXX] (ph) is influential. He is connected to the government. He is and even based on some of the threats he has made, he seems to suggest that he has the ability to track the principal claimant\u2019s movements, her family\u2019s movements and he seems to be strongly motivated to do so because even though they were divorced in 2012, he hasn\u2019t stopped threatening her and we have that evidence before me.\n[86] So, for that reason also it makes no sense for her to try to relocate to some other part of the country when you are dealing with an individual who is a Shia who seems to have connections with the government but also with fundamentalist extremists groups.\n[87] So, for that reason also I find that the claimant doesn\u2019t have a viable internal flight alternative.\n[88] So, for all those reasons, I find that claimant faces more than a mere possibility, a reasonable chance, a serous possibility that she would be persecuted if she were to return to Iraq today.\n[89] The same applies to her young minor children who are also members of particular social group, namely the family. They too are victims of domestic violence and they too are being targeted and threats have been made against them, in particular the eldest daughter [XXX].\n[90] So, that brings us to the end of the hearing, this hearing is now concluded. I want to thank everybody for their participation, thank you Madam Interpreter for your assistance. This matter is now concluded.\n[91] INTERPRETER: Thank you Mr. Bafaro.\n[92] MEMBER: Thank you\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2019 RLLR 109\n\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\n\nDate of Decision: November 26, 2019\n\nPanel: Avril Cardoso\n\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Medhat Mary Ghobrial\n\nCountry: Eritrea\n\nRPD Number: TB8-28669\n\nATIP Number: A-2020-01459\n\nATIP Pages: 000176-000182\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] The claimant, [XXX] is seeking refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Act1.\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] The claimant\u2019s allegations are fully set out in her Basis of Claim form (BOC). In summary she alleges a fear of persecution in Eritrea at the hands of the government due to her anti\u00adgovernment political opinion.\nDETERMINATION\n[3] I find that the claimant is a Convention refugees pursuant to section 96 of the Act.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[4] The claimant\u2019s personal and national identity as a citizen of Eritrea has been established on a balance of probabilities by a true copy of her passport2 and national ID card.\nCredibility\n[5] When a claimant swears that certain facts are true, this creates a presumption of truth unless there is valid reason to doubt their veracity.\n[6] The claimant\u2019s testimony about her anti-government actual and imputed political opinion in Eritrea is consistent with her profile. His testimony was spontaneous and materially consistent with her narrative and supporting documents. The minor inconsistencies in the claimant\u2019s evidence were not sufficient to overcome the credibility of her testimony and the documentary evidence.\nThe claimant and her spouse refused to join the ruling PFDJ party\n[7] The claimant testified that the People\u2019s Front for Democracy and Justice (PFDJ) which is the government in power sent her husband two letters in 2016 asking him to join the party. She said her husband refused and said he was too busy. The claimant said there was no further contact at that time from the PFDJ. She testified that in 2017, she was asked to join the women\u2019s wing of the PFDJ. The claimant testified that the party sent her a letter. When asked why she did not provide a copy of the letter, she said she did not think about it.\n[8] I find that the claimant\u2019s explanation is unreasonable. She is a business owner and the letter requiring her to join the PFDJ is regarding the central issue in her claim. However, the claimant\u2019s testimony regarding the letters from the PFDJ sent to her and her husband is consistent with her BOC and there is no valid reason to doubt her credibility. Therefore corroborating documents are not necessary in these circumstances3.\nThe claimant is sought after by the PFDJ\n[9] The claimant testified that after she left Eritrea on [XXX] 2018 the authorities have searched her home, shut down her businesses and frozen her bank account. She testified that she obtained this information through her neighbour because her two daughters who were in Eritrea left the country in [XXX] 2018 and her husband was arrested on or about August 2018.\n[10] The claimant testified that the authorities left a document at her house. She said she asked her neighbour to send her a picture of the document but her neighbour did not do so and she believes her neighbour has since left Eritrea as she has been unable to contact her since approximately November 2018. When asked for any documents regarding her testimony that her bank account was frozen, she testified that she has nobody else left in Eritrea to contact and nobody is looking after her home and that her bank did not have a presence in Canada where she could obtain information about her bank account.\n[11] The claimant submitted a business licence and a letter from the Housing and Commerce Bank of Eritrea in support of her testimony. The letter from the bank indicates that her bank balance as of May 17, 2018 was [XXX] Nakfa. In her BOC she stated that her bank account has a balance of [XXX] Nakfa. When asked to explain the discrepancy, the claimant said the letter was for her chequing account and her savings account had a balance [XXX] Nakfa. I find the claimant\u2019s explanation unreasonable. The bank letter indicates that the account is a savings account not a chequing account. I draw a negative inference from the claimant\u2019s explanation.\nThe claimant was of interest to the authorities prior to leaving Eritrea\n[12] The claimant testified that when she applied for an exit visa to leave Eritrea to come to Canada for her grandchild\u2019s baptism, she was refused. She said her husband and his friends bribed immigration officials in Eritrea and she was able to obtain an exit visa on May 3, 2018 and she went to Kampala, Uganda to apply for a Canadian visa. This evidence demonstrates on a balance of probabilities that the claimant was of interest to the authorities as her exit visa request was denied and she left Eritrea through irregular means.\nThe claimant\u2019s husband was detained since she left Eritrea\n[13] In the claimant\u2019s BOC she states that one of her three daughters left Eritrea in 2014 after completing mandatory conscription and claimed refugee protection in Ethiopia. In her BOC she states that her husband was subsequently detained for six weeks at the Adi Abieto prison likely because the authorities believed he assisted his daughter in leaving Eritrea. She testified that after her neighbour told her that her husband had been arrested in approximately August 2018, her remaining two daughters managed to exit Eritrea when the border with Ethiopia opened in September 2018. The claimant submitted refugee documents in support of her testimony that all her three daughters are residing in Ethiopia. She testified that she has not been able to obtain any further information about her husband\u2019s whereabouts. I find on a balance of probabilities that the claimant\u2019s husband has been detained or arrested since she has come to Canada.\n[14] An unknown number of persons disappeared which are not investigated by the government. Nor are family members notified about the status of detainees and disappeared persons included those detained for political or religious beliefs4. Furthermore, although the law and unimplemented constitution prohibit arbitrary arrest and detention, such acts remain widespread. Reasons for arrest include criticizing the government5.\nFailure to claim in Uganda reasonably explained\n[15] The claimant arrived in Uganda on [XXX] 2018 and left Uganda for Canada on [XXX], 2018. When asked why she did not claim protection in Uganda, the claimant said she had a letter of invitation to come to Canada for her granddaughter\u2019s baptism and went to Uganda to apply for her Canadian visa. I find the claimant\u2019s explanation reasonable. She was in Uganda for a short period awaiting the issuance of her Canadian visa and she explained that she did not leave right away on [XXX] 2018 when her visa was issued as her ticket was for [XXX] 2018. There is no evidence that the Eritrean authorities were seeking the claimant at this time.\nDelay in claiming for protection in Canada\n[16] After arriving in Canada on [XXX] 2018 the claimant filed for protection on October 31, 2018. When asked to explain the delay in claiming, the claimant testified that she had intended to return to Eritrea however once she heard her husband had been detained or arrested and that her house was searched and her bank accounts had been frozen, she decided to seek protection in Canada. I find the claimant\u2019s explanation for the short delay to be reasonable and consistent with her other testimony.\nObjective basis\n[17] Item 2.1 of the Eritrea NDP August 30, 20196 indicates that Eritrea is a highly centralized, authoritarian regime under the control of President Isaias Afwerki. The People\u2019s Front for Democracy and Justice (PFDJ), headed by the president, is the sole political party. Item 9.2 indicates that ordinary judicial procedures are not in place in Eritrea where the rule of law is absent. This document also indicates that in cases of a political nature summonses are not issued7.\n[18] The authorities are intolerant of dissent and those who fail to maintain loyalty to the one party ruling party risk imprisonment8.\n[19] Item 8.8 indicates that individuals forcefully repatriated are considered serious offenders and also traitors and are usually arrested upon return and face ill treatment to the point of torture. Item 14.2 indicates that persons who left Eritrea illegally could face interrogations, arrest and harsh punishments9.\n[20] The objective evidence is consistent with the claimant\u2019s account of fearing persecution based on her political opinion in Eritrea.\n[21] I find that the claimant\u2019s fear of persecution because of her actual and imputed anti\u00ad government political opinion has an objective basis and is well-founded.\nState Protection\n[22] A state, unless in a condition of complete breakdown, is presumed to be capable of protecting its citizens. To rebut the presumption of state protection, a claimant must provide clear and convincing confirmation of the state\u2019s inability to protect its citizens.\n[23] Given that the state is the agent of persecution and taking into account the objective evidence, I find that it would be objectively unreasonable for the claimant to seek the protection of the state in her circumstances, and that adequate state protection would not be reasonably forthcoming.\nInternal Flight Alternative (IFA)\n[24] Given that the state is the agent of persecution with control over the entire country, I find that there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout Eritrea and therefore a viable IFA does not exist.\nCONCLUSION\n[25] Having considered all of the evidence, I find that there is a serious possibility that the claimant would face persecution in Eritrea. I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee and I accept her claim.\n(signed) Avril Cardoso\nNovember 26, 2019\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27 as amended\n\n2 Exhibit 1\n\n3 Feride Celik Guven & Miray Guven v.

Rico\n\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Hannah Lindy\n\nCountry: Saudi Arabia\n\nRPD Number: TB8-25749\n\nATIP Number: A-2020-01459\n\nATIP Pages: 000172-000175\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: These are the reasons for decision in the claim of [XXX]. First name is spelled, [XXX] (sic). Second name is spelled [XXX], middle initial [XXX]. Last name is spelled, [XXX] who claims to be a citizen of Saudi Arabia and is claiming refugee protection pursuant to Sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[2] In rendering my decisions, I have had considered and applied the Chairperson\u2019s guidelines on women refugee claimants fearing gender related persecution.\n[3] You allege the following. You were sexually assaulted in Canada by a male Saudi citizen. You reported the sexual assault to the police and criminal charges were laid which resulted in criminal proceedings against the male Saudi citizen.\n[4] The Saudi Government pressured you to drop the criminal charges and to work with them to stop the criminal proceedings.\n[5] The male Saudi citizen belongs to a prominent family in Saudi Arabia. You fear that you will be prosecuted if returned to Saudi Arabia as the Saudi Government would blame you for being sexually assaulted.\n[6] I find that you are a Convention refugee as your fear of persecution is by reasons of your membership in a particular social group, specifically that a woman fearing gender based violence.\n[7] I find that your identity as a national of Saudi Arabia is established by your testimony and the supporting documentation filed, including the certified true copy of your passport found at Exhibit 1.\n[8] I find that the wealth of documentation found at Exhibits 5 and 7 establishes, on a balance of probabilities, that criminal charges were laid against a male Saudi citizen, and that you received threats from the Saudi Government because of these criminal charges.\n[9] You provided documents corroborating the criminal court proceedings against the male Saudi citizen as well as the threats you received via WhatsApp messaging arising from the commencement of those criminal court proceedings.\n[10] Given the preponderance of the corroborating evidence before me I find that, on a balance of probabilities, your allegations of persecution are, in fact, true.\n[11] I do not draw a negative credibility inference from your delay in making a refugee claim. I find it completely understandable that you had many things going on between attending hospital appointments, attending court appearances, and being available for Crown Prosecutors related to your criminal case.\n[12] I find it completely reasonable that the criminal case be in the forefront of your mind and that you would focus on the criminal proceedings.\n[13] I also note that at the time you were not at risk of being removed until Saudi students were called back to Saudi Arabia. As such, the risk had not yet materialized for you. And shortly after the risk of return to Saudi Arabia materialized you initiated your refugee claim.\n[14] While I continue to have concerns regarding your re-availment to Saudi Arabia in 2017, when weighing the totality of evidence as a whole these concerns are insufficient to rebut the presumption of truthfulness.\n[15] I therefore find that you have established a subjective fear of persecution if you are to be returned to Saudi Arabia by reason of your membership in a particular social group, specifically that of women fearing gender based violence.\n[16] Your subjective fear of persecution is objectively well-founded.\n[17] The documentary evidence at Exhibit 3 Item 2.1 states that one of the most significant human rights issues included violence and official gender discrimination against women, despite the announced new women\u2019s rights initiatives.\n[18] Though rape is a criminal offence under Shari law, a rape victim must provide four witnesses to the rape or the perpetrator\u2019s confession. Otherwise, the victim will be persecuted \u2026 prosecuted for having illegal sex. Punishment imposed by the court for having illegal sex may range from flogging if she is single or execution if she is married. Any resulting pregnancy also leaves them open to criminal prosecution or other punishment such as honour killing. Evidence of which can be found at Exhibit 3 Items 5.1 and 5.6.\n[19] Few cases of rape are prosecuted or reported as women fear being prosecuted themselves if they do report the crime.\n[20] Given that the criminal proceedings of sexual assault against a male Saudi citizen is public knowledge and that the Saudi Government through its embassy is aware of these criminal proceedings and that the objective documentary evidence establishes that you will more likely than not face a serious possibility of persecution if returned to Saudi Arabia as you may be punished for having what is considered in Saudi Arabia illegal sex, I find that you have established a well-founded fear of persecution in Saudi Arabia.\n[21] As the agent of persecution in your particular circumstances is the State, given that they will more likely than not prosecute and met out the punishment, I find that it would be objectively unreasonable for you to seek protection of the State.\n[22] I have also considered whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for you. On the evidence before me I find that there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout Saudi Arabia.\n[23] It is clear from the objective documentary evidence that the treatment of women in Saudi Arabia is the same throughout. As such, there is no safe place for you.\n[24] Based on the analysis above I conclude that you are a Convention refugee. Accordingly, I accept your claim.\n[25] Okay, let\u2019s pull the mics back.\n[26] This concludes today\u2019s hearing. We will be going off the record now. I wish you all a good afternoon.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2019 RLLR 107\n\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\n\nDate of Decision: March 7, 2019\n\nPanel: Robert Bafaro\n\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Yaritza Martinez\n\nCountry: Venezuela\n\nRPD Number: TB8-25225\n\nAssociated RPD Number(s): TB8-25277, TB8-03615\n\nATIP Number: A-2020-01459\n\nATIP Pages: 000167-000171\n[1] MEMBER: I\u2019ve had a chance to carefully review all of the evidence before me, to carefully consider the testimony of the principal claimant, XXXX, the testimony of his daughter XXXX. I\u2019ve had a chance to examine all of the supporting documents that have been provided as well as the country documents regarding the human rights situation in Venezuela at the present time, as reflected in the National Documentation Package on Venezuela from May 2018.\n[2] I\u2019ve decided to accept these refugee claims and I\u2019m now going to deliver my oral reasons from the bench.\n[3] The claimants, [XXX] and [XXX], are claiming refugee protection pursuant to s. 96 and s. 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[4] With respect to the issue of their identities, I\u2019m satisfied that they have established, on a balance of probabilities, that they are who they claim to be and that they are citizens of Venezuela. have in evidence before me, in Exhibit 1, certified true copies of their Venezuelan passports.\n[5] The other important issue that I have to assess in all refugee claims is the issue of credibility. I have to be satisfied that the testimony and evidence of the claimants, as it relates to the most central, most important, aspects of their refugee claims, is credible.\n[6] Now, in refugee law in Canada, there\u2019s a presumption. The presumption is that everything that a claimant says under oath is true, unless there\u2019s evidence, persuasive evidence, to the contrary. I find that there is no persuasive evidence to the contrary.\n[7] The narratives of the principal claimant, [XXX], and his daughter, [XXX], are very detailed. I\u2019m not going to repeat everything that\u2019s in their basis of claim forms. Suffice it to say that they are both alleging a fear of persecution in the country on the grounds of their political opinion, both their actual political opinion and their perceived or imputed political opinion, by virtue of the fact that they are members, active members, of an opposition party called COPEI (ph.). They are alleging that they fear persecution in the country also because they were actively involved in protesting, demonstrating and criticising the government \u2013 the Chavez government, the current government of Maduro \u2013 by attending demonstrations, protests, holding placards, distributing flyers, condemning the government, in the hopes of restoring some kind of democracy. As the principal claimant mentioned, he was providing logistical support, food, water, but he was also actively involved holding placards, distributing anti-government literature and flyers to demonstrators. The principal claimant has been political active for many, many years. His daughter, [XXX], started in \u2013 became a member of the party in 2007 and then she continued right up until 2014 and then the threats started. And the threats continued right up until the time she left the country for the very last time. So, that is a synopsis or a brief encapsulation of the key elements that form the basis for these refugee claims.\n[8] I already made some comments about credibility. And I heard testimony from the principal claimant. I heard testimony from [XXX], his daughter. And first want to make some comments about the principal claimant.\n[9] He gave his testimony in a very straightforward manner. His answers were spontaneous. They were consistent with the objective country information. They were consistent with the information provided in his basis of claim form. There were no major contradictions or inconsistencies or discrepancies between his testimony and other evidence which was before me.\n[10] Likewise, his daughter [XXX] also testified in a straightforward manner. Her answers were spontaneous. Her answers were generally consistent with the very detailed information she provided in her basis of claim form narrative and her testimony was consistent with, generally speaking, with the objective country information contained in the National Documentation Package on Venezuela.\n[11] And I wanted to make one comment about [XXX] and her testimony. There was one aspect of her testimony that I did have some difficulty with. However, I think she \u2013 however, I find that she did provide a reasonable explanation. Initially I didn\u2019t find it entirely \u2013 it didn\u2019t make a lot of sense to me and it didn\u2019t seem to be plausible that despite these continuing threats from the Venezuelan government that she would keep leaving the country and re-availing herself of the country. In other words, it didn\u2019t sound plausible to me that someone who\u2019s fearing persecution would leave the country of persecution, go abroad to places like Argentina, United States, Canada and not ask for protection.\n[12] However, I find that she provide a reasonable explanation. And the explanation is this. Those other times that she went out of the country, it was a kind of a temporary measure. She really had no intention at that time to claim asylum. She wanted to finish her education. And, more importantly, she didn\u2019t really feel at that time that the threats were as serious as they became later.\n[13] Now, a threat is a threat. It\u2019s serious. However, it wasn\u2019t until later, when she returned from Canada and went back to Venezuela and returned to Margarita Island, that things became a lot worse. It was when she went back that she was kidnapped, she was beaten up, she was threatened with rape. And they clearly perceived her to be someone that was disloyal to the government, an opponent of the government, especially since she had actually done an internship within the government. And it\u2019s people that work for the government especially that the government expects loyalty from them, expects them to be patriotic. And in her case, she wasn\u2019t. She didn\u2019t want to go along with what the government was trying to pressure her to do, which was to get this patriotic identity card under Chavez to, you know, vote for the government and support their policy. She refused to do that and, in fact, did the opposite. She continued to remain active in an opposition political party and attended protests that were denouncing the government.\n[14] So, I think when you look at it that way, it actually sounds entirely reasonable and plausible that initially she didn\u2019t claim asylum or ask for protection in those countries, but once she was actually kidnapped and physically assaulted at gun point and then threatened with rape, that that was basically the final straw. And it\u2019s at that point in time that she came to the realisation that this situation was really serious and that it was out of control and that things were not going to get better. And it\u2019s precisely around that time that she left and then her parents followed her to Canada because the threats were continuing.\n[15] So, that having been said, I find in light of all of the evidence that both the principal claimant, [XXX], and his daughter [XXX] were in fact very credible witnesses.\n[16] Now, turning to the objective evidence \u2013 and the objective evidence is not in dispute. It\u2019s we \u2013 we know what\u2019s going on in Venezuela. The objective documents speak very clearly about what\u2019s going on in Venezuela, that if you\u2019re a political activist, you\u2019re an opponent of the government, you\u2019re criticising their policies openly at demonstrations, protests, you face serious problems, including arbitrary arrest, detention, torture, extra-judicial killings. The situation has really spiralled out of control and the Maduro government has consolidated its power, giving itself and its own \u2013 members of its own party the ultimate power over and above the power that the National Assembly once used to have.\n[17] So, I\u2019m now going to refer to some of the objective documents that talk about the situation in Venezuela.\n[18] Item 2.3 in the National Documentation Package, which in evidence today as Exhibit 5, indicates \u2013 and it\u2019s a report from Human Rights Watch. It indicates that brutal repression of political protest in Venezuela, the erosion of human rights, state-sponsored censorship, intimidation of critics, and \u2013 it notes that people face torture and abuse in custody and that people are discriminated against because of their criticism of the government.\n[19] Item 4.3 notes that the political prisoners have been tortured in Venezuela and the government has limited human rights, including personal freedom of integrity and freedom of expression.\n[20] Item 4.14 notes that,\n\u201cProtests have been met with outright prohibition, roadblocks \u2026 repressive policing, as well as deployment of armed civilians who have beaten and shot at demonstrators.\u201d\n[21] The colectivos are a violent paramilitary wing of the ruling socialist party and they are responsible for much of this political persecution.\n[22] As indicated in Item 4.16, a faction of the colectivos known as the Tupamaros are also known for dealing ruthlessly with political opponents through fierce and deadly intimidation and assault by firearm, including the murder of protesters.\n[23] Based on the evidence before me, I find that the claimants face more than mere possibility of persecution in Venezuela as opponents of the Maduro r\u00e9gime.\n[24] I find that your claims are objectively well-founded. The totality of the country documentation supports your allegations.\n[25] On a balance of probabilities and in light of your particular circumstances, I find that there is clear and convincing evidence that the Venezuelan State would be unwilling to provide political opponents with protection. Indeed, the agent of persecution that you fear in Venezuela is the government itself. And the documentary evidence at Exhibit 5 corroborates this.\n[26] I just wanted to back up one minute and just mention that another reason why I found the claimants\u2019 testimony to be credible is that it was supported by objective documentation. And this is found at Exhibit 9. The claimants provided supporting documents that corroborate central aspects of their refugee claim. And those are found at \u2013 beginning at page 22, it talks about the internship of the female claimant, [XXX]. There\u2019s another document, page 24, that corroborates the fact that she had an internship with the government. We\u2019ve got a letter, page 27, that corroborates that [XXX] was a member of the COPEI opposition political party. And likewise we have a document, at page 30, that corroborates the membership of [XXX] in the COPEI opposition party and it corroborates that \u2013 and both of these letters corroborate that both [XXX] and [XXX] were not just members, or card-carrying members; they were activists. They were actively involved in opposing the Maduro government. They were actively involved in protests against the government.\n[27] There\u2019s also a witness statement at page 33 that provides corroboration about an incident that happened at the claimants\u2019 home. Sorry, there\u2019s a \u2013 let me \u2013 I stand corrected. There\u2019s a witness statement that says that since they have left the country, there continues to be unusual activity surrounding their home and that \u2013 suspicious activities in their neighbourhood, involving people going around asking, trying to find out where the [XXX] family has gone to.\n[28] And there\u2019s also a medical report, at page 36, which corroborates an incident in June of 2017 involving [XXX], where she sustained multiple contusions, and this was around the time that she was kidnapped, beaten brutally and threatened with rape.\n[29] So, I find that the documentary evidence is both clear and convincing and that it rebuts the presumption of State protection in your particular circumstances.\n[30] I\u2019ve also considered whether there\u2019s an internal flight alternative for you, as members of one family, anywhere in the country, in Venezuela. However, on the evidence before me, I find there is a serious possibility of persecution for all of you throughout the country in your particular circumstances. Again, the documentary evidence at Exhibit 5 indicates that persecution of political opponents occurs throughout the country.\n[31] For the foregoing reasons and having considered all the evidence before me, I conclude that you all face a serious possibility of persecution on the basis of your both imputed and actual political opinions, should you return to Venezuela.\n[32] According, I am accepting your refugee claims and find you to be Convention refugees pursuant to s. 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nDECISION CONCLUDED\n",

        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2019 RLLR 106\n\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\n\nDate of Decision: October 1, 2019\n\nPanel: Diane Hitayezu-Fall\n\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Micheal F Loebach\n\nCountry: Uganda\n\nRPD Number: TB8-18931\n\nATIP Number: A-2020-01459\n\nATIP Pages: 000161-000166\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] [XXX] (the claimant) claims to be a citizen of Uganda, and seeks refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA)1.\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] The details of the claimant\u2019s allegations are set out in his Basis of Claim (BOC) form.2 In short, the claimant alleges persecution based on his political opinion and membership in the Forum for Democratic Change (FDC); an opposition political party in Uganda.\n[3] He alleges that he was detained three times due to his political activities. He was released with conditions after each arrest, and one of the conditions was to report back to the police. He decided to flee Uganda after the third detention in [XXX] 2017, when he learned that he had been charged for inciting violence.\n[4] He arrived in Canada on [XXX] 2018 from the United States where he had a pending asylum claim.\n[5] The claimant alleges that the Ugandan government is still looking for him. He fears his life would be at risk, if he were to return to Uganda, as he still opposes the National Resistance Movement\u2019s programs and its ways of ruling the country.\nDETERMINATION\n[6] Having considered the totality of the evidence, the panel finds that the claimant is a Convention refugee as he has established a serious possibility of persecution in Uganda, based on a Convention ground, political opinion.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[7] The panel is satisfied with the claimant\u2019s personal identity and status as a citizen of Uganda, on a balance of probabilities.\n[8] His identity was established based on his oral testimony, a certified copy of his Ugandan passport (a copy of which is on file) seen by a border services officer and other documents from Uganda he provided, which include a birth certificate, academic documents and his marriage certificate.3\nCredibility and subjective fear\n[9] The claimant\u2019s oral testimony regarding his motives to join the FDC party, his activities and his political opinion was detailed and credible. It was supported by documents that the panel assessed and found trustworthy on a balance of probabilities.4 His knowledge of the Ugandan political sphere was commensurate to his alleged involvement in the FDC.\n[10] His testimony included his motives to join the FDC, his role within the FDC, the events that made him leave Uganda, and his current fears.\n[11] Despite this credible oral testimony, the panel noticed that the claimant submitted questionable police documents.5 These documents contain spelling errors and at least one cites the wrong section of the applicable law.6 The claimant did not offer any explanation when he was invited to comment on the flaws noted; he simply stated that the release on bond documents were handed to him by the police, and the other documents were given to his lawyer or his wife. The flaws identified on these police documents were not explained to the panel\u2019s satisfaction. The panel finds that they are non-genuine, on a balance of probabilities and were submitted to embellish this claim.\n[12] These non-genuine documents were tendered to corroborate the claimant\u2019s allegations that he had been detained, then released on bonds, was required to report back to the police, and that several warrants to arrest were issued against him.\n[13] The panel considered the other evidence on file regarding these allegations and found that the negative impact of the submission of these documents that the panel assessed and found non-genuine on a balance of probabilities was overcome by the claimant\u2019s credible oral testimony and other credible evidence tendered to support the alleged dealings with the police. This other evidence included the claimant\u2019s testimony, found to be credible, and a number of letters and affidavits which included an affidavit from the FDC lawyer who handled the claimant\u2019s detention cases and letters from FDC leaders and that\n[14] As the claimant arrived in Canada from the US where he had a pending asylum claim, the panel had to assess if leaving the US and abandoning his claim was a sign of lack of subjective fear.\n[15] The claimant has provided a number of documents related to his US asylum claim, which indicate that the assessment of his claim was almost completed when he left the US.7 He had received a letter inviting him to clarify some elements of his claim. He explained that having heard about the unfavourable US immigration policies, he got scared to be sent back to Uganda and decided to come to Canada.\n[16] Taking into consideration the claimant\u2019s particular circumstances and his explanation for abandoning his claim in the US and based on the understanding of the panel of the current US administration\u2019s attitude and treatment of immigrants and asylum seekers, the panel will not draw any negative inference in regards to the claimant\u2019s abandonment of his US claim.\n[17] Having assessed the entire evidence on record, the panel finds that, based on the oral testimony found credible and the documentary evidence found reliable, the claimant has established that he is a member of the opposition and that he left Uganda because of his political opinions. Therefore, the panel concludes that he has established a subjective fear as a person who holds opinions that do not align with the ruling party.\n[18] The panel finds that there is a connection between the fear alleged by the claimant and one of the Convention grounds, namely political opinion.\nObjective Basis\n[19] The claimant\u2019s allegations are supported by the objective documentary evidence contained in the National Documentation Package (NDP) for Uganda.8 This objective documentary evidence reports that people in the claimant\u2019s circumstances, individuals in Uganda who express political views that do not align with the government in power, face persecution. The claimant fears to be arrested if he returns to Uganda. He has charges pending in Uganda, stemming from his past political activities with the FDC when he opposed the Government and the National Resistance Movement (NRM) policies. The objective evidence validates his fear. There is information that Ugandan authorities cite laws protecting national security to restrict criticism of government policies.9 The FDC is reported to be the strongest force in the opposition and represents the biggest challenge to President Museveni.\n[20] The United States State Department\u2019s Country Report on Human Rights Practices for 2018 included in the NDP for Uganda notes that significant human rights issues were observed, including unlawful killings and torture by security forces, harsh prison conditions, arbitrary detention, restrictions on freedom of press, expression, assembly and political participation, as well as, official corruption.10 During the period covered by this report the police arrested and detained members of the opposition.\n[21] The same report also noted that the Ugandan government was reluctant to investigate, prosecute or punish officials who committed human rights violations, whether in the security services or elsewhere in the government and impunity was a problem. The objective evidence demonstrates that the fact that President Museveni and NRM have been in power since 1986 has resulted in the intertwinement of the ruling party with the state apparatus.11\n[22] Having considered this documentary evidence in conjunction with the claimant\u2019s allegations about his political opinion, and the consequences of having strong political opinions that oppose the ruling party\u2019s opinions, the panel finds that the claimant has a well-founded fear and that he faces a serious possibility of persecution based on his political opinion.\nSTATE PROTECTION\n[23] As the agent of the persecution is the State which acts with impunity, as it transpires in the documentary evidence as discussed above, the panel finds that there is clear and convincing evidence that State protection would not be available to the claimant.\nINTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE\n[24] Likewise, as the State is the agent of persecution and is in control of all of its territory, who oppose the ruling party face persecution across Uganda. Therefore, the panel finds that there would be no place throughout the country where the claimant would not face a serious possibility of persecution due to his political opinion.\n[25] Therefore, considering both the testimony of the claimant and the documentary evidence as a whole, the panel finds that the claimant faces a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground, that of his political opinion.\nCONCLUSION\n[26] Based on the totality of the evidence before it, the panel concludes that the claimant is a Convention refugee and therefore accepts the claim.\n(signed) Diane Hitayezu-Fall\nOctober 1, 2019\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27, as amended.\n2 Exhibit 2, Basis of Claim.\n3 Exhibit 1; Exhibit 6, pp. 1-7.\n4 Exhibit 10, pp. 1-8: Affidavit from the claimant\u2019s wife and other friends; Exhibit 9: Affidavit from his mother and grand-mother, Exhibit 6, pp. 10-11: FDC letters and Exhibit 10, pp. 9-12: Internet pas.\n5 Exhibit 6, pp. 12-14 and Exhibit 7, pp. 2-4.\n6 Exhibit 6, page 19 (\u201cRelease On Bond\u201d).\n7 Exhibit 8 (14 pages) and Exhibit 9, pp. 5-6.\n8 Exhibit 3, National Documentation Package (NDP) for Uganda (March 29, 2019).\n9 Idem, Tab 2.1\n10 Ibidem\n11 Exhibit 3, Tab 4.4.\n",

        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2019 RLLR 105\n\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\n\nDate of Decision: April 5, 2019\n\nPanel: Eric Omeziri\n\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Howard P Eisenberg\n\nCountry: Sudan\n\nRPD Number: TB8-14259\n\nAssociated RPD Number(s): TB8-14258, TB8-14260\n\nATIP Number: A-2020-01459\n\nATIP Pages: 000154-000160\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] The principal claimant, [XXX] and her daughter [XXX], allege that they are citizens of Sudan and no other county. The principal claimant\u2019s daughter [XXX] is a citizen of the United States. They are claiming refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act1 (IRPA).\n[2] The principal claimant was appointed the designated representative of the minor claimants pursuant to subsection 167(2) of the IRPA.\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] The details of the claimants\u2019 allegations are fully set out in the principal claimant\u2019s Basis of Claim (BOC) form.2 To summarize, the principal claimant alleges a fear of persecution in Sudan based on her anti-government political opinion.\n[4] The principal claimant alleges past persecution at the hands of the Sudanese National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS), who have arrested her on multiple occasions due to her activities in opposition of the ruling government and in support of the Nubian people.\n[5] The principal claimant remained active in Sudanese politics after relocating to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Egypt in 2013 and 2016, respectively.\n[6] During a 2017 visit to Sudan, the principal claimant was arrested, detained for several days and physically mistreated due to her prior political activity. With the assistance of an individual within the Sudanese police, the principal claimant escaped Sudan for Egypt. Fearing that she may be returned to Sudan, as her status in Egypt was temporary, in [XXX] 2018, the principal claimant travelled to Canada via the United States (US) to seek refugee protection.\n[7] In addition to the claimants\u2019 fear of persecution at the hands of Sudanese authorities. The claimants also fear that the female claimant\u2019s family would force her daughters to undergo female genital mutilation if they were to return to Sudan. The panel makes no finding on this issue due to the disposition of the claim based on political opinion.\nDETERMINATION\n[8] Having considered the totality of the evidence, the panel finds that the principal claimant and her dependent daughter, [XXX] are Convention refugees pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA. The principal claimant faces a serious possibility of persecution in Sudan based on her political opinion, while the dependent claimant has a derivative risk of persecution based on her membership in a particular social group-that of family member of the principal claimant.\n[9] The panel also finds that the principal claimant\u2019s youngest daughter, [XXX], has not established that she faces a serious possibility of persecution under the Convention, nor has she established that, on a balance of probabilities, she would personally be exposed to a risk of torture, to a risk to her life, or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if she were to return to the US.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[10] With respect to the principal claimant and her eldest daughter\u2019s personal identities, the panel finds that on a balance of probabilities, their identities as a citizens of Sudan have been established by their passports and the principal claimant\u2019s testimony.\n[11] Likewise, the personal identity of the principal claimant\u2019s youngest daughter, has also been established, on balance, and the panel finds that her identity as a US citizen has been established by her passport and the principal claimant\u2019s testimony.\nCredibility\n[12] Overall, the claimants were found to be credible. The principal claimant provided testimony which was consistent and included spontaneous details not included in the Basis of Claim form.\n[13] The principal claimant\u2019s testimony did not contradict the declarations within the Basis of Claim form and there were no significant inconsistencies or omissions.\n[14] The principal claimant provided credible testimony with respect to her anti-government political activity on behalf of the Nubian community, which began while she was attending high school in Sudan. She further detailed how she continued to advocate publicly for Nubian causes, protesting against dam building in the Nubian region, raising money for the anti-dam committee, participating in committee meetings, as well as participating in Nubian cultural activities and awareness campaigns.\n[15] The principal claimant\u2019s anti-government political activity made her the subject of repeated arbitrary arrests and extra-judicial detention by the Sudanese National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS). The principal claimant provided credible testimony regarding the events leading up to her arrests, her experience in detention, as well as her activities following her release.\n[16] The panel has also considered the principal claimant\u2019s testimony regarding her political activity online and since arriving in Canada. The principal claimant provided convincing testimony regarding her participation in anti-government protests in Toronto and St. Catharines, Ontario in late 2018. The principal claimant also provided testimony about her anti-government activity online and, using her mobile phone, she was able to spontaneously show the panel that she was subscribed to an anti-government message group on WhatsApp.\n[17] In addition to the principal claimant\u2019s credible testimony, the claimants also provided supporting documents which I found to be credible, they include:\na. Letter of support from the Secretary General of the Nubian House in Abu Dhabi\nb. Letter of support from the Anti-dam youth committee of Dal and Kajbar Dams\nc. Letters of support from friends and family which corroborate the claimants\u2019 allegations\nd. Photographs of the principal claimant\u2019s participation in anti-government protests in Canada\n[18] As such, the panel finds that, on a balance of probabilities, the claimants have established that the principal claimant has a subjective fear of persecution due to her anti-government political opinion.\nNexus Section 96\n[19] The panel finds that there is a link between the principal claimant\u2019s fear of persecution and the Convention grounds, specifically that the principal claimant has been persecuted by the Sudanese Government because of her anti-government political opinion, therefore this claim has been assessed under Section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nObjective Basis\n[20] The evidence before the panel establishes, on a balance of probabilities, an objective basis for the claimant\u2019s fear of persecution. Item 1.4 of the National Documentation Package for Sudan states that the NISS is responsible for the management of operations for national security, and under Sudanese law individuals suspected of a threat to the State may be detained by the NISS indefinitely.\n[21] The same law provides NISS officials with impunity for acts involving their official duties and that its current human rights violations have reached unprecedented levels. The objective documentary evidence also cites examples of the NISS using excessive and sometimes lethal force in breaking up demonstrations, protests, and rallies as well as conducting raids and confiscations.\n[22] The NISS arbitrarily arrests and detains Sudanese citizens, often detaining these individuals for a few days before releasing them without charge. The Sudanese government often targets political opponents and suspected rebel supporters and the NDP also makes reference to several reports of individuals being detained for their actual or assumed political or anti\u00ad government political opinion.\n[23] The panel has also considered the risk to the principal claimant\u2019s Sudanese child. The NDP for Sudan provides evidence of the targeting of family members of political opponents. Item 1.7 describes the situation of the brother of [XXX] \u2013 a noted Darfuri Sudanese Human Rights Defender-who was kidnapped in Khartoum by members of the NISS and taken to a deserted location in Khartoum, and beaten and subsequently released.\n[24] Item 2.1 of the NDP also make reference to numerous reports of violence by Sudanese government authorities against the family members of Darfuri student activists.\n[25] Therefore, I find that the principal claimant\u2019s Sudanese born child has a risk of persecution based on the membership in a particular social group, that of a family member of the principal claimant.\n[26] The panel has considered the documentary evidence in conjunction with the principal claimant\u2019s credible allegations about her identity as an individual with an anti-government political opinion. Having considered these factors, the panel finds that the principal claimant and her eldest daughter do have a well-founded fear of persecution.\nState Protection\n[27] As the agent of persecution is the State which, as mentioned above, does act with impunity, the panel finds that there is clear and convincing evidence that adequate State protection would not be available to the claimant.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[28] Likewise, since the Sudanese government is in control of the entirety of the country, the panel finds that there would be no safe place for the claimants throughout the country and that there is no viable internal flight alternative for the claimants anywhere in Sudan.\nCONCLUSION\n[29] Based on the totality of the evidence before it, the panel concludes that the principal claimant, [XXX], and her daughter, [XXX], are Convention refugees and accepts their claim.\n[30] The minor claimant, [XXX], has not established she faces a serious possibility of persecution in the US and is not a person in need of protection without recourse to state protection. The panel must find the minor claimant is not a Convention refugee under section 96 or person in need of protection, under section 97(1) of the IRPA and rejects her claim.\n(signed) E.

So, this is a decision for the claim made by [XXX]. The file number is TB811840. The decision is rendered today, November 22nd, 2019. So, you were claiming to be a citizen of Cameroon and you are claiming refugee protection under Sections 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Act. So, my-, I have found you to be a refugee for the following reasons.\n[2] The details of your claim can be found in your Basis of Claim Form that is in Exhibit 2 and you allege that you are an Anglophone Cameroonian. You were born and you grew up in the Anglophone region in Kumba. You allege that you are a member of the Southern Cameroons National Counsel, SCNC. You allege that you have been a member since September 2009 and that because of your membership in the SCNC and your political activities, you have been mistreated by the government agents.\n[3] You allege that your life would be at risk if you were to return to Cameroon. And you allege that the-, the government agents who have mistreated you in the past and have been mistreating members of the SCNC will arrest you, detain you, torture you or even kill you. So, as I said, I found you, that you are Convention refugee, as you have established a serious possibility of persecution on account of your political opinion and political activities.\n[4] In terms of identity, I find that your identity is established by your testimony and the supporting documentation you have provided, which include, ele-, p-, Republic of Cameroon passport which is in Exhibit 1, document we received IRCC and your acad-, your academic documents in Exhibit 5. I find that your personal identity and the National, your National identity have been established as a commun-, a citizen of Cameroon. I assessed your credibility and I find-, I found you to be credible, you have been a credible witness and I believe what you have alleged in support of your claim.\n[5] You testified in a straight forward manner and you answered directly the questions. At the end of the hearing, there were no unexplained omissions. And I note, I did not note any contradictions between what your declared in your BOC, Basis of Claim and other forms in your testimony today. I noted, some mistakes on your documents, on the documents you submitted, spelling mistakes in the French portions of your document. I asked you about it and you could not explain how it happened. You only indicated that, it happened. However, I considered your oral testimony that was oral-, overall, candid, spontaneous and detailed. And it was detailed in all aspects of the claim, your passion, your activities as a member of SCNC and your activities in Canada. And I found that, the mistakes on the document would not overweigh your other portions of test-, testimony in the other documents you have provided.\n[6] So, in support of your allegations you have provided a number of documents that support your allegations. For your membership in SCNC, you provided your membership card that you obtained in September 2009 and then attestation of membership from SCNC dated October 30th, 2019. You have provided some letters from members who attest of your membership. Some SCNC leaders provided letter of supports, attesting that you attended meetings and that they knew about your arrest, detentions and your escape. I- it would not the-, in Exhibit 5, page 13 to 17 you provided letters from [XXX] and [XXX] and other people. And with respect to your detention and mistreaten-, mistreaten-, mistreatment in detention, you provided medical note from the hospital that treated you on two occasions after being mistreated in detention. And there are-, those are notes from the, is it [XXX], in Exhibit 5, 6-, pages 16 and 17. You also provided police documents, the bail bonds from 2010 to 2014, you have provide-, provided copies of your, the warrants for your arrest and the convocation to the police.\n[7] I have also the letter from the organization that helped with your release from detention on two occasions, the Human Rights Defence Group that helps SCNC members. After reviewing all this evidence in front of me, I have accepted what you have arranged in your BOC. And I find that you have established a subjective fear based on your political opinion and political activities.\n[8] So, I looked at the objective evidence and I found that the National Documentation Package for Cameroon, May 31st, 2019, contain information that supports your allegations, that as Anglophone and as somebody who is a member of SCNC and has been identified as an anro-, Anglophone who participates in the protest asking for equal rights for Anglophone, you would be persecuted in Cameroon. The objective evidence indicates that there continue to be reports of arrests and disappearances of individuals by security forces, particularly in the Anglophone regions. The National Documentation Package on Cameroon contains many reports on-, on Human Rights that describes the situation and the crisis in those Anglophone regions, item 2.1, 2.2, 2.5. I have other documents, many documents in Items 1-, in Section 1 and Section 4 and those reports, report serious human violation, abuses of civilians by government forces and sometimes Anglophone separatists. And regarding (inaudible) disappearances and people are detained, they are not allowed to contact their families and friends and they are denied access to legal representation and some are detained in an undisclosed location.\n[9] I noted that the Item 2.(inaudible ), the human rights issues highlighted in 2018, in the report for 2018 by the United States Department of States, on Cameroon include the prolonged arbitrary detention of suspected Anglophone separatists by security forces, harsh and life-threatening prison conditions. You testified about, what you endured during the detention and the issue may-, another issue mentioned in this report is that Anglophone Cameroonians are restricted in the rights to freedom of assembly, their freedom to express their political opinion and that the government has arrested, charged and killed in recent years, those who attempted to do so. I have a response to information request that, that tells us that Anglophone regions are located in the North-West, South-West Cameroon, when from. And then, it says that Anglophone are subjected to a policy of ongoing discrimination and they\u2019re all often denied the right to use their language. They are subjected to-, to French legal and education system against their wish. And you have testify-, testified about your experiences in Cameroon, with having to do exams in a-, in French.\n[10] And the, there\u2019s another document in, our response to information request, Item 13.2 and it refers to people living in the diaspora. And they are-, the government accuses them to instigate the war in Cameroon. And they, I know that Canada is involved with the countries name where Cameroonian\u2019s have been sending money, accused of sending money to-, to Cameroon. And this, the documentation in the National Documentation Package says that, anyone is who is vocal will risk-, will be at risk if they go back to Cameroon, they risk to be arrested. Some are arrested at the airport, they-, they are detained and sometimes they would have to bribe, to get out. So, given that you have established by your testimony and the-, the supporting document that you have, come to the attention of the government of Cameroon as a person interested in Anglophone\u2019s cause, you have been detained, interrogated. I find that your-, your fear of persecution is objectively founded. I found that, I find that you, the fear you express is well-founded and you have established that there is a serious possibility of persecution based on an imputed in your-, based on a political opinion.\n[11] I had to verify if state protection would be available to you if you had to go to Cameroon. And I looked at evidence before me and I found that adequate state protection would not be reasonably forthcoming in your particular case. Based on the information on file and given that-, given that the authority in Cameroon, the authorities are your agent of persecution, I find that it is objective-, objectively unreasonable for you to seek protection from the authorities in Cameroon. I find, that I have clear and convincing evidence before me in the objective evidence, as discussed. And I find that there is no adequate state protection available for you in Cameroon. I also, had to verify if you could relocate in Cameroon and I considered whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for you, but on the evidence before me, I find that there is a serious possibility of per-, persecution throughout Cameroon. There-, there are-, there are warrants to arrest you, so it is reasonable to believe that they may be executed anywhere in Cameroon. There is nothing the documentary evidence, that to indicate that Cameroon does not control its territory. I find that there is no internal alternative for you a place in Cameroon where you could express your political opinion without fear of persecution.\n[12] So, in conclusion I find that you are a Convention refugee and I, therefore, accept your claim.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

The panel has no serious reason to doubt that the sworn testimony of this claimant was truthful.\nWell-Foundedness of Fear\nRefugee Claim in Canada\n[6] The panel finds on a balance of probabilities that there is less than a mere possibility that the Eritrea government would know that the claimant made a refugee claim in Canada if he returned to Eritrea voluntarily due to the fact that he left Eritrea legally. The claimant testified that he enters and exits Eritrea regularly. He stated that the Eritrean government believes that he is a resident of Sudan who visits Eritrea voluntarily. That being so, he has never had problems entering Eritrea in the past. The panel finds that there is less than a mere possibility that the Eritrean authorities would question the claimant upon entry regarding whether or not he made a refugee claim in Canada.\nReligion\n[7] The panel finds there is less than a mere possibility that this claimant would face persecution in Eritrea because of his Muslim religion. The claimant testified that there is no difference between the religion he practises and the state-sanctioned Islamic religion in Eritrea. The claimant was asked whether he had any problems practicing his religion while in Eritrea. He responded that he had no problems that related to him specifically. He was then asked what kind of problems he thought he would have if he returned to Eritrea now. He responded that he did not believe that there would be issues because of his specific beliefs. The panel thus finds based on the claimant\u2019s own testimony that he would not face problems in Eritrea based on his religion.\nMilitary Objection\n[8] That being said, the panel does find that the claimant could face problems in Eritrea because of his objection to military service. The documentary evidence4 states that by law all Eritrean citizens between ages 18 to 50 must perform national service. The claimant, at 51 years old, is past that age range. In addition, he has already performed and completed his mandatory military service.\n[9] However, in 2012 the Eritrean government created the \u201cPeople\u2019s Army\u201d. The People\u2019s Army is composed of citizens released from the national service as part of their open-ended national service. Eritreans up to 70 years of age can be conscripted into the People\u2019s Army. Those who ignore the People\u2019s Army conscription notices may face imprisonment.5\n[10] The claimant stated that he is opposed to carrying arms and opposed to serving the Eritrean regime in any manner. His refusal to cooperate may be seen as having a political opinion contrary to the Eritrean Government. This would place the claimant at risk should he return to Eritrea.\nState Protection and Internal Flight Alternative\n[11] The panel finds that as the state authorities are the agents of persecution, there would be no state protection available to this claimant anywhere in Eritrea should he return. For the same reason, the panel also finds that there is no viable internal flight alternative available to this particular claimant anywhere in Eritrea.\nCONCLUSION\n[12] To conclude, the panel finds on a balance of probabilities, based on his objection to military service, that the claimant has a well-founded fear of persecution in Eritrea based on his political opinion. As such the panel finds that the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. The Refugee Protection Division accepts this claim.\n(signed) M.

Charow\n\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Denis Onek Olwedo\n\nCountry: Uganda\n\nRPD Number: TB8-08518\n\nATIP Number: A-2020-01459\n\nATIP Pages: 000139-000144\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: This is the decision for [XXX], File TB8-08518. I have considered your testimony and the other evidence in this case and I am ready to render my decision orally. I would also add that I have also considered the guidelines relating to gender.\n[2] You are claiming to be a citizen of Uganda and are claiming refugee protection pursuant to Section 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[3] I find that you are a Convention refugee for the following reasons.\n[4] The allegations of your claim can be found in your Basis of Claim Form at Exhibit 2 and the subsequent amendment at Exhibit 6.\n[5] In short, you alleged persecution as a member of a particular social group, namely that you are in danger of being harmed because of your gender as you have suffered domestic violence at the hands of your husband since about 2011.\n[6] You fear that your husband would harm you or kill you should you return to Uganda and that the police cannot protect you.\n[7] You believe that your husband could locate you anywhere in Uganda as he has influence over the police and people in the army due to his position with an AIDS organisation in Entebbe.\n[8] You allege that he became friends with high-ranking AIDS patients he counselled and did favours for them, causing them to owe him favours as well as any favours that they may do for him because of their friendship.\n[9] Your personal identity as a citizen of Uganda has been established by your testimony and the supporting document filed in Exhibit 1, namely your Ugandan passport. I find that on a balance of probabilities identity and country of reference have been established.\n[10] In terms of your general credibility, I found you to be a fairly credible witness. I therefore accept what you have alleged in your oral testimony and in your Basis of Claim Form.\n[11] I did find that there were some issues with your testimony. You testified that these high-ranking officials from the police or the military had come to your home; however, this information was not contained in your Basis of Claim Form.\n[12] When I put that omission to you, you said that you were trying to narrow down the story and that you want to file amendments, but you didn\u2019t have enough time to file an amendment to your Basis of Claim Form.\n[13] I also noticed that you had described fleeing to your mother\u2019s home, and that when your husband came to take you back to Entebbe, he came with men from the army. The fact that he brought army men with him was not included in your Basis of Claim Form.\n[14] When I put that omission to you, you said as you mentioned before you had wanted to put it in your amendment, that you knew you had left out important information, but were trying to narrow down the story.\n[15] When I am considering your explanations for these omissions, I do note that you are well educated, you have a university degree, and that you had the benefit of counsel both at the hearing but also when completing your Basis of Claim Form.\n[16] Additionally, I note that you actually have submitted an addendum to your Basis of Claim Form at Exhibit 6.\n[17] So, with these factors considered together, I find that the answers that you gave for these omissions have not adequately explained the identified omissions, and I make that finding even when considering your diagnosis of stressor-related disorder. I reference Exhibit 5, page 28.\n[18] As such, I do draw a negative inference about your credibility from each omission. However, I find that the other credible evidence including other lines of testimony and your supporting documentation outweighs the concerns I have that stem out of these omissions.\n[19] I find that when you were discussing the abuse that you had suffered, you were very credible. You described in detail the abuse you suffered at the hands of your husband over the course of your marriage. You also provided extensive documentation to support your claim.\n[20] I note the existence of identity documents and medical documentation for your children, which does show the name of your husband as their father. I am satisfied therefore that you had a relationship with this man.\n[21] I also note affidavits from your mother and from your aunt and from your landlady, and these people talked about what they personally witnessed and how they personally helped you, and these affidavits are consistent with your allegations, they are detailed and they speak to each of the individual experience in regards to your allegations.\n[22] I also see a support letter from your sister, which again is consistent and detailed. I see a letter from your divorce attorney where you had described trying to get a legal divorce in Uganda so that maybe your husband will stop bothering your family.\n[23] As well, I see a police report from Kampala, and although I did have some concerns because they said that they are looking for your husband, you said today that the police are not helping at all, you explained that even if nothing is being done by the police, they would still say that the investigation is ongoing, and that is indeed consistent with other evidence that we have in the National Documentation Package at Exhibit 3, which talks about the general lack of effectiveness of the Ugandan police, specifically when it comes to domestic violence issues, as I will discuss in a bit.\n[24] I also note an affidavit from your uncle and a letter from your father, again consistent, detailed and specific to what they personally witnessed or experienced.\n[25] When considering all of that and your credible testimony, I am satisfied that the events have occurred as alleged, that you would face persecution at the hands of your husband or his friends in the military or police should you return to Uganda. I find that you have established your subjective fear.\n[26] I find that there is a link between what you fear and one of the five Convention grounds, specifically as a Ugandan woman who is at risk of domestic violence, you are a member of a particular social group because of your gender.\n[27] Therefore, your claim has been assessed under Section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[28] I further find that you have an objective basis for your fear because of the documented conditions for Uganda as found in the National Documentation Package at Exhibit 3.\n[29] I note Item 2.1 which states that gender-based violence was common. It was recorded that in 2016, there were 163 deaths of women due to domestic violence, which was almost a 50% increase over 6 years.\n[30] I also note Item 5.5, which states that 56% of women aged 15 through 49 had experienced physical violence at least once since age 15. One of the factors behind these high prevalence rates is the widespread cultural acceptance of such violence.\n[31] The same survey found that wife battering is widely accepted, with 58% of women and 44% of men believing that it\u2019s justified for a man to beat his wife for specified reasons.\n[32] When considering this, I find that your subjective fear has an objective basis. I find that you have a well-founded fear of persecution due to your gender.\n[33] I find that State protection would not be reasonably forthcoming in this case as per the evidence already discussed.\n[34] I also note that in Item 5.2 of the National Documentation Package at Exhibit 3, they talk about reasons why only a small percentage of victims of violence go to the police, and some of those reasons include apathetic attitudes among police officers towards domestic violence as well as the high cost associated with accessing police services and the desire by victims to keep families together.\n[35] The same study also notes that gender-based violence is perceived as a private matter and that legal redress could compromise the livelihood of the victims.\n[36] The same report also notes that gaps still exists in terms of State protection due to a lack of professionalism of law enforcement organisations, especially the police.\n[37] In terms of an internal flight alternative, you have alleged that your husband has friends that are high-ranking officials in both the army and the military.\n[38] You alleged that he developed these friendships because he was these people\u2019s AIDS counsellor and would do them favours by ensuring that they could pick up their medication from your home instead of risking the stigma of members of the public finding out their AIDS status.\n[39] You testified that you saw them come to your home on multiple occasions to pick up their medication and that you also saw them as the years progressed become friends with your husband as they would stay and have drinks.\n[40] The fact that he has access to people in the military or the police is supported by the documents that you filed.\n[41] Various family members and your landlady in their affidavits or letter stated that men in uniforms would come and enquire about you on your husband\u2019s behalf. These people also affirmed or wrote that they had been harassed and arrested by members of the police. I refer to Exhibits 5 and 7.\n[42] You have also alleged that should you relocate within Uganda, you would have to register with the local council, which is consistent with the documentary evidence in the National Documentation Package at Exhibit 3. On this matter, I find both your testimony and your written evidence to be credible.\n[43] Accordingly, when considering the mandatory registration upon relocation, in combination with the established police and military connections of your agent of persecution, your husband, I find that on a balance of probabilities there is more than a mere possibility of persecution for you anywhere in Uganda as there is more than a mere possibility that your husband could find you if you had relocated or would relocate in the future and that he has been making ongoing efforts to find you.\n[44] As the test for an internal flight alternative fails on the first prong, I find that there is no reasonable internal flight alternative for you anywhere in Uganda.\n[45] Based on the totality of the evidence, I find the claimant to be a Convention refugee. Your claim is therefore accepted.\n[46] So, this will conclude today\u2019s hearing. I would like to thank everyone for their participation.\n[47] Thank you, madam interpreter.\n[48] INTERPRETER: Welcome.\n[49] MEMBER: Thank you, counsel.\n[50] COUNSEL: Thank you, madam member.\n[51] MEMBER: Thank you, ma\u2019 am.\n[52] CLAIMANT: Thank you, ma\u2019 am.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

Ruthven\n\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Zainab Jamal\n\nCountry: Egypt\n\nRPD Number: TB8-08556\n\nAssociated RPD Number(s): TB8-08567\n\nATIP Number: A-2020-01459\n\nATIP Pages: 000130-000138\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] These reasons and decision are in regards to the claims for protection made by [XXX] (principal claimant), [XXX] (elder female claimant), [XXX] (younger female claimant), and [XXX] (minor claimant).\n[2] Each is claiming protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.1 The panel heard the claims jointly, pursuant to Refugee Protection Division Rule 55.2\n[3] The principal claimant was the designated representative for the minor claimant.\nALLEGATIONS\n[4] The principal claimant\u2019s full allegations are set out in his Basis of Claim Form, and related narrative.3 The two female claimants and the minor claimant each rely on the narrative of the principal claimant. All four claimants have practiced the Coptic Orthodox Christian faith from birth.\n[5] Each claimant fears the religious extremists in Egypt, based on a number of cumulative reasons, which relate to the practice of their faith. The principal claimant was anointed as a deacon in 2000. He has practiced his faith in Egypt, in the United Arab Emirates, and in Canada.\n[6] During his residence in Egypt, the principal claimant faced discrimination from those who discovered his Christian faith. He faced problems such as unfair academic treatment from the university authorities during his studies at [XXX], and later was the victim of threats from would-be customers and assaults at the hands of Muslim extremists in the medical and pharmaceutical industries.\n[7] All four claimants also faced long-term threats of violence associated with attending their Coptic Orthodox Christian church in Egypt. The principal claimant was assaulted on several occasions when he departed his church late at night, and the younger female claimant faced harassment in Egypt because she did not wear a traditional Muslim head covering. She was physically assaulted on many occasions, including one incident where her hair was cut with scissors on the subway.\n[8] Subsequent to a physical assault outside church on February 18, 2018, where the younger female claimant was pushed to the ground during her pregnancy, the claimants decided to depart Egypt permanently. On [XXX], 2018, the claimants departed Egypt, and made their claims for protection in Canada the following month.\nDETERMINATION\n[9] The panel finds that the four claimants are Convention refugees, pursuant to section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, based on the persecution they face in Egypt due to the practice of their Coptic Orthodox Christian religion.\nIdentity\n[10] The panel finds that the four claimants have each established their identity as nationals of Egypt, based on a balance of probabilities. Each of the four claimants presented a valid Arab Republic of Egypt passport.4 The panel finds no reason to doubt the authenticity of any of these four documents.\nCredibility\n[11] The panel finds that the principal claimant testified at the hearing in straightforward and consistent manner, without the use of embellishments.\n[12] The panel finds that there are both cumulative factors, and immediate factors, which caused the four claimants to depart Egypt on [XXX], 2018.5 The panel further finds that these factors all directly, or indirectly, relate to the practice of their Coptic Orthodox Christian faith.\n[13] The principal claimant testified coherently about his service to the Coptic Orthodox community in Egypt, including being an [XXX] in his village (talking about The Bible and bringing food and drink to poor families). The panel finds that this testimony was spontaneous, rich in personal details, and relevant to the corroboration of his faith.\n[14] In addition to the testimony provided regarding the Coptic Orthodox Christian faith of the four claimants, the claimants also presented a series of corroborating documents sourced to individuals and organizations in Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, and Canada.\nMembership and Participation in the Coptic Orthodox Church\n[15] The claimants presented an August 9, 2017 letter of support from the [XXX] confirmed that the principal claimant served as [XXX] to the church in Zagazig. [XXX] confirmed that the elder female claimant also attended liturgy and spiritual meetings at the parish in Zagazig.6\n[16] Similarly, [XXX] confirmed that the younger female claimant attended [XXX] in Giza, prior to her relocation to the United Arab Emirates.7\n[17] In regards to parish attendance during their residence in the United Arab Emirates, the claimant presented an undated letter from [XXX] of the [XXX] in Sharjah.8\n[18] The panel gave each of four letters lesser probative value, as none of the respective authors specified a timeframe for the service of the three adult claimants to their respective parishes in Egypt or the United Arab Emirates. Despite this, the panel notes that some religious background was established.\n[19] The [XXX] Coptic Orthodox Church in Oakville, Ontario presented two undated letters of support signed by [XXX], which (read together) confirmed the participation of all four claimants at their parish for a period of seven months.9\n[20] In addition to the above-mentioned direct involvement with the Coptic Orthodox Church in Egypt, there were also several secondary documents presented which the panel finds corroborate a long-term practice of Christianity for the claimants and their family members in Egypt.\n[21] These documents include the presented Birth Certificate for the principal claimant and the younger female claimant,10 the Birth Certificate for the minor claimant,11 the Certificate of Baptism presented for all four claimants,12 the presented Confirmation of a Marriage Contract for the principal claimant and the younger female claimant,13 the Death Record for the elder female claimant\u2019s spouse,14 and each Egypt Personal Identification Card (for the three adult claimants).15\n[22] The panel also notes the twenty-one presented photographs which depicted attendance at places of Christian worship for the claimants. Although not labelled or dated, the panel considered these photographs in conjunction with the principal claimant\u2019s testimony, the presented letters of support, and the presented corroborating evidence related to the practice of the Coptic Orthodox faith by each of the four claimants.\n[23] Based on the testimony of the principal claimant, and in consideration of the corroborating evidence presented by the four claimants,16 the panel finds that all four claimants have established a subjective fear of returning to Egypt, based on the practice of their Coptic Orthodox Christian faith.\nObjective Basis of the Claims\n[24] The panel finds that the overall objective evidence supports the four claims for Convention refugee protection.\n[25] The elder female claimant has only resided in Zagazig, Sharkia (when she was a resident of Egypt). This residential history included seven short periods between 2013 and 2018, in addition to the longer period of September 1990 to May 2013.17 Similarly, the principal claimant resided in Zagazig from September 1990 to May 2011, and then again from February 2018 to March 2018.18\n[26] The younger female claimant resided in El Doukki, Giza from May 1987 to June 2010.19 After she was married,20 she resided with the principal claimant and the elder female claimant in Zagazig from February 2018 to March 2018.21\n[27] The principal claimant has a maternal aunt who resides in Egypt.22 He testified that he keeps in communication with the wife of his brother, who resides in Zagazig. The younger adult female claimant only has her younger brother, as a family member in Egypt.23\nReligious Profile of Egypt\n[28] Coptic Christians are a minority in Egypt but still constitute the largest single Christian community in the Middle East. The government estimates there are about five million Coptic Christians in Egypt, but the Coptic Orthodox Church estimates that there are between fifteen to eighteen million adherents in Egypt.24\n[29] Muslims and Christians live together in all parts of Egypt; however, there are larger concentrations of Christians in southern Egypt, especially in the governorates of Minia, Assiut, and Sohag, as well as in the big cities of Alexandria and Cairo. Christians are fewer in number in the Delta.25 There are suburbs in Cairo, other cities and some villages that are known to be Coptic Christian areas, but few are exclusively Coptic.26\nIntimidation of Christians in Egypt\n[30] On August 30, 2016, Egypt\u2019s parliament passed a new law on the construction and renovation of churches, which maintains restrictions and discriminates against the Christian minority.27 Coptic Christians in Egypt have suffered numerous cases of forced displacement, physical assaults, bomb and arson attacks, and blocking of church construction in recent years.28\n[31] The number and severity of violent incidents targeting Coptic Christians and their property has increased since 2015. This includes attacks by Daesh (alternatively known as Islamic State), which has stated its intent to target Christians and claimed responsibility for high profile bombings in Cairo, Alexandria, and Tanta in December 2016 and April 2017 resulting in scores of casualties.29\n[32] As such, the panel finds that the objective evidence supports the claims for Convention refugee protection for all four claimants.\nState Protection\n[33] Successive Egyptian governments have failed to tackle a longstanding pattern of discrimination against Coptic Christians and rising incidences of sectarian violence, by bringing those responsible for sectarian crimes to justice. Instead of prosecuting those behind such violent attacks the Egyptian government of Abdel Fattah al Sisi has continued to rely on state-sponsored reconciliation agreements, which in some cases have involved forcibly evicting Coptic Christians from areas where they are under threat.30\n[34] The Christian minority in Egypt remains underrepresented in the military and security services. Christians who were admitted at the entry level were seldom promoted into the upper ranks of government entities. Coptic Orthodox religious leaders appealed to the government to change the culture of a nation poisoned by extremism.31\n[35] The Abdel Fattah al Sisi government has sought to improve law and order, and has taken several highly visible steps towards bettering state relations with the Coptic Christian community. Al Sisi has vowed to bring the perpetrators of anti-Christian attacks to justice and has promised to rebuild churches damaged in sectarian attacks during the Morsi era. Despite these promises, recent incidents of anti-Christian violence over the past three years have been prompted or preceded by anger among some local Muslims over actual or alleged church construction. Even when authorities have made arrests, they have rarely prosecuted.32\nAdditional State Protection Considerations for the Female Claimants\n[36] The younger female claimant highlighted two physical attacks against her in Egypt, including a subway attack, and a more-recent February 18, 2018 attack when she was pregnant.33 As members of the wider Coptic Christian community, Coptic Christian women face discrimination and in some cases violence, from which they are not adequately protected by security forces.34\n[37] The panel finds that the documentary evidence is both clear and convincing, and that it rebuts the presumption of adequate state protection for each of the four claimants in Egypt. As such, the panel finds it unreasonable to expect any of the four claimants to seek redress or protection from the police or any other authorities in Egypt.\n[38] The panel also finds that adequate state protection would not be forthcoming to any of the four claimants, in each of their particular set of circumstances.\nInternal Flight Alternatives\n[39] As a result of the above-referenced country condition documentation from the National Documentation Package, the panel finds that a viable internal flight alternative does not exist for any of the four claimants in any place in Egypt.\n[40] As such, the panel finds that there are no places or regions in Egypt which could offer any of the four claimants safety from the reasonable chance of persecution, in each of their particular sets of circumstances, namely as Coptic Orthodox Christians who practice their faith in Egypt.\n[41] The panel finds that the four claimants each have a well-founded fear of persecution throughout Egypt, and that there is no viable internal flight alternative for any of them.\nCONCLUSION\n[42] Having considered all of the evidence, the panel finds that there is a serious possibility that each of the four claimants faces persecution in Egypt, based on their religion as Coptic Orthodox Christians.\n[43] The panel therefore accepts all four claims under section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n(signed) C.

In Mogadishu, members of Al Shabaab (alternate name spellings include Al-Shabaab,3 al-Shabaab4, and Harakat Al-Shabaab Al-Mujaahidiin5) had forced the claimant\u2019s parents to close their small Sufi shop. Their members also enforced Al Shabaab\u2019s fundamentalist interpretations of Islam.\n[4] In Jilib, the claimant and his father joined the claimant\u2019s paternal grandfather in raising forty cows and fifty goats. Al Shabaab took control of Jilib in 2008. Their members demanded quarterly taxation of the family\u2019s herd animals. The claimant\u2019s paternal grandfather died in 2015, but the claimant and his father continued to raise the animals for their meat and their milk production.\n[5] On January 21, 2018, four members of Al Shabaab approached the claimant\u2019s parents, in an attempt to recruit the claimant. The claimant\u2019s father was killed by one of the armed men, and the claimant\u2019s mother was threatened with death, if the claimant did not agree to be recruited the following day.\n[6] The claimant and his mother immediately fled to a residence thirty minutes outside Jilib, and took shelter with [XXX], a friend of the claimant\u2019s late father. [XXX] arranged for the burial of the claimant\u2019s father, as well as the sale of the family\u2019s livestock. The claimant and his mother relocated to Mogadishu, where the claimant arranged for a smuggler to take him to North America.\n[7] The smugger provided to the claimant a Finland passport, and she accompanied him to Canada on [XXX], 2018. The claimant made his claim for protection in April 2018.\nDETERMINATION\n[8] The panel finds that the claimant is a Convention refugee, pursuant to section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, based on his imputed political opinion, namely his refusal to be recruited into the Al Shabaab armed group.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[9] The claimant declared that his name was [XXX] and that his date of birth was [XXX], 1997, within his Basis of Claim Form responses, and within his responses to Generic Application Form for Canada, Schedule 12, and Schedule A.6 According to his Basis of Claim Form narrative and his responses to Generic Application Form for Canada, he was born in Mogadishu.\nTestimony of the Witness\n[10] The claimant invited a witness to testify in support of his identity and his nationality. [XXX] testified that he knew the claimant, as the witness was a former Jilib shopkeeper. The witness further testified that they met in August 2007, and that the claimant visited his Jilib shop three or four times a month, until October 2015 (when the witness\u2019 father was killed).\n[11] The panel finds that the witness testimony supported the narrative and the testimony of the claimant, in regards to his personal identity, as well as in regards to the claimant\u2019s Jilib residence, between 2007 and October 2015.\nClaimant\u2019s Sheikhal Clan Identity\n[12] The witness testified that both he and the claimant were members of the Sheikhal Lobogi clan.\n[13] The claimant presented a November 10, 2018 notarized letter from maternal Uncle [XXX], as well as a November 12, 2018 notarized affidavit from his mother.7 Both [XXX] and [XXX] confirmed that the claimant was from the Sheikhal clan, and that he practiced the Sufi rites of Sunni Islam.\n[14] A deponent\u2019s identity card or passport is normally required to sign an affidavit in Kenya.8 Regarding the November 12, 2018 notarized affidavit signed by [XXX], the panel notes that a verbal acknowledgment from [XXX], also without presented identification,9 was used by the notary public to verify the identity of [XXX]. No further evidence was adduced regarding the relationship between [XXX] and [XXX].\n[15] The panel assigned the testimony more probative value than the notarized letters, as neither the notarized letter (Somalia) nor the notarized affidavit (Kenya) was accompanied by the respective declarant\u2019s identification, for verification purposes.\n[16] The panel acknowledges that the Sheikhal clan has alternate names in Somalia, including Sheikal, Shekhal Lobogi, Shekhal Gendershe, in addition to the alternate name of Shekhash, used in Ethiopia.10 The Sheikhal are the common name for lineages with an inherited religious status. Because of their religious status they usually have privileged access to all parts of Somalia.11\n[17] Both Ashraf and Sheikhal peoples have achieved political influence and success in education and commerce with Arab countries, yet they can still face discrimination and human rights abuses in Somalia, on account of their non-clan origins and lack of an armed militia.12\nMidaynta Community Services\n[18] The presented November 21, 2018 letter signed by an administrator at Midaynta Community Services13 put forth the several indicators that the claimant was a member of the Sheikhal clan, and that he was a former resident of Somalia. An interview was completed with the claimant on November 21, 2018, in the standard Somali language. The claimant displayed accurate geographic knowledge and he was able to fluently speak in a dialect consistent with a resident of Somalia.\n[19] Although these types of interviews can never conclusively determine citizenship, the panel assigned the assessment probative value, in conjunction with the other oral and written evidence which was adduced, regarding the claimant\u2019s identity.\n[20] Based on the claimant\u2019s testimony and the totality of the written submissions,14 which were consistent with the objective evidence, the panel is satisfied that the claimant established that, on a balance of probabilities, he belongs to the Sheikhal clan.\nDocuments Confirming Identity and Citizenship in Somalia\n[21] The claimant testified that he has never been properly issued a passport in his lifetime, nor was he issued a driver\u2019s licence before his arrival in Canada. The claimant further testified that he has never been issued a voter\u2019s card or a national identification card (by any country).\n[22] The Government of Somalia ceased to exist in December 1990, and the country underwent a destructive and brutal civil war, in the course of which most records were destroyed. Those few records not destroyed are in the hands of private individuals, or are otherwise not retrievable. There are no circumstances under which a person born in Somalia can reasonably be expected to recover original documents held by the former government of Somalia. As such, most Somalis lack birth certificates.15\n[23] There is no official birth registration system in Somalia. Only hospitals are registering births.16 The claimant testified that he was born at a private residence in Mogadishu.\n[24] The panel finds that the documentary evidence from the National Documentation Package of Somalia indicates that the issuance and retention of official documents has been very challenging for all of the years that the claimant declared that he has been alive. As such, the panel finds the claimant\u2019s testimony about a lack of documents issued to him by officials in Somalia to be reasonable.\nResidential History, Academics, and Work History\n[25] The claimant indicated the he received three years of education within his response to Education\/Occupation Detail Question 2 of the Generic Application Form For Canada.17 The claimant left the response to Question 7 of Schedule A blank, where it asked to enumerate any completed years of education.18\n[26] In addition to the above responses, the claimant indicated in his Basis of Claim Form narrative that he had no formal education, but that his father taught him how to read and write. He attended a dugsi for education in the Sufi rites of Sunni Islam.19\n[27] When the panel put the difference between the Schedule A response and the Generic Application Form For Canada response to the claimant at the hearing, he testified that the three years he was referencing in the Generic Application Form For Canada were the years that his father taught him, namely from 2003 to 2006. These were the same three years a dugsi teacher came to his home to teach him about Sufi rites.\n[28] The claimant testified that he was never issued a results certificate by his dugsi teacher, and that he never sat for an examination in Somalia. As such, no educational documents from Somalia were issued to him.\n[29] The panel finds the claimant\u2019s explanation regarding the differences between his Schedule A response and his Generic Application Form For Canada response to be reasonable, and the panel finds the claimant\u2019s testimony about his lack of educational documents to be reasonable, under the circumstances.\n[30] The claimant was self-employed as a herder on his family\u2019s Jilib farm from February 2015 until January 2018, and he resided in Jilib during that same timeframe.20\n[31] The panel finds the claimant\u2019s testimony regarding the regions where he lived in his lifetime were consistent with the presented written evidence. The panel also finds the claimant\u2019s testimony regarding how his problems in Somalia developed to fluid and coherent. The panel therefore accepts this testimony as being credible.\nGlobal Identity Assessment\n[32] Having assessed all of the evidence presented, the panel finds the claimant\u2019s explanations to be reasonable under the circumstances, regarding the reasons why he was unable to produce sufficient credible documentation to corroborate his personal identity, in view of the circumstances which were present in Somalia since his declared birth.\n[33] The panel finds that, on a balance of probabilities, the claimant is who he claims to be, with regard to his name, his family situation, his place of birth, his nationality, and his Sheikhal clan membership.\n[34] Based on the above considerations, including the presented documents, as well as the claimant\u2019s testimony, and the testimony of the witness, the panel finds that the claimant has established his identity as a national of Somalia, based on a balance of probabilities.\nCredibility\n[35] The panel finds that the claimant testified at the hearing in a straightforward and consistent manner, without the use of embellishments, contradictions, or omissions from the details which were presented when he made his claim for protection. As such, the panel finds the claimant to be credible.\n[36] The panel finds that the country condition evidence supports the claimant\u2019s testimony, the testimony of the witness, and the Basis of Claim Form narrative statements,21 regarding the underlying reasons for the claimant\u2019s departure from Somalia on [XXX], 2018.22\n[37] Based on his testimony and the corroborating evidence presented,23 the panel finds that the claimant has a subjective fear of returning to Somalia.\nObjective Basis of the Claim\n[38] The overall objective evidence supports the claim for Convention refugee protection for the claimant based on his imputed political opinion. The panel finds that the presented evidence from the claimant, including his narrative statements,24 his testimony, the testimony of the witness, and the presented corroborating documents,25 is consistent with the objective evidence from the National Documentation Package for Somalia.26\nAl Shabaab\n[39] The claimant testified that he fears a return to Somalia because of the threat of forced recruitment at the hands of the Al Shabaab armed group. Members of Al Shabaab attempted to recruit the claimant on January 21, 2018. His father was fatally shot by the same men who attempted to recruit the claimant.\n[40] Al Shabaab aims to discredit and destabilize the Federal Government of Somalia and target any countries or entities that support Somalia\u2019s fight against Al Shabaab.27 The group\u2019s ideology is typically described as a brand of Salafism and Wahhabism that supports talifir, the excommunication of apostates or unbelievers.28\n[41] Over the past seven years, Al Shabaab\u2019 s military capacity has been considerably reduced due to the efforts of the African Union Mission in Somalia and Somali government forces, as well as internal division within Al Shabaab. Despite this, the group still controls large sections of rural areas, where it appears to have regrouped, as well as supply routes between towns. Al Shabaab appear to be more capable of launching larger, more complex targeted attacks.29\n[42] Al Shabaab are estimated to consist of between five and nine thousand armed fighters, who are able to move across regions to engage in combat.30 Despite extensive security measures being implemented across Mogadishu, last year\u2019s Independence Day attacks by Al Shabaab demonstrated continued operational capability for the group.31\n[43] Al Shabaab has an extensive network of sympathisers, informants, spies, and other collaborators throughout Somalia. The group is considered to be present everywhere in south and central Somalia, and they are assumed to have infiltrated Somali government institutions, the police force, and Somali National Army, according to a United Nations source. Al Shabaab also executed civilians suspected of having collaborated with its enemies.32\n[44] As a result of the referenced country condition documentation from the National Documentation Package, the panel finds that the claimant has established an objective basis for his claim, and that his fears are well-founded.\nState Protection\n[45] Continuing problems of corruption, mismanagement, and financial constraints have compromised the effectiveness of the Somali National Army, according to the United Nations Monitoring Group on Somalia and Eritrea. The clan alliances of certain army and police units threaten their impartiality in dealing with local clans. Irregular pay of the police and army staff in Somalia has had a negative impact on the security situation, leading to desertion and some members of security forces joining Al Shabaab. There are also indications of infiltration of the security forces by Al Shabaab.33\n[46] In light of the referenced country condition evidence, the panel finds that it would be objectively unreasonable for the claimant in his particular set of circumstances to seek the protection of the authorities in Somalia.\n[47] Based on his personal profile and Sheikhal clan membership profile, the panel finds that the claimant has rebutted the presumption of state protection with clear and convincing evidence of the state\u2019s inability to protect him, in his particular set of circumstances. The panel finds that on a balance of probabilities, adequate state protection would not be available to the claimant, should he return to Somalia, based on his membership in the Sheikhal clan.\nInternal Flight Alternatives\n[48] The panel finds that it would be unreasonable to expect the claimant to seek refuge in another part of Somalia, based on the country condition evidence related to the clan structure, and lack of available protection in Somalia.\n[49] With regards to possible internal flight alternatives for the claimant in Somalia, given that the Somali National Army and the police authorities are ineffective throughout Somalia, and based on the risks of harm to the claimant from the death threats made against him by members of Al Shabaab, the panel finds that there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout Somalia for the claimant, and therefore a viable internal flight alternative does not exist for him.\nCONCLUSION\n[50] The panel finds that there is a serious possibility that the claimant faces persecution in Somalia, pursuant to section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. The panel concludes that the claimant is a Convention refugee based on his imputed political opinion, namely his refusal to be recruited into the Al Shabaab armed group.\n[51] The panel therefore accepts the claim.\n(signed) C.

Shaffer\n\nCounsel for the claimant(s): Ugochukwu Udogu\n\nCountry: Cameroon\n\nRPD Number: TB8-07480\n\nATIP Number: A-2020-01459\n\nATIP Pages: 000114-000118\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: Okay, I am sorry for the delay again. I took a few moments to consider the evidence and I am going to accept your claim. I just have to read my reasons, okay. It is going to take me a few minutes.\n[2] [XXX], you are a citizen of Cameroon and you are seeking refugee protection pursuant to Sections 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[3] Your allegations are more fully set out in your Basis of Claim Form and in your testimony.\n[4] In summary, you allege that you fear persecution based on your political opinion and based on your ethnicity as an Anglophone Cameroonian. I find that you are a Convention refugee for the following reasons.\n[5] I find that you have established your identity on a balance of probabilities based on the certified true copies of your passport on files forwarded to the Refugee protection division by Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada.\n[6] I find that you have established a nexus to a Convention ground to your ethnicity as an Anglophone Cameroonian.\n[7] With respect to credibility, I have serious concerns about your alleged Sur Place political opinion. I find much of your evidence about your political activity within the Southern Cameroon\u2019s relief organisation suspect.\n[8] You alleged that you joined the party in early 2017 and attended a protest with this organisation in August 2017. You alleged that this protest is what led you to becoming of interest to the Cameroonian government. I am not persuaded by the evidence you presented on this matter.\n[9] All of your letters from this organisation indicate that you joined the organisation almost a year later than you said you did. You have no reasonable explanation for why you did not bring documentary evidence to correct the alleged error.\n[10] You had no documentary evidence to show that you attend this protest. I am not persuaded based on the evidence before me that you attended this protest.\n[11] I note that your documentary evidence indicates that you joined the organisation either shortly before or after you prepared your refugee claim.\n[12] You did not name the organisation correctly in your BOC, Basis of Claim Form and you had no reasonable explanation for why you would misname an organisation that you had allegedly joined which put your life at risk.\n[13] I had serious concerns about your motivation for joining this organisation and many other concerns about the evidence that you presented with respect to your alleged political activities.\n[14] However, I have no valid reason to doubt that you are an Anglophone from Cameron. I will rely on the Response to Information Request, CMR106141.E even though it was not disclosed prior to the hearing, but because the evidence contained within it is to your benefit.\n[15] I will excerpt the portion that I find particularly relevant, \u201cA joint statement by a group of UN independent experts expressed concerns over reports of the violence in the South West and North West at the end of 2017 where the country\u2019s Anglophone minority was reportedly suffering worsening human rights violations including excessive force by the security services, injuries, mass arrest, arbitrary detentions, torture, and other ill- treatments\u201d, UN November 17th, 2017.\n[16] According to US country report 2017, \u201cthere continue to be reports of arrest and disappearances of individuals by security forces in Cameroon\u2019s Anglophone regions, US, April 20th, 2018, 2.\n[17] A report by Amnesty International documents \u201cunlawful killings and extrajudicial executions, destruction of private property, arbitrary arrest and torture committed by the Cameroonian security forces during military operations in the Anglophone regions including the burning down of villages\u201d, Amnesty International, June 12th, 2018, 6.\n[18] Similarly, in correspondence with the research directorate or researcher in transnational African migration indicated that, more than 78 localities in Anglophone Cameroon have been burned down by the Cameroon military and that the civilians are killed on a daily basis, the Researcher, August 9th, 2018.\n[19] Correspondence with a Research Directorate, representative from International Crises Group indicated that in Bamenda, the regional capital of the predominantly Anglophone Northwest region the security of the Anglophones and Francophones too is not guaranteed.\n[20] This is because violence has been rising as a result of confrontation between security forces and armed separatists as well as several abuses on the population committed by both military and armed groups.\n[21] Security and military officers brutalise and then carry out arbitrary arrest, extort money from the population, intimidate girls and boys with guns and even rape girls. The above information on Bamenda also applies to Buea, Kumba, Menji, Mamfe, Bangu and other Anglophone localities especially rural areas\u201d. International Crises Groups, August 3rd, 2018.\n[22] Similarly, in correspondence with the Research Directorate, a representative at Nouveaux droits de l\u2019homme Cameroon, NDH Cameroon, an Yaounde-based NGO indicated in the document she prepared on the situation of Anglophones in Cameroon that armed forces in Bamenda <inaudible> fire live ammunitions, sometimes occupy houses at night for searches, carry out arbitrary arrest and use excessive force in all circumstances against individuals and Anglophone residents are caught in the crossfire of separatists and government forces\u201d, NDH Cameroon, August 2018.\n[23] According to sources, people have fled the violence in Anglophone regions <inaudible> Cameroon May 29th, 2018, Caritas May 15th, 2018.\n[24] The UN reports that, \u201cAnglophone Cameroonians began fleeing violence in October 2017 and continue to pour into Nigeria\u2019s Cross River, Taraba, Enugu, Akwa, Ibom states and total over 20000 refugees have been arrested in the area, UN March 20th, 2018.\n[25] Amnesty International similarly reports that as a result of the security operations conducted in Cameroon\u2019s Anglophone regions and the consequent violence, more than 20000 people fled to Nigeria and over 15000 people became internally displaced, Amnesty International June 12th,2018, page 6.\n[26] Similarly, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs OCHA reports that at least 160,000 people have been internally displaced in Cameroon\u2019s Anglophone region, UN, 29th May, 2018.\n[27] In an emergency response for these regions, OCHA further explained that clashes between non\u00adState armed groups and defence and security forces have displaced the civilian population into the surrounding forest and villages and that 80% of the displaced population have found refuge in the forest, UN, May 2018, page 3.\n[28] I find that the information contained in this RIR as well as other information from the National Documentation Package indicates that there is a serious possibility that Anglophones even ones that are not politically active, accordingly I find that as an Anglophone Cameroonian you face a serious possibility of persecution based on this ethnicity.\n[29] As the State is the agent of persecution against Anglophone Cameroonians, I find that here is no State protection available to you. For the same reason I find that, there is no internal flight alternative available to you.\n[30] Having considered all the evidence, I find that you are a Convention refugee for the above noted reason.\n[31] I am going to return your original documents. Thank you for your testimony today.\n[32] CLAIMANT: Thank you madam member.\n[33] MEMBER: That\u2019s it.\n[34] This hearing is now concluded.\n[35] CLAIMANT: Are we off the record?\n[36] MEMBER: No, I don\u2019t have discussions off the record. So if you would like to say something, go ahead?\n[37] CLAIMANT: Okay, So he did mean, additional, it is not why I mean it..\n[38] MEMBER: It\u2019s fine. Everything is done. So it doesn\u2019t matter. Thank you.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

Mortazavi\n\nCounsel for the claimant(s): Sherif Ashamalla\n\nCountry: Jordan\n\nRPD Number: TB8-06771\n\nATIP Number: A-2020-01459\n\nATIP Pages: 000107-000113\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] [XXX], the claimant, a male Muslim, is a citizen of Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan (Jornan). He is claiming refugee protection under sections 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).1\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] The claimant\u2019s allegations are detailed in his narrative of his Basis of Claim Form (BOC), signed on March 14, 2018.2\n[3] In summary, his evidence indicates that he had an out-of-wedlock relationship with a Christian woman named [XXX], whom he met her in 2016. In support of [XXX] existence, he submitted two photographs,3 and testified under oath that the woman depicted in the two photographs is [XXX].\n[4] In January 2017, the claimant told his parents that he intended to marry a Christian woman, with whom he had a sexual relationship with. His parents disapproved. The claimant alleged that in early February 2017, he was threatened and humiliated by one of [XXX] male relatives while he was walking on the street and holding hands with [XXX]. She left him, and walked away. He alleged that he has not seen her since, and he was later blocked from her Facebook account.\n[5] He alleged that while he was walking home on February 13, 2017, he was hit by a car. He lost consciousness, and was taken to the hospital by a bystander. He was hospitalized for three days. In support of this allegation, the claimant submitted a copy of the complaint form he had filed with the police, dated February 13, 2017, against an unknown driver.4 He also submitted a copy of a medical report, dated February 16, 2017.5\n[6] The claimant alleged that during the incident he lost his phone and belongings. The claimant speculated and alleged that this incident was orchestrated by [XXX] family, in attempt to kill him. He further states that neither [XXX] nor any of his family members visited him while he was in the hospital.\n[7] The claimant alleged that he has not heard from [XXX] since he was blocked from her Facebook. However, the claimant\u2019s friend, [XXX], in the United States (US), did speak to her once via Facebook Messenger, in order to encourage [XXX] to go to the US with the claimant. Subsequently, [XXX] Facebook account was closed, and [XXX] was blocked. Thus, [XXX] and the claimant have not been able to contact her via social media since April 2017.6\n[8] The claimant alleged that his four brothers and uncles have disowned him officially because of the hateful relationship between the claimant\u2019s tribe and [XXX] tribe.7\n[9] The claimant testified that he fears [XXX] family, that they would try to kill him because he has dishonored them. He explained that he no longer has protection of his own family and tribe, and that the police will not protect him because it is a family honor issue. He fears being a victim of honor killing if he were to return to Jordan.\nDETERMINATION\n[10] The panel finds that the claimant is a person in need of protection pursuant to section 97(1) of the IRPA for the following reasons.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[11] The panel finds that the claimant, on a balance of probabilities, is a citizen of Jordan, and has established his personal identity based on the copy of his original passports.8\nCredibility\n[12] Notwithstanding the issue of delay in claiming asylum in Canada, and the credibility assessment of the car incident, given that the culprits were unknown and the claimant merely speculates that [XXX] family had planned it, the panel gives the benefit of the doubt to the claimant\u2019s evidence with respect to having a relationship with [XXX], and accepts that, on a balance of probabilities, the basis of his subjective fear is true.\nObjective evidence\n[13] Having considered the totality of the evidence and counsel\u2019s submissions, the panel finds that there is sufficient credible or trustworthy objective evidence before it to support the claimant\u2019s subjective fear.\n[14] The documentary evidence indicates that honor killing persist in Jordan. However, while it refers to women being target of honor killing, it makes no such reference to men. In fact, \u201c[a]ccording to estimates, there are an average of 20-25 so-called honour killings reported every year in Jordan.\u201d9\n[15] According to US Department of State report:\nThere were no reported instances of forced marriage as an alternative to a potential honor killing during the year, although NGOs noted that many cases of forced marriage occurred shortly after an accusation of rape due to family and societal pressure before any formal trial began. Observers noted that if a woman marries her rapist, according to customary belief, her family members do not need to kill her to \u201cpreserve the family\u2019s honor,\u201d a belief that persisted despite the 2017 amendment to the legal code.10\n[16] The review of the documentary evidence indicates that the main victims of honor killings are women, and their family members are also at risk of honor killings. Regarding family members, and disputes between tribes, the claimant submitted a news article, dated May 21, 2018. It notes that, \u201ca group of members of the Shawabkeh tribe, led by a former Royal Guard officer, and seven others, including retired members of the security services, brutally assault[ed] a young Al-Fayez family.\u201d11\n[17] The documentary evidence indicates:\nIn the past, Article 98 of the Penal Code was applied to reduce penalties for men who perpetrated violent crimes against women, such as murder or assault, after the woman had committed a dishonourable act. Article 98 was amended in 2017 to prevent it from being used to reduce penalties for so-called \u2018honour\u2019 crimes against women.12\n[18] A recent Human Rights Watch report indicates that, \u201c[a]ccording to press reports, about 20 women are killed in Jordan each year by male family members in so-called \u201cfamily honor\u201d crimes.\u201d13\n[19] The panel finds that in the circumstances of this case, on the balance of probabilities, the claimant could be a target of honor killing if he were to return to Jordan.\nProtection\n[20] Refugee protection is meant to be a form of surrogate protection to be invoked only in those situations where the refugee claimant has unsuccessfully sought the protection of their home state. The onus is on the refugee claimant to approach the state for protection, in situations where state protection might be reasonably forthcoming.14 In the absence of a compelling explanation, a failure to pursue state protection opportunities within the home state will usually be fatal to a refugee claim, at least, where the state is a functioning democracy with a willingness and the apparatus necessary to provide a measure of protection to its citizens.\n[21] In the case at hand, the state is not the agent of persecution. The claimant fears [XXX] tribe. However, the panel needs to determine whether the state would be willing to offer the claimant protection, if he were to seek state protection.\n[22] The panel notes that the US Department of State report indicates that:\n\u2026 Jordan is a constitutional monarchy \u2026 The constitution concentrates executive and legislative authority in the king\u2026 Elections for the Chamber of Deputies occur approximately every four years and last took place in 2016. International observers deemed the elections organized, inclusive, credible, and technically well run.\nCivilian authorities maintained effective control over the security forces.15\n[23] The documentary evidence filed establishes that the police rarely investigate honour killings on their own initiative:\n\u2026 it is clear that there is a strong connection between tribalism and the protection of women\u2019s rights once cases reach court. One focus group member described this relationship, saying \u201ceven at court there are tribal dynamics at play, so it\u2019s not as if it\u2019s two separate systems \u2026 they are totally intertwined.\u201d\n\u2026\nThe state law in Jordan reflects what many believe to be tribal principles in how it deals with men who kill their female relatives they suspect of not being chaste. The bias towards the perpetrators of this crime is evident early in the process. [Human Rights Watch] claims that in Jordan the police rarely investigate so-called honour killings and \u201ctypically treat the killers as vindicated men.\u201d Or when the police do conduct an investigation, they routinely conduct faulty investigations that fail to produce enough evidence for conviction.\n\u2026\nTribal processes seem to be primarily used today in Jordan for violations against life, limb and honour. The first of these are referred to as \u2018blood crimes\u2019 and criminal responses to violations of the first are known as \u2018honour crimes\u2019. A mentioned, tribal principles and processes of dispute resolution are used in Jordan not just by those living nomadically but also by many people of all socioeconomic backgrounds with tribal affiliations living in villages or cities like Amman.16\n[24] The claimant must establish, through clear and convincing evidence, that the state would be unwilling or unable to provide adequate protection if he were to return to his home country, Jordan. In view of the objective evidence noted above, in the circumstances of this case, the panel finds the claimant has rebutted the presumption of state protection.\nInternal flight alternative\n[25] Jordan is a small tribal country. Moreover, the documentary evidence indicates that attitudes towards honour are the same throughout the country.\n[26] In the circumstances of this case, there is no viable internal flight alternative available to the claimant in Jordan.\nCONCLUSION\n[27] The panel finds, [XXX], is a person in need of protection pursuant to section 97(1) of the IRPA, as he faces a particularized risk of harm. On a balance of probabilities, his removal to Jorden may subject him to a risk to life, to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or to a danger of torture.\n[28] The panel therefore accepts his claim.\n(signed) F.

Seevaratnam\n\nCounsel for the claimant(s): Paul VanderVennen\n\nCountry: Ethiopia\n\nRPD Number: TB8-04005\n\nATIP Number: A-2020-01459\n\nATIP Pages: 000096-000106\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] The claimant, [XXX], claims to be a citizen of Ethiopia and he is claiming protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).1\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] The claimant alleges that he fears returning to Ethiopia because of his perceived political opinion in opposition of the Ethiopian regime, due to his ethnicity as a member of the Oromo tribe.\n[3] The claimant testified that his father is a prominent advocate for the equality and freedom of the Oromo people.2 He is an active member and participant in the Oromo Federalist Congress (OFC).3\n[4] On October 8, 2017, the claimant participated in the Irecha Festival at Gefersa dam.4 The claimant testified that he and his friends enjoyed the celebrations until some young people turned the event into an anti-government protest. This resulted in an intervention by the anti-riot members of the federal police. The claimant and his friends quickly dispersed.5\n[5] The claimant testified that on October 9, 2017, around 7:00 a.m. he was awoken by his father who indicated that the police officers were waiting for him outside their family home. The claimant stated that his father advised him to be co-operative since they could become aggressive. The claimant explained that he was handcuffed and taken to Kolfe Keranyo sub-city police station where he was interrogated and accused of participating in the Oromo unrest.6 The claimant denied participating in the public protest as a consequence he was severely beaten with a rubber hose and threatened to confess.7\n[6] The claimant testified that he was detained for five days and finally released on bail that was posted by his mother on [XXX], 2017. He was warned not to leave Addis Ababa and not to participate in any public gathering or meetings.8 He was told not to even attend church.9\n[7] The claimant believes that there is no protection for the Oromo people in Ethiopia since political opposition is not tolerated. He fears re-arrest and torture since the security forces suspect him to be a political opponent of the government of Ethiopia. Thus, the claimant fled to Canada in search of safety.\n[8] During his absence from Ethiopia, the claimant has been informed by his father that the police have attended at their family home, in search of the claimant.10\nDETERMINATION\n[9] The panel finds the claimant to be a Convention refugee. The panel\u2019s reasons are as follows.\nIDENTITY\n[10] The claimant submitted a copy of his passport issued by the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, which was certified to be a true copy by an Immigration Officer on January 26, 2018.11\n[11] The claimant also provided a copy of his birth certificate,12 his Kebele identity which identifies his ethnicity as Oromo,13 his father\u2019s membership card14 and membership dues paid with Oromo Federalist Congress (OFC).15 The panel was provided with the original identity documents for examination in advance of the hearing, which was helpful in assessing identity.\n[12] The panel is satisfied that the claimant is a citizen of Ethiopia and that he is a member of the Oromo community.\nCREDIBILITY\n[13] The panel is guided by the leading jurisprudence on the issue of credibility. Maldonado stands for the principle that when a claimant \u201cswears to the truth of certain allegations, this creates a presumption that those allegations are true, unless there is reason to doubt their truthfulness.\u201d16\n[14] The claimant responded to all questions clearly and directly. He was straightforward. His sworn viva voce evidence was consistent with his Basis of Claim Form (BOC),17 the police statement,18 the bail receipt,19 and witness letters,20 as well as the documentary evidence.21\n[15] The panel was provided with the original for each of the items in the claimant\u2019s documents,22 in advance of the hearing.\n[16] The panel finds the claimant to be a credible and trustworthy witness. Accordingly, he has established his subjective fear of persecution.\nWELL-FOUNDED FEAR OF PERSECUTION\n[17] The claimant participated in a celebration at Gefersa dam, which was turned into a public protest by a few young people. This resulted in the claimant being falsely accused of participating in activities against the government. Consequently, the claimant was arrested, interrogated, detained, and tortured by the security forces in Ethiopia.\n[18] The police report dated October 13, 2017, accuses the claimant of \u201ccausing public unrest on the Gefersa Irrecha festival.\u201d23 The police report corroborates the claimant\u2019s arrest and detention. Furthermore, the bail money receipt issued by the Kolfe Keranyo police department confirms the claimant\u2019s release upon payment of bail.24\n[19] Current and reliable media reports submitted by counsel for the claimant indicates that \u201c67 people were killed in Ethiopia\u2019s Oromia sate this week as protests against Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed morphed into ethnic clashes.\u201d25 The report further states that according to Amnesty International, \u201csince Abiy took office, there have been several waves of mass arrests of people in Oromiya perceived to be opposed to the government. Detainees were not charged or taken to court\u2026\u201d26 This is similar to the predicament faced by the claimant when he was in Ethiopia.\n[20] Furthermore, a press statement by the African Commission on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights (ACHPR) on the human rights situation in the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia finds that:27\nThe Commission is gravely concerned by the escalation of protests which have been taking place in the Oromia region since the 23rd October 2019. Those protests have spiraled into clashes amongst civilians and between civilians and security forces, and they are increasingly being fanned by ethnic and religious under\u00adcurrents, with groups being mobilized to attack minority ethnic communities and churches.\n[21] In addition, the ACHPR reminds the Ethiopian government that:28\n\u2026 [I]t is obligated to take measures for restoring peace and reassuring the country. It should ensure that its security forces take appropriate measures to protect civilians, and that they do not use indiscriminate force in this regard. It should investigate arising human rights violations, prosecute perpetrators and provide effective remedies to victims.\n[22] The panel has carefully reviewed reputable and reliable sources in assessing the objective basis of this claim. According to the Bertelsmann Stiftung\u2019s Transformation Index (BTI) 2018 Country Report for Ethiopia:29\nAccording to the constitution, individuals, and groups who want to protest only need to inform the government, not seek permission. The government often declines permits for protest that are not pro-government. Whenever protests go ahead without permits, the government uses violent means and coercive tactics to crack down on protestors. During the Oromo and Amhara protests, security forces allegedly killed well over 1,000 people, with the government admitting the death of over 500 people.\nThe government has increasingly curtailed the freedom of expression and organization of politicians, journalists, NGOs [non-governmental organizations] and human rights organization, thus making Ethiopia a de facto dictatorship.\n[23] According to a reputable report by Freedom House titled \u201cFreedom of the Press 2017: Ethiopia Profile\u201d:30\nEthiopia\u2019s media are dominated by state-owned broadcasters and government\u00ad oriented newspapers. Many private newspapers, which generally have low circulation, report that officials attempt to control content through article placement requests and telephone calls to editors about stories that are critical of the government. Reporters who cover controversial topics risk being arrested or dismissed from their jobs.\n\u2026\nCensorship and self-censorship are routinely practiced. Government control of the country\u2019s primary printing press allows for prepublication censorship of newspapers. The risk of job loss, harassment, prosecution, and arbitrary arrest encourage journalists to self-censor.\n[24] Another Freedom House report for 2018 Ethiopian country conditions indicates that \u201c[t]he Ethiopian government maintains, and exercises, the ability to censor critical or opposition websites.\u201d31 The report further states that that \u201copposition members in Ethiopia and the diaspora have accused the government of tapping their phones or monitoring their electronic communications.\u201d32\n[25] The United States Department of State\u2019s (DOS) \u201cEthiopia 2018 Human Rights Report\u201d indicates the following:33\nHuman rights issues included reports of unlawful or arbitrary killings by security forces and between citizens; forced disappearances by some government forces; torture; harsh and life-threatening prison conditions; arbitrary arrest and detention by security forces; political prisoners; interference with privacy; censorship and site blocking; substantial interference with the rights of peaceful assembly and freedom of association, such as overly restrictive nongovernmental organization laws; and significant restrictions on freedom of movement \u2026\n[26] The DOS report further states that:34\nThere were numerous reports that the government and its representatives committed arbitrary and unlawful killings. Security forces used excessive force against civilians.\nA July 31 report from the independent nongovernmental organization (NGO) Human Rights Council (HRCO) that documented field investigations in 26 districts across seven zones in the Oromia and Somali Regions found that federal and regional security forces, as well as mobs of local youth, killed 733 citizens between January 2017 and January 2018.\n[27] According to a Freedom House report, \u201cEthiopia is an authoritarian state ruled by the Ethiopian People\u2019s Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF), which has been in power since 1991 and currently holds every seat in Parliament.\u201d35 The report further states that, \u201c[o]pponents of the EPDRF find it nearly impossible to operate inside Ethiopia. Authorities frequently invoke antiterrorism legislation against dissenters.\u201d36\n[28] Moreover, this report indicates the following:37\nIntense government pressure opposition parties from winning political representation through elections. There are no opposition members in the national parliament, nor in regional parliaments\u2026 Opposition party members were intimidated, detained, beaten, and arrested ahead of the polls.\n\u2026\nThe authoritarian one-party system in Ethiopia largely excludes the public from any genuine and autonomous political participation.\n[29] In its report titled \u201cEthiopia: Political situation and treatment of opposition,\u201d the Danish Immigration Service states that:38\n\u2026[M]embers of the diaspora community were, \u2018without doubt\u2019 monitored closely by the government, wherever they might reside. This is, according to the interlocutor, no secret\u2026\nThe editor noted that if Ethiopians participate in demonstrations against the Ethiopian regime in a foreign country, be it in Europe or in the USA, would be video-taped to document their activity. This would also be the case if members of the diaspora had gotten foreign nationality. Thus they would fear that they were to return to Ethiopia then something might happen to them upon return. As examples of what might occur, Mr. Giorgis mentioned that they could run the risk of being detained in the airport or jailed \u2026\n[30] According to an EU representative, under the current regime \u201c10,000 of political prisoners had been released, others were still arrested by the police on political grounds.\u201d39\n[31] In September 2018, the police commissioner of Addis Ababa indicated that nearly \u201c3,000 youths were arrested in the capital Addis Ababa over the weekend, and that 174 would be charged and 1,200 others would be detained at the Tolay Military Camp for a \u2018rehabilitation education.\u201d\u201840 In response, Amnesty International stated that \u201c[w]hile the Ethiopian authorities have in recent months made a commendable attempt to empty the country\u2019s prisons of arbitrary detainees, they must not fill them up by arbitrarily arresting and detaining more people without charge.\u201d41\n[32] Based on this country documentary evidence and the credible allegations, the panel finds that the claimant has a well-founded fear of persecution in Ethiopia, by reason of the claimant\u2019s ethnicity as Oromo and his perceived political opinion.\nSTATE PROTECTION\n[33] There is a presumption that except in situations where the state is in complete breakdown, the state is capable of protecting its citizens.42 To rebut the presumption of state protection, a claimant must provide clear and convincing evidence of the state\u2019s inability to protect its citizens.43\n[34] According to the 2018 Political Transformation Index Country Report for Ethiopia, \u201c[t]he Ethiopian judiciary lacks both a structural and functional independence.\u201d44\n[35] The DOS report states that \u201c[c]orruption, especially the solicitation of bribes, including police and judicial corruption, remained a problem.\u201d45 The report further finds that the \u201claw provides criminal penalties for conviction of corruption. The government did not implement effectively or comprehensively.\u201d46 Moreover, the DOS report indicates that human rights issues have diminished, although \u201c[t]he government at times did not take steps to prosecute officials who committed human rights abuses, resulting in impunity for violators.\u201d47\n[36] The 2019 Human Rights Watch report for Ethiopia indicates that:48\nGovernment officials often dismissed allegations of torture, contrary to credible evidence\u2026\n\u2026\nThe government did not take any steps to carry out investigations into the killings [of] over 1,000 protesters by security forces during wide spread protests in 2015 and 2016 in Oromia and other regions\u2026\n[37] The claimant was arrested, detained and tortured by the Ethiopian security forces in Addis Ababa on [XXX], 2017.49 The claimant fears that he would be arrested, detained, and mistreated upon his return to Ethiopia. Given his previous arrest, the claimant would be perceived to be an opponent of the state, if he were to return to Ethiopia today.\n[38] The National Documentation Package,50 and the documents submitted by the claimant51 make clear that the state is the agent of persecution and, in these particular circumstances, is clear and convincing evidence that the state is unable or unwilling to protect the claimant.\n[39] Accordingly, the panel finds that the claimant has met the burden of proof, on a balance of probabilities, and the presumption of state protection has been rebutted.\nINTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE (IFA)\n[40] The Federal Court of Appeal established a two-part test for assessing an IFA in Rasaratnam and Thirunavukkarasu:\n(1) As per Rasaratnam, \u201cthe Board must be satisfied on a balance of probabilities that there is no serious possibility of the claimant being persecuted in the part of the country to which it finds an IFA exists\u201d52 and\/or the claimant would not be personally subject to a risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture in the IFA.\n(2) Moreover, the conditions in the part of the country considered to be an IFA must be such that it would not be unreasonable in all the circumstances including those particular to the claim, for him to seek refuge there.53\n[41] The claimant bears the burden of proof to demonstrate that he would be persecuted on a Convention ground, or subject personally, on a balance of probabilities, to a risk to life, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in all of Ethiopia.\n[42] It is evident that the Ethiopian security forces operate with impunity throughout the country. The documentary evidence corroborates the claimant\u2019s testimony that there is no state protection available to him, since the state security forces are his agent of persecution. As such, there is no safety for the claimant anywhere within Ethiopia.\nCONCLUSION\n[43] For the above-mentioned reasons, the panel finds [XXX] to be a Convention refugee. The claimant has established that there is a reasonable chance of persecution, if he were to return to his country of nationality, Ethiopia, today.\n(signed) S.

Charow\n\nCounsel for the claimant(s): Aishah Nofal\n\nCountry: Sudan\n\nRPD Number: TB8-03866\n\nAssociated RPD Numbers: TB8-03910, TB8-03947, TB8-03948\n\nATIP Number: A-2020-01459\n\nATIP Pages: 000090-000095\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: This is the decision for [XXX] File TB8-03866 the associated adult claimant [XXX] File TB8-03910 and the associated minor claimants [XXX] File TB8-03947 and [XXX] File number TB8-03948.\n[2] I\u2019ve considered your testimony and the other evidence in this case and I am ready to render my decision orally.\n[3] You\u2019re claiming to be citizens of Sudan and are claiming refugee protection pursuant to Sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[4] The principal claimant has been appointed as the designated representative for the minor claimants, his children. I find that you are Convention refugees for the following reasons;\n[5] The allegations of your claims can be found in your basis of claims forms at exhibits 2 through 5 and the subsequent amendments at Exhibits 8 and 13.\n[6] In short you allege persecution from Sudan\u2019s national intelligence and security service or NASS based on essentially two things. First you allege that you were arrested with a colleague for printing pro (inaudible) materials and that you were also the last one to see that colleague alive.\n[7] Secondly you allege that you\u2019ve been politically active online after leaving Sudan and the NASS has been monitoring these posts. You allege receiving threats including threats of being met at the airport if you return to Sudan because of this online posting. You fear future physical harm or death for yourself or your family should you return to Sudan.\n[8] I note that there were allegations made about the risk of female genital mutilation for the female minor claimant. I will not consider that as it is not determinative because your political opinions and your family\u2019s membership in a particular social group due to your political opinions are the determinative issue in this matter. You allege there\u2019s no state protection for you nor any internal flight alternative.\n[9] Based on the Sudanese passports in exhibit 1 and your overall credible testimony I do find that identity and country of reference have been established on a balance of probabilities.\n[10] I further find that on the balance of probabilities you have established that you and your family will be at risk of persecution because of your political opinion.\n[11] I did note some issues with your testimony; specifically I noted a basis of claim or a basis of claim amendment, omission of someone assisting you in getting your passport when you first left Sudan.\n[12] I further note that there was very little mention of any social media activity at all in your basis of claim form or the subsequent amendment but very specifically you had allege that you received threats over Face book because of the way you were posting about Sudanese political issues, there was no mention at all of any threats in your basis of claim form or the subsequent amendments.\n[13] I did put these issues to you over the course of the hearing; although you\u2019ve provided some explanation I was not satisfied that your explanations adequately explain these omissions. That does negatively impact your credibility.\n[14] However I do balance those issues with the other parts of your testimony which I did find to be credible. This includes detailed, spontaneous evidence about your arrest. I note that on this line testimony, your testimony was consistent with your basis of claim form and you were able to give details when asked to do so that went beyond your basis of claim description of these events.\n[15] I did find this to be very persuasive. I also note that in support of your claim you provided additional documents to substantiate your allegations. I note pictures of the claimant\u2019s attending protests here in Canada, pictures of attending an event which was essentially about a book that had been authored about corruption and other issues with the NISS, a letter from your brother explaining that you had discussed this event and you had sent him a photo of you in that author and that subsequently your brother had been arrested and questioned about this activity.\n[16] I further see the What\u2019s app messages with your brother where you had discussed the event. I note photographs of your brother\u2019s injuries after he had been arrested, letters from the brother of your co\u00adworker who had been arrested at the same time as you in 2006, medical reports from here in Canada confirming scaring and getting the opinion that the presentation of your injuries is consistent with the allegations about how you received those injuries and I further note letters from your mother and sister and brother to confirm that they witnessed or experienced your arrest.\n[17] Today you also showed me on your phone that you under an assumed name on Face book but still one that could be connect to you and your family had made posts in groups entitled no to high prices, freedom to Sudanese people, no to greed hash tag independent justice system the revolution continues, the national movement group, republican brotherhood and the November 27th movement civilian take over.\n[18] You did show me that directly through Face book and I was able to navigate through that, we were able to have that interpreted by cite by Madame Interpreter.\n[19] I\u2019ve also considered whether your re-availments to Sudan negatively impact your credibility; however you\u2019ve offered evidence that your mother was ill and you felt you needed to go back and went with the assistance of someone who worked at the airport.\n[20] In consideration of the supporting documents provided at Exhibit 10 which do establish your mother\u2019s illness, I do find that you\u2019ve offered a reasonable explanation for these re-availments, it does not impact your credibility.\n[21] I further considered whether your failure to claim asylum in the Netherlands impacts your credibility, however you\u2019ve testified that at that time you had stable status in Oman and there was no risk of not, there was no risk should you have not made a claim there. I do find that\u2019s a reasonable explanation for that failure to claim again it does not impact your credibility.\n[22] I further considered whether your failure to claim asylum in the United States after you had lost status in Oman negatively impacts your credibility. You explained that the intention was to claim protection in Canada. You spent four days in the United States before crossing irregularly into Canada.\n[23] You had also testified that you completed your own research into the situation in the United States and had learned that the United States had anti-immigrant policies at that time. In consideration of the current political climate in the United States and your relative short stay there again four days, I do find that you\u2019ve offered a reasonable explanation for your failure to claim asylum in the United States. I will not draw any negative inference regarding your credibility from this issue.\n[24] I do find that the credible evidence available to me outweighs the negative credibility inferences I drew from the omitted allegations.\n[25] Therefore overall I do find you to be credible. I therefore find your allegations as outlined in your basis of claim form and your testimony to be credible. I find that you\u2019ve established your subjective fear.\n[26] I find there\u2019s a link between what you fear and two of the five convention grounds, specifically you have been persecuted by the Sudanese government and may be at risk of further persecution because of your antigovernment political opinions.\n[27] I also note that the associated claimants hold membership in a particular social group as the family member of someone with a political opinion. Therefore these claims have been assessed under Section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[28] The objective documentation supports your allegations that individuals in your circumstance face persecution in Sudan. Before I discuss the available evidence I will note that I can take notice that there has been a change in the regime in Sudan, I can take notice from the available news that we can see on a regular basis, however when considering that I note that any report that I\u2019ve seen suggests that this regime change is in name only. There\u2019s no evidence before me to describe any improving situation in Sudan, rather there\u2019s still evidence of people being persecuted for political opinions.\n[29] There\u2019s no indication that this would stop just because the person at the head of the government has changed. Without that evidence I will still rely on the national documentation package as found at Exhibit 6 of the national documentation package for Sudan.\n[30] I specifically note Item 1.4 which states that the NISS is responsible for the management of operations for national security. Under Sudanese legislation individuals suspected to be a threat to the state may be detained without charge for up to forty five days without judicial review.\n[31] I also note that the same piece of legislation provides NISS officials with impunity for acts involving their official duties. This evidence suggests or states that though the NISS has for the last decade perpetrated human rights violations with impunity, its current human rights violations have reached unprecedented levels.\n[32] The NISS has used excessive and sometimes lethal force in breaking up demonstrations, protests and rallies as well as office raids and confiscation of newspapers, perpetrated arbitrary arrests and deliberately targeted ethnic and religious minorities.\n[33] There were also several reports of individuals detained due to their actual or assumed support of antigovernment forces.\n[34] I\u2019ve considered this documentary evidence in conjunction with your credible allegations about your political opinions. I find that you have a well founded fear and that you face a serious possibility of persecution based on your political opinion.\n[35] I further note that the national documentation package states that there\u2019s evidence of the Sudanese authorities targeting family members of people who are of interest to them. I refer to Items 1.4 and 1.7 of the national documentation package.\n[36] Therefore I find that there is a well founded fear and a serious possibility of persecution for the associated claimants in this matter, as family members of someone with a political opinion.\n[37] As the agent of persecution is the state which acts with impunity, I find that there is clear and convincing evidence that state protection would not be available to you. Likewise as antigovernment political opinions are persecuted throughout the country and the NISS operates across the country there would be no safe place for you anywhere in Sudan.\n[38] As the test for an internal flight alternative fails on the first prong I find there would be no internal flight alternative available.\n[39] Based on the totality of the evidence I find the claimant\u2019s to be Convention refugees. Your claims are therefore accepted.\n[40] So this will conclude today\u2019s hearing. I\u2019d like to thank everyone for their participation. Thank you Madame Interpreter, thank you counsel and thank you both.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

Hamilton\n\nCountry: Sri Lanka\n\nRPD Number: TB8-03757\n\nATIP Number: A-2020-01459\n\nATIP Pages: 000084-000089\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: This is the decision of refugee protection claim for file number TB8-03757.\n[2] The panel has considered the claimant\u2019s testimony and the other evidence in this case and is ready to render an oral decision.\n[3] The claimant is a citizen of Sri Lanka and is claiming refugee protection pursuant to Section 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[4] Since this case involves gender related issues the panel also considered the guidelines within Chairperson\u2019s guideline number four titled women refugee claimants fearing gender related persecution.\n[5] Preliminary issues were also addressed at the hearing, and the panel accepted late disclosure documents which are relevant and probative to this claim and these documents were accepted as exhibits. The panel notes this hearing was held in two sittings.\n[6] With regards to determination, the panel finds that the claimant is a Convention refugee for the following reasons. The claimant has established a serious possibility of persecution based on the Convention grounds of a perceived political opinion and her ethnicity.\n[7] The claimant\u2019s allegations are set out in the claimant\u2019s Basis of Claim Form and her amended Basis of Claim Form and was further supplemented by her testimony and supporting documents.\n[8] The claimant alleges that she fears persecution at the hands of the Sri Lankan army and pro\u00adgovernment militants, including the Karuna group because of the perceived political opinion that she is a supporter of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, herein called the LTTE. The claimant also fears persecution in Sri Lanka because her \u2026 of her ethnicity as a Tamil.\n[9] In summary, the claimant is a 26-year-old single female from Jaffna the Northern Region of Sri Lanka. She grew up during the civil war and was fearful because the Sri Lankan army visited her family home on several occasions in search of LTTE supporters.\n[10] The claimant alleges that she was detained by police on a number of occasions which started back in January of 2009. In April 2009 she was taken to an army camp with other girls where she was beaten and accused of joining the LTTE.\n[11] While at university in Batticaloa the claimant alleges that she also encountered problems with the army Intelligence Unit and members of the Karuna group who interrogated her because she was suspected of being an LTTE supporter. And she was accused of being a Tamil Tiger Cub at that time.\n[12] In May 2016 at age 23 the claimant returned to Jaffna and became an active member of her community. She was again questioned by army officers in relation to her community activities and her perceived LTTE activities.\n[13] The claimant alleges that the main fearful incident that led to her decision to flee Sri Lanka occurred in November 2017 when she was taken to an army camp where she was detained for seven hours and interrogated after being accused of being an LTTE supporter. During her interrogation an army officer made physical, sexual advances towards her and she was threatened with detention under the country\u2019s Prevention of Terrorism Act.\n[14] As a result of this incident of November 28th, 2017 the claimant\u2019s father contacted an agent smuggler who secured a false Canadian passport for the claimant. The claimant fled Sri Lanka on [XXX], 2017, arriving in Canada the following day, and she claimed refugee protection a few weeks later.\n[15] With regards to analysis, the panel considered all of the evidence submitted and determined the following.\n[16] On a balance of probabilities, the claimant\u2019s identity as a citizen of Sri Lanka is established by testimony and the copy of her national identity card and birth certificate.\n[17] With regards to credibility, testimony given under oath is presumed to be true unless there is a valid reason to doubt its truthfulness.\n[18] The panel considered the claimant\u2019s testimony as a whole and the panel finds that the claimant was a credible witness and the panel believes what has been alleged in support of this claim relating to the key elements of this claim.\n[19] Although the claimant\u2019s testimony was disjointed at times during the hearing, nonetheless, the panel is satisfied that her testimony was generally consistent with \u2026 in relation to central elements of this claim. Further, the panel is satisfied that any inconsistencies, contradictions, or omissions that were central to this claim are adequately explained.\n[20] Specifically, the panel is satisfied that the claimant did not claim refugee protection in India prior to coming to Canada since she was in transit through India en route to Canada.\n[21] The panel is also satisfied that the claimant would be of interest to the Sri Lankan authorities as they have visited her family since she left Sri Lanka to inquire about her whereabouts.\n[22] In addition, the panel is cognizant that the claimant was interrogated by the CID and jailed at the Negombo Prison in [XXX] 2016 where she was fingerprinted and again accused of being an LTTE members. So, returning to Sri Lanka could increase this claimant\u2019s risk for interrogation and detention.\n[23] In addition, the claimant provided corroborating documents as evidence including a support letter from her father, medical diagnostic ticket report, and other documents that the panel considered credible.\n[24] Therefore, after review, the \u2026 the panel satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant\u2019s allegations are credible and further, the panel accepts that the claimant has established a subjective fear of persecution if the claimant returns to Sri Lanka.\n[25] With regards to objective evidence and the objective basis of this claim, the panel finds that this claimant\u2019s allegations are corroborated by the country conditions as noted in the National Documentation Package and in counsel\u2019s disclosure package.\n[26] The panel is satisfied that this claimant fits the profile of a young Tamil individual from the Jaffna Region who is perceived as a LTTE supporter by the Sri Lankan authorities and whose family members are also linked to the LTTE. And therefore this profile is further of interest to the Sri Lankan Government.\n[27] The panel is satisfied that this profile is supported by the NDP country condition documents. Specifically, noted in Items 1.4, 1.1(1), 2.2, 13.7, 1.9, and 13.10, as well as other references within the country conditions documentation.\n[28] Therefore, when assessed in context of the country conditions the panel is satisfied that this claimant\u2019s subjective fear of persecution have an objective basis.\n[29] Specifically, the NDP notes that Sri Lankan authorities have been actively engaged in rooting out LTTE supporters and those viewed as having connections with the LTTE, and if a person is detained by the Sri Lankan security forces then there remains a real risk of ill-treatment or harm which requires international protection.\n[30] Amnesty International also remains concerned that the persistent climate of impunity in Sri Lanka as the government has failed to provide minorities with protection from violence and discrimination or has failed to protect those suspected of LTTE links.\n[31] Amnesty International is also concerned that Tamils continue to experience harassment, threats, and arrest by security forces whom they suspect of LTTE links and this is based largely on their ethnicity and their place of origin or where they live, and it is more militant with regards to Tamils from the north.\n[32] The NDP also indicates with regards to gender related issues, in Item 13.8 that it is a well known reality that rape of women by security forces take place in Sri Lanka, and Items 1.4 indicates that \u2026 that the UN Human Rights Council Special Rapporteur report notes that women in the north and east of Sri Lanka continue to suffer from the scars of the conflicts of war, as well as the insecurity that resulted from the subsequent militarization.\n[33] Also, in the last stages of the war and its aftermath human rights abuses against civilian population by both sides of the conflict were rife, including sexual and gender based violence. The climate of impunity and the additional insecurity created by the militarization have meant that women are living with multiple challenges that threaten their freedom, dignity, and security on a daily basis.\n[34] And although sexual assaults by military personnel are said to have decreased with the downsizing of the army in the north and east, nonetheless, the climate of fear still remains amongst Tamil women in that area where the military presence have continued.\n[35] In addition, Item 1.4 of the NDP notes that Tamil women in Northern Sri Lanka still face the risk of rape and harassment by security forces who are present throughout the region and that their lives are even more negatively impacted by the climate of fear or by a worrying uptick in violence against women within the Tamil community. The ever present threat of violence by the military has led women to lead tightly restricted lives, limiting their daily activities in order to minimize their risk of sexual assault.\n[36] Next with regards to State protection, the panel finds that the claimant has rebutted the presumption of adequate State protection with convincing evidence that adequate separate is not available to this claimant and is not reasonable forthcoming in this case since the agents of persecution are the Sri Lankan security forces, specifically, the army and its affiliates.\n[37] Review of country conditions also specifically indicate in Items 2.10, 9.2, and 10.9 which summarizes that Tamils throughout Sri Lanka, especially those in the north and east, have reported security forces regular surveil or harass members of their community.\n[38] And further, many human rights challenges still persist in Sri Lanka, including torture and ill\u00adtreatment of detainees and surveillance and harassment of civil society and those perceived to be LTTE sympathizers.\n[39] Item 2.1 in the NDP notes that State agents commit human rights abuses with impunity and that a general culture of impunity still remains in Sri Lanka.\n[40] After review, the panel is also satisfied that no viable internal flight alternative exists for this claimant because she would face a serious possibility of persecution throughout Sri Lanka because her agents of persecution are associated with the ruling government and their affiliates such as the army and the police who have control throughout the country.\n[41] In conclusion based on the totality of the evidence and the previously mentioned analysis the panel finds that this claimant has established a serious possibility of persecution based on the Convention ground of a perceived political opinion that she is viewed as an LTTE supporter and hence, viewed as anti-government and based on her ethnicity as a Tamil female.\n[42] Therefore, this panel concludes that this claimant is a Convention refugee as defined by Section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. And as such, the panel accepts this claim for refugee protection in Canada.\n[43] That is the end of the decision and its reasons.\n[44] Thank you all. Thank you, Mr. Interpreter. Thank you, ma\u2019am. Counsel, thank you. And I do appreciate your comments and your apology earlier, counsel. Thank you. I appreciate that.\n[45] That brings me to the end and the hearing is now concluded. We are off record.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2019 RLLR 94\n\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\n\nDate of Decision: March 1, 2019\n\nPanel: J. Kushner\n\nCounsel for the claimant(s): Mohamed Mahdi\n\nCountry: Yemen\n\nRPD Number: TB8-03742\n\nATIP Number: A-2020-01459\n\nATIP Pages: 000080-000083\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] [XXX] claims to be a citizen of Yemen and is seeking refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.1\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] The claimant\u2019s allegations are set out in his Basis of Claim form as amended and were expanded upon in testimony.2 To summarize, the claimant fears that he will be harmed or killed by Houthis because of his real and imputed anti-Houthi political opinion. The claimant\u2019s brother has engaged in anti-Houthi journalism despite the Houthis charging the claimant with ensuring that his brother supports the Houthis.\nDETERMINATION\n[3] The panel finds that the claimant has established that he faces a serious possibility of persecution in Yemen.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[4] The claimant\u2019s personal and national identity as a citizen of Yemen has been established on a balance of probabilities based on his testimony and a copy of his Yemeni passport.3\nCredibility\n[5] On a balance of probabilities the panel accepts as credible the claimant\u2019s testimony regarding the central allegations in this claim. The claimant provided supporting documents for some of these allegations. The claimant\u2019s testimony was generally consistent with the documentary evidence. The claimant provided evidence regarding his most recent trip to Yemen when his brother was detained and abused by Houthis, when the claimant was ordered to ensure his brother supported the Houthis in future, and when the claimant and his brother separately fled the country. The claimant has provided corroborating evidence including letters from his wife who remains in hiding in Yemen4 and from his brother who fled to Egypt.5 The claimant\u2019s documentary evidence supports his allegations regarding his brother\u2019s [XXX] work criticizing Houthis, supports the claimant\u2019s brother\u2019s detention and mistreatment by Houthis, and supports the claimant\u2019s forced pledge to the Houthis to ensure that his brother supported the Houthis. The claimant also provided evidence of his brother\u2019s [XXX].6\nSubjective fear\n[6] The claimant has lived in Saudi Arabia as a temporary resident for approximately 25 years though he currently has no immigration status there and has never had any permanent status there. Over the last several years the claimant has travelled to Yemen on multiple occasions. The claimant\u2019s explanation for making repeated trips to Yemen while it was in a state of civil war is that he was on vacation, he wanted to see his family, and he did not go out often. After being targeted by the Houthis on his last trip to Yemen, the claimant later travelled to the United States of America (USA), though he did not seek asylum there. The claimant explained that Muslims are suffering under the administration of the current USA president. The claimant\u2019s explanations do not completely mitigate the panel\u2019s concerns regarding the lack of subjective fear evidenced by repeatedly returning to a situation where the claimant was at risk, and of not seeking asylum when he had the opportunity to do so. However, the panel finds that in the claimant\u2019s particular circumstances the concern that remains is not determinative.\nPersecution\n[7] The country conditions documents provided by the claimant,7 along with the objective evidence in the National Documentation Package (NDP),8 set out the situation in Yemen in detail. The documents are generally consistent regarding the risk faced by those who are critical of the Houthis or who are seen as having a political opinion that is against the Houthis. The Houthis control a large portion of Yemen, including the area where the claimant\u2019s family was living. The claimant is seen as the head of a family who has repeatedly and publicly spoken out against the Houthis.9 The claimant\u2019s family includes a journalist who has been detained, tortured, and threatened, by Houthis. The documentary evidence contains numerous reports of the Houthis engaging in violence, human rights violations, arbitrary detentions, and torture.\n[8] The objective evidence is clear that Yemen is currently dealing with a widespread armed violent conflict. It involves multiple factions including Houthi rebels, Saudi-led or Saudi\u00adsupported armed forces, as well as various extremist factions in Yemen including reports of Al\u00adQaeda being active in many parts of the country. There is no single central government in Yemen. The situation in the country has been described as a civil war. The evidence before the panel gives no indication that the conflict will be ending in the near future. There are reports of an increasing number of civilians being seriously affected by the ongoing conflict, including being displaced, harmed, or killed. When considering the widespread and ongoing nature of the conflict in Yemen, the panel finds that the current security situation in the country is such that there is no access to state protection nor is there a viable internal flight alternative in the claimant\u2019s particular circumstances.\nCONCLUSION\n[9] Having considered all of the available evidence the panel finds that the claimant faces a serious possibility of persecution in Yemen. The panel concludes that the claimant is a Convention refugee. The panel therefore accepts the claim.\n(signed) J.

The eldest son and the middle son were born in Baghdad, Iraq; the younger son was born in Abu Dhabi, the United Arab Emirates (UAE). These claimants lived in Iraq and in the UAE.\n[3] The principal claimant and the associate claimant were married in 2003. After the fall of the secular, but Sunni-dominated regime of Saddam Hussein in 2003, the claimants started to have problems. Their problems arose due to the principal claimant\u2019s Palestinian origin and his Sunni Muslim religion, and their mixed marriage. The associate claimant is an Iraqi woman, of Shiite sect of Islam. Their marriage added exasperation to the associate claimant\u2019s Shiite family, friends and acquaintances, and the community. In fear of his life, in 2006, the principal claimant fled Iraq and went to the UAE. He managed to get a job in the UAE, and was therefore, able to get a temporary residence permit. He then had his family join him in the UAE. Thereafter, the claimants resided in the UAE, until they came to Canada.\n[4] In November 2017, the principal claimant\u2019s employment in the UAE was terminated. He looked for another job, but was unsuccessful in finding any.\n[5] In search of a permanent solution to their problems, the claimants decided to come to Canada and seek refugee protection.\n[6] At the time these claimants left the UAE, they were already in possession of visitor visas for the United States of America (U.S.) and Canada. On [XXX], 2017, the claimants arrived in the U.S. On [XXX] 2017, they arrived in Canada. They filed their claims at an inland office of the Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) on January 24, 2018.2\n[7] The claimants allege that they cannot return to Iraq. The principal claimant alleges that he cannot return to Gaza in Palestine, because he would not be allowed to enter Gaza. The principal claimant alleges that he cannot return to the UAE because he has no job there and therefore, would not be allowed to return to reside there.\nDETERMINATION\n[8] The panel finds that the claimants are Convention refugees pursuant to s. 96 of the IRPA.3\nANALYSIS\n[9] The claimants fear persecution in Iraq, primarily on account of the principal claimant\u2019s Palestinian origin and his Sunni Muslim religion, and because he married a Shiite Iraqi woman. The associate claimant fears persecution in Iraq because she married a Palestinian Sunni Muslim. All claimants, including the minor claimants, fear persecution in Iraq as members of the principal claimant\u2019s family.\nDeterminative Issues\n[10] The panel first determines each claimant\u2019s country or countries of nationality, or if determined to be stateless, the country or countries of former habitual residence (CFHR).\n[11] Thereafter, the panel assesses if these claimants\u2019 alleged fear of persecution in any of their respective country or countries of reference is well founded. If their fear of persecution is determined to be well-founded, then the panel assesses if they can return to their respective country or countries of reference.\nCredibility\n[12] Credibility is an issue in every refugee protection claim. The panel finds that the claimants\u2019 testimonies were generally consistent with their written evidence. The panel has assessed the claimants\u2019 credibility with regard to their evidence relating to their allegations of persecution or risk of harm pursuant to s. 96 and ss. 97(1) of the IRPA.4\n[13] The principal claimant and the associate claimant provided testimony at their hearing. The panel finds these claimants to be credible witnesses.\nClaimants\u2019 personal and national identities\nThe principal claimant\u2019s personal and national identity\n[14] The principal claimant was born in Baghdad, Iraq, to Palestinian parents. He is in possession of his Palestine travel documents that are issued to stateless Palestinians. Based on these claimants\u2019 testimonies and the documents in evidence, the panel accepts that the principal claimant is who he says he is, and that he is a stateless Palestinian.5\nDefining Country of Former Habitual Residence (CFHR)\n[15] The panel finds that the principal claimant is a stateless Palestinian, therefore, his claim must be assessed on the basis of his CFHR. As stated by the Court of Appeal in Thabet, \u201ca person is not a refugee solely by virtue of statelessness\u201d.\n[16] According to the Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status under the 1951 Convention and the 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees (UNHCR Handbook),6 for someone who is stateless to be considered a refugee, he or she must be outside of his or her country of habitual residence for one of the reasons set out in the definition of a \u201cConvention refugee.\u201d Paragraph 102 states the following:7\n102. It will be noted that not all stateless persons are refugees. They must be outside the country of their former habitual residence for the reasons indicated in the definition. Where these reasons do not exist, the stateless person is not a refugee.\n[17] Furthermore, paragraph 104 of the UNHCR Handbook states the following:8\n104. A stateless person may have more than one country of former habitual residence, and he may have a fear of persecution in relation to more than one of them. The definition does not require that he satisfies the criteria in relation to all of them.\n[18] In terms of case law, in Maarouf,9 the Federal Court indicates that \u201c[t]he claimant must have established a significant period of de facto residence in the country in question.\u201d According to those terms, a claimant must have been admitted to a given country and have had the intention of settling there for a certain period:10\n\u2026 [A] \u201ccountry of former habitual residence\u201d should not be limited to the country where the claimant initially feared persecution. Finally, the claimant does not have to be legally able to return to a country of former habitual residence as denial of a right of return may in itself constitute an act of persecution by the state. The claimant must, however, have established a significant period of de facto residence in the country in question.\n[19] The Federal Court in Marchaud,11 found that studying for several years in a third country, such as the USA, is not sufficient for a CFHR. The Court indicated that the analysis should also include the connection of claimants to these countries.\n[20] More recently, the Federal Court in Al-Khateeb has provided a more fulsome test to discern what can be considered a CFHR:12\n\u2022 There can be more than one CFHR;\n\u2022 The Applicant\u2019s birth in Gaza gives him status akin to nationality;\n\u2022 His rights of return and residence are also akin to the rights associated with citizenship;\n\u2022 There is no minimum period for residence to establish a CFHR;\n\u2022 CFHR\u2019s are \u201cformer\u201d. The fact that he was a habitual resident of Gaza many years ago is not a bar to it being a CFHR; and\n\u2022 He has family in Gaza and he is a Palestinian.\n[21] According to Al-Khateeb,13 a significant period of de facto residence is not restricted to the length of the residence.\n[22] The panel considers the totality of the claimants\u2019 evidence, and the connections they have had in the country or countries of the principal claimant\u2019s former habitual residence.\nIs Gaza a CFHR for the principal claimant?\n[23] The evidence shows that the principal claimant was born to Palestinian parents in Iraq. His parents moved to Gaza in 1995, but he stayed in Iraq. The principal claimant has never visited Gaza. He is in possession of his Palestinian travel documents, which are issued to persons of Palestinian origin for the purposes of travel. The principal claimant acquired these documents in 2005 to go to the UAE.\n[24] Based on the claimants\u2019 testimonies and the legal parameters of what is considered to be a country of former habitual residence, the panel finds that Gaza is not a country of former habitual residence for the principal claimant.\nIs Iraq a CFHR for the principal claimant?\n[25] As mentioned above, the principal claimant was born to Palestinian parents in Iraq. His parents moved to Gaza in 1995, but he stayed in Iraq. The principal claimant and the associate claimant were married in 2003. Their eldest and middle sons were born in Baghdad, Iraq. Since these claimants\u2019 problems in Iraq continued, in fear of their lives, in 2006, the principal claimant fled Iraq and went to the UAE. Later his family joined him in the UAE.\n[26] The totality of the evidence in this case shows that the principal claimant has established a significant period of de facto residence in Iraq.\n[27] Based on the claimants\u2019 evidence, and the legal parameters of what is considered to be a country of former habitual residence, the panel finds that Iraq is a country of former habitual residence for the principal claimant.\nIs the UAE a CFHR for the principal claimant?\n[28] The principal claimant has lived and worked in the UAE for a number of years. During his residency there, the evidence shows that he was able to enter and exit the UAE, without any significant difficulty. The principal claimant went to the UAE in 2006, secured a job, and thereafter, had his family join him there. The children have received formal schooling in the UAE. The evidence demonstrates that these claimants have significant personal, social or contractual connections in the UAE. The claimants have spent many years living in the UAE. They left the UAE to come to Canada.\n[29] The totality of the evidence in this case shows that the principal claimant has established a significant period of de facto residence in the UAE.\n[30] Based on the claimants\u2019 evidence, and the legal parameters of what is considered to be a country of former habitual residence, the panel finds that the UAE is a country of former habitual residence for the principal claimant.\nPersonal and national identities of the associate claimant and the minor claimants\n[31] The associate claimant was born in Baghdad, Iraq, to Iraqi parents; she is an Iraqi citizen. The minor claimants, the eldest son and the middle son, were born in Baghdad, Iraq, to a Palestinian father and Iraqi mother; they are citizens of Iraq. The minor claimant, the younger son, was born in Abu Dhabi, UAE to a Palestinian father and Iraqi mother; he is a citizen of Iraq. Based on the totality of the evidence in this case, including certified true copies of their Iraqi passports in evidence, the panel finds that the associate claimant and the minor claimants are citizens of Iraq and no other country. Therefore, the panel finds that in their cases, the country of reference is Iraq only.\nClaim of the principal claimant against Iraq\n[32] In Thabet,14 Justice Linden of the Federal Court of Appeal provides this answer to the question of how a stateless person who has habitually resided in more than one country could establish the merits of his or her claim for Convention refugee status:\nIn order to be found to be a Convention refugee, a stateless person must show that, on a balance of probabilities, he or she would suffer persecution in any country of former habitual residence, and that he or she cannot return to any of his or her other countries of former habitual residence.\n[33] The principal claimant is a stateless Palestinian; however, Gaza is not a country of former habitual residence in his case. He has lived in Iraq and the UAE; these are the two countries of former habitual residence for the principal claimant. The claimants allege that the principal claimant cannot return to Iraq or the UAE in his particular situation and circumstances.\n[34] The principal claimant was born in Baghdad, Iraq, to Palestinian parents. He lived in Iraq until 2006, when he was 29 years of age and moved to the UAE.\n[35] After the fall of the secular, but Sunni-dominated regime of Saddam Hussein in 2003, the claimants started to have problems. The Institute for Internal Law and Human Right report at item 2.4 of the National Documentation Package (NDP) for Iraq confirms this allegation, stating:15\nAfter 2003, Palestinians were targeted by security forces and armed militant groups-mainly Shia\u2019h. This persecution forced many to flee Iraq, go into hiding, or move to refugee camps such as Al Waleed. Of the estimated 35,000 in Iraq before 2003, only about 11,000 to 15,000 remain.\n[36] These claimants\u2019 problems arose primarily due to the principal claimant\u2019s Palestinian origin and his Sunni Muslim religion.\n[37] In respect to the Palestinians in Iraq, the documentary evidence from the UNHCR states the following:16\nPalestinian refugees in Iraq, who arrived in the country during several waves of displacement since 1948, were never formally recognized as refugees by former Iraqi governments; however, they enjoyed a favourable protection environment in Iraq in line with key resolutions of the League of Arab States and the 1965 Protocol for the Treatment of Palestinians in Arab States (\u201cCasablanca Protocol\u201d). Although they could not obtain Iraqi nationality, were not permitted to vote, and were not required to perform military service, their socio-economic circumstances were on par with Iraqi nationals. However, following the fall of the former government of Saddam Hussein in April 2003, the situation of Palestinian refugees was reported to change dramatically as they became the target of hostility and harassment by segments of the Iraqi population, particularly armed militias, on account of their perceived association with and preferential treatment by the former regime, as well as their perceived support for Sunni militant groups. They were reported to be subjected to targeted attacks, including arbitrary arrest and detention, torture, kidnappings, extra-judicial killings, bombings and mortar attacks in Al\u00ad Baladiyat, the main Palestinian residential area in Baghdad, as well as discrimination, dismissal from employment, denial of education, and forced eviction from government and rented housing. By 2007, thousands of Palestinians had fled Iraq, mainly to Syria and Jordan. [footnotes omitted]\n[38] The principal claimant fled Iraq in 2006. At the hearing, the principal claimant also narrated the situation and circumstances of similarity-situated colleagues who have fled Iraq in fear for their lives.\n[39] In 2003, the principal claimant, a Palestinian Sunni Muslim, married the associate claimant, an Iraqi woman of the Shiite sect of Islam. Their marriage led to additional problems for him, as the associate claimant\u2019s Shiite family, friends and acquaintances disapproved of their marriage. The documentary evidence does not clearly state any significant risks to mixed\u00ad marriage couples; however, in these claimants\u2019 particular circumstances, it became a real issue.\n[40] The claimants testified that the situation in Iraq today is the same as it was when the principal claimant fled Iraq in 2006. In this respect, the documentary evidence supports the claimants\u2019 allegations. According to the \u201cUNHCR Position on Returns to Iraq\u201d report:17\n\u2026 Since 2014, Palestinian refugees in Baghdad have increasingly been subjected to targeted attacks based on nationality and perceived affiliation with ISIS, including harassment, threats, arbitrary arrest and prolonged detention under the Anti\u00adTerrorism Law, physical abuse, kidnapping, extortion, killings as well as house-to\u00adhouse searches at the hands of both state and non-state actors. [footnotes omitted]\n[41] The aforementioned Institute for Internal Law and Human Right report indicates:18\nThe persecution of Palestinians was coupled with forcible evictions from government and privately owned housing, the destruction of Palestinian businesses and property, bombings and mortar attacks in Palestinian neighborhoods, and the termination of large numbers of Palestinian workers.\n[42] A report about Iraq from the European Asylum Support Office (EASO) states that \u201c[t]he Palestinians in Baghdad were targeted as allies of Saddam Hussein in the past, and now they are targeted as allies of the IS.\u201d19\n[43] The documentary evidence in the Internal Law and Human Right report further shows:\n\u2026 Palestinians in Iraq suffer from uncertain legal status, onerous challenges to updating and maintaining identity documents, and discrimination in access to basic services, housing, and employment. They continue to be arbitrarily arrested and detained, and apartment complexes in Al Baladiyat neighborhood in Baghdad are regularly raided by police and army.20\n\u2026\nPalestinians report being terminated from work, forced from their homes, and face ongoing discrimination and arbitrary arrest.21\n\u2026\nThe treatment of Palestinians and the risks the community faces are ostensibly similar in the Kurdish region, in Baghdad, and in the south. The Palestinian community is highly visible and faces security risks from armed groups which can access community members virtually anywhere in Iraq. Given this, many Palestinians who were able to leave the country have tried to do so.22\n[44] The principal claimant fears persecution upon return to Iraq. Based on the totality of the evidence, including the country documentation, the panel accepts the principal claimant\u2019s alleged fear of persecution upon return to Iraq today.\n[45] The panel finds that the claimants have met the burden of establishing that, on a balance of probabilities, there is more than a mere possibility that the principal claimant would face the alleged persecution upon return to Iraq today.\nCan the principal claimant return to the UAE?\n[46] Regarding the principal claimant\u2019s return to the UAE, the other country of his former habitual residence, the evidence shows that the principal claimant has no permit to legally return to the UAE. As such, he would not be allowed to enter the UAE to reside there, in his particular situation and circumstances today. The principal claimant\u2019s residency in the UAE was tied to his employment there. The principal claimant has no job in the UAE at the present time. The evidence shows that the principal claimant looked for employment in the UAE in 2017, but was unable to secure any jobs. The panel accepts the principal claimant\u2019s explanation in failing to secure a job in the UAE in 2017 as alleged. The panel finds that the principal claimant, in his particular situation and circumstances, would not be allowed to enter the UAE to reside there today.\n[47] Based on these reasons, the panel finds that the principal claimant, a stateless Palestinian person, would face persecution upon return to Iraq, and that he cannot legally return to the UAE, his other country of former habitual residence.\nClaims of the associate claimant and the minor claimants against Iraq\n[48] The associate claimant and the minor claimants are citizens of Iraq and no other country.\n[49] These claimants fear persecution upon return to Iraq on account of the principal claimant\u2019s Palestinian origin and his Sunni Muslim religion, and because the associate claimant, a Shiite Iraqi woman, has married a Palestinian Sunni Muslim. Due to the dire situation of Palestinians in Iraq, and these claimants being members of the principal claimant\u2019s family, the panel finds that these claimants would face more than a mere possibility of persecution upon return to Iraq.\n[50] These claimants would have to use their personal identity documentation at various places, in order for them to live their lives in Iraq. For example, for the minor claimants to be registered for school, the associate claimant would be required to confirm her identity as their mother, by showing the authorities her marriage certificate and the minor claimants\u2019 birth certificates. These documents clearly indicate these claimants\u2019 link to the principal claimant, a Palestinian Sunni Muslim. Hence, they would be seen as having significant, practical associations with a Palestinian Sunni Muslim. Therefore, the panel finds that these claimants would also face persecution upon return to Iraq, as alleged in their particular situation and circumstances.\nState protection in Iraq for these claimants\n[51] The panel finds that the claimants have rebutted the presumption of state protection, in their case. The principal claimant is a Palestinian Sunni, and the associate claimant is an Iraqi Shiite woman who has married a Palestinian Sunni. The associate claimant and the minor claimants, their children, face risk by familial association. The principal claimant testified that should he or any member of his family run into problems with Shia militias in Iraq, they could not expect adequate state protection because the police are often affiliated with the Shia militias.\n[52] The documents show that the state of Iraq is still struggling to optimally function, in the midst of continued sectarian conflict. Moreover, the evidence also shows that, particularly outside of Kurdistan, a culture of impunity exists for state actors and corruption is prevalent among government agencies.23\n[53] In general, the authorities in Baghdad are unable, and in the case of Sunni complainants, are likely to be unwilling to provide adequate state protection.\nInternal flight alternative in Iraq for these claimants\n[54] With respect to an IFA, the evidence shows that the principal claimant and his family would not be safe anywhere in Iraq because he is a Palestinian Sunni, and the associate claimant is an Iraqi Shite woman who has married a Palestinian Sunni. The associate claimant\u2019s relatives have never accepted their marriage. The associate claimant and the minor claimants, their children, face risk by familial association.\n[55] The panel finds that the risk these claimants face is the same everywhere in Iraq.\n[56] A United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) report entitled \u201cUNHCR Position on Returns to Iraq\u201d published on November 14, 2016, states the following:24\nWhere decision-makers consider the availability of an internal flight or relocation alternative, the burden is on the decision-maker to identify a particular area of relocation and to show that in respect of this location the requirements for the relevance and reasonableness of the proposed relocation alternative are met. In the current circumstances, with large-scale internal displacement, a serious humanitarian crisis, mounting intercommunal tensions, access\/residency restrictions in virtually all parts of the country and increasing pressure exercised on IDPs [internally displaced persons] to prematurely return to their areas of origin following the retaking of these areas from ISIS, UNHCR does not consider it appropriate for States to deny persons from Iraq international protection on the basis of the applicability of an internal flight or relocation alternative. [footnotes omitted]\n[57] Given all of the circumstances and the situation as a whole for these claimants and in consideration of the \u201cUNHCR Position on Returns to Iraq\u201d, the panel finds that, at this time, these claimants do not have a viable IFA in Iraq.\nCONCLUSION\n[58] The panel determines that the principal claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to s. 96 of the IRPA.25 Accordingly, the Refugee Protection Division accepts his claim.\n[59] The panel determines that the associate claimant and the minor claimants are Convention refugees pursuant to s. 96 of the IRPA.26 Accordingly, the Refugee Protection Division accepts their claims.\n(signed) S.S.

Mary Akhbari\n\nCountry: Palestine\n\nRPD Number: TB8-01656\n\nATIP Number: A-2020-01459\n\nATIP Pages: 000062-000065\n[1] MEMBER: I have had an opportunity to consider the evidence before me, and I will now render a decision orally.\n[2] Sir, you will be provided with a transcript of my decision, which I reserve the right to edit.\n[3] The Claimant, [XXX], is claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. In assessing your claim, I have considered your oral testimony, the documentary evidence filed by your counsel on your behalf, and the information in the Board\u2019s National Documentation Package on the occupied Palestinian territory.\n[4] In summary, the Claimant is a 40-year old man who was born in Saudi Arabia on the [XXX] 1978. The Claimant held temporary residence status in Saudi Arabia and was not entitled to citizenship. In 1995, when the Claimant was approximately 17 years old, he relocated to Gaza with his parents; however, the situation in Gaza turned out to be less than ideal. The Claimant\u2019s family, like many Gazans, faced problems due to nearby Israeli settlements, who had the protection of the Israeli Army. The Claimant alleges that he was abused on several occasions by Israeli soldiers at checkpoints. Further, the Claimant and his family faced intimidation by Hamas. The Claimant himself was asked to join Hamas on a number of occasions but would tell them that he was not interested. Hamas perceived him as a traitor or a supporter of Israel. Due to the problems in Gaza, the family eventually returned to Saudi Arabia in 2001; however, the Claimant and his family would visit Gaza occasionally.\n[5] In 2009, the Claimant travelled to Gaza to check on relatives, and the family home. The Claimant was stopped at an Egyptian checkpoint and detained. While in detention, he was interrogated, physically assaulted, and sustained multiple injuries, including a broken shoulder. His interrogators wanted to know about his relationship with militants in Gaza. After approximately six months, the Claimant was released from Egyptian detention. In 2012, the Claimant returned to Gaza. While there, he was summoned by Hamas and asked why he had been arrested by the Egyptian Government in 2009. The Claimant was interrogated and ordered by Hamas to report for further questioning on three occasions. After the third reporting, the Claimant became concerned and left Gaza. He has not returned to Gaza since 2012. In 2016, the Claimant was terminated or was advised that he would be terminated from his employment in Saudi Arabia; however, he was able to transfer his sponsorship to a Saudi citizen for a limited period of time but had to pay a bribe to do so. The Claimant was unable to find work and feared deportation to Gaza. Therefore, on [XXX] 2017, the Claimant left Saudi Arabia, entering Canada on [XXX], 2017, where he filed a refugee claim.\n[6] The Panel finds that you have established that you face a serious possibility of persecution for a Convention ground pursuant to section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[7] In regards to your identity, I find on a balance of probabilities that you are a stateless Palestinian who was born in Saudi Arabia and who lived in the occupied Palestinian territories, specifically Gaza for a number of years. This was established by your sworn testimony and the supporting documentation you provided, including your Palestinian Authority-issued travel document, and your UNHCR Family Registration card.\n[8] I find that both Saudi Arabia and Palestine are countries or places of former habitual residence; however, you cannot return to Saudi Arabia due to the loss of employment. Therefore, your claim has been assessed against Gaza.\n[9] In regards to credibility, I find you to be a very credible witness, who testified in a straightforward manner about your experiences in Gaza, specifically, your encounters with Hamas. You also provided ample supporting documentation found in Exhibits 8, 9 and 10.\n[10] In regards to subjective fear, the Panel considered your delay in leaving Saudi Arabia considering that you only had temporary status there, and also because you had encountered very serious problems in 2009 and 2012, but you only left Saudi Arabia in 2017. However, I found your explanation to the Panel\u2019s questioning to be quite credible, and I draw no negative inference. Likewise, I conQuebec doinsider that you travelled to the United States in [XXX] of 2017 with your wife and daughter but returned to Saudi Arabia. When asked about that, you also gave a very plausible explanation, and so I draw no negative inference in that regard.\n[11] Regarding the objective basis for your fear, the National Documentation Package on the occupied Palestinian territory, which in this case is Exhibit 3, talks about the situation in Gaza. It says that \u201cIn 2007\u2026\u201d, and this is Item 2.1, \u201c\u2026Hamas staged a violent takeover of [the Palestinian Authority] government\u2026in the Gaza Strip and has since maintained a de facto government in the territory.\u201d Item 2.1 of Exhibit 3 states that there were \u201c\u2026significant human rights abuses under Hamas\u2026included unlawful and arbitrary killings, disappearances, torture, arbitrary arrest and detention\u2026\u201d. Item 1.12 of Exhibit 3 states as well that there were serious human rights abuses under Hamas authorities in Gaza, which again includes arbitrary arrests, lent to detention and widespread use of torture, and the use of the death penalty. It says specifically that Hamas Security Forces continue to kill, torture, and kidnap, as well as arbitrarily detain or otherwise harass Palestinians, who they view as Fatah supporters. And that is consistent with your testimony here today. Item 2.1 further speaks about the harassment of people who oppose Hamas, and you testified that on several occasions Hamas did ask you to join and you refused to do so, and that people who are not with Hamas are viewed as opposing Hamas. And I find that that is the circumstance in your case. So I find that your fear of persecution has an objective basis.\n[12] In regards to state protection, I consider that, as I stated, the documentary evidence indicates Hamas is the governing authority in the Gaza Strip. They have considerable power and influence, and Item 2.1, indicates that impunity was a major problem under Hamas. Having found that you have established a well-founded fear of persecution from Hamas, I find that you would not be able to obtain adequate state protection; therefore, you have rebutted the presumption of state protection.\n[13] Likewise, I find that you have no viable internal flight alternative given that Hamas is the governing authority in Gaza, and even though the occupied Palestinian territory also includes the West Bank, I find that you would not be able to relocate to the West Bank. According to Item 1.14 of the documentary evidence, Item \u2014 sorry \u2014 Exhibit 3, Palestinian movement throughout the West Bank remains restricted by a complex system of physical and administrative barriers, checkpoints, roadblocks, and a permit system. Item 14.5 states that \u201cfreedom of movement between Gaza and the West Bank is nearly \u2018non-existent\u201d\u2018. In any event, I find that you face a serious possibility of risk in all of the occupied Palestinian territory.\n[14] In conclusion, then, having established the presence of subjective fear and an objective basis for that fear, I find that you face a serious possibility of prosecution, that adequate state protection does not exist, and you do not have a viable internal flight alternative. I therefore accept your claim pursuant to section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, and I wish you the very best of luck.\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 DECISION CONCLUDED \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n",

        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2019 RLLR 91\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: November 12, 2019\nPanel: Stephen Rudin\nCounsel for the claimant(s): Katherine M Macdonald\nCountry: Syria\nRPD Number: TB8-01528\nAssociated RPD Numbers: TB8-01583, TB8-01584\nATIP Number: A-2020-01459\nATIP Pages: 000055-000061\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[l] [XXX], and [XXX], (the claimants) are claiming refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).1\nJoined claims\n[2] Pursuant to Rule 55 of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) Rules, these claims for refugee protection were heard jointly.2 The principal claimant is [XXX]. Each claim was decided on its own merits, and decisions were made for each claimant.\nAppointment of a Designated Representative\n[3] The IRPA requires the designation of a representative for all claimants less than 18 years of age. The children in this claim are aged three and seven.\n[4] In accordance with subsection 167(2) of the IRPA,3 and Rule 20 of the RPD Rules,4 on February 5, 2018, the RPD designated [XXX] to be the representative for the minor claimants for the purposes of this claim for refugee protection.\nALLEGATIONS\n[5] The complete story alleging the basis of the claimant\u2019s fear is captured in the Basis of Claim Form (BOC),5 and amendment to the principle claimant\u2019s BOC.6 The associate claimants rely on the principle claimant\u2019s BOC.7 Their allegations can be summarized as follows.\n[6] The claimant alleges that she and her children fear returning to Syria. As a Sunni Muslim, and a person who was born and has lived in Saudi Arabia, she fears that if they were to return, they would be detained, tortured, and possibly face death because of her father\u2019s affiliation as a member of the Muslim Brotherhood.\n[7] The claimant alleges that many of her family members have been targeted by the current Syrian regime because they were perceived as being opponents of the govermnent.\n[8] Believing that they could not remain in Saudi Arabia as they had no status, and because they feared returning to Syria, the claimants, accompanied by the principle claimant\u2019s mother-in\u00ad law, former husband and two of her sisters-in-law, left Riyadh, Saudi Arabia on [XXX], 2018, and arrived in New York on the same day. On [XXX] 2018 the claimants flew to Buffalo, and crossing at the Peace Bridge into Canada, made their applications for refugee protection.\nDETERMINATION\n[9] For the reasons that follow, the panel finds that the claimants would face a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground, and on a balance of probabilities, would be subjected to a risk to life, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or a danger of torture upon their return to Syria.\n[10] Therefore, the panel finds that the claimants are a Convention refugees, and have a well\u00ad founded fear of persecution or hmm should they return to Syria.\nIDENTITY\n[11] For the following reasons, on a balance of probabilities, the panel finds that the principle claimant is a citizen of Syria. She established her citizenship by providing a photo copy of her Passport.8\n[12] For the following reasons, the panel notes that the associate minor claimants are stateless. The minor claimants were born in Saudi Arabia. The principle claimant\u2019s former husband is a Palestinian, who was working in Saudi Arabia on a temporary residence permit. According to their birth certificates, the minor claimants were born in Saudi Arabia.9 Although the habitual residence of the minor claimants was Saudi Arabia, they had no entitlement to permanent status or claim against Palestine. Moreover, the minor claimants hold Palestinian Passports and travel documents, which limited their entry to Syria.10\nANALYSIS\n[13] In assessing this claim, the panel focused on the credibility of the claimants\u2019 allegations of the risk of persecution or harm they might face upon their return to Syria because of their perceived political opinion.\n[14] The panel is cognizant of the difficulties faced by the claimant in establishing their claims. These include cultural factors, the environment of the hearing room, and the stress inherent in responding to oral questions through an interpreter. The panel has taken these considerations into account in arriving at its determination.\n[15] For the following reasons, on a balance of probabilities, the panel found the principal claimant to be a credible witness, and therefore believed what she alleged in support of their claims. Although her testimony sometimes focused on the current situation in Syria and had to be reminded to address her specific fear as it related to a nexus to the IRPA, she testified in a straight forward manner and there were no relevant inconsistencies in her testimony, or contradictions between her testimony and the other evidence before the panel.\n[16] The claimant testified that her father and brother were believed to be members of the Muslim Brotherhood, and as early as 1980 fled Syria to live in Saudi Arabia, where he claimant was born. She further testified that her brother was wanted by the Syrian authorities because of the possible family link to the Muslim Brotherhood, and his avoidance of compulsory military service. Further, when the claimant entered Syria for her wedding celebration in 2011, the claimant testified that she was suspected at the border of being involved with the Muslim Brotherhood, and believed that she was fortunate not to have been arrested.\n[17] For the following reasons, on a balance of probabilities, the objective evidence indicates that there is more than a mere possibility that the claimants would face persecution or harm if they were to return to Syria.\n[18] The United States Department of State 2018 report notes that:\n[t]here continued to be a significant number of reports of abuse of children by the Syrian government\u2026 [There are] regular reports of detention and torture of children younger than age 13, in some cases as young as 11, in government detention facilities.11\n[19] The International Religious Freedom Report indicates that:\n\u2026 [m]embership in the Muslim Brotherhood or \u201cSalafist\u201d organizations is illegal in Syria and punishable to different degrees, including by imprisonment or death.\n[\u2026]\nThe personal status law on divorce for Muslims is based on an interpretation of sharia implemented by government-appointed religious judges. In interreligious personal status cases, sharia takes precedence. A divorced woman is not entitled to alimony in some cases; a woman may also forego her right to alimony to persuade her husband to agree to the divorce. Additionally, under the law, a divorced mother loses the right to guardianship and physical custody of her sons when they reach the age of 13 and of her daughters at age 15, when guardianship transfers to the paternal side of the family.\n[\u2026]\nAn individual\u2019s birth certificate records his or her religious affiliation. Documents presented when marrying or traveling for a religious pilgrimage also list the religious affiliation of the applicant.12\n[20] The same document noted that, \u201c[t]here were continued media reports the government and its Shia Muslim militia allies [consisting mostly of foreigners] killed, arrested, and physically abused members of opposition groups which were predominantly Surmi Muslim.\u201d13\n[21] The panel has chosen to rely on the documentary evidence of the Syria National Documentation Packages (NDP), because it originates from a variety of reputable independent sources, which, reasonably, is expected to be knowledgeable with respect to the situation in Syria. The documentary evidence is seen as reliable, probative, detailed information, so as to provide the panel with a thorough understanding of the political situation in Syria.\n[22] On the basis of the totality of the evidence and the cumulative findings noted above, in the specific instances of this case, the panel finds that the claimants have satisfied their burden of establishing more than a mere possibility that they would face persecution should they return to Syria. Based on the forgoing reasons, the panel finds that because of the principle claimant\u2019s perceived relationship to the Muslim Brotherhood, there is more than a mere possibility that the claimant would face persecution or harm should she return to Syria.\n[23] In regard to the minor claimants, for the following reasons the panel finds that their claims for refugee protection should be accepted. They have never lived in Syria, and with their immediate family now in Canada, there is no one in Syria to care for them. Further, in a decision of the Honourable A.W.J. Sullivan of the Ontario Court of Justice, the principle claiman) has been granted joint custody of the minor claimants.14 In making this finding, the panel is guided by the principle expressed in Baker, that although not determinative, the best interests of the child is an important factor in humanitarian and compassionate considerations that must be given substantial weight.15\nCONCLUSION\n[24] Therefore, based on the foregoing reasons, the panel finds that the claimants are Convention refugees, and their claims are accepted.\n(signed) Stephen Rudin\nNovember 12, 2019\n1 The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c.27, as amended, sections 96 and 97(1).\n\n2 Refugee Protection Division (RFD) Rules SOR\/2012-256 [RPO Rules], Rule 55.\n\n3 IRPA, supra, footnote 1, section 167(2).\n\n4 RPD Rules, supra, footnote 1, Rule 20.\n\n5 Exhibits 2-4, Basis of Claim Forms (BOCs).\n\n6 Exhibit 10.

        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2019 RLLR 90\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: November 6, 2019\nPanel: James Waters\nCounsel for the claimant(s): Raoul Boulakia\nCountry: Sri Lanka\nRPD Number: TB8-00236\nATIP Number: A-2020-01459\nATIP Pages: 000048-000054\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] The 29-year-old claimant, [XXX], claims to be a citizen of Sri Lanka, and claims refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).1\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] The allegations in support of his claim are set out in detail in his Basis of Claim Form (BOC) narrative.2 The following is a short summary.\n[3] The claimant left Sri Lanka for India with his mother and siblings in 1999, to escape the fighting between the Sri Lankan Army and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). The claimant returned to Ukulankulam, Sri Lanka in 2003, and studied at [XXX], where he was a student prefect.\n[4] In April 2006, the claimant was kicked while being interrogated at home by the Sri Lankan Army, concerning his attendance as a representative of his school at what had been a Tamil cultural event, which turned out to be an event organized by the LTTE to promote their cause and recruit students.\n[5] The claimant returned to India on [XXX] 2006. His activity as an [XXX] of a 2009 protest at the Pooluvapatti Refugee Camp, demanding a halt to the war in Sri Lanka, brought him to the attention of the Q Branch of the Indian police. In 2013, the claimant attended a large student protest in Chennai, accusing the Sri Lankan Army and government of genocide, and demanding that the Sri Lankan government and Army be held accountable for the atrocities committed against the Tamil people during and after the conflict with the LTEE.\n[6] The claimant alleges that his younger brother, [XXX], who had returned to Sri Lanka in 2014, was arrested and detained at an army camp in Vavuniya for his participation at a student protest held on October 24, 2016, after police killed two Jaffna University students. During his detention, [XXX] was questioned about the whereabouts of the claimant, and instructed to inform the claimant that he must attend for an inquiry whenever he returned from abroad.\n[7] The claimant became involved in publicizing an intrusion by members of an extreme wing of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), a Hindu nationalist party, riding motorcycles into the Pooluvatti Refugee Camp on July 8, 2017. The claimant alleges that he was harassed and targeted by the Q Branch police in India, who pressured him to apply for a travel document to return to Sri Lanka.\n[8] The claimant was issued a passport that restricted his travel to refugee repatriation to Sri Lanka.\n[9] The claimant fears he will be detained and tortured on his return to Sri Lanka, as someone returning from abroad, suspected of fleeing Sri Lanka because of his association with the LTTE, and of supporting their cause abroad.\nIDENTITY\n[10] The national identity of the claimant as a citizen of Sri Lanka was established by his oral testimony in the Tamil language, and the supporting documentation filed. The supporting documentation included: a certified true copy of his most recent Sri Lankan passport,3 as well as copies of his expired Sri Lankan passport, birth certificate, and birth registrations for his parents.4\nCREDIBILITY\n[11] When a claimant swears that certain facts are true, this creates a presumption that they are indeed true, unless there is valid reason to doubt their veracity.5 The determination as to whether a claimant\u2019s evidence is credible is made on a balance of probabilities.6\n[12] The claimant testified in a spontaneous direct manner. There were no significant discrepancies between his oral testimony and the information contained in his written narrative.\n[13] The claimant\u2019s oral and written testimony as to returning to Sri Lanka from India in 2003 was supported by a copy of his Sri Lanka Deputy High Commission Emergency Travel Document, issued to his mother and her accompanying children, dated April 3, 2003.7 Similarly, his oral and written testimony as to returning to India on [XXX] 2006 was supported by an entry stamp in his expired Sri Lanka passport.8\n[14] The claimant\u2019s oral and written testimony as to attending high school in Sri Lanka after his return was supported by a copy of his General Certificate of Education (O.L.) Examination results, dated May 4, 2005.9\n[15] The claimant\u2019s oral and written testimony as to being a refugee from Sri Lanka, housed in refugee camps in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu after his return to India, was supported by a copy of his family identity card.10\n[16] His testimony as to his younger brother, [XXX], attending an October 24, 2016 large student demonstration in Colombo, protesting the killing of two Jaffna University students by the police was supported by an article from the Tamil Guardian which included a picture of [XXX] waving a sign.11\n[17] The claimant\u2019s testimony as to his involvement in publicizing a violent incursion into the refugee camp he stayed at, by militants aligned with the BJP, was supported by a newspaper article and a copy of the photograph of the damaged motorcycles abandoned by the militants in the fracas that ensued after they entered.12\n[18] Having regard to all of the evidence, the claimant established, on a balance of probabilities, the main allegations outlined in his narrative. He established problems with the Sri Lankan Army that caused him to return to India in 2006. He established participation in demonstrations in India against the Sri Lankan government in 2009 and 2013. He did not use the expired 2017 Sri Lanka passport that permitted travel only to Sri Lanka.\nOBJECTIVE BASIS\n[19] A British Home Office Report indicates that:\n\u2018The focus of the Sri Lankan government\u2019s concern has changed since the civil war ended in May 2009. The LTTE in Sri Lanka is a spent force\u2026\u2019\n\u2018The government\u2019s present objective is to identify Tamil activists in the Diaspora who are working for Tamil separatism \u2026\u2019\n\u2018If a person is detained by the Sri Lankan security services there remains a real risk of mistreatment or harm requiring international protection.\u2019 \u2026\n\u2018Any risk for those in whom the Sri Lankan authorities are or become interested exists not at the airport, but after arrival in their home area, where their arrival will be verified by the CID or police within a few days\u2026\u2019\n\u2026\nFor persons whose names appear on either the \u2018watch list\u2019 or \u2018stop list\u2019 the risk of ill-treatment following arrival in Sri Lanka will be as a result of arrest and detention by authorities, rather than any prosecution itself for the crime or crimes for which the person is wanted.13 [footnotes omitted]\n[20] The latest Department of State (DOS) report indicates that the \u201c[e]xcessive use of force against civilians by police and security officials remained a concern.\u201d14\n[21] Amnesty International maintains that:\nIndividuals removed from Canada and suspected of having ties to the LTTE may be detained, interrogated and arrested by the CID or SIS upon arrival at the airport with respect to their reasons for return to Sri Lanka, activities in Canada and possible links to the LTTE. Such a person is at risk as a person returned from abroad, who may be presumed to have access to financial resources and\/or international connections which could be exploited for financial gain by Tamil paramilitary groups or state agents.15\n[22] The documentary evidence provides an objective basis for the claim. The claimant has rebutted the presumption of state protection.\n[23] The claimant has established a serious possibility of persecution should he return to Vavuniya, based on his Tamil ethnicity and imputed political opinion.\nINTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE (IFA)\n[24] An IFA arises when a claimant, who has a well-founded fear of persecution in his or her home area of the country, is not a Convention refugee, because he or she has an IFA elsewhere in the country.\n[25] The test to be applied in determining whether there is an IFA is two-pronged:\n\u2026 the Board must be satisfied on a balance of probabilities that there is no serious possibility of the claimant being persecuted in the part of the country to which it finds an IFA exists.\n\u2026conditions in the part of the country considered to be an IFA must be such that it would not be unreasonable, in all the circumstances, [including those particular to the claimant,] for the claimant to seek refuge there.16\n[26] The Federal Court of Appeal sets a very high threshold for the unreasonableness test, requiring \u201cnothing less than the existence of conditions which would jeopardize the life or safety of a claimant.\u201d17 There must be \u201cactual and concrete evidence of such conditions.\u201d18 I identified Colombo as a prospective IFA.\n[27] Sri Lanka is an island country, and the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade report notes that, \u201cSri Lankan security forces maintain effective control throughout Sri Lanka and it is unlikely that individuals would be able to relocate internally with any degree of anonymity.\u201d19\n[28] The claimant fears the Sri Lankan Army and police who are important parts of the state apparatus. The claimant has established a serious possibility of persecution throughout Sri Lanka.\nCONCLUSION\n[29] I find the claimant, [XXX], to be a Convention refugee. I therefore accept his claim.\n(signed) James Waters\nNovember 6, 2019\n1 The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c.27, as amended, sections 96 and 97(1).\n\n2 Exhibit 2, Basis of Claim Form (BOC).\n\n3 Exhibit 1, Package of information from the referring CBSA\/IRCC, Certified True Copy of Passport.\n\n4 Exhibit 4, Package of Personal Disclosure, at pp. 3-10, and 18-19.\n\n5 Maldonado, Pedro Enrique Juarez v.

I would like to add that in event that written reasons are issued, a written form of these reasons may be edited for spelling, syntax, and grammar, and references to the applicable case law and documentary evidence may also be included.\n[2] The claimant is Ms [XXX]. Claims to be a citizen of Afghanistan and is claiming refugee protection pursuant to subsections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[3] She is joined by four minor claimants her children, all with the last name [XXX] and whose names are [XXX], and you are appointed as the designated representative to the four minor age children whom I saw in the video conference at the last sitting.\n[4] In deciding your claim I\u2019ve also considered the guideline on minor refugee claims. That\u2019s the guideline number three and also on the guideline four on women refugee claimants fearing gender related persecution.\n[5] I find that all five of you are Convention refugees for the following reasons.\n[6] You allege that you fear returning for two reasons to Afghanistan. One for the security situation in Afghanistan, the (inaudible) and the current war with the Taliban and also that you and the minor claimants would be targeted because your husband has been a high ranking official with the Afghan Government.\n[7] Now, I note that the claimant\u2019s husband Mr. [XXX](ph) [XXX], testified at the last sitting on March 6th and testified via phone from Kabul.\n[8] And also, you explained that you \u2026 your husband was posted in Afghanistan. Not in Afghanistan but in Brussels, Belgium from [XXX] 2016 or about [XXX] 2017. You went together, a family vacation in Washington State on the Canadian border.\n[9] You had previously discussed with your husband that you wanted to claim asylum in Belgium but he would not release the passports of your children, and that he also disagreed. He did not want you to cross the border \u2019cause he felt that it would be an illegal crossing and it would be not proper for you and the minor claimants cross the Canadian border to make refugee claims.\n[10] Across \u2026 but you did cross in [XXX] 2017 made \u2026 and made refugee claims, and you spoke to your husband that day by phone and he was upset. But or \u2026 as \u2026 as we passed into 2018 and 2019 since then you\u2019ve reconciled with your husband.\n[11] Now, what happened before this reconciliation became apparent the Minister representative did not have information that the panel has now and \u2026 today \u2026 and first brought up two issues that they wanted to intervene under Articles 1(f)(b)(c). First under the United Nations Convention relating to the status of refugee, and l(f)(c) as well.\n[12] Now, under 1(f)(b) the Minister believed that there were serious reason for concern that the claimant has committed \u2026 committed an act of abduction as described in Section 283 of the Criminal Code. Then under 1(f)(c) the Minister believed that there were serious reasons for considering that the claimant had committed acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations. Specifically, the United Nations Convention on the rights of the child and, however, since there was no consent letter from your husband on file.\n[13] Subsequent to that on \u2026 the Minister\u2019s representative wrote another letter on March 5th, 2019. That is Mr. Patrick Klauss, K-L-A-U-S-S, a hearings officer with the Canada Border Services Agency, and said the Minister is withdrawing their participation from \u2026 from the refugee hearing.\n[14] The Minister did conduct an investigation that did not yield any adverse information. The Minister also contacted background checks via the RCMP, and they did not indicate that the minor children had been reported missing or abducted, and also \u2026 Minister\u2019s rep also added a Hague Application has also not been filed with regards to the minor children. Hague is spelling, H-A-G-U-E.\n[15] All right. And it said further, the Minister is of the understanding that the husband has now granted permission for his children to be in Canada.\n[16] Now, the Minister added that the Minister\u2019s aware of the possibility of the l(f)(b) exclusion should \u2026 could also be considered by they panel as the claimant\u2019s action could potentially fall within the ambit, A-M-B-I-T, of Section 283 of the Criminal Code of Canada.\n[17] However, the panel has considered Section 283 of the Criminal Code and conducted a teleconference with the claimant\u2019s husband from Kabul on Wednesday March the 6th, and the claimant\u2019s husband gave credible testimony. Also, provided important dates including birthdates, marriage dates for the children and the claimant. His testimony was also very consistent with the claimant\u2019s Basis of Claim Form, and he gave credible and very, very detailed information about the security situation in Afghanistan and in Kabul.\n[18] Now, I\u2019ll go into that again, but I also noted that through counsel we also received a written consent letter Exhibit 13 from the claimant\u2019s husband as well as the verbal consent. So, I find that given the Minister\u2019s new position examining Criminal Code Section 283 the \u2026 the claimant does not fall under the exclusions Articles either l(f)(b) or l(f)(c). And so, I have no reasons to believe \u2026 there\u2019s no evidence that those article \u2026 exclusion Articles are in play in this case.\n[19] Now, your identities, all your identities as nationals of Afghanistan is established by your testimony in Dari and also the supporting documentation including the certified true copies of your Afghan passports in Exhibit 1.\n[20] All right. I found you and your husband as a witness are \u2026 to be credible witness and \u2026 witnesses and therefore I believe what you have alleged in support of your claims. You both testified in a straightforward manner and there are no relevant inconsistencies in either of your testimony or contradictions between your testimony and the other evidence before me such as country documents, personal documents, or the Basis of Claim Forms.\n[21] Now, the \u2026 your husband testified that he was a foreign \u2026 in the foreign service and is seeking a new position either in the securities \u2026 internal security or the Defense Department in Afghanistan.\n[22] He gave a candid assessment of the security situation in Afghanistan today. At least 40 to 50 percent of the territory of Afghanistan is controlled by the Taliban. The \u2026 he explained the difficulties in containing the Taliban including the porous borders and other factors that made it very documents to control this insurgency.\n[23] He also explained as an adult. He\u2019s about 45-years-old. His \u2026 he lives with his mother and his mother is afraid for his life and fears \u2026 doesn\u2019t want him to go out definitely in the evening time at all, to stay close to home. And your husband also said that \u2026 that daily security precautions have to be taken. There\u2019d have to be frequent changes in departures and entrances into the house from different situations. For \u2026 for example, if someone \u2026 if he were to work again he\u2019d have to change his route daily or almost two times a week, biweekly to be safe.\n[24] So \u2026 so, I find that in your particular case given that you are family members of a former diplomat with the Afghan Government, that State protection would not be reasonably forthcoming in this particular case. Given that you and your family members the minor claimants would be high valued targets of the Taliban since you are, since you would be targeted because of your family membership and your \u2026 your husband\u2019s relatively high profile.\n[25] I \u2026 I also considered Exhibit 7 the latest National Documentation Package for Afghanistan from February 28, 2019 and note the tenuous security situation. The State is willing to provide protection but in many instances is unable to do so.\n[26] Given the targeted attacks on women and children by the Taliban, for \u2026 for example, I see that in the Department of State report for Afghanistan in Section 2.1 and other human rights documents in the Index.\n[27] Now, going back briefly credibility, I \u2026 I accept your explanation why you didn\u2019t claim in Belgium. You were under your husband\u2019s \u2026 well, he had the passports and wouldn\u2019t let you even try to claim there. And \u2026 and in July 2017 there was again, you were at \u2026 disagreement about what to do with yourself and the children, and you took action to \u2026 because of your fear of returning to Afghanistan to make claims in Canada.\n[28] And I must say also Mr. [XXX] gave phenomenally detailed information about the security situation in Afghanistan and he obviously, on a balance of probabilities, was a diplomat, has been involved with the Afghan Government.\n[29] Now, I\u2019ve considered whether a viable internal flight alternative exits for you in Kabul. But on the evidence before me I find that there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout Afghanistan including Kabul if you were to return to Afghanistan.\n[30] Now, I considered the fact your husband is in Kabul, but he basically is semi-hiding, and the security situation has outlined in the National Documentation Package including the Department of State report is very tenuous right now. That\u2019s why I find that there\u2019s more than a mere possibility of persecution should you return to Kabul since you and the children would be obvious and visible targets of \u2026 of blood thirsty Taliban forces.\n[31] Therefore, for all those reasons I conclude all five of you are Convention refugees and therefore accept your claims.\n[32] The hearing \u2026 okay. Thank you, Mr. Yusuf, and Mr. Noor, here in Toronto. Thank you.\n[33] This hearing is now concluded.\n[34] CLAIMANT: Thank you.\n[35] INTERPRETER: Thank you very much, Mr. Member.\n[36] MEMBER: Okay, bye-bye.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

So, I find that you are a Convention refugee and I accept your claim. I\u2019m now going to explain to you the reason why I am accepting your claim. Congratulations first.\n[2] CLAIMANT: Thank you.\n[3] MEMBER: Given the issues that you have presented in your claim, I have considered the Chairperson\u2019s Guidelines on the women refugee claimants fearing gender related persecution. The details of your claim, sorry are to be found in your Basis of Claim form but in short, you fear abuse at the hands of your ex\u00ad husband\u2019s relatives. And all also, at the hands of your relatives. To be more specific you divorced your first husband because of physical abuse and you forfeited the right of custody of your children. And after your husband, your first husband passed away, you refused to marry his younger brother. You married a second time and it also ended in a divorce here in Canada after you were physically abused. Therefore, you are also afraid that your parents would pressure you to go back to your first husband.\n[4] Now with regard to the identified issue.\nIDENTITY\n[5] I find that your identity as a national of Jordan has been established by your testimony and by the supporting documents filed, including a Jordanian passport bearing a Canadian visa.\n[6] With regards to credibility, I find you to be a very credible witness and I believe what you have alleged in your claim. You have explained your personal situation as well as the cultural norms in Jordan which have affected your situation. You have testified in a straight forward manner and I didn\u2019t see any inconsistencies between your oral and written testimony. You have provided some supporting documents to corroborate your allegations in particular, your first husbands death certificate and your divorce certificate, as well as court and police documents, with regards to the abuse that happened here in Canada.\n[7] I find that you have a nexus to the convention definition as a woman fearing gender related persecution. In so far as you sustained physical and mental abuse at the hands of your first husband and your family member, due to membership in a particular social group as a victim of family violence. I find that your fear of persecution is both subjectively and objectively well-founded. I have looked at the information contained in the documentation package on the situation faced by women, such as yourself, in Jordan. As well as in the country conditions document package provided by your council.\n[8] I note that problems of domestic and family violence are the most outgoing human rights problems in Jordan. And all the reports, injury report, the most recent ones continue to note that violence against women and honour crimes continue to occur despite the government\u2019s efforts to put an end to such acts. As I indicated previously, I believe that you have testified. I believe what you have about your experiences in Jordan and I believe that your first husband\u2019s relatives may still harm you.\n[9] I also looked at state protection and I asked you questions in this regard. And the information that I have on the availability of protection for women such as yourself and the evidence is quite clear that adequate state protection at an operational level does not exist for you in Jordan from the harm that you fear.\n[10] The reports are consistent with your experience as you described it. And you testified that the state would not be able to protect you because your husband is from a very important tribe in Jordan. I also note that even in the most recent report, for example, for Amnesty International, they report that women remain subject to discrimination in law and in practice. And they are inadequately protected from sexual and other violence, including so called honour crimes.\n[11] I also looked at internal flight alternatives and I find that internal flight alternative does not, not exist for you in Jordan. And the evidence before me states that there is no area where a single woman can attempt to live outside the family home.\n[12] In conclusion, I find that you\u2019re a Convention refugee and I accept your claim.\n[13] Congratulations.\n[14] COUNSEL: Great. Thank you, Madame Member. Thank you so much.\n[15] MEMBER: Your welcome.

Pike\n\nCounsel for the claimant(s): Claire Houkaye m\n\nCountry: Libya\n\nRPD Number: TB7-18122\n\nAssociated RPD Numbers: TB7-18133, TB7-18157, TB7-18158, TB7-18159\n\nATIP Number: A-2020-01459\n\nATIP Pages: 000037-000039\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: This is the decision in the claims for refugee protection made by [XXX] and [XXX]. The principal File Number is TB7-18122.\n[2] Having carefully considered the evidence in this case, I am in a position to render a decision orally now and that decision is to accept the claim. The reason I come to that conclusion is as follows.\n[3] First of all, your identities are well established. I have copies of everyone\u2019s passports and numerous other identity documents.\n[4] You have sought protection the following reason: When you returned to Libya in 2015 after having finished a period of studies in Canada, you allege that your home in Tripoli was damaged during armed conflict in the city at that time. You were not living there at that time, you were living in your parents\u2019 home another city, Zaltan.\n[5] You went to go check on the damage. You made a report to the persons of responsible for the local security in the area in hopes of one day getting for some compensation for the damage. People came to inspect the home and the damage, and you say that an unintended consequence of this was that they found materials that they perceived to be of pro-Gaddafi in your home. Despite your explanation that these were related to your academic work, you were detained and questioned, treated badly in detention.\n[6] And you remain afraid of returning to Libya as you believe the security forces and militia groups perceive you as aligned with the former regime. You say this belief is supported by the continuing action of the local militia in your neighborhood in Tripoli, and that they chose to take your home you said for their own purposes in 2017.\n[7] You were able to secure visas to return to Canada to study and subsequently claim protection here. So, the reason I accept the claim is because I do find there is sufficient credible evidence to support your allegation.\n[8] Your testimony today was consistent and detailed. You provided documents in support of your claim, which included photos of your home and the damage to your home, letters from family members and neighbors who support your claims, and a record from the local militia group obtained by a family member, and so for all of those reasons I do believe that your home was damaged and you are now a target of the local militia group in Tripoli and that should you return to Libya and try to live in your home in Tripoli, you would face more than a mere possibility of persecution as a result of your perceived political opinion as being seen as pro-Gaddafi and by default against the militia.\n[9] Having found that you face persecution in your home, I had do consider whether there was an internal flight alternative for you. We considered Zaltan as this where your family is from and where you went to after you were released in Tripoli. You claim that you would be at risk there because the militia groups are widespread. You did remain there for a number of months before leaving Libya. There is no information that that militia group has control or reach in that city, and your family continues to live there. So, it is somewhat questionable whether the evidence supports that you would face risk there.\n[10] However, in addition to your fear of return, you also described the situation in general in the city as very poor. The security situation has resulted in your family member and others being unable to leave their homes and living in a situation of fear based on the lack of security in the area.\n[11] You are a family with four young children, and so even if the specific militia group that you fear in Tripoli would not necessarily harm you there, I find it objectively unreasonable for you to relocate to a city where there is such a poor security situation such that people were unable to leave their homes.\n[12] Finally, I note that there is no State protection currently in Libya as there is no functioning central State.\n[13] And so, for all of those reasons, I do find that you are Convention refugees and the claims are accepted. Thank you.\n[14] COUNSEL: Thank you, Board member.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

Young\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Ali Dakakni\nCountry: Syria\nRPD Number: TB7-16920\nATIP Number: A-2020-01459\nATIP Pages: 000032-000036\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] This is the decision in the claims of [XXX] (the principal claimant), [XXX] (the principal claimant\u2019s spouse), [XXX] and [XXX], (the minor claimants). The claimants are making claims against Syria, seeking Canada\u2019s protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).1 The principal claimant was appointed Designated Representative for the minor claimants. A third minor claimant, citizen of the United States, (U.S.), had initially made a claim with the rest of the family but that claim was withdrawn before the hearing.\n[2] The claimants have lived in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) since 2016. They had residence permits based on the principal claimant\u2019s employment. The principal claimant was, according to documents filed, a valued employee of [XXX] in Dubai.2 Prior to that, he had worked for the same company in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The family was planning to re-locate to Canada for the principal claimant to take a job with [XXX] in Toronto. The family\u2019s application to the Canadian government for a visa was refused because \u201cthe LMIA\/Job Offer which you have provided in support of the application is fraudulent\u201d.3 A subsequent application for a visa was also refused. The principal claimant alleges that because he was leaving his job in UAE, his employer had replaced him and refused to extend his employment. As a result, the claimants would be required to leave UAE. The only country they had a right to live in was their country of nationality, Syria. The family fears targeting due to their perceived opposition to the Assad regime and that the principal claimant would be forced to serve in the Syrian army. They had been issued Non-immigrant visas to the U.S. in 2015 valid until 2017. They travelled to the U.S. on [XXX] 2017. They crossed the Canada\u00adU.S. border ten days later, outside of an authorized port of entry and made refugee claims.\n[3] The panel had concerns about the evidence regarding the claimants\u2019 decision to leave the UAE. At the end of the hearing, counsel was given the opportunity to submit representations in writing. Along with his representations, counsel submitted documents regarding this issue along with documents about the U.S. administration\u2019s statements regarding refugees from Syria and the text of a tweet from the Canadian Prime Minister. As these were relevant to issues raised by the panel in the hearing, the documents were entered into evidence.4\nIdentity\n[4] Certified copies of the claimants\u2019 current Syrian passports were included with the referral.5 These are sufficient to establish the claimants\u2019 identity and nationality.\nCredibility and Subjective Fear\n[5] The panel stated in the hearing that credibility and subjective fear were issues in this claim. Specifically, on credibility, the truthfulness of the claimants\u2019 evidence regarding why they had left the country they were living in, where they had ongoing resident status, even though that status was not permanent. Had the status been permanent, the claims would likely have been excluded from consideration in accordance with Article 1E. As it stands, the claimant\u2019s decision to leave a country where they had status becomes a consideration in assessing their subjective fear. Further, the claimants\u2019 decision not to make an asylum claims in the U.S. also gives rise to an issue of whether the claimants lack subjective fear and also affects the assessment of the credibility of their allegations of fear of return to Syria.\n[6] The documents submitted by counsel post-hearing give a detailed explanation of the claimant\u2019s efforts to re-locate to Canada and set out more clearly the sequence of events. The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that when the claimants left the UAE, they were likely facing removal from that country.\n[7] Regarding the decision to pass through the U.S. and make a claim in Canada, the evidence is not as convincing. The claimants allege that the current president\u2019s statements regarding a Muslim ban was the reason and that therefore they had no choice but cross over to Canada. The panel notes that the claimants had visas permitting them to enter the U.S. and had been allowed entry to the U.S. during the time of the president\u2019s statements regarding banning Muslims but had been refused visas to travel to Canada. This undermines the claimants\u2019 assertion that they would be more welcome in Canada than the U.S. Counsel in his submissions referred to the Canadian Prime Minister\u2019s tweet. The statements does re-affirm that Canada accepts refugees fleeing risk of persecution. The statement does not say that persons who are already in safe countries should leave those countries and instead come to Canada. That said, even though the panel does not find that the claimants would be unsafe in the U.S., their belief is not so completely unreasonable that the panel can find that it indicates a lack of subject fear sufficient to undermine their claim.\nObjective Basis\n[8] With regard to the objective support for the claimants\u2019 allegations of the risk they face in Syria, this is found in the documentary evidence. Political opinion in Syria is imputed to citizens based on their locality or family connections. The International Protection Considerations with Regard to People Fleeing the Syrian Arab Republic, Update IV prepared by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) states:\nA particular and deepening feature of the conflict is that different parties to the conflict frequently impute a political opinion to larger groups of people, including families, tribes, religious or ethnic groups or whole towns, villages or neighbourhoods, by association. As such, members of a larger entity, without individually being singled out, become the targets for repercussions by different actors, including government forces, ISIS, and anti\u00adgovernment armed groups, for reason of real or perceived support to another party to the conflict.6\n[9] Refusal to take part in the actions of the Syrian army, in the current circumstances, is an expression of political opinion under the Convention definition and the actions which likely would be taken against the claimants would come within the definition of persecution.\nInternal Flight Alternative and State Protection\n[10] Syria is embroiled in a multi-dimensional, multi-national war which affects the entire country and has led to extreme sectarian violence. I find that the current security situation in the country is such that there is no access to state protection or a viable internal flight alternative for this claimants at the current time.\nCONCLUSION\n[11] Having considered all of the evidence before me, I find the claimants to be Convention refugees and I accept the claims.\n(signed) D. Young\nMarch 5, 2019\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27 as amended.\n\n2 Exhibit 10.\n\n3 Emphasis added.\n\n4 Exhibit 11.\n\n5 Exhibit 1.\n\n6 Exhibit 6, NDP for Syria (28 September 2018), item 1.12.\n",

Howorun\nCountry: Egypt\nRPD Number: TB7-16817\nATIP Number: A-2020-01459\nATIP Pages: 000027-000031\n[1] PRESIDING MEMBER: This is the decision in the case of file number TB7-16817. This decision is with respect to the claim of Mr. [XXX]. He claims to be a citizen of Egypt and is claiming refugee protection pursuant to Sections 96 and Section 97.(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[2] This decision is being rendered orally today and a written form of these reasons will be sent to your home at your address, sir, and they may also be edited for spelling, syntax, grammar as well as references to the applicable case law and legislation as well as exhibits.\n[3] I find that the claimant is a national of Egypt as is established by his testimony and by the supporting documentation filed; namely, his passport, a certified true copy of which is found in Exhibit 1, as well as his Egyptian identity card which was found in Exhibit 9.\n[4] From this evidence I conclude on a balance of probabilities that the claimant has Egyptian citizenship and that he is who he claims to be.\n[5] Mr. [XXX], I find that you are a Convention refugee for the following reasons.\n[6] In this case the nexus to the Convention definition is your imputed political opinion. You have come to the attention of the security authorities in Egypt, at first through your attaining what you believe to be an authentic building permit to build a barn on your property. Then you proceeded to build this and then when it was demolished and you complained about that you came facing the police and then were taken to the police station.\n[7] You also appear from your evidence to have come to the attention of the police authorities through your involvement in attending anti-government, political demonstrations in November 2016, as well as by posting on your Facebook page what were anti-government opinions as well as the fact that you had attended those demonstrations.\n[8] The allegations are found in your Basis of Claim Form and I will just summarize them, but I won\u2019t provide every detail.\n[9] These demonstrations which you attended in November 2016 were against the government of Mr. El-Sisi giving two Egyptian islands to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and also they were against the rising inflation that was taking place in Egypt.\n[10] With respect to the building permit which you had obtained from what you believe to be a legitimate source, the office that issued the permits, you had paid your 4,000 Egyptian pounds and then you proceeded to build the barn in December of 2016.\n[11] Then shortly afterwards on the 7th of January 2017 the police went to your home with the equipment and commenced demolishing the barn.\n[12] Then when you protested you were subsequently taken the police station. You were there accused of assaulting police officers with weapons which you then denied, and then you were kept in solitary confinement for two months and warned to not speak out against the government again or you would be killed.\n[13] Your family who had gone looking for you at the police station where you were taken had been told by the authorities at that time that you were released the very first day, thus causing them to extreme fear thinking that you had disappeared as others had \u2013 as it had happened to others.\n[14] You also understood by the warning that you were given by the police that they were aware of your anti-government opinions and the posts that you had published on Facebook as you had not spoken out against the government in any way until that point except by writing on your Facebook page which was in your account, and by attending the two protests in November of 2016.\n[15] You were released from detention on the [XXX] 2017. Customers who had come to you in the past for painting jobs had ostracized you as did your friends who stopped contacting you.\n[16] And there was the belief that your detention by the police was for the illegal building of the barn, but you told people at your brother\u2019s barbershop that it was not for that, but because you had spoken out against them for what they were doing to you.\n[17] Also upon learning from your cousin whose friend while working at the national security office in Garbaya (ph) you learned that there was a warrant for your arrest.\n[18] You immediately commenced making arrangements to leave the country and to obtain a temporary resident visa to Canada. You then travelled to Canada in [XXX] 2017 and subsequently make a protection claim in August 2017.\n[19] You have a wife and two children in Egypt and they are staying with her parents instead of at your home as you are aware that the police have gone to your home looking for you for about six times and they have even gone to look for you at your home while there\u2019s no one there and this information was obtained by your wife and she informed you that she obtained it from the neighbours who saw them go there.\n[20] And you provided a picture of the broken door that the police caused recently in January and this photograph is Exhibit 10.\n[21] You fear returning to Egypt because you fear that the police will detain you, that you may disappear or you may possibly be killed by the police or you will be given a long sentence for something that you did not do which was you did not assault the police officers and not with weapons either.\n[22] The temporary resident visa that you obtained to Canada was obtained through the help of a person and to whom you paid $10,000 total and that they arranged that you would leave the country without any problems and so you did.\n[23] Regarding your credibility, Mr. [XXX], I found that your response were generally consistent with your Basis of Claim Form. I was concerned about the BOC omission whereby you omitted to mention that you had written your political opinions on Facebook or on social media.\n[24] You provided an explanation that you did not have any copies of these to give, given that you had someone, an expert on computers close your account or you believe they closed it permanently or deactivated it permanently so that there would be no risk to your wife and your sisters and your family in Egypt once you had left the country. Therefore, that is why you did not mention the Facebook account and your political opinions in social media to your counsel and then put that in your Basis of Claim Form.\n[25] I have considered your education level and the hearing evidence and find that this explanation under the circumstances of this case is reasonable and that you have had in this hearing opportunities to embellish your evidence by your testimony, but you did not take those opportunities. Therefore, I\u2019ve concluded that I find you to be a credible witness and some of your response were very spontaneous.\n[26] Your evidence is consistent with the documentary material both in counsel\u2019s package as well as in the National Documentation Package found at Exhibit 3 primarily with respect to the deteriorating human rights situation in Egypt.\n[27] Counsel\u2019s package of Exhibit 5 speaks also about the \u2013 sorry, Exhibit 8 speaks about the corruption that has taken over Egypt primarily since the el-Sisi Government and the large bribes that are paid for people to build permit or get building permits where they should not be getting them and how this is a huge problem in Egypt at the present time.\n[28] In your case you believe that it was a legitimate and actual permit that you obtained whereby you continue \u2013 you proceeded to build your barn. Whether it was or not that\u2019s not \u2013 we won\u2019t know, but the issue is that you are being charged by the police with something that you claim you did not do which was assaulting the police officers and anything that you have done with respect to protecting what you believe was your right to build that barn and complain to the police officers. They took that to be an example of a political opinion against them.\n[29] The situation in the documentary material clearly indicates that the human rights in Egypt are continuing to deteriorate.\n[30] There\u2019s a report in Amnesty International with respect to 2017 that indicates that to be case. It speaks about the authorities arbitrarily restricting the rights to freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly.\n[31] It speaks there also about a crackdown plot by the government that was to include members of the Muslim Brotherhood as well as anyone that was perceived to be members of armed groups, but reliable human rights sources speak about how many people who were just sympathizers are often caught and unfairly treated in these group crackdowns.\n[32] In some cases detainees in political cases or anyone who has an opposing view to the government are often held in prolonged detention without charge or without trial.\n[33] The documentary material also speaks about unfair trials when these are held and anyone who has a view opposing the current government is held accountable for that view and will be detained.\n[34] Many human rights groups throughout the world believe that the Egyptian authorities have misused many of their powers against their own citizens and that the Egyptian authorities troll through social media to see who has said anything opposing the government and that is whereby you think that they may have read your Facebook posts and they may have.\n[35] I believe that for these reasons, Mr. [XXX], you cannot ask the Government of Egypt for protection because they are the source of persecution to you.\n[36] You also cannot go elsewhere in the country to live safely without hiding because you would face the same possibility or serious grounds of persecution given what is your imputed political opinion and that means that it\u2019s the opinion of the authorities believe you have. It doesn\u2019t really matter whether you actually have it, but the authorities in Egypt believe that you are against the government because of what you have said and maybe because of what you have written.\n[37] So for all of these reasons I find that you, [XXX], are a Convention refugee and I therefore accept your claim.\n[38] This hearing is now concluded. Thanks, Madam Interpreter, for all your assistance. Good day, Counsel.\n[39] COUNSEL: Thank you.\n[40] PRESIDING MEMBER: Good day to you, sir. All the best to everyone and we\u2019re concluding now.\n\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2013\n",

        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2019 RLLR 84\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: April 25, 2019\nPanel: R. Jackson\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Micheal F. Loebach\nCountry: Burundi\nRPD Number: TB7-08140\nATIP Number: A-2020-01459\nATIP Pages: 000023-000026\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] [XXX], a citizen of Burundi, is claiming refugee protection pursuant to ss. 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act1 (IRPA).\nFILE REVIEW PROCESS\n[2] The panel issued this decision without a hearing in accordance with paragraph 170(f) of the IRPA and the relevant instructions.\nDETERMINATION\n[3] The panel finds that the claimant is a Convention refugee, as he has established that he faces a serious possibility of persecution on Convention grounds, if he returns to Burundi, by reason of his imputed political opinion and ethnicity.\nALLEGATIONS\n[4] The claimant is 21 years old and a Tutsi.\n[5] The claimant\u2019s allegations are contained in his Basis of Claim (BOC) form. In summary, he fears returning to Burundi because he has been targeted in the past by Jmbonerakures and other state actors due to his ethnicity and imputed anti-government political opinion. The authorities and state actors have also persecuted his family members over the years, due to their Tutsi ethnicity and real or imputed political opinions.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[6] The claimant\u2019s identity as a national of Burundi was established by a copy of his passport.2\nCredibility\n[7] The claimant\u2019s allegations were credible and supported by probative evidence.\n[8] He presented various documents supporting certain aspects of his claim, particularly regarding the treatment his family members\u2019 have received in Burundi.\n[9] The National Documentation Package (NDP) for Burundi shows the political violence in Burundi, government repression and violence against anti-government protesters and political opponents3.\n[10] The objective documentation mentions that protests against the government have involved Hutu and Tutsi; that Tutsi are often targeted4; and that family members of political opponents to the government\u2019s third term of the president are subject to violence from government authorities or supporters due to their imputed political opinion.5 Sexual violence remained pervasive and was often used as a means of torture to obtain information or confessions from detainees. Rape was also committed while police officers or members of the Imbonerakure arrested a victim\u2019s spouse or relative accused of belonging to an opposition party.\n[11] An example that illustrates the situation in Burundi is that on December 11, 2015, police and military personnel summarily executed dozens of persons in Bujumbura Mairie, including in Nyakabiga and Musaga. The bodies of persons who had been executed were also found in the commune of Mukike (Bujumbura Province). The extrajudicial executions that took place in December 2015, on a scale that exceeded those reported since April 2015, were accompanied or followed by torture, rape and arbitrary arrests.6\n[12] There are reports of summary executions by the Imbonerakure, acting either as auxiliaries of the defense and security forces or on their own initiative.7\n[13] There is ample evidence in the NDP indicating that there is a risk to Tutsis in Burundi when they are associated with political opposition, such as residing in an area associated with anti-regime protests or with a high population of Tutsis.\n[14] The objective documentation is consistent with the claimant\u2019s allegations. The panel therefore accepts his allegations and that he has a subjective fear of returning to Burundi.\nSTATE PROTECTION\n[15] There is clear and convincing evidence before the panel that the state is unable or unwilling to protect the claimant, since the state is the agent of persecution. As noted in the objective documentation referred to above, the government has effective control of its territory.\nINTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE-IFA\n[16] Based on the evidence before the panel, there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout Burundi.\n[17] As indicated in the evidence above, the state is the agent of persecution and the government has effective control of its territory and would probably eventually find the claimant in another area of Burundi. Remaining in hiding in that country is unreasonable.\nCONCLUSION\n[18] The claimant, [XXX], is a Convention refugee due to his imputed political opinion.\n[19] The panel accepts his claim.\n(signed) R. Jackson\nApril 25, 2019\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c.27 as amended.\n\n2 Exhibit I \u2013 passport.\n\n3 Exhibit 3 \u2013 National Documentation Package (NDP) for Burundi (March 29, 2019), items 2.1, 4.7 and 13.1.\n\n4 Ibid., items 2.1 and 13.6.\n\n5 Ibid., items 2.1 and 4.14.\n\n6 Ibid., item 2.10.\n\n7 Ibid.\n",

So, you allege you are a citizen of Djibouti and you are being forced to marry someone against your will.\n[2] You allege the Government of Djibouti won\u2019t protect you and there is no safe place for you anywhere in Djibouti.\n[3] You provided your Djiboutian passport and we have the copy in Exhibit 1, and I accept that you are a citizen of Djibouti and I am satisfied you have established your identity.\n[4] Your testimony was straightforward and there were no major inconsistencies or contradictions between your testimony and that of your Basis of Claim Form.\n[5] Your father passed away and you testified that arranged marriages are common in Djibouti, and in this case your uncle on your father\u2019s side has the power to determine who you will marry. Your uncle had arranged for you to marry a much older man whom you had no interest in marrying and you had a long-term boyfriend already.\n[6] You explained this to your uncle and he threatened you and beat you up. So, then you ran away from Djibouti rather than getting married to this older man. A letter of support from your long-term boyfriend in Djibouti was presented.\n[7] On a balance of probabilities, I accept that your testimony is credible and trustworthy.\n[8] I took notice of the Chairperson\u2019s Guidelines for claims based on gender. Also, Item 5.3 in the National Documentation Package, which indicates that forced marriages are common practice in Djibouti.\n[9] You would have no or little protection from the coercion exercised by your uncle and that pressure would not stop until you agree to go through with the marriage that he arranged for you.\n[10] And whether this is treated as a case of domestic violence or forced marriage, the documentary evidence in Item 2.1 indicates the police will not intervene to protect you from your uncle.\n[11] With regard to State protection, civilian authorities maintained effective control over security forces, but there were many significant human rights issues such as interference with privacy rights; harassing, abusing and detaining government critics; restrictions on freedom of speech, assembly, association and religion.\n[12] There is government corruption, violence against women and children with inadequate government action for prosecution and accountability, trafficking in persons, restrictions on worker rights, and child labour. Impunity is reportedly a problem in your country. The government seldom takes steps to prosecute or punish officials who commit abuses, whether in the security services or elsewhere in the government.\n[13] One of the reasons that police rarely intervene in cases of domestic violence is that the culture in Djibouti is that families and clans handle cases of violence against family members.\n[14] Under these circumstances, it is clear that it is not reasonable for you to ask the protection of the State of Djibouti.\n[15] It is relatively a small country and the documentary evidence indicates that asking you to attempt to relocate within your country as a single woman with no family connections is unreasonable, and so therefore I find it is not reasonable for you to seek an internal flight alternative in your particular circumstances.\n[16] Having considered all the evidence, I find that you have discharged your burden of establishing that there is a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground if you were to return to Djibouti, and so I therefore conclude that you are a Convention refugee and the Division accepts your claim.\n[17] So, this hearing is now concluded.\n[18] Thank you all for your participation today.\n[19] COUNSEL: Thank you.\n[20] CLAIMANT: Thank you.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

In 2018, they completed their high school diploma in Rwanda. Upon return to Burundi in [XXX] 2018, the claimant, [XXX], alleges that he received a police summons asking him to present himself to the police on December 23rd, 2018. When he presented himself at this state, intelligence agents questioned him about what he had been doing in Rwanda. They took his phone and implied that he was involved with a group of youths spreading propaganda on social media.\n[4] The claimant also alleges that he was kidnapped on January 25th, 2019 where his watch and phone were stolen and he was held without food or water for two days. He alleges that he was beaten and interrogated with regards to the reasons he went to Rwanda and asking him who he was working with to undermine the government in Burundi. In the end, he was released because his father paid millions of francs to his abductors.\n[5] The claimant, [XXX], alleges that she received threatening phone calls from individuals saying that she would be killed and raped because she was gathering information on Burundi in order to help groups in Rwanda.\n[6] The claimants arrived in Canada on [XXX], 2019 and sought asylum on April 10th, 2019.\n[7] The Board finds that the claimants are \u201cConvention refugees\u201d as they have established a serious possibility of persecution should they return to their country of origin based on one of the grounds set out in Section 96 of the IRPA, namely their imputed political opinion for being suspected of working against the government of Burundi.\n[8] With regards to identity, the claimants provided certain identity documents at the request of the Board that contained many errors. During the first hearing, the claimants had difficulty explaining the reasons for these mistakes.\n[9] At the second hearing, the claimant Mrs. [XXX] explained that she had since spoken to her father who told her that he had obtained these documents when the claimants were already in Canada. Her father said that he had gone to different authorities to obtain the required documents, but as he does not read French he did not realize they contained mistakes. He also told her that he obtained a new national identity card for her because he couldn\u2019t find her original one at home.\n[10] Thus, the Board gives no weight to the following identity documents as they contained many mistakes and the claimants have not established that they were obtained legitimately: Exhibits C-1 and C-2 which are the attestations of residence, C-10 and C-12 which are the birth certificates and C-13 which is the national identity card for Mrs. [XXX].\n[11] That being said, the claimants also submitted as evidence of their identity their two authentic passports on which the information is consistent with the claimants\u2019 declarations. The claimants were also able to explain how they had obtained these passports and their explanations were conforming with the documentary evidence.\n[12] They also submitted several laissez-passer which are authentic documents given by Burundi for allowing them to travel and study in Rwanda. These documents do not contain any anomalies and are consistent with the information found in their passports. Consequently, the Board gives these primary identity documents weight and strong probative value with regards to the claimants\u2019 identities.\n[13] While the Board evidently does not condone the fabrication of documents to bolster an asylum claim, it accepts the claimants\u2019 explanation with regards to their father\u2019s undertakings to obtain these documents while the claimants were already in Canada. The claimants are both young and relied on their father to obtain these documents as they thought they were absolutely necessary for their asylum claim.\n[14] In conclusion, the identity of the claimants has been established as nationals of Burundi on a balance of probabilities.\n[15] With regards to credibility, the claimants were both credible witnesses. With regards to the threats and violence suffered in Burundi, the claimant, [XXX], recounted in detail how he was detained and interrogated several times. He also explains his dissatisfaction of the Board why he did not write about his detention in his IMM 5669 form. He submitted that he did not know who had abducted him and because he had not been taken to a legitimate jail, he did not think that he had to write this information in the form. The Board finds that this is a logical explanation as the claimant was not detained lawfully.\n[16] The claimant, [XXX], also testified in detail about the threatening phone calls she received and she added significant details to those already found in her Basis of Claim form which bolster her credibility.\n[17] The claimants also provided documentary evidence that supported their allegations. Exhibits C-3 through C-7 proves that they indeed attended high school in Rwanda and Exhibit C-18 is a copy of the police summons that was issued to the principal claimant. In light of their credibility and the supporting documents provided, the claimants have proven their allegations on a balance of probabilities.\n[18] The Board finds that the claimants have established that they face a future risk of being subjected to arbitrary detention, ill treatment such as physical assault and torture, sexual violence and death if they had to return to Burundi.\n[19] The documentary evidence found in the National Documentation Package at Tabs 1.5, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 10.5 and 13.1 states that authorities in Burundi and Imbonerakure are responsible for serious human rights violations, summary executions, rape, kidnappings and intimidation of people who are perceived to be political opponents. Furthermore, Tab 1.5 states that individuals who have lived in the countries surrounding Burundi such as in Rwanda have been subjected to arbitrary arrests and other human rights violations as they are suspected of collaborating with rebel groups based in Rwanda who are seeking to overthrow the regime in Burundi.\n[20] Not only do the claimants fit that profile as they studied in Rwanda, but they also lived in Kasikibuye (phonetic), a neighbourhood where many young people have been arrested and where mass graves have been found. In light of the attacks and threats received by both claimants in Burundi, the Board finds that they face a serious possibility of persecution were they to return to their country of origin.\n[21] The Board further finds that there is clear and convincing evidence that the State is unable or unwilling to provide them with adequate protection. In the case at hand, the agents of persecution are agents of the State such as the police, intelligence services and the Imbonerakure. As such, the claimants cannot reasonably receive any kind of State protection. The claimants have rebutted the presumption of State protection in this particular case.\n[22] The Board finally analyzed whether the claimants could avail themselves of an internal flight alternative within Burundi. However, because they face persecution from State agents who control the entire country, they could not safely relocate anywhere. State authorities and Imbonerakure have demonstrated that they have the interest and ability to track down any presumed political opponent. Thus, they do not have a viable internal flight alternative.\n[23] Based on this analysis, the Board reiterates that the claimants are \u201cConvention refugees\u201d and their claims are accepted.\n",

He alleges that he is a citizen of Yemen and is claiming refugee protection as \u201cConvention refugee\u201d and as \u201cpersons in need of protection\u201d under sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection (IRPA).\nDECISION\n[3] The Tribunal concludes that the claimant is a person in need of protection under section 97 of IRPA.\nANALYSIS\n[4] The determinative issues are identity and credibility.\nIDENTITY\n[5] The claimant\u2019s name is as indicated in his Yemeni passport: [XXX].\n[6] The claimant has established his identity by means of the certified copy of his Yemeni passport which was seized by Canadian authorities when he claimed for asylum.1\n[7] The claimant lived in Saudi Arabia from 2011 until February\/March 2016 according to his Generic Application Form and his Schedule A Form. He moved to the USA to Study in [XXX] or [XXX] 2016 and never had any problem in Yemen, according to his CBSA interview dated March 12, 2019. He left the U.S. to come to Canada on [XXX] 20192, to claim asylum.\nAllegations\n[8] The story of this claim is as follows.\n[9] The claimant alleges that he is a citizen of Yemen but he was born and resided in Saudi Arabia and never loved or resided in Yemen. He says that he is married to a Saudi citizen but has no permanent residence in that country or citizenship. He fears of being deported to Yemen where he may be targeted by the militias, including the houthis, as an outsider.\n[10] He alleges that his relatives were assassinated in Yemen in 1974, 2013 and 2015 and he has no known relatives in Yemen. He is afraid to return to Yemen because, as a Yemeni from abroad, he could be targeted by various militias there.\n[11] In his interview with CBSA authorities, the claimant recognized that he had no personal history of persecution or harm in Yemen3.\nCREDIBILITY\n[12] The claimant has established, on the balance of probabilities, that as a young Yemeni citizen who never lived or resided in that country, that he may face harm because of the ongoing civil war in Yemen.\n[13] The evidence shows that he was born in Saudi Arabia and married a Saud citizen, which does not grant him the right of citizenship in Saudi Arabia. His family also resided in Saudi Arabia and outside Yemen, which would leave the claimant vulnerable if he was to be sent to Yemen.\n[14] The documentary evidence shows that Yemen is not governed by a strong central government and various militias control several parts of the country and as a person who never lived in Yemen and carries foreign identity documents, the claimant could easily become identifiable thus a target of those militias.\n[15] Given the fact that there is no state protection and the situation is similar all over the country, the Tribunal concludes that there is a risk to the claimant\u2019s life if he was to be sent back to Yemen.\nDECISION\n[16] Therefore the claim is accepted.\n(signed) Harry Dortelus\nNovember 29, 2019\n1 Notice of Seizure of the claimant\u2019s Yemeni passport dated March 12, 2019.\n\n2 Canadian Border Services Agency (CBSA) interview dated March 12, 2019.\n\n3 Note No. 2.\n",

These are the reasons for the decision in the claim of [XXX], who claims to be a citizen of Rwanda, and is claiming refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and paragraph 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] You allege the following. You are a political activist. You are against the government of Paul Kagame, who is the current President in Rwanda right now. You\u2019re coming from a family with a history because your father was targeted by the regime. He was part of the same party, but your father opposed the President and he was, you said in your testimony actually, that he was killed by the regime, from what I understood. Yourself, in 2013, you started your social involvement by funding a non-governmental organization called \u201cHelp a Child Initiative\u201d which was in 2013, as I mentioned, until 2015. But you explained to me as well that the government asked you\u2026 You were able to gather a lot of parents to take care of children, and the government wanted you to promote the referendum and ask the parents to vote \u201cyes\u201d to the referendum. At that time, you refused to do that, and you left the organization.\n[3] You left Rwanda for a few years, two years actually. You worked in Dubai. Then, you came back to Rwanda and then, there, you started to work with, I should say closely, with Diane Rwigara. Supporting her in her\u2026 in her\u2026 in her campaign, and she was running for President at that time. You said that, even like you were in Dubai, you called her to give her your support. Then, after that, the government just did not allow her to continue to run as President, but you decided with her and with a group of people to continue your political involvement. And, you founded a movement called \u201c[XXX] Movement\u201d. And, the election took place in August 4th, 2017. You\u2026 Diane Rwigara was not a candidate; she was not allowed as I mentioned.\n[4] Then, yourself, you started to have problems. You left Rwanda for the United States in [XXX], 2018, but during that year there was a lot of problems you had. You were arrested twice in August 2017, and in October as well. You were interrogated. You were even accu\u2026 You appeared in court and you provided the judgement from the court. You were accused of being\u2026 of having influence or wanted to\u2026 like an enemy of the nation, being against the government and bringing the youth in your movement. You were\u2026 You had to report to the police every week, then, until December 2017, but that continued after. You received phone calls, and in January threats. You were worried, but finally after a few months you\u2026 you left for the U.S. And, after, even like\u2026 When you left, and in October 17, you received a second summons. The government was still after you. You had to report to the authorities for criminal case\u2026 for a criminal case. There is no detail, but you, of course, you didn\u2019t go. You were in the U.S.A friend \u2026 A co-worker actually sent you the summons, so you were able to provide the original today. So, you\u2019re\u2026 The authorities are still looking for you and you\u2019re afraid of going back to Rwanda because of your political activities, your political opinion.\nDETERMINATION\n[5] This is my decision. I find that you are a \u201cConvention refugee\u201d as you have established a serious possibility of persecution on account of your political opinion.\nANALYSIS\nIDENTITY\n[6] I find that your identity as a national of Rwanda has been established through your testimony and also the supporting documentation filed, namely your passport from Rwanda. In the passport, there was also your American Visa, and your identity was established through that process as well.\nCREDIBILITY\n[7] I find you to be a credible witness and therefore I believe what you have alleged in support of your claim. You testified in a straightforward manner, and I didn\u2019t find contradictions or omissions between your testimony and the other evidence I have. I think that you had you had a lot to say. For instance, you wanted to speak about your family background. I think you were influenced by your father\u2019s decisions in your activities and the way you\u2026 in your thoughts as well. So, for that, I find that you were credible.\n[8] Also, you provided important documentation, the membership card from the [XXX], Diane Rwigara\u2019s movement. You provided this card in P-2. You provided as well in P-3 the decision of the court. You were accused, most precisely, you were accused of crime of discrimination, divisionism among the youth, instigating divisions to hate the country and leaders, as well as genocide ideology, as stated in your case. So, this is a serious accusation in the judgement, but from the evidence I have, you only express your political opinion and you were fighting for your ideas. There\u2019s also P-4, the summons you received from\u2026 the second summons you received while you were\u2026 while you were in the United States in October 2018. It says, as I mentioned, it refers to \u201ccriminal cases\u201d. It doesn\u2019t say precisely what it is, but it says if you will not appear, you will be apprehended by authorities in charge. So, they are ready to arrest you. But you didn\u2019t. So, I took all these exhibits into consideration, and I find that they contribute to your allegations \u2026 in supporting your allegations.\nOBJECTIVE BASIS OF FUTURE RISK\n[9] Based on the credibility of your allegations, and the documentary evidence that I have, I find that you have established a future risk that you will be subjected to the following harm: arrest, detention, torture, and death, possibly, death. The torture\u2026 You were submitted to torture before, and also, you also mentioned that you have\u2026 there are people who are involved in your movement who have simply disappeared. The fact that you face this risk is corroborated by the following documents, and this is the last version of the NDP. So, there are a lot of documents about how the authorities are treating opposition in Rwanda. So, for instance, on the Rwandan authorities suppressing dissent through violence and intimidation, and on individuals who are subjected to arbitrary arrest and physical abuse in custody, this is in tab 2.3. On the fact that political parties are unable to function normally in Rwanda because of arrest and harassment of their members, this is in tab 2.4. There is only one opposition party registered in Rwanda. The other parties, they cannot be\u2026 they are not allowed, and this is in tab 2.4. On the repression of any dissident voice qualified as being enemy of the nation, this is in tab 2.7. And, on opposition parties and media reduced to silence, this is in tab 2.7. Now, we spoke about the father of Diane Rwigara, Assinapol Rwigara, who died in 2015, officially it\u2019s from an automobile accident, but the family suspects that\u2026 the family believe that it was orchestrated, and this is in tab 4.12 and also in tab 9.1.\nNATURE OF HARM\n[10] This harm clearly amounts to persecution.\nSTATE PROTECTION\n[11] I find that there is clear and convincing evidence before me that the State is unable or unwilling to provide you with adequate protection. In fact, the State is the agent of persecution, and the State is looking for you. You provided this\u2026 this evidence, the second summons, that they want to arrest you. So, I don\u2019t think that it would be reasonable for me to tell you \u201cwell, you go and ask for protection from the State\u201d. You would be at risk I believe. There are a lot of arrests of members of the opposition, leaders, activists and journalists right now in Rwanda, and this is in tab 4.1. This is a Human Rights Watch report that details this information. There are also disappearances. People, they disappear simply or they are like you are\u2026 you were, actually. They are\u2026 They have\u2026 They are charged with criminal cases. So, that is not State protection. In fact, the State wants to punish these people.\nINTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE\n[12] I have considered whether you would be able to go to another region of Rwanda and on the evidence before me, I find that there is serious possibility of persecution throughout Rwanda. There is, in a report in tab 2.7, which explains that though in Rwanda there is some economic success, and it appears to be a great country. But in fact, there is a repression and it is an authoritarian State now in Rwanda. People have a fear of expressing their ideas. There is, again, disappearances of people or opposition members, assassinations. So, this is all in this report, as I mentioned.\nCONCLUSION\n[13] Based on the analysis above, I conclude that you are a \u201cConvention refugee\u201d and therefore I accept your claim.\n",

        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2019 RLLR 79\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: April 9, 2019\n\nPanel: Jeffrey Brian Gullickson\nCountry: Libya\nRPD Number: MB8-19759\nRPD Associated Number(s): MB8-19775\nATIP Number: A-2020-01459\nATIP Pages: 00001-00005\n[1] I have considered your testimony and the other evidence in this case, and I am ready to render my decision orally. These are the reasons for the decision in the claims of Mr. [XXX] and Ms. [XXX], who are citizens of Libya and are claiming refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. In rendering my reasons, I have considered and applied the person\u2019s\u2026 the Chairperson\u2019s guidelines on women refugee claimants fearing gender-related persecutions.\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] The claimants are 22 and 19. They are from Tripoli. They are associated with Misrata through their brother. They had come to Canada approximately in 2014 as students, last\u2026 leaving the country, for Mr. [XXX], it was in late [XXX] 2015, for Ms. [XXX], it was [XXX] 2016. The two claimants are brother and sister. They do have two siblings who are still leaving in Libya, but most of their family members, or at least their parents, are living in Qatar where the two claimants had lived for several years before the revolution in Libya in 2011. The claimants had visited Libya recently for Mr. [XXX] in [XXX] 2015, for the female claimant, his sister, in [XXX] 2016. They had stayed for approximately two weeks at that time and for period previous to that, when they were visiting but living in Qatar. The brother, [XXX] (phonetic), had fought in armed conflict in one of the militias starting in 2011 and through to 2013. He was fighting Gaddafi forces, pro-Gaddafi forces, during that period, and he had been targeted by rival militias. And, he had warned the claimants not to return to Libya. The claimants fear that they would be targeted by rival militias, or other groups, and would be the targets of kidnapping, extortion, or related harm, or some harm just related to being a perceived opponent for political reasons or for being associated with Misrata militia. So, the claimants made their refugee claims eventually in Canada.\nDETERMINATION\n[3] I find that you are \u201cConvention refugees\u201d as you fear persecution by reason of a member of a particular social group or for imputed political opinion, and this is in association with your brother [XXX] activity in the Misrata militia or a similar militia associated with Misrata, and that you would be targeted by rival militias as a possible political opponent.\nANALYSIS\nIDENTITY\n[4] I find that your identity as nationals of Libya is established by your passports you\u2019ve deposited as evidence.\nCREDIBILITY\n[5] I find that you were generally credible in your testimony. There were some credibility concerns but they are not determinative. There is probative evidence in support of your claim. The evidence that you did submit were primarily the DVD, which was fairly detailed, it\u2019s almost \u2026 I think it\u2019s an hour and a half. It\u2019s approximately an hour and a half, that was a documentary on the claimants\u2019 brother [XXX], who fought in the armed conflict in Libya after the revolution or in the period of 2011 and shortly after that, showing that he had taken up arms and fought in that conflict. He is clearly identified in the credits of the film as well and corresponds to the claimants\u2019 Basis of Claim form where they list their family members. Another document is P-2, which is a letter from the claimants\u2019 father, which is basically explaining his limited and temporary status in Qatar as an employee of a [XXX]. It\u2019s unclear whether he would be able to renew his status in Qatar, but one of the allegations by the claimants is that if they were not allowed to stay in Canada, and there was a risk of being forced to Libya, they would have no refuge in Qatar since their own father has only temporary status there. And, the claimants don\u2019t appear to have any permanent status in Qatar.\n[6] The Documentation Package for Libya, dated March 2019, describes the conflict in Libya. That the Gaddafi regime was violently overthrown in 2011 by armed insurgents and NATO, and that\u2019s tab 1.12, sections 5.1.1 to section 5.1.3. And, that\u2019s in the Documentation Package. There is conflict between the ruling groups in Libya. One is in Tobruk and Albida now, in the East, and the other is the\u2026 is in the West in Tripoli, which is acting under the UN Accord which had named the government of National Accord as the governing body or the governing structure, and that was in 2015. But that governing structure was not endorsed fully by the parties, and that there are two competing factions in the East and in the West now. And, that is described in tab 1.2, sections the same, 5.1.1 to 5.1.3.\n[7] The NDP mentions that family association is not documented as a factor to probably cause danger for other family members who are not primary target \u2026 the primary target of aggression by militias or the government in Libya. But there is conflicting information about that, because there is much information in the Documentation Package that describes security zones and armed militias organizing along family clan and tribal lines. So, that would mean by association people could be targeted for violence, and that information is found in tab 9.4 of the Documentation Package, section 4.11. The National Documentation Package indicates that the rest of the country, and this is outside Tripoli, Tobruk, and\u2026 what did I say? Albida, and there are other areas that are being disputed by various factions, armed militias, etc. They would be pro-Gaddafi, anti-Gaddafi, Islamic extremist groups, etc. And, there is not a government body that could offer adequate State protection for those areas in Libya. The Documentation Package indicates that Tripoli\u2019s militia groups Libya Dawn, or it\u2019s an umbrella. The group Libya Dawn was dominated by the Misrata based on (inaudible) in 2014. And, that militia included the Tripoli\u2019s\u2026 Tripoli Revolutionaries Brigade, or the TRB, and that\u2019s found in tab 1.12 section 7.6. The NDP mentions in several places the Misrata militia as the local armed forces which include\u2026 or included \u2026 The Misrata had been fighting other forces, and this would be in the Magarha and Sabha region, in 2016, and this is\u2026 so, there are some rival militias fighting against Misrata, that\u2019s 4.15 pages 20 to 21.\n[8] There are other mentions of Misrata fighting other rival militias. In any case, the National Documentation Package\u2026 because the two government that are functioning, and because there\u2019s much maneuvering by the various militias to control territory, being associated with one or the other militias would put someone at risk, necessarily being identified as an opponent to the other militias. So, the claimants, I understand in their situation, their relationship with their brother would be by association, associated with Misrata militia and they would face trouble and would be targeted by the militias which are opposing Misrata.\nSTATE PROTECTION\n[9] I find there is clear and convincing evidence that the State, as we understand it, Libya is unable or unwilling to provide adequate protection for the claimants in their particular circumstances, partly because part of the State may actually be against the Misrata militias, for example the government in the East. And the other reason is that, even the government in the West, the National Documentation Package shows (inaudible) I already stated. And, also mentions that the government in the West that\u2019s been sanctioned by the UN to\u2026 sanctioned by the UN meaning that they have the approval of the UN, they have delegated their security duties to various militias in the area that are allied with the government in the East\u2026 or in the West rather, in Tripoli. So, consequently, the State has not shown their capacity or willingness to protect the claimants, and they would not\u2026 the State would not be able to protect the claimants if they were to go in other areas in Libya.\nINTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE\n[10] On the evidence, I find that there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout Libya for the claimants for the same reasons I\u2019ve already stated above, general lack of security, lack of State control of certain territory, and the inability to protect the claimants.\nCONCLUSION\n[11] I conclude that you are \u201cConvention refugees\u201d and I accept your claim. Thank you.\n",

        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2019 RLLR 78\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: November 6, 2019\n\nPanel: Chad Prowse\nCountry: Democratic Republic of Congo\nRPD Number: VB8-05510\nATIP Number: A-2020-01274\nATIP Pages: 000250-000254\n\u2014 DECISION AND REASONS BY THE MEMBER\n[1] PRESIDING MEMBER: Mr. [XXX] I\u2019ve considered your testimony and the other evidence in your case and I\u2019m ready to render my decision orally. I would like to add that in the event that written reasons are issued they will reflect those that I\u2019m giving you now.\n[2] Mr. [XXX], the claimant, is a citizen of Democratic Republic of Congo, hereafter referred to as DRC who claims refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[3] The claimant alleges the following in his Basis of Claim form and narrative: that he belongs to the Banyamulenge Tutsi ethnic group. His refugee claim is based on his fear of persecution at the hands of various militia groups, government authorities and other Congolese tribes who consider the Banyamulenge community as foreigners in the DRC.\n[4] The claimant states that he has suffered a great deal in his country on the basis of his membership in this ethnic group. He says that he cannot count how many times he has walked in fear, been tortured, attended funerals of innocent Banyamulenge who are massacred including his own family members, relatives, friends and neighbours, all from this community.\n[5] He alleges that violence against his ethnic group is country-wide in Congo and has intensified after the recent elections due to the fact that the current government campaigned on the promise of uprooting foreigners and leaving Congo to the Congolese.\n[6] He refers to a few recent incidents of personal persecution leading to his departure from the country. In [XXX] 2017 he alleges that he was captured by rebels and tortured along with some of his workers. One of his workers died and [XXX] of his cows were stolen.\n[7] In [XXX] 2018 Mai-Mai militias escalated their attacks on Banyamulenge villages. At this time he was in Goma to purchase salt and medication for his cows. His farm was attacked and one worker was killed. He went to the police in Goma to report the incident but while there he was thrown into a police cell, tortured and had to bribe the guards to be released.\n[8] Recently while he was in Canada he learned that his farm was attacked again by militias, cows were taken and another worker was killed.\n[9] The claimant departed the DRC on the [XXX] 2018, transiting [XXX] on a Canadian visa that he had previously obtained.\n[10] The determinative issue in this case is credibility. The claimant\u2019s identity as a citizen of DRC is established by his testimony and the supporting documentation filed, including a certified true copy of his passport.\n[11] When a claimant swears to the truth of certain allegations, this creates a presumption that those allegations are true unless there is reason to doubt their truthfulness.\n[12] I found the claimant to be a credible witness. He testified in straightforward manner and there were no relevant inconsistencies or omissions in his testimony or contradictions between his testimony and other evidence before me that have not been explained.\n[13] The claimant called his grandson [XXX] (ph) as a witness who was able to corroborate his allegations.\n[14] The claimant also supported this claim with adequate personal documentation including his passport and the GCMS notes pertaining to his visa application which support his tesetiony that he is from the tradition location of the Banyamulenge community in south Kivu.\n[15] On a balance of probabilities I find that the claimant has established that he is a member of the Banyamulenge Tutsi ethnic group from the province of South Kivu and that he was targeted, threatened, harmed by militia and\/or other criminal armed groups on the basis of Convention grounds.\n[16] The available country evidence in the NDP establishes that there is an objective basis for the claimant\u2019s fear of persecution. According to the Response to Information Request RIR COD 105 270 on the treatment of Banyamulenge, the Banyamulenge community in the narrow sense of the term is located in South Kivu; however, the term Banyamulenge is also used broadly to designate the Tutsi or other people of Rwandan origin in the DRC.\n[17] On a balance of probabilities the claimant is a member of the Banyamulenge located in South Kivu. The country documents establish that the Banyamulenge face some discrimination and mistreatment throughout DRC and that they are victims of ethnically motivated conflict in South Kivu and other areas at the hands of a wide variety of non-state and state actors.\n[18] According to the RIR the Banyamulenge are considered by many Congolese as recent immigrants with no rightful claim to Congolese citizenship. Anti-Tutsi ideology is still present in the DRC and some Congolese call for the return home of all Rwandan groups.\n[19] As the claimant himself expressed, his father and his father\u2019s father and perhaps beyond that have all been born and raised in DRC. The document titled It\u2019s not all about the land: Land disputes and conflict of the Eastern Congo explains the nexus of land, identity and conflict in South Kivu and other areas of DRC. According to this document, the most visible land-related conflicts in the Eastern Congo which have contributed to large-scale violence are those that have pitted ethnic communities against each other. Land, identity and conflict are often directly connected with competition for land undermining ethnic co-habitation leading to large scales violence.\n[20] The dramatic and long-term impact of such intercommunity struggles is illustrated by the case of Calais (ph) South Kivu. Here tensions are mainly the result of the expected return of Tutsi communities to their lands on Calais\u2019 high plateau mountain range. These communities left the region in 1994 as a result of attacks from Hutu armed groups that were related to spill-over effects of the Rwandan genocide.\n[21] Prior to their departure, Tutsi communities made arrangements about their concessions, either selling the land or leaving it custodians or guardians. At present, however, much of this land is occupied by Hutu farmers who fear the loss of their livelihood options in case the original Tutsi land owners return. In this case land disputes have revived long-standing animosities and contribute to the enduring presence of armed groups.\n[22] While community leaders use these armed groups to ensure and protect their access to land, the persistence of these groups is also connected to land-grabbing by politico-economic elites, which further reduces the livelihood options of Hutu farmers.\n[23] The ethnically motivated violence towards Banyamulenge is well-documented in the NDP with sources referring to the death and displacement of members of these communities over the years.\n[24] United State Department of State report for 2018 reports that conflicts continued in parts of eastern DRC, particularly in the provinces of North Kivu, South Kivu, Tanganyika, lturi, Uele, and provinces in the Kasai (ph) region. Foreign rebels and militia groups, RMGs, such as the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda, the Allied Democratic Forces National Army for the Liberation of Uganda, the National Forces of Liberation and the Lord\u2019s Resistance Army, as well as indigenous RMGs such as various Mai-Mai local militia groups, Kamuna Nasapu (ph) and the Banamura (ph) continue to perpetrate violence against civilians.\n[25] RMGs committed abused in rural areas of North Kivu, South Kivu the Kasai provinces and the former provinces of Katanga and Noriyantal (ph) including killing, raping and torturing civilians.\n[26] I find that the claimant has rebutted the presumption of state protection and that he does not have a viable internal flight alternative. United States Department of State report states that civilian authorities did not always maintain control over the security forces.\n[27] Additionally, the government took military actions against some RMGs but had limited ability to investigate abuses and bring the accused to trial. Moreover, government security forces were one of the perpetrators of abuses, including unlawful killings, disappearances and torture.\n[28] There\u2019s also evidence that the authorities have failed to intervene to protect the Banyamulenge. According to the RIR, sources state that the Congolese Army did not intervene to protect the violence against them in 2014.\n[29] Human Rights Watch also criticises members of the UN Peacekeeping Mission in the DRC who were based a few kilometres away for not intervening. Sources note however that the authorities initiated a Commission of Inquiry into the violence and two members of the armed forces were arrested.\n[30] Finally, the claimant has provided testimony that is presumed to be truthful that he was mistreated by the authorities when he attempted to seek police protection prior to his departure from the country.\n[31] I find that any IFA fails on the grounds that it would be unreasonably harsh. The claimant is an 82 year old man with medical conditions. He has no relatives outside the conflict zone. His immediate family members have disappeared in DRC. He is from a rural area where he managed two farms and worked as a [XXX]. Although there is some evidence that some Banyamulenge in Kinshasa are well integrated in political, social and economic terms, the claimant has poor prospects for establishing himself there or anywhere else in the country.\n[32] I find that he has met the high threshold for establishing that an IFA would be unreasonable.\n[33] Therefore, having considered all of the evidence before me, I determine that there is a serious possibility that the claimant would be persecuted in DRC on grounds of race or nationality. Therefore, I find that Mr. [XXX] is a Convention refugee and I accept his claim for protection.\n\u2014PROCEEDINGS CONCLUDED\n",

In 1993, her marriage to a second cousin was arranged by her family. After a couple of months, her husband, [XXX], became abusive. He would regularly humiliate push, punch, kick, pinch and beat her. He also routinely raped her. The violence would continue even while she was pregnant. When her first child was born, the principal claimant\u2019s husband was angered because it was a girl. This was repeated for her second and third daughters. Her husband was also controlling and demanded that the principal claimant cover her hair. When she did not do so, he taunted her about being a bad Muslim in front of guests until she finally relented.\n[3] Although the principal claimant\u2019s fourth child was a son, [XXX] was abusive towards him too, not to mention the other children. The principal claimant gave birth to the minor claimant nine years after her last child and when he was just one week old, she was bathing him when her husband demanded lunch. When she asked him to wait a moment, he grabbed the minor claimant by the arm and threw him on the bed and beat the principal claimant. When the minor claimant did not appear able to move his arm, [XXX] begrudgingly agreed to let the principal claimant take him to a doctor. It was determined that the baby had nerve damage. The minor claimant still has difficulty moving his arm today.\n[4] [XXX] forced the principal claimant\u2019s eldest daughter to marry a much older man when she was 20. He also started demanding that her eldest son join Hezbullah. The principal claimant and this son agreed that he would run away if his father forced him to join. The principal claimant was treated even more violently by [XXX] who insisted that she had made their son weak. She began to believe he would kill her. As a result, the principal claimant left her husband and made a complaint at the prosecutor\u2019s office in a nearby town. There, she was advised to submit a document to a police station. She decided against doing so because her husband\u2019s cousins work at that station.\n[5] The principal claimant decided her only option was to leave the country so she sought the help of her brother who lives in Canada. But, her Canadian visa application was denied. She decided to leave her husband anyway and asked for the help of a close friend who lives in a Beirut suburb. She travelled to her house and stayed there for two days without letting anyone else know about her whereabouts. The principal claimant rented a place near her friend\u2019s home which she paid for with her brother\u2019s help. She did not leave the apartment for two weeks out of fear. She then began going out a little for a month before her husband, armed with a gun, came to her door and forced her to return home where she was brutally beaten. He threatened to kill her if she tried to leave again. He even refused to allow her to see her dying grandmother and threw a knife at her to make his point.\n[6] With her brother\u2019s assistance, the principal claimant applied for another Canadian visa and included the minor claimant in the application which was accepted. With the help of her eldest daughter and son-in-law, the claimants secretly left the country. When [XXX] discovered this, he disowned his daughter and harassed the principal claimant\u2019s father. The claimants fear that if they return to Lebanon, they will face persecution and other risks from [XXX].\nDETERMINATION\n[7] I find that, pursuant to section 96 of the Act, the claimants are Convention refugees as they have a well-founded fear of persecution related to a Convention ground in Lebanon.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[8] The claimants\u2019 identities as nationals of Lebanon are established by their passports in evidence. I am satisfied of their identities by these documents.\nCredibility\n[9] At the hearing, the principal claimant gave clear, direct and succinct testimony that was natural and clearly unrehearsed. Her voice would often soften to a whisper when describing specifics of the violence, particularly in relation to the minor claimant. There were no material inconsistencies or contradictions within the claimants\u2019 evidence that were not reasonably explained or that undermined their credibility in respect of their central allegations. The claimants submitted evidence to corroborate some of their allegations. This includes statements from the principal claimant\u2019s brother, four eldest children, son-in-law and friend who all confirm [XXX] abuse and the principal claimant\u2019s efforts to leave him. Also in evidence are some doctor\u2019s notes pertaining to the claimants\u2019 injuries and the complaint to the prosecutor. These documents substantiate the abuse suffered by the claimants. The objective country condition evidence in the National Documentation Package (NDP) also verifies the prevalence of domestic violence in Lebanon and the inadequate measures to address the problem. Based on the presumption of truthfulness, the principal claimant\u2019s consistent testimony and the corroborative evidence, I accept her allegations as credible.\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution\n[10] I find that the principal claimant has a well-founded fear of persecution based on her status as a woman in Lebanon. Gender-based violence in Lebanon is tolerated, ignored and perpetuated by patriarchal structures in Lebanese society. The principal claimant endured 25 years of routine verbal, physical and sexual abuse by her husband who controlled her life. When she tried to leave him, she was discovered and further brutalized. Her husband threatened to kill her in the past and reiterated his intention when he learned she had fled to Canada. The minor claimant also suffered abuse at the hands of his father starting from infancy. This past abuse demonstrates a prospect of continued violence that can be characterized as serious, sustained and systematic human rights violations amounting to persecution. As the principal claimant\u2019s fear of persecution is based on her membership in a particular social group, her allegations form a nexus to the Convention. Since the principal claimant\u2019s allegations are grounded in the Convention, the minor claimant derives a nexus from her claim as a family member. The objective evidence corroborates the fact that gender-based violence in Lebanon is a very serious problem.\n[11] Act for Human Rights Lebanon (ALEF) reveals a grim fact about the situation for women; Lebanon ranked 137 out of 144 countries in terms of gender equality which is evident in every-day life.2 A Response to Information Request (RIR) cites an estimate that one woman a month is killed by a family member in Lebanon, usually her husband.3 It goes on to state that gender-based violence is serious and widespread and women are also victims of discrimination both in law and practice. Furthermore, women cannot depend on family to prevent violence as they rarely receive their family\u2019s support. Finally, the RIR finds that customs and beliefs have \u2018normalized\u2019 violence against women in Lebanon.\n[12] The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) maintains that under-reporting of domestic abuse remains high, as many women are afraid to speak out about violence they experience at home for fear of being blamed for the abuse, or of bringing shame on the family.4 In addition, social and family pressure, as well as lack of financial independence, compels many women to remain in abusive relationships and they are sometimes instructed to return to abusive husbands by religious courts.\n[13] The Department of State (DOS) finds that while the law in Lebanon criminalizes domestic violence, \u201cit does not specifically provide protection for women.\u201d5 Despite maximum sentencing law of 10 years in prison for battery, some religious courts may legally require a battered wife to return to her home despite physical abuse. The DOS goes on to confirm that women suffer discrimination under the law and in practice. It reports that in matters of child custody, inheritance and divorce, personal status laws provide unequal treatment across the various confessional court systems but generally discriminate against women.\n[14] The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) concludes that women in Lebanon face a \u201chigh risk of societal and official discrimination, and a high risk of societal violence.\u201d6\n[15] The evidence reveals that domestic violence in Lebanon is prevalent. Based on the past violence suffered by the claimants, the ongoing threats to harm them further and the treatment of women in Lebanon generally, I find that there is a serious possibility of persecution if the claimants return.\nState Protection\n[16] In this case, I do not find that the claimants are likely to obtain adequate state protection. The principal claimant attempted to make a complaint against her husband, but could not see it through in view of her husband\u2019s relatives who are employed by the police. I accept that this posed a reasonable barrier for her. However, the authorities will and capacity to protect women from violence is inadequate.\n[17] DFAT finds that generally, Lebanese authorities do not provide effective protection though this depends on the area concerned. Several areas in Lebanon are not under effective state control due to the presence of Hezbullah, so the authorities are largely absent there. According to the RIR in evidence, \u201cit is not mandatory for police officers, lawyers, physicians, social counsellors, colleagues in the workplace, neighbours, friends, clergymen, or any other potential witness of women subjected to family violence to report such abuse.\u201d Furthermore, the RIR states that the police often do not take the complaints from women seriously and by going to a police station, women risk being ridiculed and subjected to other forms of harassment. The OECD confirms that police are reluctant to intervene in domestic violence which is considered a taboo issue. It notes that \u201chonour crimes\u201d are rarely prosecuted and are often reported as suicides.\nInternal Flight Alternative (IFA)\n[18] I also do not find that relocation in the claimants\u2019 circumstances is reasonable. Internal relocation is \u201chighly dependent\u201d on an individual\u2019s financial constraints and connections; those with financial limitations and without connections find it difficult to relocate in Lebanon.7 I considered that the principal claimant is a middle-aged, high school graduate who has never held a job in Lebanon. Her ability to support herself and her son in another city is therefore quite limited, particularly given income inequality and other disadvantages women experience. As discussed earlier, there are areas that are not under state control which also hampers relocation. An IFA is not, therefore, viable.\nCONCLUSION\n[19] Having considered all of the evidence, I find that the claimants are Convention refugees as set out in section 96 of the Act. Their claims are therefore accepted.\n(signed) Preeti Adhopia\nSeptember 20, 2019\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n\n2 Exhibit 3, National Documentation Package (NDP), Lebanon, March 29, 2019, Item 2.8.\n\n3 Exhibit 3, NDP, Item 5.2 Response to Information Request (RIR) LBN104656.FE.\n\n4 Exhibit 3, NDP, Item 5.3.\n\n5 Exhibit 3, NDP, Item 2.1.\n\n6 Exhibit 3, NDP, Item 2.5.\n\n7 Exhibit 3, NDP, Item 2.5.\n",

        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2019 RLLR 76\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: May 24, 2019\nPanel: Nick Bower\nCounsel for the claimant(s): Ramin Joubin\nCountry: India\nRPD Number: VB8-02905\nATIP Number: A-2020-01274\nATIP Pages: 000233-000242\nREASONS FOR DECISION\nINTRODUCTION\n[1] These are the reasons for the decision in the claim of [XXX], a citizen of India who claims refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).1\n[2] In rendering my reasons, I have considered and applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guidelines on Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution.2\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] The claimant alleges that she is at risk of being killed by her husband\u2019s family to satisfy their honour.\n[4] The claimant was born in and grew up in Punjab, India. Except for her time in university, the claimant lived with her parents until she married.\n[5] She attended university at [XXX], a city [XXX] or [XXX] hours away. She stayed in [XXX] for two days a week to attend classes, and returned home for the other five days each week. While in [XXX] she lived in a [XXX] with other women. She graduated with a bachelor\u2019s degree in [XXX].\n[6] After graduation, the claimant returned to live with her parents. Her parents did not let her stay in [XXX]. She looked for work in her hometown without success. Her parents did not support the claimant looking for work elsewhere in India, and the claimant did not want to live on her own because she was afraid that she would get a bad reputation as a single woman living alone.\n[7] The claimant\u2019s family and the family of her future husband were acquainted through distant relatives. Her future husband, [XXX], contacted the claimant through Facebook in 2014 and they stayed Facebook friends until he asked her family to marry her. The claimant\u2019s family agreed, and the claimant and [XXX] were engaged in 2015.\n[8] [XXX] brother, [XXX], and sister-in-law, [XXX], lived in Canada. After the claimant confessed her anxieties about her upcoming marriage to [XXX], [XXX] passed this information to [XXX] parents. [XXX] parents were angry that the claimant was opposing her husband, and right before the formal engagement ceremony [XXX] parents called off the engagement.\n[9] [XXX] insisted on marrying the claimant, and his parents relented. The claimant and [XXX] were engaged in summer 2015, and married on [XXX], 2015. Following the marriage the claimant moved to live with [XXX].\n[10] For the first few months after they were married, [XXX] consulted with the claimant regarding decisions for the couple. He later stopped considering the claimant\u2019s opinion, and the claimant was not even allowed to choose what food to prepare for family meals.\n[11] In mid-2017 the claimant discovered that [XXX] had been abusing drugs when he suffered a [XXX]. The claimant spoke to [XXX] family about seeking treatment for him, but they did not cooperate. The claimant believes that [XXX] family, who continued to dislike the claimant, were hoping that [XXX] addiction would drive the couple apart. [XXX] did eventually go to treatment for his addiction.\n[12] [XXX] family arranged for the couple to visit [XXX] brother and sister-in-law in Canada, and the claimant and [XXX] arrived in Canada in [XXX] 2018. They stayed with [XXX] brother and sister-in-law. The sister-in-law, [XXX], was the same woman who had worked to turn [XXX] family against the claimant years before.\n[13] In Canada [XXX] continued to use drugs. [XXX] told the claimant\u2019s mother-in\u00ad law that the claimant was blaming the mother-in-law for the claimant\u2019s and [XXX] problems. The mother-in-law spoke to [XXX] about this. A few weeks after the claimant and [XXX] arrived in Canada, [XXX] confronted the claimant, and the two argued. [XXX] then assaulted the claimant, choking her.\n[14] Disagreements between the claimant and her in-laws continued. Later, on [XXX], 2018, [XXX] and [XXX] insisted that the claimant leave their home. The claimant did so the next day.\n[15] The claimant went to stay in a women\u2019s shelter. She returned to her in-laws\u2019 home a few days later in the company of police to collect the rest of her belongings. The claimant told the police about [XXX] assault on her, and the police returned to arrest [XXX].\n[16] Although there were no charges against [XXX] that proceeded to court, [XXX] parents learned that he had been arrested. Others in their community in Punjab heard about the arrest from their own relatives in Canada. The claimants\u2019 parents-in-law felt shamed that their son had been arrested, and threatened to kill the claimant once she returned from Canada. The parents-in\u00ad law made this threat to the claimant\u2019s parents, who passed the information to a family friend, who in turn passed it to the claimant.\n[17] The claimant has had no contact with her parents-in-law since she left [XXX] brother\u2019s home. She has had no contact with her own parents for several months.\n[18] The claimants\u2019 in-laws had owned a high-earning [XXX] that earned them social status in the community. Her wedding was attended by significant local figures, including actors, retired military officers, and criminals. The claimant saw some of these people visit her in-laws\u2019 home socially on other occasions.\n[19] However, after the claimant came to Canada, she learned that her in-laws had lost the [XXX], and had little liquid assets left. The claimant\u2019s sister-in-law [XXX] was working at [XXX] and other jobs, and sending money back to the claimant\u2019s parents-in-law.\n[20] The claimant alleges that her parents insist that she return to her husband, whatever the situation, because that is what is expected of a wife. She alleges that her in-laws are angry that she has shamed them by having their son arrested and seek to kill her to restore their honour.\nDETERMINATION\n[21] I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[22] I find that the claimant\u2019s identity as a citizen of India is established by her testimony and the copy of her current Indian passport including a Canadian visa.3\nCredibility\n[23] When a claimant swears to the truth of their allegations, there is a presumption that those allegations are true, unless there is reason to doubt their truthfulness.4 I cannot find a reason to doubt the truthfulness of the claimant\u2019s allegations.\n[24] The claimant\u2019s testimony was generally consistent with the other evidence before me. She testified in a responsive manner and with reasonable detail on relevant matters.\n[25] The claimant provided some corroborating documentary evidence. She has provided a name card with a file number from a constable with the [XXX] RCMP.5 Although there is no date or any further information, the card does corroborate that the claimant had some contact with the RCMP in [XXX], where she stayed with her brother-in-law and his wife.\n[26] The claimant has provided a letter from a women\u2019s shelter.6 This letter corroborates that the claimant stayed at the shelter for an extended period after being kicked out of her in-laws\u2019 home in [XXX].\n[27] The claimant has provided a transcript of a recorded telephone conversation between her mother and a friend of the claimant\u2019s that corroborates details of the claimant\u2019s testimony. Details of the conversation, including the first names and family circumstances of the subjects of the conversation, are consistent with the claimant and [XXX]. The speaker identified as the claimant\u2019s mother states that [XXX] father has threatened to kill the claimant because she filed a complaint against them, and that the claimant\u2019s mother wants nothing more to do with the claimant.\nNexus\n[28] I find that there is a nexus between the persecution alleged and the Convention ground of membership in a particular social group as a woman. The claimant alleges that she faces persecution because she is a woman, and faces harsh consequences for not behaving as expected by the community.\nWell-Founded Fear\n[29] The claimant has testified that she fears returning to India. Considering all of the evidence before me, I find on a balance of probabilities that her fear is objectively well-founded.\n[30] The claimant\u2019s father-in-law has threatened to kill the claimant because she publicly shamed the family. I find that there is a serious risk that the claimant\u2019s in-laws will carry out that threat.\n[31] The claimant has testified that her in-laws have publicly and proudly associated with high-ranking members of local criminal organizations, including at her wedding, and that her father-in-law has bragged to her of using his connections to bribe police. This demonstrates that the claimant\u2019s in-laws are willing to demonstrate in illegal activity for their own benefit.\n[32] Objective evidence states that police in India are subject to corruption and operate in an environment of \u201cwidespread impunity,\u201d corroborating the father-in-law\u2019s boasts of bribery.7\n[33] The claimant has provided photos obtained from Facebook of her father-in-law and other relatives posing proudly with a variety of firearms.8 I am satisfied that the claimant\u2019s in-laws have the means to carry out their threat to her.\n[34] The objective evidence establishes that \u2018honour\u2019 crimes against women in India remain a major issue.9 10\n[35] \u2018Honour\u2019 crimes are committed to maintain a family\u2019s or community\u2019s honour in society and are usually targeted against women. Family honour is particularly connected to women and marriage, and \u2018honour\u2019 crimes can occur because a child married against the parents\u2019 wishes. Although there are no official statistics available, \u2018honour\u2019 crimes are reported to be \u201cprevalent\u201d or \u201cwidespread\u201d in India, and are more common in northern areas, including Punjab. \u2018Honour\u2019 crimes occur in all sectors of society, among all religions, and in both urban and rural areas. \u2018Honour\u2019 crimes frequently end in the death of the victim.11\n[36] The claimant\u2019s in-laws have threatened to kill the claimant because her actions in leaving their son and involving the police have insulted their honour. Based on the evidence before me in this case, I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that there is a serious risk that the claimant faces persecution in the form of \u2018honour\u2019 killing if she were to return to India.\nState protection\n[37] I find that the claimant has rebutted the presumption of state protection.\n[38] Police in India are under-staffed, under-resourced, under-trained and overburdened. Police are subject to political pressure, and are themselves sometimes responsible for human rights abuses. Police frequently failed to respond effectively, particularly regarding crimes against women.12\n[39] Police are reluctant to accept complaints or carry out investigations regarding \u2018honour\u2019 crimes, generally only registering complaints if the complainant is influential or wealthy. Powerful perpetrators often face no real consequences. In some areas, police are sympathetic to the perpetrators and implicitly condone \u2018honour\u2019 crimes.13\n[40] Based on the evidence before me in this case, I find that the state will not provide adequate protection to the claimant.\nInternal flight alternative (IFA)\n[41] Considering all of the evidence before me, in the particular circumstances of this case, I find that it is not objectively reasonable for the claimant to relocate within India.\n[42] The threshold for an IFA to be objectively unreasonable is very high; conditions must jeopardize the life and safety of the claimant for a proposed IFA to be unreasonable.14 The onus is on the claimant to provide actual concrete evidence of conditions that would jeopardize her life and physical safety if she were to relocate, considering all of the circumstances, including those particular to her.15\n[43] The claimant has a university education; she has obtained a bachelor\u2019s degree in [XXX]. However, she has never worked outside the home, and had never lived independently before separating from her husband in Canada. Even given her education, the claimant is inexperienced and unsophisticated.\n[44] The claimant has not kept in contact with her friends from university. Her family will not support her, and she no longer has contact with her family members. She has only a few friends willing to assist her, and they are here in Canada. If the claimant were to return to India, she would be alone and without support.\n[45] Single women are stigmatized and marginalized in Indian society, and are not considered complete without a husband. Women face significant difficulties finding employment, often only able to find low-paid subsistence work in the informal sector. Women are more vulnerable to inequities in job security, pay parity, access to credit, and suitable work conditions.16\n[46] Single women have great difficulty finding housing. Single women are seen to be of poor moral character and possibly engaged in prostitution, and so landlords do not like to rent apartments, even to single women who are professionals. Landlords who do rent to single women sometimes impose rules on their tenants, including curfews, and frequently look for opportunities to evict single female tenants.17\n[47] Many women who flee domestic violence are left homeless. Homeless women are subject to constant violence, sexual assault and murder, from passers-by and even police, and lack access to essential public services.18\n[48] Women in India are subject to violence including rape and violation of their rights, which occur throughout the country systematically and with impunity, within the home and within the community at large. State actors perpetrate or condone the violence. There are few resources available to assist single women to live independently.19\n[49] As set out by the country documents, these conditions exist throughout India, including in large metropolitan cities such as Mumbai and New Delhi.\n[50] Based on all of the evidence before me in this case, including the objective documentary evidence about country conditions in India faced by single women, I find on a balance of probabilities that internal relocation is objectively unreasonable for the claimant. She would face significant and constant obstacles in finding work and shelter, and would be at constant risk of homelessness and violence. These conditions jeopardize her life and safety.\n[51] Because relocation is objectively unreasonable in all of the circumstances of this case, the claimant does not have a viable IFA.\nCONCLUSION\n[52] Based on the analysis above, I conclude that the claimant is a Convention refugee, and I accept her claim.\n(signed) Nick Bower\nMay 24, 2019\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n\n2 Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (IRB) Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 4: Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution, November 1996.\n\n3 Exhibit 1.\n\n4 Maldonado v.

The file number is VB8-00176 and today\u2019s date is [XXX], 2019.\n[2] You claim to be citizens of the Democratic Republic of Congo and you are both claiming refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and paragraph 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[3] I find that you are both Convention refugees because of your imputed political opinion. Here are my reasons.\n[4] Your detailed allegations can be found in your respective Basis of Claim forms. Here\u2019s a summary.\n[5] Your problems started in 2002 when one of your sons, who is now living in Canada, was accused of being part of the rebellion of the north. He was arrested and detained many times. You finally were able to help him leave the country and seek refugee protection in Canada.\n[6] That year you had agents going to your house, searching your house and filling your property on a regular basis. Mr. [XXX], you were brought for questioning by the authorities and each time you had to bribe them in order to be released. Mr. [XXX], in 2005 you were accused of being a member of the Bundi dia Kongo movement and you were arrested and detained by the government authorities on many occasions. You were also the victim of intimidation by agents of the military intelligence service of the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n[7] You continued being harassed until 2010 but things were not as bad as in 2005. After the presidential elections of 2011 you felt that things had improved. The police no longer came to your house and there was no harassment.\n[8] You visited your children in Canada in the [XXX] of 2011 and returned to the Democratic Republic of Congo in [XXX] 2011. At the airport in Kinshasa you were set aside and questioned about your visit in Canada. All of the gifts and new clothes you were bringing back were seized by the authorities.\n[9] In [XXX] 2012 a government agent visited you at your house and questioned you about the purpose of your recent trip to Canada. You were asked to once again present yourself to the military intelligence office the next day, which you did. You were questioned once again and released at the end of the day. You were once again questioned by the same man in [XXX] 2012.\n[10] You arrived in Canada on [XXX], 2012, with a super visa. At that time, despite the past issues you had with the Congolese authorities you were not planning to claim refugee protection. From 2012 until 2017 you considered claiming refugee protection but you were hoping things would get better in your country.\n[11] On [XXX], 2017 you were informed by Mr. [XXX]\u2019 s sister that a summons was left at your house in Kinshasa. Another summons was served three days later. In addition, you found out that a national search warrant was issued on July 10, 2017 for Mr. [XXX].\n[12] Even though you love your country where you still have properties and friends, you both finally decided you claim refugee protection the end of 2017.\n[13] I find that your identity as nationals of the Democratic Republic of Congo has been established by your testimony and the documentation filed including your passports at Exhibit 1.\n[14] Both of you testified at the hearing. I find that you were both credible and I therefore believe what you have alleged in support of your claims. You both testified in a direct, straightforward and spontaneous manner and there were no material contradictions or inconsistencies between your testimony and the rest of the evidence before.\n[15] You also did not embellish your evidence even when you had the chance to do so. For example, when I asked you if you had received another summons since [XXX] of 2017, you testified that you had not. Or, when I asked you if you were involved in any political parties you testified that you had not. Again, I asked you what your political opinion was and you simply stated that you were for the alternates of the president.\n[16] In addition, you provided documents that corroborate your allegations, including a copy of the avis de recherche and the summons, both in Exhibit 3, which state that Mr. [XXX] is wanted for national security reasons.\n[17] Your son, [XXX], also testified at the hearing about why he had to flee the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2002 and claim refugee protection in Canada. I too find him credible. He testified in a direct and straightforward manner and corroborated your evidence. He explained in detail the reason by he had to leave the country and why, even with the election of a new president, he is still afraid of going back to the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n[18] I find that you have both established that you have a well-founded fear of persecution because of your imputed political opinion.\n[19] I find that you have both established, on a balance of probabilities, that you are seen by the authorities of the Democratic Republic of Congo as political opponents because of your son who was accused of being a rebel in 2002 and because the authorities believe that you were or you are a member of the Bundi dia Kongo movement a religious and opposition political party.\n[20] You testified that throughout the years you have been harassed, arrested and interrogated multiple times by the authorities. While things got a bit better after 2010, you testified that you were again arrested and interrogated upon your return from Canada in [XXX] of 2011 at the airport as well as in early [XXX] 2012 and [XXX] of 2012.\n[21] I find that you have established a subjective fear despite having returned to the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2011 and despite the delay in claiming while in Canada.\n[22] First, I note that you had valid legal status in Canada during your entire stay. In addition, you testified that even though you considered claiming refugee protection back in 2011 and 2012 and in the following years, you were hoping to eventually be able to return to Democratic Republic of Congo.\n[23] Most importantly, you testified that you finally decided to claim refugee protection after receiving the summons and the search warrant in [XXX] of 2017. At that point, you were really afraid that your life was in danger.\n[24] I accept your explanations that I find reasonable.\n[25] The country documentation on the Democratic Republic of Congo provides the objective basis for your claims. It clearly indicates that people opposing the regime in power or seen as opposing the regime have been arbitrarily arrested, detained, kidnapped, tortured or even killed. There\u2019s ample evidence that anyone opposing or seen as opposing the regime is a target.\n[26] For example, I\u2019d like to refer to item 2.1 of the National Documentation Package and I read from page 10:\n\u201cThroughout the year security forces regularly held protestors and civil society activists incommunicado and without charge for extended periods. For example, on June 15, state agents arrested opposition Union For Democracy and Social Progress Youth League president David Mukeba in Kisangani for raising concerns about the country\u2019s voter registration. The ANR allegedly held Mukeba incommunicado until August 31, when he was released.\nOn July 31, the SSF arbitrarily arrested at least 131 civil society activists and civilians following nationwide protests. While most were released within two days, five individuals who attempted to deliver a letter to the local CENI office in Lubumbashi were prosecuted. In August a court convicted four of the activists for disturbing the peace and sentenced them to eight months in prison. In November a court convicted the fifth activist, Timothee Mbuya, of provocation and incitation of disobedience and sentenced him to 12 months in prison.\u201d\n[27] As another example, I\u2019d like to refer to item 2.2 of the National Documentation Package and I read from page 2:\n\u201cAuthorities continued to ban and repress public dissent and peaceful assemblies organized by civil society organizations and the opposition, especially protests concerning the political crisis and elections. Opposition peaceful protesters were intimidated, harassed and arrested by security forces; government supporters demonstrations took place without interference from the authorities.\u201d\n[28] With respect to the treatment of the Bundi dia Kongo followers, I\u2019d like to refer you to item 4.7 of the National Documentation Package\n\u201cADIAC indicates that BDK followers are on the radar of the Congolese authorities and that they are being sought by the security services, forcing some to live in hiding. Similarly, the Congolese daily Le Potentiel reports that BDK\/BDM followers are mistreated by security services, including arbitrary arrest and torture. The same source states that this is the situation in Kinshasa and in the Congo Central province.\u201d\n[29] I also find that your risk of persecution would be increased if you were to return to Congo as failed asylum seekers, especially given that you have made a claim against the authorities of the Democratic Republic of Congo and I\u2019d like to refer to item 14.3 of the National Documentation Package which states that there is reports to instruct security chiefs to track down and arrest opponents of the government including members of the main opposition party and that they could use torture with discretion upon their return to the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n[30] Finally, I know that even though a new president was elected recently, I have no evidence before me that things have changed for the better in Democratic Republic of Congo. To the contrary, it appears that the election results are now being contested.\n[31] According to the articles found in Exhibit 5 many suspect that Kabila made a deal with the new president Tshisekide. In addition, according to your testimony, many of the people who worked under Kabila remain in place and the article in Exhibit 5 confirms this, stating for example, at page 5 that most of the security establishment remain loyal to Kabila.\n[32] Therefore, should you return to Democratic Republic of Congo I find that there is a serious possibility that you would be persecuted because of your imputed political opinion.\n[33] I find that you have rebutted the presumption of state protection since the agents of harm in this case is the government and the security forces in the Democratic Republic of Congo, it is clear that state protection would not be reasonably forthcoming.\n[34] Finally, I have assessed whether or not there is a viable internal flight alternative available to you in Democratic Republic of Congo.\n[35] Since the state authorities are the agent of persecution and since they control the entire territory, I find that there is no viable internal flight alternative for you anywhere in the country as there would be a serious possibility of persecution throughout the country.\n[36] For the foregoing reasons, I find that you are both Convention refugees and I therefore accept your claims.\n[37] Thank you and end of the decision.\n\u2014PROCEEDINGS CONCLUDED\n",

        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2019 RLLR 74\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: January 8, 2019\nPanel: S. Shaw\nCounsel for the claimant(s): Kieran Verboven\nCountry: El Salvador\nRPD Number: VB7-06918\nATIP Number: A-2020-01274\nATIP Pages: 000221-000226\n[1] PRESIDING MEMBER: So [XXX], [XXX] and [XXX] you claim to be citizens of El Salvador.\n[2] You claim refugee protection pursuant to Sections 96 and 97 [1] of Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[3] The Claimants\u2019 Basis of Claim form allegations found in Exhibit 2. The Principal Claimant, [XXX] is a citizen of El Salvador. Born on [XXX], 1981. The Principal Claimant\u2019s wife, the Associate Claimant, [XXX] is a citizen of El Salvador. Born on [XXX], 1984. The Principal Claimant and the Associate Claimant\u2019s daughter is the minor Claimant. [XXX]. She\u2019s born on [XXX], 2016.\n[4] The Claimants face a risk to their lives from MS13 because originally the Principal Claimant sent them to jail and then confronted them later. It began on [XXX], 2017 when the Principal Claimant was attacked by three gang members for no reason. In the city [XXX] in Antigua Cuscatlan C-U-S-C-A-T-L-A-N. The gang members had asked for money and then they said they were going to harm the Associate Claimant. And three of them began to attack the Principal Claimant. He was lynched and thrown into the street and run over by\u2014 twice by a car, which fractured his [XXX] and his right [XXX]. He would have died but he was assisted by security employees who helped him before the police arrived. The gang members \u2014 two of the gang members were captured of the three. Due to the attack the Principal Claimant spent more than [XXX] months in hospital recuperating. The legal matter against the gang members was botched by the general prosecutor of the Republic and also by the judge. The judge admitted evidence that wasn\u2019t valid. The criminal offences kept changing which would benefit the gang members. The judge granted them alternative measures to provision of detention, and so forth.\n[5] All this led to the gang members learning that where the Claimant\u2019s family lived. They kept searching for the Claimant\u2014 for the Principal Claimant trying to intimidate him and trying to force him to withdraw his lawsuit and trying to locate him even while he was hospitalized. After he left the hospital, [XXX] 2007, relatives of the gang members came to the Principal Claimant\u2019s home to tell him that if he didn\u2019t drop the charges they would kill the Principal Claimant. Ultimately he had to reconcile with the gang members and they reached an agreement so that they would not kill him. The gang members also told him that he would need to leave the zone or else they would kill him.\n[6] The Claimant\u2014 Principal Claimant went to the general prosecutor to get protection measures but all he negotiated with the gang was to get them to give him $1500 each from each of them to facilitate his departure from the area and to prevent the killing of the Principal Claimant. The Associate Claimant was also at risk because she was a witness to the events.\n[7] The Claimants started moving and went back to their studies. Each of them studied [XXX]. The Principal Claimant became a [XXX] to the [XXX]\u2019s office in San Salvador since mid 2012. The Principal Claimant would observe the gang members would come to [XXX]\u2019 s office asking for him. This made him afraid to show the problems he had with the gang. The Principal Claimant decided to transfer to another department to avoid the risk. The Principal\n[8] Claimant was then appointed by the [XXX] to [XXX]. He had to negotiate with companies that are under the control of the gangs. The Principal Claimant gave up that work in XXXX 2015 for his safety. He there after decided to open his [XXX]\u2014 his own [XXX]. He was asked by a particular bank to carry out a [XXX] of five cases which had been stagnate for years and they haven\u2019t been able to recover properties. The Principal Claimant was able to find owners of one property in the United States. He learned that the house that he was getting information about was filled with gang members and that\u2019s why the MS had decided to keep that house. The family had fled El Salvador for the United States to avoid being killed. The Principal Claimant was able to negotiate the return of the house to the bank. Where the Principal Claimant would be the [XXX] and be able to authorize this transaction.\n[9] The Principal Claimant learned in [XXX] 2016 that the men who were living inside the house were the men who had attacked him in 2007 in the initial transaction he had with the gang. This was in [XXX] 2017. The gang insisted that the Principal Claimant negotiate this transaction. In [XXX] 2017, gang members approached the Principal Claimant and told him that his luck would be over unless he returned that house to the Maras (ph.), to the MS. They knew all the details about his parents and they threatened his life.\n[10] On [XXX] while the Principal Claimant was in a car with his wife and daughter, two persons followed them on a motorcycle. They intercepted the car and they took out a 9mm black weapon out of a bag. The Claimant hid in different hotels and left the country eventually getting to Canada to claim for refugee protection.\nDETERMINATION\n[11] I find that the Claimants are persons in need of protection. In that the removal to El Salvador will subject them personally to a risk to their lives for the following reasons.\nANALYSIS\n[12] The Claimants\u2019 identities as nationals of El Salvador are established by their testimony and the supporting documentation filed, namely their passports found in Exhibit 1. I have found the Claimants to be credible witnesses. They did not exaggerate about the amount of information they are aware of, about their situation since they came to Canada. Moreover the Claimants corroborated every allegation contained in their Basis of Claim forms with the 257 pages of supporting documentation found in Exhibit 4. These include their [XXX], the legal documents about the initial incident where in the Principal Claimant was run over by cars, they arrested the men and evidence that the Claimant was in the hospital, the detentions of the gang members for five months, the conditional suspension procedure, the judicial errors in this case, evidence that the Claimant fled and was hiding in different houses and suffering from [XXX] and [XXX], witness to the events of 2007, evidence about the motorcycle incident, that the Claimants were constantly fleeing and hiding in houses, medical evidence from the hospital, confirmation the Principal Claimant worked at the various locations and doing the work that he said he was doing, including that he recovered debts and so forth.\n[13] The Claimants\u2019 testified today that the parents of the Principal Claimant are still in hiding and never go outside. They are currently living in Santa Ana. And even here in last May 2018 gang members were asking neighbours of the Claimant\u2019s parents where the Claimants were. There\u2019s evidence that the gangs are still searching for the Claimants to this day.\n[14] I have considered\u2014 and so I thus find that\u2014 I have considered whether the Claimants\u2019 are Convention refugees. For the Claimants to be Convention refuges their fear of persecution must be by reason of one five grounds enumerated in the Convention refugee definition. I find that the Claimants\u2019 fear of persecution is criminality and criminality is not a Convention ground. I therefore find that the Claimants\u2019 are not Convention refugees.\n[15] The Claimants alleged that if they return to El Salvador they will be subjected to a risk to their lives by the MS13. I find that on a Balance of Probabilities that they have established this. The gang has been after the Claimant since 2007. First in connection to the Claimant\u2019s having the gang members incarcerated and for not dropping charges against them with regard to the aggravated assaulted perpetrated against the Principal Claimant. The gang members have been asking for the Claimant since mid-2012 again when he was working for [XXX]\u2019s office. In this job he made more enemies with the MS by evicting them from the market which had been a stronghold of the MS gang. So the MS gang only, by this point in 2012, had increased interest in the Claimant than in the originally in 2017. And after the Principal Claimant decided to leave this job out of fear of the gangs, his next position put him back in front of the gang again for trying to evict them from their headquarters, the house that got re-deeded back to the bank. The Principal Claimant was told in [XXX] 2017 that he was a dead man. They threatened the Claimants on [XXX] and took out a gun on their car which had all of the Claimants in it. Even when the Claimants were hiding they were found over and over again. I thus find that on a Balance of Probabilities all of the Claimants are at risk of harm pursuant to Section 97.\n[16] National Documentation Package item 7.2 and 7.3 of the National Documentation Package dated September 28\u2014 September 28, 2018 indicates that El Salvador has become the most violent in the world that is not in active warfare. There are approximately 18 murders a day. A 70 per cent increase compared to the previous year. Making El Salvador the highest murder rate for any country in the world in almost 20 years.\n[17] Item 7.2 of the National Documentation Package indicates that these numbers do not include the unreported murders or the hundreds or more disappearance cases. Gang related violence is the proximate and cause for many individuals and families fleeing El Salvador and becoming internally displaced as the Claimants had been. At present there are approximately 300,000 El Salvadorians who are internally displaced. Gang violence in El Salvador is an immediate pre cursor to displacement. Entire families, like your own, are caught up in this violence without end. That\u2019s Exhibit 3, National Documentation Package Item 7.2.\n[18] I find that the authorities in El Salvador have consistently failed to assist individuals and prevent displacement. In your case they assisted the displacement and made a deal to get you out of town. To create your own displacement instead of protecting you. And the authorities have, moreover, have shown a difference to the plighted victims of violence and have thrown their back on their own citizens. The government officials botched the entire 2007 case against the gangs. And instead of following through on the manner, the Claimants were forced, again as I said, to leave town to protect their own lives.\n[19] The article Gang Based Violence and Internal Displacement indicates that the police, attorney general and prosecutors office discourage citizens from reporting crimes. They refuse to take denouncements or refuse to take responsibility for accepting reports of crime. Referring victims, witnesses and family members to other offices or agencies. The El Salvadorian state is unable to protect victims of crime, witnesses of crime or people who have participated in investigations or reported crime.\n[20] In many cases after having sought out the police or other government agencies, like yourselves, victims continue to suffer threats, attacks, violence and attempts on their lives. When the government representatives fail to response victims and survivors in these cases are forced to go hungry even sleep on the street, stay in deplorable conditions. In some cases, victims or family members are killed after seeking state protection. And media reports of the murder of the eye witnesses and those who testify at trial abound.\n[21] Item 7.13 and Item 2.3 Freedom of the World. There is a slowness in the state\u2019s response to the seriousness case of harassment, abuse or violence that leaves victims in danger. Including cases involving persons like yourselves. There appears as well to be a failure on behalf of the judicial branch. The judicial system in El Salvador is weak and plagued with corruption. This is what the Claimants have alleged as well. With all of this there has been a creation of impunity from criminal prosecution as you experienced. Moreover there are frequent cases in the national news of violent deaths of those who report or witness crimes. These documents indicate that there are close ties between some government representatives and organized criminal structures. In a number of cases, links between local government and the police force and the gangs operating in communities are evident. This contributes to increased threats as stated and prevents the pursuit of justice and results in further victimization of citizens and victims. See Item 7.2, 7.13, 2.3, 2.1 of the National Documentation Package.\n[22] The United States Department of State report at Item 2.1 of the National Documentation Package indicates that corruption is widespread, highlighting the weaknesses in the judiciary and security forces have contributed to a high level of impunity. According to Freedom House, Item 2.3 corruption continues to be a serious problem with few officials facing charges.\n[23] For all these reasons I find that the presumption of state protection has been rebutted. I have considered whether you face a risk throughout the country. I find that you would face\u2014 each of you face a risk to your lives on a Balance of Probabilities throughout El Salvador.\n[24] As noted in the National Documentation Package gang based violence article at Item 7.13 the MS reach extends across Central and North America. Estimates of active gang membership rang from 54,000 to 80,000 persons in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. The gangs are now present in each of El Salvador\u2019s 14 regional departments controlling entire neighbourhoods and imposing violence and fear on the population. Item 7.2 of the National Documentation Package.\n[25] The gangs are everywhere. If the Claimants were to move anywhere in El Salvador there is gang presence and their numbers are very high and they are always looking around for who is entering a neighbourhood. The Claimants cannot move anywhere in the country without their presence being learned by the gang. And for this information to be gather by the gangs. The gang presence is so large in El Salvador I find that the Claimants face a risk to their lives throughout El Salvador. There is no Internal Flight Alternative.\nCONCLUSION\n[26] For the foregoing reasons I conclude that the Claimants are persons in need of protection and I therefore accept their claims.\n[27] And that\u2019s the end of my decision and I will go off the record at this time.\n\u2014PROCEEDINGS CONCLUDED\n",

Wuebbolt\nCountry: India\nRPD Number: TB9-05340\nATIP Number: A-2020-01274\nATIP Pages: 000214-000220\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: So, I have considered your testimony and the other evidence in the case and I\u2019m ready to render my decision, orally.\n[2] I would like to add that in the event that written reasons are issued, a written form of these reasons may be edited for spelling, syntax and grammar and references to the applicable case law and documentary evidence may also be included. I also may add additional footnotes and correct any inadvertent errors.\n[3] Now, the claimant is, Mr. [XXX] and he is a 40-year-old citizen of India and is claiming refugee protection pursuant to subsections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[4] I considered this claim mainly under Section 96, since the claimant claimed persecution based on political opinion or imputed political opinion.\n[5] Now, for the reasons that will follow, I find that you are a Convention refugee, for the following reasons:\n[6] He is a resident citizen of lndia who lives in Punjab State.\n[7] He is a member of the Shiromani Akali Dal, SAD, political party.\n[8] Now, there are two Akali Dal parties in Punjab. The claimant said he was associated with the [XXX] wing, which is led by [XXX].\n[9] He said he was beaten and harassed by members of the Congress Party and also by their links with the police. He said he was detained and tortured and was asked to appear at the police station every month for an indefinite period.\n[10] The claimant is or was a [XXX] in India.\n[11] He was a member of the [XXX] wing since [XXX] 2011. He used to assist his cousin in arranging pilgrimage trips for community members in Yatra in Pakistan and he would also take part in organizing Party meetings with the help of community members.\n[12] In [XXX] 2017, a Congress Party area leader noticed him and asked him to join the Party. He refused to join.\n[13] In [XXX] 2017, he was beaten by three Congress Party members when he was convincing a group of people to attend his Party meetings.\n[14] He went to a doctor for treatment. He went to the police to report the incident but instead of helping him, the police threatened him with detention for making false accusations against Congress Party members and ordered him to leave the station.\n[15] In [XXX] 2017, he was able to convince four community members to join the Party. One of them had previously supported the Congress Party and he was also a cousin of the Congress Party leader.\n[16] In [XXX] 2017, he received a threatening phone call from a Congress Party member and on [XXX], 2018, he was picked up from home by the police and detained without charges. He was interrogated and beaten by the police and told that he had links with Sikh militants.\n[17] They questioned him about his involvement in the arrangement of [XXX] trips for pilgrims to Pakistan and the addresses of people that had assisted him in trips in the past and the people he knew in Pakistan. An officer warned that he could be threatened indefinitely on suspicion of espionage.\n[18] His uncle came and after some negotiations, was able to get him out of detention on [XXX], 2018 after paying a bribe.\n[19] However, the officer still told him he had to report every month indefinitely and he warned him not to be involved in any political activity and if he did not show up at the station, he would be tracked down and picked up from anywhere in the country and brought to the station where they would torture him to death.\n[20] Upon his release, he needed medical attention.\n[21] About a week later, the Congress leader, again, threatened him that it is a matter of time before he is beaten to death or permanently detained by authorities.\n[22] He started to make plans, had to collect substantial funds in order to leave the country. He relocated to the state of Himachal Pradesh. It\u2019s to the east of Punjab. So, he stayed there and still though, would come back to the state of Punjab to report monthly and when he would come back, he alleged that he would be slapped, manhandled and humiliated by the authorities.\n[23] His friend was able to find an agent who asked for 20 lakh rupees to make overseas travel arrangements. He made visa applications for himself and his spouse, without their daughters and he arrived in Canada on [XXX], 2018, accompanied by his spouse, who soon returned to India.\n[24] He was in status. He had status for about six months and was able to contact present Counsel and started the process of making a refugee claim before his status expired in [XXX] 2018.\n[25] He approached Immigration with his Counsel in [XXX]. The forms were finally filled out in [XXX] 2019.\n[26] Now, the claimant also alleged that he suffered severe mistreatment, both physically- he underwent beatings and harsh treatment in prison and has continued to do follow-up medical visits and he said that, because of the continuing stress and tension, also because of the mistreatment, eventually contributed to him suffering a [XXX] in 2019, for which he still being treated today.\n[27] Now, the claimant, regarding identity, he said he had lost his passport and he provided a police, Toronto Police Service report, part of Exhibit 5, that he reported the loss of his passport but I note in his Exhibit 1, there is a certified true copy of his Indian identity card from the government, issued by the government of India, with his name, [XXX] and it has his address in Punjab, [XXX] in Punjab.\n[28] The claimant spoke fluently in Punjabi. He had other identity documents. In Exhibit 5, people attesting to his identity, including a letter from a spiritual centre, from relatives. There is also copies of his work in India as a [XXX].\n[29] So, on a balance of probabilities, I conclude that the claimant is who he says he is and that he is from the Punjab.\n[30] I found the claimant to be a very credible witness and, therefore, believe what he has alleged in support of his claim. I agree with Counsel that he did not exaggerate or embellish his claim. He testified in a straightforward manner and there were no relevant inconsistencies in his testimony or contradictions between his testimony and the other evidence before me.\n[31] During the hearing, I asked for additional details and he credibly is, I find, on a balance of probabilities, a member Shiromani Akali Dal Party, the XXXX wing. He was able to identify the leader. He was able to identify members of the provincial assembly, both from the Akali Dal Party and from the, what he called, his agents of persecution, from the BJP Party.\n[32] He gave vivid details about his detention in jail at the police station in XXXX, how he was beaten, humiliated, sometimes the officers went out of their way to humiliate him and to beat him and he was kept, basically, in a state of terror for every time he would report every month and while the claimant did relocate to, as I said, the neighbouring state of, Himachal Pradesh and we\u2019ll go into that later as we discuss internal flight alternative.\n[33] So, I find that he was in effect, he was \u2013 I would not \u2013 his profile was not as a high-level Shiromani Akali Dal member, nor a low level. I think. I think he was a mid-level member who was active in his party and had good knowledge of the political situation in Punjab and credibly came to the attention of Congress Party members.\n[34] Now, in this case, given that the \u2013 in this case, in that the police were agents of persecution, I find that state protection would not be reasonably forthcoming.\n[35] Now, I find that the claimant has made a claim under Section 96, political opinion and before we get into that and the issue of IFA, I\u2019m going to just note that he had many corroborating documents in his Exhibit 5 that attest to his political involvement and the history of abuse that he alleged.\n[36] Now, before we get into documents, I should also mention, I did consider the issue of delay in making a claim but I note the claimant came with a visa, was never out of status and made arrangements with Counsel to make his refugee claim before that status had expired.\n[37] So, in any event, the delay in making a claim cannot be a sole reason for denying a claim and in this regard, I\u2019ve given him the benefit of the doubt.\n[38] In Exhibit 5, we have, attesting to his religious background, the letter from the [XXX] in Toronto.\n[39] I found a letter also from his Party in Exhibit 5 at page 2, which, on a balance of probabilities, I find genuine and it attests to his persecution he suffered in Punjab.\n[40] There is supporting affidavits from family and Party members throughout. Again, I find no inconsistencies in those.\n[41] There is plenty of documentation that he was a [XXX]. He did explain that there was a Canadian visitor\u2019s visa. He didn\u2019t know what the agent filled out, claimed he worked for the local government. But there\u2019s documents in Exhibit 5 that attest to his work in the agricultural industry as a [XXX].\n[42] There is also \u2013 and I was able to examine the originals \u2013 again, I could find no discrepancy, internal discrepancies in these documents. There is page 13 document from the [XXX] Clinic. There is another one from a hospital in \u2013 [XXX] Hospital. There is also his continuing treatment in Toronto in Etobicoke.\n[43] It states on page 15 from, Dr. [XXX], that he is, he has a [XXX] history and he has attended to his office on six times.\n[44] There is some more comprehensive consultation report on the [XXX] situation, starting at page 16. It\u2019s a consultation report that was done on [XXX], 2019. It talks about his [XXX] history, the impairment he has undergone, as well.\n[45] There is also many photos of his political and agricultural activities as a [XXX] in Punjab.\n[46] So, on a balance of probabilities, I find that he was a [XXX] and he was involved with the Party.\n[47] Now, internal flight alternative, I considered whether there was a viable internal flight alternative for you. I identified a number of areas in India, including in the neighbouring state at Himachal Pradesh.\n[48] Also, I mentioned cities such as, Mumbai and Calcutta, Delhi, also as, Hyderabad. Now, I should note that in regards to Himachal Pradesh, the ruling party of the state is his alleged agent of persecution, the Indian National Congress and I considered the other \u2013 his argument that he could be traced by his residency card or that he could be traced by the police when he\u2019d have to rent, for example, when he\u2019d have to do some requirements and procedures for tenant registration, that he could be traced that way.\n[49] However, I conclude that in regards to the first prong of the test, there is no serious possibility of persecution based on a review of the documentary evidence that, for example, in the National Documentation Package, Item 14.10, the Home Office Report on Internal Relocation, at page 6, states that:\n\u201cTracking and surveillance systems appear to be limited and there is no centralized registration system in place to enable police to check the whereabouts of inhabitants in their own state or in other states or union territories and that each state and union territory has responsibility for its own separate police force and effectiveness and conduct varies across states.\u201d\n[50] So, I find, based on a review \u2013 especially of Exhibit 14.10, there is no serious possibility of him being traced. It says that, India, for example, at page 10:\n\u201cIndia does not have a centralized registration system in place to enable police to check the whereabouts of inhabitants in their own state let alone in other states or union territories and that tracking and surveillance systems appear to be limited.\u201d\n[51] However, I have to also consider the second prong of the test and that whether it be reasonable, in all the particular circumstances, for the claimant to relocate to those IFA identified areas, such as, Calcutta or Delhi. I did not consider Himachal Pradesh because it\u2019s controlled by the Congress Party.\n[52] Now, the Federal Court has mandated the Board or the Refugee Division to consider other factors under Section 96 \u2013 I\u2019m talking about- not 97 \u2013 96 imputed political opinion or political opinion.\n[53] The Court has identified also, medical and psychological reports that provide objective evidence and that I\u2019m mandated to consider whether it would be unduly harsh to expect a claimant to move to potential IFA areas.\n[54] Now, I considered the medical evidence that was in Exhibit 5 in finding that it would not be reasonable in all his particular circumstances, the claimant\u2019s particular circumstances, to relocate to these IFA areas. The medical evidence demonstrates, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant suffered severe beatings and that it led to a series of events and, on a balance of probabilities, that led to his current medical state.\n[55] I see the claimant had to then report once to the police but at least reported five or six times. Every time he went, he underwent beatings. This had a cascading effect on his medical health.\n[56] I note that the claimant subsequently, in Canada, suffered from a [XXX] that incapacitated him to the point that at times, he could not even speak Punjabi, could not even write, although that\u2019s recovered. He was severely restricted in the use of his right hand. It severely affected his ability to work, let alone as a [XXX], but let alone work and he has now, even in the hearing, had to wear a monitor around his neck that monitor\u2019s his medical condition to detect any possible ongoing or future [XXX].\n[57] So, given the claimant\u2019s very unique medical situation, that\u2019s corroborated by at least three reports in Exhibit 5, I find, on a balance of probabilities, under Section 96 that the second prong of the test, that it would not be reasonable, in all his particular circumstances, to relocate to these IFA designated areas, given his medical condition as a [XXX] patient who is undergoing still, some after effects that could plausibly be linked to his mistreatment, harsh mistreatment, at the hands of Indian police in the state of Punjab, where he was detained, beaten and humiliated.\n[58] So, given in regards to this medical evidence, again, I\u2019ve afforded the claimant the benefit of the doubt. I find that it is, on the balance of probabilities, that based on <inaudible> medical evidence, he did suffer severely and harshly because of mistreatment, both physically, psychologically and it affected his physiology as well and that, given his situation as a [XXX] patient right now and his inability to work now it would not be reasonable, in all his particular circumstances, to relocate to the IFA designated areas.\n[59] So, I said I examined all the originals. There was no discrepancies and I will return them now to Mr. [XXX].\n[60] So, in summary then, the claimant \u2013 I considered the claimant\u2019s personal situation in deciding and determining the reasonableness of the IFA and I considered both his medical condition and his inability to earn a livelihood.\n[61] Therefore, I conclude that the claimant, Mr. [XXX], is a Convention refugee and, therefore, accept his claim.\n[62] Thank you very much.\n[63] The hearing is concluded.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

Robinson\nCounsel for the claimant(s): Pablo Andres Irribarra Valdes\nCountry: Jamaica\nRPD Number: TB8-30002\nATIP Number: A-2020-01274\nATIP Pages: 000210-000213\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: so I\u2019m going to start that again. The panel has considered your testimony and all the other evidence in this case and the panel is now ready to render our decision orally. You [XXX] claim that you are a citizen of Jamaica and are making the claim for refugee protection pursuant to Sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[2] In assessing this claim the panel considered the chair person\u2019s Guideline 9 proceedings before the IRB involving sexual orientation, gender identity and expression. You will receive an unedited transcript of this oral decision in the mail in approximately three weeks. Your counsel will also receive a copy and can answer any related questions you may have at that time.\n[3] Your claim is accepted. We find that you are a Convention refugee as you have established a well founded fear of persecution in Jamaica based on a convention ground and that is having membership in a particular social group namely as a gay male.\n[4] The details of your allegations were documented in your basis of claim form as well as your oral testimony.\n[5] In summary you fear persecution in Jamaica because of your sexual orientation as a gay man. You allege that while growing up you have been the subject of negative treatment and verbal abuse due to your perceived sexuality and famine behaviours.\n[6] During your employment with the [XXX] and as a [XXX] you were called homophobic slurs and faced hostility and ridicule for your perceived sexual orientation.\n[7] You allege that you were in a same sex relationship in Jamaica from approximately 2014 to 2017 as well as casual encounters after that relationship ended.\n[8] On one occasion visiting your mother two men yelled homophobic slurs at you for your red coloured extensions and they threatened your life after you evaded the situation. On another occasion in [XXX] 2018 you were threatened from a man in a car and a group of men on the street. You allege that there is no state protection for you or an internal flight alternative.\n[9] Your personal identity as a national of Jamaica is established based on your testimony and documents namely the certified true copy of your passport in Exhibit 1.\n[10] The panel therefore finds on a balance of probabilities that your identity and country of reference have been established.\n[11] The panel finds that there is a link between what you fear and one of the five convention grounds, specifically your membership in a particular social group that of a homosexual man.\n[12] In terms of your general credibility, overall the panel found you to be a credible witness and the panel therefore accepts what you have alleged in your oral testimony and in your basis of claim.\n[13] You have testified in a straightforward manner and there were no relevant inconsistencies in your testimony or contradictions between your testimony and the other evidence before us that were not satisfactorily explained.\n[14] The panel also notes that the allegations that you write in your basis of claim narrative and which you have testified about are supported by documentary evidence that you have provided.\n[15] The panel notes that this case is very well documented by corroborated personal documents to establish your sexual orientation as well as some of the other allegations in your claim specifically you submitted numerous letters of support from your current partner, ex partners, friends as well as social media and text correspondence between you and your close friends and partners.\n[16] You have provided copies of photographs including photographs of your employment and relationships. You have brought with you today Mr [XXX](ph) your current partner in Canada. He was a credible witness and testified with consistency in relation to your testimony to the genuineness of your relationship.\n[17] You have also brought your brother [XXX](ph) with you as a witness, although he was not required by the panel to testify.\n[18] The panel therefore finds on a balance of probabilities that you are a homosexual male. The panel believes that you have been in relationships with men in Jamaica and Canada. The panel believes that you have been subject to threats and abuse as a result of your sexual orientation. The panel believes that should you return to Jamaica you will be targeted and persecuted by the homophobic community due to your sexual orientation. The panel therefore finds that your subjective fear has been established.\n[19] The panel finds based on a review of the national documentation package that what you fear is objectively well founded. The documents show that homosexual acts between males are criminalized in Jamaica while the laws are not enforced negative attitudes and a climate of homophobia persist and is promoted through some types of Jamaican music by churches and politicians who have made negative statements towards sexual minorities.\n[20] The objective documentation supports your allegations that threats of violence and attacks against sexual minorities are frequent and widespread in Jamaica. This is also indicated in the articles provided by your counsel.\n[21] Person\u2019s in the LGBTQ community in Jamaica have been attacked and are the targets of mob violence. Therefore the panel finds that you have a well founded fear of persecution.\n[22] The panel finds that adequate state protection would not be available to you were you to seek it in Jamaica.\n[23] You have stated in your narrative and testimony that you did not seek protection because you believed the police to be against homosexuals and feared escalating the situation in your community should the police investigate the incidents where you felt threatened.\n[24] The objective indicates, the objective evidence indicates that gay men are often reluctant to report incidents for fear of their well being and fear of extortion based on their sexual identity. Sources report that police often fail to take action regarding incidents of violence directed at sexual minorities even after being reported.\n[25] The climate of hostility towards sexual minorities and documentations such that shows that Jamaica has failed to develop a legal system that is responsive to and inclusive of the rights of the LGBTQ community.\n[26] The documentation reports that the state has failed in its obligation to take appropriate measures to prevent attacks and to vigorously investigate and prosecute attackers.\n[27] In light of the objective country documentation the panel finds that you have rebutted the presumption of state protection and that adequate state protection would not be available to you in Jamaica.\n[28] The panel has also considered whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for you. The country documentation indicates that the situation for individuals in circumstances such as yours is the same throughout the country. The climate of homophobia and violence exists throughout Jamaica. The panel therefore finds that there is no viable internal flight alternative available to you.\n[29] Based on the totality of the evidence the panel finds that the claimant is a Convention refugee. Your claim is therefore accepted. This concludes the hearing today.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

He\u2019s claiming refugee protection pursuant to Sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. The details of the claimant\u2019s allegations are documented in his Basis of Claim form and in his oral testimony.\n[3] The claimant alleges he fears a risk of harm from society in general and criminal gangs in particular in El Salvador because of his sexual orientation as a gay man.\n[4] The Panel determines that the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to Section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. As he has a well-founded fear of persecution based on his membership in a particular social group.\n[5] The Panel finds that the claimant has established on a balance of probabilities his personal identity and national identity as a citizen of El Salvador through his testimony and the disclosure of the claimant\u2019s identity documents, namely his passport.\n[6] The claimant testified in a candid, straightforward manner and without embellishment. There were no discrepancies and inconsistencies, omissions or contradictions in the claimant\u2019s oral testimony and the other evidence before the Panel. The claimant readily answered all the questions without hesitation and provided further detail when asked to do so.\n[7] The claimant provided supporting documentation in the form of a denunciation to the Attorney General and support letters from family members to substantiate his allegations. No credibility concerns arose and a session of reasons arose to doubt the truthfulness of the claimant.\n[8] The Panel therefore finds on a balance of probabilities that the claimant is a credible witness.\nOBJECTIVE DOCUMENTATION\n[9] In recent years, El Salvador\u2019s government has enacted several positive measures to protect members of the LGBT community. While in office in 2010, Salvadorian President Mauricio Funes signed executive Order 56 prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation and\/or gender identity by executive branch agencies. Further, homosexuality is not criminalized in El Salvador and the country\u2019s constitution protects a person\u2019s right to life and physical integrity.\n[10] It also establishes the equality of all persons before the law. Also, El Salvador has ratified the international covenant on civil and political rights which has been interpreted to pr-, to include protection from discrimination for LGBTI people. However, even with the positive steps just noted, there are still deeply ingrained social prejudices that lead to the persistence of systematic violence carried out by State actors. In addition, the absence of processes aimed at achieving accountability plays into perpetrators\u2019 ability to act with impunity, repeating the cycle of violence and discrimination. This extends to crimes and other violence motivated by hatred or prejudice that are carried out by other members of society.\n[11] A review of the documentary evidence pertaining to the situation of sexual minorities in El Salvador shows that sexual minorities face human rights abuses, including acts of violence.\n[12] Discrimination against sexual minorities was widespread. Thus, being gay, bi-sexual, transgender and intersex communities faced risks and suffered violence and intimidation from State agents, individuals and private groups. LGBT persons have been killed due to their sexual identity. LGBT persons are some of the most vulnerable popu-, populations in El Salvador. And are discriminated against in education, health care and employment. A serious aspect of violence against sexual minorities is criminal gangs.\n[13] The documentary evidence indicates that these groups acted in an extremely violent way, usually attacking and murdering sexual minorities. The claimant testified to hav-, to having personally experienced threats and violence from members of what he believed to be a gang. Non-governmental organizations have reported that public officials, including the police, engaged in violence and discrimination against LGBTI persons. Sexual minorities were ridiculed when they applied for identification cards or reported cases of violence against LGBTI persons.\n[14] Documentary evidence indicates that all members of LGBT persons tend to remain unsolved, violence sorry, violations of human rights of LGBTI people are not investigated by the State in effective or adequate manner and perpetrators have not been punished. It\u2019s also noted that State authorities did not act with due diligence to prevent such acts of violence.\n[15] Based on the documentary evidence before me and the Panel, we find that the claimant\u2019s allegations of a risk of harm, based on a sexual orientation are supported by the objective documentary evidence.\n[16] The Panel also finds on a balance of probabilities, that adequate state protection would not be forthcom-, forthcoming on a forward-looking basis.\nINTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE\n[17] Given the lack of adequate state protection available to the claimant. And given the fact that the gangs are prevalent throughout El Salvador, the Panel finds on a balance of probabilities that the claimant would face a serious possibility of persecution anywhere in El Salvador if he were to return and attempt to live openly as a gay man.\n[18] Therefore, the Panel finds that there\u2019s no viable internal flight alternative available to the claimant.\n[19] So, in conclusion, we find that the claimant would be subject to a serious possibility of persecution should he return to El Salvador. And having considered the totality of the evidence, we find that the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to Section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[20] And therefore, accepts his claim.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

I would like to add than in the event that written reasons. You could do it at the same time. Okay? I would like to add that (inaudible) in the written reasons are issues. A written of these reasons may be edited for spelling, syntax and grammar and references to the applicable case law and documentary evidence may also be included.\n[2] The claimant, [XXX], claims to be a citizen of Bangladesh. He is claiming refugee protection pursuant to Section 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration Refugee Protection Act. In deciding their claim and have considered your testimony and the documentary evidence filed. In addition, I have considered Guideline number 9, the SOGIE Guidelines, in this particular case.\n[3] Your allegations are set out in your Basis of Claim Form in (inaudible )tive. The following is a brief summary of your allegations. You alleged that you \u2018re a bisexual man and that you work for an [XXX] that supported the LGBTQ community. You fear the authorities. A same-sex relationships are considered illegal in Bangladesh and you also fear the Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen, the JMB, that you be killed by them due to your activities in support of the LGBTQ community.\n[4] You alleged that you started working with this [XXX] in 2011 called [XXX], that you\u2019re a [XXX] for this [XXX], that you helped secret meetings for members of the LGBTQ community in houses and as a result you started to receive threatening phone calls that you believe came from the JMB. You also wrote an article in the newspaper, I believe, [XXX], as regarding [XXX], dated [XXX] of 2015. You also started subsequently to receive threatening phone calls and letters in your mail box that came from the JMB. You reported this to the police but they did not assist you. You continue to have problems with the JMB. You had to go into hide or leave actually [XXX] and go into hiding in several places before you eventually went back to Dhaka in [XXX] 2016. In subsequently, five (5) men with machetes came to your home and you were able to escape. You stayed at a friend\u2019s house and subsequently left for the United States in [XXX] 2016, and you made your way to Canada in October 17, 2018, and made a claim for refugee protection.\n[5] I find that you\u2019re a Convention refugee based on two (2) grounds. First, base on the ground of your sexual orientation as a bisexual individual and also, base on the ground of membership in a particular social group that being a former [XXX] worker for the LGBT community.\n[6] For the following reasons, your identity is established by your testimony and the supporting documentation filed found in Exhibit 1. I believe a certify copy of your passport is in Exhibit 1. I find you to be a very credible witness and therefore believe what you have alleged in support of your claim. You have testified in a straightforward manner and there were no inconsistency and your testimony and the materials before me. You did not exaggerate or embellish your claim and you have provided an extensive collaborative personal documents in Exhibit 6, 7 and 8 that support your claim, and they include quite a few letters of support from you, the police report, general diary entries. Heavy remaiance was placed on the-, all your documents showing that you work for [XXX] and also the threatening letters from the JMB and also the newspaper article that you wrote in title [XXX]. All these documents support your allegations.\n[7] The Panel did have a concern regarding the revelment and also why your failure to claim for the United States. However, the Panel has accepted your explanation in terms of the first time returning back to Bangladesh because your wife was ill and also your explanation for why you didn\u2019t claim because you couldn\u2019t afford the fees and also the fact that, entered Canada due to the changes in the United States under the Trump administration. Therefore, the Panel did not go on negativity inferences to the credibility of the claimant and accepted his explanation in that regard.\n[8] Now, as for the objective documentary evidences that appear in Exhibit 3, 5 and 6, it indicates there\u2019s a problem for the LGBTQ and the homosexual community in Bangladesh and it indicates, it is well supported that concentral say in same-sex sexual activity is illegal under Section 7377 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and that the police uses the law as a pretext to bully individu-, LGBTQ individuals as well as to limit registrations of LGBTQ organizations.\n[9] Some group social report harassment under suspicious behaviour provision of the police code and this is all in Exhibit 12.1, the DOC report, sorry, 2.1 of Exhibit 3. In Exhibit, sorry, 2.2 of Exhibit 3, the World report 2000-, it stated that, January 2018, it indicates that they\u2019re continued problems for gay rights activists and the-, it indicated that in May, the Rapid Action Battalion raided a gathering in Dhaka, arresting 28 men for homosexuality and drug possession.\n[10] In Exhibit 1 believe, that there are several documents in Exhibit 3 also indicate that various groups target the lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgender and intersex people, in the name of Islam, killing dozens of them in targeted attacks and that the police did not offer enough protection to people and also the LGBT community was reluctant to apperse the police fearing they would be charged to harass.\n[11] In a Exhibit 6.1 of Exhibit 3 is an excellent summary of the situation of the LGBTQ community. It says over the last three (3) years Bangladesh has becoming increasingly torned by violence, extremists and there are evidences pointing growing threats of extremist serment in mosques throughout Bangladesh and that routinely condemn homosexuals as heretics and they are to be punished or kill and this is echo the local social media posts condemning homosexuality and justifying these attacks. And the fear of the LGBT community was realized last year when two (2) activists were brutally murdered by attackers associate with Al-Qaeda and the revilement was slow to condemn their motives and the prime minister suggested those of challenging suicidal norms and religions, and sexuality should be considering leaving the country.\n[12] This lack of-, and they are more documents in our package supporting the problems of the LGBT community faces. So it is clear from the documentary evidence that you may face a severe problem if you return back to Bangladesh not only because of your sexual orientation but also because of your activism in to help the LGBT community.\n[13] I find that, on the balance of probabilities, there is more than a reasonable possibility of persecution if you go back to Bangladesh. I also find you rebuted the presumption of state protection as of the police are also sometimes the perpetrators and are unable to protect you. I also find that unreasonable for you to seek state protection in this case. I also find that there is no internal flight alternative for you because the situation would be the same wherever you are in Bangladesh.\n[14] Therefore, I concluded that you\u2019re a Convention refugee and I accepted your claim.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

Bonhomme\nCounsel for the claimant(s): Robin Edoh\nCountry: Jamaica\nRPD Number: TB8-24791\nATIP Number: A-2020-01274\nATIP Pages: 000199-000203\n[1] MEMBER: This is the decision for the following claimant, [XXX].\n[2] You are claiming to be a citizen of Jamaica and are claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[3] Given the nature of this claim, I have taken into consideration the Chairperson\u2019s Guidelines on women refugee claimants fearing gender related persecution.\n[4] You\u2019ll receive an unedited transcript of this oral decision in the mail in approximately three weeks.\n[5] Your counsel will also receive a copy and will answer any related questions you may have at that time.\nDetermination\n[6] Your claim is accepted.\n[7] I find that you are a Convention refugee on the grounds of your membership in a particular social group as a woman facing gender-based violence for the following reasons.\nAllegations\n[8] You allege the following.\n[9] You are a citizen of Jamaica and you are in an abusive relationship with a man in Jamaica, [XXX], from 2011 to [XXX] 2016, at which time you fled Jamaica because you were afraid.\n[10] You allege that you moved in with [XXX] in 2011 and approximately a year later he started being physically abusive to you and he was also physically abusive to your son, [XXX] (Ph.).\n[11] The one time you tried to leave him while you were in Jamaica in [XXX] 2013, he stabbed you in the [XXX] with a knife and you sustained a serious wound which left a scar.\n[12] You allege that [XXX] has continued to threaten you while you have been in Canada through your parents.\n[13] You allege if you return, [XXX] will harm you or kill you, as he has threatened.\n[14] You allege that there is no state protection for you or an internal flight alternative.\nIdentity\n[15] Your personal identity as a citizen of Jamaica has been established by your testimony and the supporting documents filed in the exhibits, namely the certified true copy of your Jamaican passport and Canadian visa.\n[16] I find that on a balance of probabilities, that identity and country of reference have been established.\nNexus\n[17] I find that there is a link between what you fear and one of the five Convention grounds, namely membership in a particular social group, as a woman facing gender-based violence, and therefore I\u2019ve only assessed your claim under section 96.\nCredibility\n[18] In terms of your general credibility, I have found you to be a credible witness and I therefore believe what you have alleged in your oral testimony and in your Basis of Claim form.\n[19] You were forthcoming and answered all questions put to you.\n[20] You gave thoughtful answers and did not embellish your evidence in your testimony.\n[21] Your evidence was consistent between your testimony and your Basis of Claim form.\n[22] You have provided letters from your mother and sister in Jamaica who had firsthand knowledge of your abusive relationship with [XXX] and who corroborated the abuse.\n[23] Your mother corroborated [XXX] continuing threats to harm you while you have been in Canada.\n[24] Although you did not provide a letter from your son, who is in Ottawa, Canada, and who also experienced abuse from [XXX], and witnessed [XXX] being abusive to you, you provided a reasonable explanation for not requesting one from him.\n[25] Although the Panel was concerned that you returned to Jamaica from Canada and the United States on three occasions, you have explained that you were fearful of increasing [XXX] anger towards you and that you were unaware of the option of making a refugee or asylum claim.\n[26] The Panel has considered your explanations in light of the Chairperson\u2019s Guidelines and in the context of your profile as a woman in a longstanding abusive relationship and finds that your explanations are adequate.\n[27] I find that you have established on a balance of probabilities that you were in an abusive relationship in Jamaica with [XXX] for nearly five years.\n[28] Although you wanted to leave him, you were unsuccessful the one time you tried and that resulted in a serious injury to yourself.\n[29] I find that he continues to be a risk to you if you were to return to Jamaica, as he has continued to threaten to harm you through your parents.\n[30] I therefore find that your subjective fear is established by your credible testimony and by your corroborating documentation and I believe what you have alleged on a balance of probabilities.\n[31] I also find, based on a review of the National Documentation Package, that your fear is objectively well founded.\n[32] The National Documentation Package indicates that domestic violence is a serious and widespread problem in Jamaica.\n[33] According to one source:\n[34] \u201cThe incidence of violence against women in general and domestic violence in particular remains high. A number of factors continue to deter women from reporting and pursuing sexual offence cases, including victims\u2019 and witnesses\u2019 fear of reprisals and retaliation and delays in the judicial process.\n[35] Cases of gender-based violence also remain underreported due to the prevalence of social and cultural norms.\n[36] Legal protections for women are poorly enforced.\n[37] There are not currently any government-funded shelters, only one shelter operated by a non\u00adgovernmental organization, and insufficient funding for police investigations or supportive services for victims.\n[38] Although there are a number of government plans and measures aimed at addressing gender\u00ad based violence, including a national strategy plan of action, there is no current information on their operational effectiveness.\u201d\n[39] I find that you haver a well-founded fear of persecution in Jamaica.\nState Protection\n[40] States are presumed to be capable of protecting their own citizens, except in situations where the state is in a state of complete breakdown.\n[41] You have testified that you did not seek police assistance as the police are unable to effectively assist women in your country and you are afraid that if the police got involved, it would make the situation worse for you.\n[42] You are aware of a woman similarly situated in Jamaica who did seek police assistance and ended up being killed.\n[42] The Panel finds that you are unable to obtain adequate state protection based on the country conditions described in the National Documentation Package.\n[43] According to one source:\n[44] \u201cThere remains some challenges, including a reported lack of understanding and insufficient training by law enforcement personnel, such as police officers and judges.\n[45] Furthermore, the delayed judicial process and fear of reprisals continue to serve as a deterrent to reporting and prosecution.\u201d\n[46] The country information is clear and convincing evidence that rebuts the presumption that adequate state protection is available to you in Jamaica.\n[47] The Panel therefore finds on a balance of probabilities that you cannot access adequate state protection in Jamaica.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[48] The Panel has also considered whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for you.\n[49] The country conditions described above exist throughout the country.\n[50] You testified that you believe Jamaica to be a small country and that XXXX would be able to find you if you returned, possibly through your work as a XXXX.\n[51] Furthermore, XXXX works as a XXXX, which means he moves about the country in the course of his work, thereby increasing the chances that he may locate you.\n[52] Based on the country conditions, the size of the country, and the agent of persecution\u2019s profile, I find that there is a serious possibility of persecution for you throughout Jamaica and therefore I find that there is no viable internal flight alternative available to you.\nConclusion\n[53] Based on the totality of the evidence, I find you to be a Convention refugee and I accept your claim.\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 DECISION CONCLUDED \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n",

        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2019 RLLR 68\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: August 8, 2019\nPanel: L. Bonhomme\nCounsel for the claimant(s): Robin Edoh\nCountry: Jamaica\nRPD Number: TB8-24644\nATIP Number: A-2020-01274\nATIP Pages: 000192-000198\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] The claimant, [XXX], is seeking refugee protection pursuant toss. 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).i\nDetermination\n[2] The panel finds the claimant to be a Convention refugee on the grounds of his membership in a particular social group, namely homosexual or bisexual males in Jamaica.\nAllegations\n[3] The details of the claimant\u2019s allegations are set out in the claimant\u2019s Basis of Claim Form (BOC).ii In short, the claimant alleges that he was rejected, called names, mistreated and threatened with death in Jamaica because he is homosexual or bisexual.\n[4] The claimant is fearful of returning to Jamaica as he fears he will be killed or seriously harmed by his own family members, the family of the mothers of his children and the community at large.\n[5] The claimant alleges that there is not adequate state protection available to him or an internal flight alternative in Jamaica.\nIdentity\n[6] The claimant\u2019s personal identity as a citizen of Jamaica has been established by the claimant\u2019s testimony and the certified true copy of his Jamaica passport and Canadian visa on file.iii\n[7] The panel finds on a balance of probabilities that the claimant is who he says he is and that the country of reference is Jamaica.\nNexus\n[8] As the panel has found that there is a nexus between what the claimant fears and one of the five convention grounds, namely membership in a particular social group, a homosexual or bisexual male, the panel has only assessed the claim under s.96 of the IRPA.\nAnalysis\n[9] The determinative issues in this claim are credibility, state protection and internal flight alternative. In making this assessment, the panel has considered all the evidence, including the oral testimony, documentary evidence entered as exhibits and counsel\u2019s submissions as well as the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9: Proceedings Before the IRB Involving Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression.iv\n[10] The claimant testified and although he was hesitant at times and had difficulty expressing himself, the claimant appeared to be nervous and was not sophisticated. The panel took into account that although the claimant had completed secondary school it was not without some struggles, he was living in the bush for the latter part of his teenage years and he has only worked as a [XXX] for the past twenty plus years.\n[11] The claimant did not embellish his answers and was frank in sharing information that was not flattering or helpful to his claim, such as when he shared that he had married a woman in Canada in order to acquire status. This marriage lasted only one month due to the claimant\u2019s inability to maintain the fa\u00e7ade which was consistent with his previous relationships with women in Jamaica. The claimant\u2019s testimony was internally consistent and he elaborated on matters only briefly summarized in the BOC.\n[12] The panel did have concerns that important details with respect to the material elements of the claim were missing from the BOC. The BOC did not contain any information about the claimant\u2019s only relationship of import with a male which occurred in his teenage years. In his testimony, the claimant described how he was friends with [XXX] in high school and they enjoyed spending lots of time together. They were also attracted to one another and engaged in sexual activity. On one (and the last) occasion, they were caught by peers being intimate in a hut during a football game. Word spread to the rest of the community and to his father. The claimant\u2019s father severely beat him and kicked him out of the house. [XXX] moved to Kingston. After that, the community continued to harm, harass and threaten the claimant as it was believed that he was homosexual. The claimant provided details of how he was treated, including the derogatory names he was called; being stoned; the crops in his field being destroyed; the windows of his home being broken; and being threatened to be set on fire with a tire. When the claimant was asked by the panel why this significant relationship and details of the ensuing treatment were omitted from his BOC, the claimant responded that he was scared to remember what he had been through. The panel accepts this explanation as the claimant appeared to be genuinely upset and affected by describing these events.\n[13] Although the claimant was unable to explain whether his sexual orientation was homosexual or bisexual, the panel does not draw any conclusions from this inability because the consequences to the claimant in Jamaica would be the same either way. The claimant convincingly described his physical attraction to men. As well, the claimant was able to convincingly describe his history of relationships with women. He explained that it was at his mother\u2019s urging that he engaged in a series of relationships with women who became pregnant in order to cover up his attraction to males and to overcome the damage to his reputation caused by being caught in the hut with [XXX]. The claimant admitted that he was not always able to have sex with the women and he usually did not have feelings for the women inevitably leading to the end of these relationships. He did admit that he was somewhat attracted to and did have some feelings for the first woman.\n[14] The claimant submitted a letter from his sister in Jamaica. This letter corroborated the claimant\u2019s allegation that he was believed by his family and the community to be homosexual. The claimant also submitted a letter confirming that he has reached out to the 519 Centre in Toronto, an organization for the LGBTQ community. The claimant testified that he was planning to participate in programming through the centre. He has connected with a male in Toronto who he is interested in but that relationship is moving slowly. The claimant was shy to share the individual\u2019s name but was able to describe how they met and their tentative communications. The claimant explained that he was scared by what had happened to him in the past.\n[15] The claimant has established on a balance of probabilities that he is a homosexual or bisexual male. The claimant has also established on a balance of probabilities that his family and community in Jamaica are aware of his sexual orientation and that he has been harmed as a result.\n[16] Given the credible testimony by the claimant on issues going to the core of the claim as well as the corroborating documentation cited above, the panel believes what the claimant has alleged in support of his claim and finds that his subjective fear of persecution on the basis of his sexual orientation is established, on a balance of probabilities.\nObjective Basis\n[17] A review of the national documentation packagev indicates that there is a climate of homophobia and violence throughout Jamaica. The documents state that homosexual acts between males are criminalized in Jamaica. While the laws are not enforced, there is a climate of hostility toward sexual minorities. Some types of Jamaican music propagate homophobia and politicians and Church leaders have made negative statements toward sexual minorities. Several sources report that sexual minorities are the target of violence in Jamaica and violence against sexual minorities is widespread and that sexual minorities may also be the targets of mob violence. Sources also report that police often fail to take action regarding incidents of violence directed at sexual minorities. In some cases, police are the perpetrators. Gay men are often reluctant to report incidents for fear of their well-being and may be extorted based on their sexual identity.\n[18] Based on the claimant\u2019s personal experiences and the documentary evidence cited above, the panel finds the claimant\u2019s fear of return to Jamaica to have an objective basis. The claimant has established a well-founded fear of persecution in Jamaica.\nState protection\n[19] States are presumed to be capable of protecting their own citizens, except in situations where the state is in a state of complete breakdown. To rebut the presumption of state protection, a claimant has to provide clear and convincing evidence of the state\u2019s inability or unwillingness to protect its citizens.\n[20] The claimant alleged and the panel believes that he did not seek police protection because the police themselves do not protect or assist homosexuals because they are homophobic like the rest of the community.\n[21] The panel finds the claimant\u2019s failure to seek state protection was reasonable given the country conditions described in the national documentation package and described above. Not only do police often fail to take action regarding incidents of violence directed at sexual minorities but in some cases, police are the perpetrators.vi\n[22] The country information is clear and convincing evidence that rebuts the presumption that adequate state protection is available to the claimant in Jamaica. The panel therefore finds on a balance of probabilities that the claimant cannot access adequate state protection in Jamaica.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[23] The panel has also considered whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for the claimant. The country conditions described above exist throughout the country.vii\n[24] The panel finds that there is a serious possibility of persecution for the claimant throughout Jamaica and therefore finds that there is no viable internal flight alternative.\nConclusion\n[25] Based on the totality of the evidence, the panel finds the claimant to be a Convention refugee and the claim is accepted.\n(signed) L.

Fainbloom\nCounsel for the claimant(s): Dariusz Wroblewski\nCountry: Colombia\nRPD Number: TB8-15262\nAssociated RPD Number(s): TB8-15317, TB8-15261\nATIP Number: A-2020-01274\nATIP Pages: 000189-000191\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: So, these are the reasons for the positive determination of the refugee claims of [XXX], her husband [XXX] and their daughters [XXX].\n[2] The claimants are citizens of Colombia and they claim refugee protection pursuant to Section 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[3] Their allegations are contained in the narrative of the principal claimant\u2019s Basis of Claim form. I\u2019m going to briefly summary those allegations.\n[4] The, the principal claimant is a [XXX]. She describes how she and her family have been affected by the civil war in Colombia. Her brother was killed in [XXX] of 2003. She met the other adult claimant and they were married in 2004. Their daughter was born in 2008. She graduated in 2011 and began to work and at the same time, she began to be involved in community work. Assisting people who have been displaced by the civil war.\n[5] So on weekends, she would work with members of the community action boards, assisting people displaced by the conflict who had come to Medellin. All was going well until her, her work came to the attention of the AGC. And on [XXX], 2017 she received a note from this organization at her home, threatening her and telling her that she must quit her work or she would pay the consequences.\n[6] After, she reported this to the appropriate authorities including her employer. On [XXX], she was threatened by a man on a, on a motorcycle. And fearing further problems, they decided to leave Medellin and they relocated to Bogot\u00e1.\n[7] However, on [XXX] in Bogot\u00e1 she was again a, a, attacked and followed. So they again relocated. The family now relocated to Cack-, C\u00facuta. I have trouble with that one. However, there again there were problems. On [XXX], the principal claimant\u2019s husband received a telephone call from someone searching, searching for them. And indicating that they knew where they were.\n[8] So, fearing for the lives the, the claimants fled Colombia and made their way to Canada and made refugee claims upon arriving.\n[9] Having considered the totality of the evidence before me, I find the claimants to be Convention refugees. find this is due to their political, an imput-, an imputed political opinion. On the part of the agents of persecution in terms of the volunteer work the principal claimant was doing. As noted in the threatening letter received, her actions are seen as a, a political view of the, the AGC\u2019s lost.\n[10] With respect to the claimants\u2019 identities as nationals of Colombia, it\u2019s established by the documents on file which include copies of their passports.\n[11] As to the credibility of the allegations, I have no concerns. Firstly, the claimants provided their evidence in a credible detailed and what appeared to be spontaneous fashion.\n[12] The responses given in an oral testimony were con-, consistent with what\u2019s been stated in written form. The claimants were appropriately emotional in describing some of the difficulties they faced in Colombia. Their allegations are consistent with country condition reports as to what might happen in Colombia if you come to the attention of the wrong people.\n[13] And I would note the presence of a number of fairly strong corroborative documents. This includes letters corroborating the principal claimant\u2019s volunteer work. The letter from the lawyer who assisted in her work and who was aware of the threatening calls she had received. There\u2019s a copy of the threatening letter itself. There are a number of supportive letters including from the principal claimant\u2019s sister who provided her and her family refuge in, in [XXX] of 2018. There\u2019s also a letter from their friend who provided the shelter for this family while they were in the other city. There\u2019s a letter from, there\u2019s a letter from the retired police officer who describes the assistance and suggestions he made to the family.\n[14] There are some references in the letters to searches that are ongoing in Colombia for people looking for the principal claimant. And there\u2019s also documents indicating how the principal claimant suffered from [XXX] as a result of, of having these threats uttered against her. Documents showing the, the, the counselling she received in Colombia and the counselling she\u2019s receiving in, in Canada as well. And finally, there are the police reports.\n[15] And so, in consideration of these documents, in consideration of the quality of the testimony, I find on the balance of probabilities the allegations to be true.\n[16] Given that I accept the allegations to be true, the co-, country condition documents before me indicate there\u2019s an objective basis to their, claimants\u2019 fear of returning to Colombia.\n[17] The documents note the existence of threats, of violence and incidents of violence against human right defenders, social leaders, educators and, and so on. People such as the claimant who are providing assistance to those who have been devastated by the civil conflict. According to a recent U.N. report, there were 163 verified killings of social leaders and human rights defenders since November 2016.\n[18] So, in light of the country condition documentation, I find there\u2019s an objective basis for their fear of returning. Given that they\u2019ve approached the author-, the appropriate authorities on a number of occasions and not received adequate protection, I find the claimants have rebutted the presumption of adequate state protection. And I also see that as a result of their movements in various parts of the countries and the fact that each time they moved, they were still targeted and harassed.\n[19] There is no viable internal flight alternative available to the claimants. And I find that if they relocated to any part of Colombia they would suffer a serious possibility of persecution.\n[20] So, for all these reasons, I conclude the claimants are Convention refugees. And I therefore accept their claims.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

Fainbloom\nCounsel for the claimant(s): Terry S Guerriero\nCountry: Colombia\nRPD Number: TB8-14474\nAssociated RPD Number(s): TB8-14483, TB8-14467\nATIP Number: A-2020-01274\nATIP Pages: 000185-000188\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: These are the reasons in the decision, the positive decision for the refugee claims of [XXX], his spouse [XXX] and [XXX]\u2019s mother [XXX].\n[2] The citizens are, the claimant\u2019s are citizens of Columbia they claim refugee protection pursuant Section 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[3] The claimant\u2019s referred jointly pursuant to Rule 55. The details of the claimant\u2019s allegations are set in their basis of claim form narratives and I\u2019m going to briefly summarize that narrative.\n[4] [XXX] the principal claimant and his partner [XXX] are a homosexual couple, active in the LGBT community in Columbia. They owned a [XXX] and lived above the business.\n[5] On [XXX] 2017 the business was targeted by homophobic graffiti. They went to the police, the policeman\u2019s responses this is what happens when you\u2019re a fagot. On [XXX] 2018 the principal claimant was accosted by a man who put a gun to his waist and told him that he did not want to see the principal claimant or his partner again or he would kill them. He said they knew where he lived. The principal claimant made a denouncement to the attorney general\u2019s office on [XXX] 2018.\n[6] On [XXX] 2018 the principal claimant and his partner were accosted by the same man. The principal claimant and his partner decided they would leave Columbia with their mother. They left on [XXX] 2018 and they are afraid to return to Columbia.\n[7] Having considered the totality of the evidence before me I find the claimant\u2019s to be Convention refugees pursuant to Section 96 of IRPA.\n[8] The nexus or connection to the definition for the two male claimants is their sexual orientation. The connection for the female claimant is her connection to her son, her connection to this family. So because of that family connection she\u2019s connected to the definition.\n[9] With respect to their identities as nationals of Columbia this is established by the documents on file which include copies of their passports.\n[10] As to the credibility of the claimant\u2019s allegations I have no concerns. At First they were provide their evidence in what I appeared to be a spontaneous, detailed fashion. The evidence they provided today in oral testimony was consistent with what\u2019s been provided in written form, their allegations are consistent with the situation for sexual minorities n Columbia and finally they\u2019ve done an admiral job of corroborating their allegations.\n[11] I\u2019ll refer to some of the documents in Exhibit 4 these would include the two denunciations made by the principal claimant on [XXX] and [XXX]. There\u2019s provided proof of their involvement with the foundation, for both male claimants also a reference in that letter to their receiving death threats. There are a number of corroborative statements made by siblings of the principal claimant as well as the employee hired by the claimant\u2019s to run the [XXX]. There\u2019s a certificate of their involvement in the LGBT community in Canada and there\u2019s also a photograph of the [XXX] and the graffiti that was put on the [XXX] in [XXX] 2017.\n[12] So in consideration of all those factors I find on the balance of probabilities their allegations to be true, given that I accept their allegations I find that there\u2019s sufficient objective evidence for me to find that they\u2019re objective, positive reasons why they should fear returning to Columbia.\n[13] The documents note that in that the mistreatment of sexual minorities in Columbia has actually worsened significantly in recent years. The documents contained in Exhibit 3 including the Item at 6.1 and 6.5 refer to LGBTI person\u2019s being subjected to acts of violence aimed at eliminating their sexual orientation and that they face sexual violence, forced displacement as well as homicide.\n[14] The document at 6.5 notes that reports of violence and discrimination against Columbia\u2019s LGBT community have been steadily increasing in recent years and notes that discrimination is prevalent throughout Columbia and society even prevalent in high level Columbian politicians.\n[15] The documents still has been particularly extreme in Caribbean coastal regions where LGBTU rights, defenders have received death threats in which they have been declared military targets by various armed groups. At in the document provided by counsel Exhibit 4 the last Item at Page 49 makes the following statement; Columbia\u2019s made no progress in stopping killing of lesbians, gay, bisexual and transgender people as new research showed more than one hundred were killed last year despite the overall fall in the murder rate.\n[16] So in consideration of those conditions I find that there\u2019s an objective basis to their fear of returning to Columbia.\n[17] I\u2019ve considered the issue of whether adequate state protection would be provided, I find in this situation it is not been provided and would not be reasonably expected to be provided should they return.\n[18] Firstly I would note the country conditions as just described the government is has not been effectively providing protection to sexual minorities that are subject to threats and violence. I would note that while the Columbian state has been putting some effort into improving state protection particularly since the peace accord with FARC the state\u2019s ability to actually provide protection is highly limited. This is partly due to lack of presence and capacity; it\u2019s partly due to issues of corruption as there\u2019s information of corruption and complicity by many local, regional authorities.\n[19] The documents also note that paramilitary groups are known to infiltrate official institutions and forge alliances with public servants. Notwithstanding these the country conditions as I\u2019ve just described the subjective experience of this couple is that they have gone to the authorities the first time they went they were insulted, when they called the authorities for assistance there was no answer and times they went to make denunciations to the attorney general\u2019s office they were not given adequate protection.\n[20] So I find that adequate protection would not be available to these claimants. I find the issue I\u2019ve considered is whether there might be a viable internal flight alternative available. I find that there would not be. I think the [XXX] the principal claimant\u2019s opinion with respect to the relocation within Columbia not being feasible is reasonable and supported by the documents before me.\n[21] The more you get into rural areas of smaller cities you\u2019re dealing with more (inaudible) prevalence of violence and threats against sexual minorities.\n[22] So I find that this couple would suffer persecution, the three claimants\u2019 would suffer persecution anywhere in the country and that therefore there is no viable internal flight alternative available to the claimants.\n[23] In consideration of the totality of the evidence before me and the factors I\u2019ve just reviewed I find the claimant\u2019s to be Convention refugees. The division therefore accepts your claims.\n[24] CLAIMANT: Thank you.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2019 RLLR 65\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: April 1, 2019\nPanel: S. Shaw\nCounsel for the claimant(s): Md Wazir Hossain\nCountry: Bangladesh\nRPD Number: TB8-14360\nATIP Number: A-2020-01274\nATIP Pages: 000180-000184\nDECISION\n[1] Member: This is the decision of the refugee protection claim made by Mr. [XXX] file number TB8-14360.\n[2] At this point the panel has considered the claimant\u2019s testimony and the other evidence in this case and is ready to render an oral decision.\n[3] The claimant is a citizen of Bangladesh and is claiming refugee protection pursuant to Section 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[4] After review the panel finds that the claimant is a Convention refugee for the following reasons. Specifically, the claimant has established a serious possibility of persecution based on a Convention ground of perceived political opinion. Regarding the other issues, specifically that of religion of a Convention ground, the panel did not consider that a key issue in this case.\n[5] The claimant\u2019s allegations are set out in the Basis of Claim Form and the amendments and further supplemented by testimony and supporting documents.\n[6] In summary, the claimant has alleged that he fears persecution at the hands of the Awami League who is the current ruling party in Bangladesh and the Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh herein called the JMB, specifically, because of his perceived political opinion of being anti-Awami League and because of religious beliefs which are different from the JMB Islamic extremist views.\n[7] The claimant alleges that he was targeted because of his social work and his business activities. The claimant is a self-employed entrepreneur and founded [XXX] organizations in Bangladesh.\n[8] He alleges that his fears began in [XXX] of 2015 when he was assaulted by Awami League members following a protest rally he organized against Awami League members which included Monir the mayor of Bhola City. Threats to the claimant continued until [XXX] of 2018.\n[9] The claimant alleges that he was assaulted in 2016 because he refused to pay money to fund the Awami League\u2019s Independence Day activities.\n[10] The Awami League visited his home and threatened him to stop protesting against Monir and the Awami League and he was again attacked in [XXX] of 2016 which led to medical treatment at the local medical clinic.\n[11] In [XXX] of 2017 the Awami League and associates demanded that the claimant sell his land to the Awami League, and in [XXX] of 2018 the JMB visited the claimant\u2019s office, ransacked it, and threatened him with death.\n[12] In [XXX] of 2018 two Islamic leaders also visited the claimant\u2019s [XXX] and assaulted his spouse and two other female employees.\n[13] Further, in [XXX] of 2018 the claimant was again attacked by Awami League members causing him to be hospitalized for [XXX] days, and on [XXX], 2018 three armed Awami League members tried to abduct the claimant and his two daughters.\n[14] This incident prompted the claimant\u2019s decision to flee Bangladesh and he left Bangladesh on [XXX], 2018, arriving in Canada [XXX], 2018, and claiming refugee protection soon after.\n[15] With regards to the analysis, the panel considered all of the evidence submitted and determined the following.\n[16] On a balance of probabilities, the claimant\u2019s identity as a citizen of Bangladesh is established by testimony and also by a certified true photocopy of his passport and the claimant\u2019s national identity card and his Bangladesh Road Transport Authority card. Both of which were submitted at the hearing as oral \u2026 as original documents at the hearing. The panel finds no reason to doubt the veracity of these documents.\n[17] With regard to credibility, testimony given under oath is presumed to be true unless there is a valid reason to doubt its truthfulness. As such, the panel has considered the claimant\u2019s testimony as a whole and find the claimant to be a credible witness and believe what he has alleged relating to the issue of his perceived political opinion.\n[18] The panel finds that the claimant\u2019s testimony was generally straightforward with regard to central elements of this case, and any inconsistencies, contradictions or omissions that were considered central to this claim was adequately explained.\n[19] Specifically, the panel asked why the claimant returned to Bangladesh prior to his final \u2026 fleeing from Bangladesh in [XXX] of 2015. Sorry, [XXX] of 2018, given that his fears began in [XXX] of 2015. The panel notes that the claimant had returned to Bangladesh prior to the [XXX] 2018 final reason when he left.\n[20] After review, the panel accepts that the claimant\u2019s final crystalizing fear did not occur until [XXX] 2018 and [XXX] 2018, and those two incidents in 2018 were the incidents that crystalized his decision to finally leave Bangladesh in fear of his safety. The panel accept this as reasonable considering the circumstances.\n[21] In addition, as previously indicated with regards to the claimant\u2019s allegations of fear of the JMB Islamic extremist group, the panel did not consider this the key issue of this claim since the claimant had not met or been threatened personally by JMB extremists, and since the JMB \u2026 or fear was related to the [XXX] that the claimant ran the panel notes that this [XXX] was closed since [XXX] of 2018 and as such, the \u2026 the panel is of the view that this group JMB did not pose a significant fear to this claimant and hence was not the key fear of this particular claim.\n[22] With regard to documentation relating to the perceived political opinion and the fear that arise from that, the claimant provided the following corroborating documents as evidence. Specifically, as noted in Exhibit 5 the claimant\u2019s tax documents and business documents, as well as hospital and doctor\u2019s letters in \u2026 and discharge summary report from the hospital. Both of which indicate and diagnose a physical assault that needed emergency attention and multiple deep lacerations that the claimant sustained.\n[23] The panel also considered the corroborating documents of a number of police complaints, general diaries, deposition, and court order, as well as an arrest warrant, and a court case filed against the claimant\u2019s perpetrators.\n[24] Therefore, after review, the panel is satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant\u2019s allegations are credible and further that the claimant has established a subjective fear of persecution if returned to Bangladesh.\n[25] With regards to the objective basis of this claim, the panel finds that this claimant\u2019s allegations are corroborated by the country conditions as noted in the National Documentation Package and counsel\u2019s disclosure package.\n[26] The panel accepts that there is an objective basis for this claim, specifically as noted in the NDP Items 1.1(0), 4.1(3), 2.1, and 1.5. These country condition documents confirm that the Awami League is currently by far the largest political force in Bangladesh after recent elections and that the Awami League has consolidated its power which has led international and domestic critics to accuse the Awami League of being authoritarian and heavy handed in its approach to any opposition or anti-government individuals that it is \u2026 that it views against the government.\n[27] Further, the NDP shows that Bangladesh authorities increasingly use harsh measures including abuse and harassment, and that the Awami League Government is increasingly using imprisonment detention without trial and show trials to silence opposition.\n[28] With regards to State protection, the panel finds that the claimant has rebutted the presumption of adequate State protection with clear and convincing evidence that adequate State protection is not available to this claimant and is not reasonably forthcoming in this case.\n[29] The panel notes the claimant\u2019s testimony that he has attempted to file complaints in the past, specifically in [XXX] of 2016 which would \u2026 sorry. Specifically, in [XXX] of 2018 but it was again refused, and also the panel notes that there is country conditions that specifically speak to the anti\u00ad corruption efforts of the international community has been weakened because of the Awami League\u2019s politicizing of law enforcement agencies and the judicial process.\n[30] In addition, Item 2.3 of the NDP also indicates that there\u2019s a concern which is on the increase about the growing interference by government in the judiciary process, and that Item 1.1(7) indicates from the United States State Department report which indicates that public has a deep distrust of police and security services which has deterred many Bangladeshis from approaching police for assistance or reporting criminal incidents.\n[31] With regards to internal flight alternative, the panel has also considered whether a viable internal flight alternative exits for this claimant. After review, the panel is satisfied that there\u2019s no viable internal flight alternative because this claimant would face a serious possibility of persecution throughout Bangladesh considering that some of the agents of persecution are the Awami League and its members which are integrally linked to the ruling government.\n[32] The panel notes that the claimant and his family did attempt to internally relocate by going and staying at their parent\u2019s home, as in the claimant\u2019s in-laws home in [XXX](sic) District which a [XXX] kilometres away from the claimant\u2019s home in Dhaka. However, the claimant was found one week later by the Awami League, and also the claimant again relocated to the [XXX] Region in [XXX] of 2018, but again was found by the Awami League, and the Gibot(ph) League.\n[33] After review and based on the profile of the agents of persecution and their affiliation with the ruling government who has control throughout the country of Bangladesh, the panel finds that this claimant would face persecution throughout the country of Bangladesh. Therefore, the panel is satisfied that there\u2019s no viable internal flight alternative available to this claimant.\n[34] In conclusion based on the totality of the evidence and the previously mentioned analysis the panel finds that the claimant has a well-founded fear of persecution based on the perceived political opinion. Therefore, this panel concludes that this claimant is a Convention refugee as defined by Section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. As such, the panel accepts this claim for refugee protection in Canada.\n[35] That is the end of the decision and its reasons.\n[36] This hearing is now concluded. That brings me to the end of the hearing. We are now off record. Thank you all for attending. Interpreter and everyone, thank you. Thank you.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2019 RLLR 64\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: March 1, 2019\nPanel: S. Shaw\nCounsel for the claimant(s): Kieran Verboven\nCountry: Bangladesh\nRPD Number: TB8-12509\nRPD Associated Number(s): TB8-12520, TB8-12546, TB8-12547\nATIP Number: A-2020-01274\nATIP Pages: 000174-000179\n[1] MEMBER: This is the decision of the refugee protection claim made by the Principal Claimant, [XXX], File Number TB8-12509; as well as the Associate Claimant [XXX], TB8-12520; and the two Minor Claimants, [XXX], File Number TB8-12546; and Minor Claimant, [XXX], TB8-12547.\n[2] The Panel has considered the testimony and other evidence provided in this case, and renders the following oral decision:\n[3] The above-mentioned Claimants are citizens of Bangladesh and are seeking refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. These four claims have been jointly heard, as they were joined pursuant to Rule 55 of the Refugee Protection Division Rules. The Principal Claimant was named as the Designated Representatives for the two Minor Claimants.\n[4] The Panel has determined that these Claimants have established a well-founded fear of persecution in Bangladesh, based on the Convention grounds of perceived political opinion, specifically, as they are employees as [XXX] and [XXX] in their country. The female Claimant, or this Principal Claimant is the [XXX] in her country, while the associate Claimant [XXX] and [XXX] and [XXX] her [XXX]. The female Claimant, as the Principal Claimant, is also a [XXX] throughout her country, and their actions are viewed as perceived anti-government because of their employment and their roles. The two Minor Claimants\u2019 persecution is based on their membership in a particular social group, specifically, as part of the adult Claimants\u2019 families.\n[5] With regard to the allegations, the details of this case are set out in the Claimants\u2019 Basis of Claim forms found in Exhibit 2, 3, 4 and 5, and were further supplemented by the adult Claimants\u2019 testimonies and supporting documentary evidence.\n[6] In summary, the Claimants fear persecution in Bangladesh at the hands of the [XXX] of the [XXX], herein called [XXX], and specifically, the [XXX] name, Mr. [XXX]. They also fear [XXX] and members of the Awami League, as well as the police. [XXX] is alleged to have strong links to the ruling Awami League Party, and [XXX] is a [XXX] with the Awami League.\n[7] The Principal Claimant alleges that she and her husband are targeted by [XXX] and [XXX] because of [XXX] in the Bangladeshi [XXX] and because [XXX] wanted her to restrict her [XXX] only to [XXX], and that he also wanted her husband to [XXX]. Therefore, their refusal to do so was seen as being anti-government, perceivably, and against the Awami League. Hence their fears are based on a perceived political opinion, as [XXX], and in the [XXX], either in [XXX] or as [XXX].\n[8] With regard to analysis, the Panel considered all of the evidence, including the oral testimony, the supporting personal documents, and the country conditions, which has been entered exhibit \u2014 as exhibits. The Panel has also considered the further allegations in detail, specifically, that the Claimants\u2019 fears occurred between [XXX] 2018 and [XXX] 2018, and started in [XXX] 2018 when [XXX] met with the adult Claimant and expressed his request that they work for him at his [XXX] \u2013 [XXX] instead of working at [XXX]. As the adult Claimants\u2019 refused this offer, they were subsequently threatened by phone calls from [XXX], a current Awami League member, and others, and also asked for money by way of extortion so that they could fund the Awami League coffers.\n[9] The main incident that led to the adult Claimants\u2019 fears occurred on [XXX], 2018 when they were returning home at night and they were attacked by four Awami League associates of [XXX]. They were pistol whipped and \u2014 with rods and questioned again as to why they refused to join the [XXX], as was asked of them by the [XXX], [XXX]. Both Claimants were hospitalized as a result of this incident and they were hospitalized for three days. The adult Claimants also indicated and testified that they did report these incidents, both the [XXX], 2018 incident, as well as the [XXX], 2018 incident. They were both reported to the police, and they filed general diaries and police complaints, but they did not have much success.\n[10] On [XXX], 2018, the Claimants relocated their family to their friend\u2019s home in [XXX], [XXX] hours away, and two weeks later, their young son, the Minor \u2014 one of the Minor Claimants was subsequently kidnapped on [XXX], 2018 while they stayed in [XXX]. He was returned the next day, on [XXX], 2018, and again, the Principal Claimant and the Associate Claimant were told not to report this incident to the police and they were again asked on the phone about why they have refused to sign the contract and join [XXX]. The adult Claimants and the Minor Claimants soon left Bangladesh on [XXX], 2018 bound for Canada.\n[11] So with regards to analysis. Firstly, the Panel is satisfied that on the balance of probabilities the Claimants\u2019 personal identities as citizens of Bangladesh has been established by testimony and supporting documents filed. Specifically, documents included the certified true copies of the Claimants\u2019 passports filed in Exhibit 1, which were seized by immigration officials. The Panel finds no reason to doubt the authenticity of these documents.\n[12] With regard to credibility, credibility is an issue to be considered in all claims before the Immigration and Refugee Board. The Claimants must establish a well-founded fear of persecution by presenting credible and trustworthy evidence. When a Claimant affirms that certain facts are true, this creates a presumption that they are true unless there is a valid reason to doubt their truthfulness.\n[13] In this case, after review, the Panel finds that the adult Claimants\u2019 oral testimonies were candid, straightforward, and credible. The Principal Claimant was tearful at times during her testimony; however, her answers were still spontaneous and in detail.\n[14] With regards to supporting documents, Exhibit 11, specifically, is a package of personal documents submitted by counsel. These corroborating documents included business license, income tax certificates, the [XXX] and [XXX] ID cards, as well as the two police complaint reports filed on [XXX], 2018 and [XXX], 2018, and hospital reports of their \u2014 and discharge certificates, all filed in Exhibit 11. There were also newspaper articles filed as part of the evidence. These cumulative documents corroborated the adult Claimants\u2019 testimonies and the BOC narratives, and on a balance of probabilities, support the core elements of the allegations.\n[15] Therefore, after review of the cumulative nature of the testimony and documentary evidence submitted, the Panel is satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the Claimants\u2019 testimonies and allegations are believable and credible. The Panel is satisfied that they would face persecution based on the previously-stated determination, that being based on a Convention ground of perceived political opinion, specifically, as they are viewed as anti-government because of their \u2014 anti\u00ad government and anti-Awami League because of their employment as [XXX] and [XXX] and [XXX] and in [XXX] in their country, as well as the two Minor Claimants\u2019 persecution being based on that of membership in a particular social group, specifically, as part of the adult Claimants\u2019 family.\n[15] The Panel is satisfied that their persecution is also because they refused to comply with [XXX]\u2019s request that they join [XXX], and \u2014 which is linked to the Awami League and the government as it tends to promote and only advertise news of the Awami League and the government.\n[16] With regard to the objective basis of this claim, the Panel finds that these Claimants\u2019 evidence as a whole is generally consistent with the objective documentary evidence and corroborated by the country conditions as noted in the National Documentation Package listed in Exhibit 6, and also, in counsel\u2019s disclosure package listed in Exhibit 8, 9, and 10. The country conditions document -\u00ad specifically demonstrates similarly situated circumstances in Items 1.10, 1.4, 1.14, and 1.9 of the National Documentation Package for this country. In particular, the evidence indicates in Items 1.4 and 1 .14 that although the Constitution provides for freedom of speech and freedom of the press, however, some critics of the government or \u2014 including journalists and publicists and publishers and social media users are subject to surveillance, arrests, harassment, and intimidation, and at times have had their media accreditation withdrawn following politically motivated allegations against them. Also, Item 1.10 of the NDP specifically speaks to the Amnesty International report that indicates bloggers, and by extension, media and television and personnel are threatened in person and they, themselves, or their family members have also received threatening phone calls at their home.\n[17] The Panel is therefore satisfied on a balance of probabilities that these Claimants\u2019 subjective fears are objectively well-founded, specifically, when assessed in the context of the country conditions. Therefore, the Panel finds that the Claimants have a well-founded fear of persecution.\n[18] With regards to state protection, in all refugee protection claims, the Panel must determine if state protection is available. In other words, the Panel must consider whether or not these particular Claimants could live safely in another part of Bangladesh. In making determination on this, the Panel considered the answers provided by the Claimants, which stated the following, and the Panel also considered the information provided in their Basis of Claim forms and the objective documentary evidence submitted and the country conditions of this country.\n[19] With regards to testimony, the Panel is satisfied that the Claimants have requested police assistance on two occasions by filing police complaints, as noted previously, and that they later returned to the police station on [XXX], 2018 to inquire about the status of their police complaint. They felt that the police were not proactive in providing answers to their complaint, but instead that the police was just passing the information along to them that they were going to look into the case but with no real avail.\n[20] With regards to the country conditions, Items 1.10, 1.17, and 1.4 \u2014 1.9 also speak to the country conditions and state protection, specifically, in that law enforcement agencies tend to be aligned with the ruling party, and political affiliation is a motive for arrest and criminal persecution, and further, that the effectiveness of the criminal justice system is undermined by poor infrastructure and endemic corruption. Item 1.17, the U.S. State Department report, notes that capacity issues, corruption, and politicization have weakened the ability of the judiciary to deliver effective justice, and that public distrust of police and security services deter many Bangladeshi\u2019s from approaching the police for assistance or to report criminal incidents. Item 1.9 speaks to a culture of police corruption that continues, and that security forces commit serious abuses with impunity and that the judiciary is subject to bribery, interference, and political pressure. And also, if a person fear is of persecution or serious harm at the hands of the state, or the ruling party, they, that person, will not be able to avail themselves of the protection of the authorities.\n[21] Therefore, based on the Claimants\u2019 personal circumstances as well as the objective country conditions documentation, the Panel finds that these Claimants have rebutted the presumption of adequate state protection. Also, the Claimants have demonstrated on a balance of probabilities that they have attempted to seek state protection; however, it was not adequately forthcoming. The Panel notes that there is clear and convincing evidence that the reasons given for lack of state protection is adequate, as the agents of persecution are affiliated with the current ruling party, and includes the Awami League and its members, who have national reach and influence throughout the country.\n[22] With regards to internal relocation, in reaching a decision the Panel must also consider whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for these Claimants, and whether they can live safely in another part of the country. To make this determination, the Panel did question the Claimants about possible cities of internal relocation, and also reviewed the country conditions in the documentary evidence submitted.\n[23] The Panel notes that on [XXX], 2018, these Claimants relocated from Dhaka to their friends\u2019 home in [XXX], approximately [XXX] kilometers away. They were, however, found one week later in [XXX] by [XXX]\u2019s associates and one of the Minor Claimants was kidnapped on [XXX], 2018 while they stayed in [XXX]. After the Minor Claimant\u2019s return, the Associate Claimant was told that she cannot hide from her persecutors and that she cannot hide within the rest of the country and that she was again asked to join the [XXX] at that time. The Claimants fled Bangladesh two days after the Minor Claimant\u2019s kidnapping.\n[24] In addition, the Panel considered the testimony of the Principal Claimant, that she is a [XXX] throughout her country, as she has been a [XXX] since 1990 and that [XXX], [XXX] throughout the entire country of Bangladesh. So the Panel accepts that if she is to relocate anywhere, she would be [XXX] within the country, which then means by extension she would be [XXX] and found by her perpetrators, and by extension, her husband\u2019s perpetrators as well. The Claimants also testified that they cannot return to Bangladesh because [XXX]\u2019s associates have come looking for them in [XXX] since their departure, and more recently, their house in Bangladesh has been seized by the Awami League.\n[25] With regards to country conditions, the Panel is satisfied that the same objective evidence reviewed prior but addressing country conditions and state protection, is also relevant to the country conditions relating to internal relocations. The Panel has considered the specific profile of these Claimants as [XXX] and [XXX], and specifically, that the Principal Claimant is [XXX], so it would be unreasonable for them to relocate to another part of Bangladesh without being found. Therefore, the Panel is satisfied that these Claimants would face persecution throughout the country of Bangladesh, and as such, the Panel accepts that no viable internal flight alternative is available to these Claimants that is safe and reasonable given their particular circumstances.\n[26] In conclusion, based on the totality of the evidence and the previously mentioned analysis, the Panel finds that these Claimants have a well-founded fear of persecution for the reasons already stated. The Claimants have established that there is a serious possibility of persecution if they returned to Bangladesh based on the previously-stated determination of perceived political opinion and membership in a particular social group. Therefore, this Panel concludes that these Claimants are Convention refugees as defined by section 96 of the Immigration and Protection \u2014 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, and as such, the Panel accepts this claim for refugee protection in Canada.\n[27] And that brings me to the end of the decision, and its reasons. This hearing is now concluded.\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 DECISION CONCLUDED \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n",

The claimant fears persecution from the public and the authorities due to the homophobic environment in Jamaica.\nDETERMINATION\n[4] The panel finds that the claimant has satisfied the burden of establishing a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground if she were to return to Jamaica.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[5] The claimant has established her identity as a national of Jamaica by her testimony and the supporting documentation filed, namely a copy of her Jamaican passport.3 The original document is in custody of Immigration, Refugees Citizenship Canada (IRCC) officials.4\nCredibility\n[6] The panel found the claimant to be a credible witness on a balance of probabilities and the panel therefore accepts what has been alleged in support of her claim. The claimant testified in a straightforward manner and there were no relevant inconsistencies in her testimony or contradictions between the testimony and the other evidence before the panel.\n[7] The claimant explained about the culture of homophobia in Jamaica, how the LGBTQ community functions in a homophobic society and how life was really difficult for her as a lesbian in Jamaica. She explained how she was treated differently in her family and how her father and siblings called her names. She stated that she received the same treatments at school and the community. She explained that while at school, students would confront her verbally and assault her physically and that she was reprimanded when she reported these assaults to the teachers in the school.\n[8] The claimant explained that she became worried after personally seeing how gay persons were treated in Jamaica and that she did not have a same-sex relationship because of her fear of being harmed in Jamaica. She stated that her mother encouraged her to date men and that she tried to date men but she could not.\n[9] The claimant explained that while at the [XXX] school, she met a [XXX] teacher (Ms [XXX]), who noticed that she always kept to herself and that she was different from other girls in the school. She stated that Ms [XXX] met her parents and advised them to allow her go to a country where she would be free to be who she really wants to be. She stated that her parents were worried about her safety even though they were not happy about her sexual orientation. The claimant explained that based on Ms. [XXX]\u2019 s advice, her mother reached out to her sister (the claimant\u2019s aunt) in Canada and she was invited to Canada by her aunt.\n[10] The claimant testified about her current relationship and she testified with the detail and emotion that one would expect in describing such a relationship. The claimant\u2019s same-sex partner provided a letter of support and also testified in person to provide evidence about their same-sex relationship and knowledge of the principal claimant\u2019s sexual orientation as a lesbian.5 The panel, on a balance of probabilities found the witness testimony to be credible.\n[11] The claimant disclosed corroborative evidence which includes a support letter from her mother, who confirmed the claimant\u2019s circumstances in Jamaica and her sexual orientation as a lesbian. She provided copies of her academic diploma, which includes her early childhood diploma from the [XXX] college in Jamaica, the school where she met Ms. [XXX]. The claimant also provided several probative pictures of herself and her current same-sex partners at community and social events including LGBT events. The claimant provided copies of text messages exchanged between the claimant and her current same-sex partner in Canada. In addition, a welcome letter of support, identification and attendance log sheet from The 519 community center was provided to the panel to support the claimant\u2019s involvement in the LGBT community in Canada.\nDelay in Claiming\n[12] The panel had some concerns regarding the principal claimant\u2019s subjective fear due to her delay in claiming in Canada. In response to her delay in claiming in Canada, the claimant stated that she applied for a visa extension and it was denied. She stated that upon denial, she went with her aunt to an agent, who advised the claimant to make a Humanitarian and Compassionate claim. She stated that she signed some papers with the agent but the agent did not process the Humanitarian and Compassionate application. The claimant further stated that she did not know that she could make a refugee application because of her sexual orientation and that she only found out about making a refugee claim when she started interacting with the LGBTQ community and she was introduced to her current representative.\n[13] The panel accepts the explanation provided by the claimant because she made efforts to remain in Canada permanently and draws no negative inference in regards to the claimant\u2019s subjective fear.\n[14] The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant is credible and the panel accepts her allegations as credible and the claimant has established her subjective fear.\nObjective Evidence\n[15] The panel also finds that the claimant\u2019s fear of harm in Jamaica because of her sexual orientation as a lesbian woman is supported by the documentary evidence.\nJamaica\n[16] The objective documentary evidence indicates that, according to sources, same-sex acts between men are criminalised in Jamaica. While sources report that same-sex acts between women are not criminalised in Jamaica, the US Department of State\u2019s Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2016 specifies:\n\u201c[t]he law prohibits \u2018acts of gross indecency\u2019 ([which are] generally interpreted as any kind of physical intimacy) between persons of the same-sex.\u201d6 Further, according to sources \u201cdespite a lack of enforcement, the existence of these laws creates a climate that sanctions violence and discrimination against sexual minorities.\u201d7\n[17] The documentary evidence speaks to the societal attitudes and discrimination in Jamaica against members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) community. According to the Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2016, homophobia is \u201cwidespread\u201d in Jamaica.8 Furthermore:\nother sources note that homophobia continues to be perpetuated by the country\u2019s music, political and religious figures and by the media. According to Human Rights First, sexual minorities \u201cface both general societal discrimination as well as discrimination in access to services, including healthcare, housing and employment.\u201d [citations omitted]9\n[18] The documentary evidence indicates that violence and harassment against sexual minorities continue to be problems in Jamaica:\nHuman Rights Watch \u2026 states that physical and sexual violence is \u201cpart of the lived reality\u201d for many members of sexual minorities and that \u201cthe level of brutality leads many to fear what could happen if their sexual orientation or gender identity is disclosed.\u201d10\n[19] Based on the claimant\u2019s testimony on her personal experiences and the documentary evidence cited above, the panel finds the claimant\u2019s fear of return to Jamaica to be objectively well founded.\nState Protection and an Internal Flight Alternative\n[20] The objective evidence supports the reasonableness of the claimant\u2019s allegations and the conclusion that state protection would not be reasonably forthcoming in this particular case. With respect to the claimant\u2019s profile as a lesbian woman, the panel finds that state protection would not be reasonably forthcoming to her.\n[21] The documentary evidence confirms that \u201ccitizens express mistrust towards the police and their effectiveness.\u201d11 Further sources indicate:\n\u201cbias based specifically on gender identity or sexual orientation directly contributes to the inadequate police response\u201d. Following interviews with LGBT persons in 2013, Human Rights Watch notes that most respondents indicated that they did not report incidents of violence to the police because they believed that police would not take any action\u2026. [W]hile individual police officers \u201cshowed sympathy\u201d and worked on cases involving sexual minorities, NGOs [non-governmental organizations] reported that \u201cthe police force, in general, did not recognize the extent and seriousness of bullying and violence directed against members of the LGBT community and failed to investigate such incidents.\u201d\n[22] The documentary evidence also indicates \u201cthat police officers have perpetrated violence against sexual minorities themselves.\u201d12 Further, according to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights:\n\u201c[p]etitioners reported abuse and discrimination against LGBTI individuals who were either ignored or laughed at when they attempted to report acts of violence, or were themselves the direct victims of police abuse, including arbitrary detention, blackmail, extortion, threats and cruel and degrading treatment.\u201d13\nHuman Rights Watch noted \u201cthat while cases of police violence appear to have decreased between 2004 and 2014, \u2018the persistence of even isolated cases is of great concern given the police\u2019s role as a source of protection. \u201c\u201814\n[23] I have considered whether there is a viable internal flight alternative for you. On the evidence before me, I find that there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout Jamaica since homophobia as per the Department of State report is widespread.15\nCONCLUSION\n[24] For the foregoing reasons the panel concludes that the claimant would face a serious possibility of persecution on the basis of her sexual orientation should she return to the Jamaica. Accordingly, the claim is accepted under Section 96 of the IRPA.\n(signed) O.

To summarize, the principal claimant alleges a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground and a risk to life or of cruel and unusual punishment or treatment in Colombia by her ex-partner [XXX].\nDESIGNATED REPRESENTATIVE\n[3] The principal claimant was appointed as the Designated Representative for her minor children. She provided a written consent letter3 from her ex-spouse to take the children to Canada.\nCHAIRPERSON\u2019S GUIDELINES\n[4] In assessing the evidence of the principal claimant, I have considered the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 4: Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution.4\nDETERMINATION\n[5] The principal claimant is a Convention refugee, as she has demonstrated a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground, as a member of a particular social group \u2013 women fearing gender-related persecution.\n[6] The minor claimants are also Convention refugees, as they have demonstrated a serious possibility of persecution on Convention ground, as members of a particular social group \u2013 family members of the principal claimant.\nANALYSIS\nCredibility\n[7] The principal claimant was a credible witness. Her testimony was consistent with the evidence in her narrative and she provided documentation which was corroborative of certain aspects of her claim. Her evidence was free from material contradictions or omissions and I find that she did not embellish her evidence.\n[8] As such, I make the following findings of fact:\na) The principal claimant met her former partner [XXX] in 2000 while working for his uncle\u2019s company called [XXX]. She became pregnant after dating him for approximately one year and they moved in together in [XXX] of 2002;\nb) [XXX] was affiliated with the Centro Democratico Party and worked on the campaign of one [XXX];\nc) After living together for a while, [XXX] became verbally abusive by making hurtful comments about the principal claimant\u2019s appearance. Once her daughter was born, the principal claimant became aware that [XXX] had other lovers and when she attempted to leave, [XXX] struck her, verbally accosted her, raped her and locked her in the apartment for three days;\nd) On the third day, [XXX] came home with roses, food and apologies. He threatened the principal claimant that he would take their daughter away from him if she should ever leave;\ne) [XXX] had asked his uncle, the couple\u2019s employer, to start paying the principal claimant\u2019s salary directly to him, as she was allegedly too irresponsible to handle the money herself. Thus, the principal claimant became totally dependent on her former partner;\nf) In 2004, after being questioned by his uncle about bruises on her face, [XXX] forbade the principal claimant from working outside the home;\ng) In 2012 the principal claimant became pregnant again, this time with a son;\nh) In [XXX] 2013, while seven months pregnant, her former spouse raped her and beat her, causing her to enter a depressed state and to develop anemia which required hospitalization;\ni) In [XXX] 2014, the principal claimant saw a psychologist who diagnosed her with [XXX] and [XXX];\nj) In [XXX] of that year she worked up the courage to file a complaint with the Family Welfare Office. [XXX] showed up to a mediation session with a party colleague who convinced the social worker that the principal claimant was delusional. [XXX] later beat the principal claimant once again;\nk) In [XXX] 2016, the principal claimant was alerted by her daughter\u2019s teacher that [XXX] was unhappy and uncommunicative. She was taken to therapy where she was diagnosed with [XXX], [XXX] and [XXX] and ordered to attend further clinical intervention;\nl) In [XXX] of 2017, [XXX] invited some of his associates over to the house for dinner. One was an unsavory youth nicknamed [XXX] made appalling comments about [XXX]\u2019 s mature appearance, and referred to her as his \u201cprincess\u201d. The youth was openly glaring at [XXX] the whole time;\nm) In [XXX] of 2017, the principal claimant found her daughter\u2019s diary while cleaning the house. In it were passages that referred to her inability to cope with the family abuse and that she would rather be dead;\nn) At the end of that month, the principal claimant went to the Court in Tulua to seek a restraining order against [XXX]. When the official heard his name, he looked mockingly at the principal claimant and told her without evidence nothing could be done;\no) On Tuesday [XXX], 2017 XXXX came home livid because he learned about the judicial complaint. When the principal claimant showed him the psychiatrist\u2019s notes about their daughter, he went crazy and began hitting the principal claimant and threatened to kill her and the doctor if she kept divulging that [XXX] has mental health issues;\np) On Saturday of that same week, [XXX] showed up with three men to the principal claimant\u2019s stepmother\u2019s home. The two ladies were alone at the time. The men flashed their firearms and began insulting them. [XXX] then bragged about his affiliation with the Los Urabe\u00f1os criminal group and that he was sent by [XXX] to tell her she had 24 hours to return home or die, and if she disappeared, [XXX] promised him \u201cher princess\u201d as a present;\nq) The principal claimant\u2019s stepmother managed to record some of the conversation on her phone. The principal claimant then phoned [XXX] and threatened to expose him and his ties to the Urabe\u00f1os if he did not leave her and her daughter alone;\nr) On [XXX], 2017 the principal claimant called [XXX] and told him to provide her with a consent letter via post to her parents\u2019 house, where it was retrieved by a neighbour;\ns) The claimants left Colombia on [XXX], 2017 filed their basis of claim forms on March 28, 2018;\nNEXUS\n[9] Based on the above facts, I find that the principal claimant was the victim of physical, emotional and sexual abuse by her former spouse. As such, I find that she has a nexus to the Convention by virtue of her membership in a particular social group \u2013 women fearing gender\u00ad related persecution. I find that but for her gender, she would not have been subject to the various forms of violence she suffered at the hands of [XXX].\n[10] The minor claimants [XXX] and [XXX] in my view also have a nexus to the Convention as family members of the principal claimant. The effect of the household domestic violence on [XXX] is particularly acute as evidenced by the psychological documentation filed by the principal claimant. However, it is clear that both children have been threatened and face a future serious possibility of persecution as family members of the principal claimant should they return to Colombia.\nSUBJECTIVE FEAR\n[11] The principal claimant tried to leave the relationship three times, twice by filing complaints with the authorities. Each attempt was unsuccessful and resulted in future violence and sexual abuse.\n[12] The principal claimant fled to her parents\u2019 house on [XXX], 2017 and remained there until leaving for Canada the next month. She filed for refugee protection in Canada within a reasonable time, while she had lawful status in Canada courtesy of a previously obtained VISA;\n[13] When the domestic violence began to affect her daughter, the principal claimant took steps to address the mental health issues which arose therefrom.\n[14] All of these actions are consistent with a person that fears their spouse and therefore I find that the principal claimant has demonstrated a subjective fear of persecution.\nOBJECTIVE BASIS\nDocumentary Evidence\n[15] Exhibit 4 contains approximately 11 items, 36 pages in total. This documentation includes two psychological reports and one medical report, as well as excerpts from [XXX]\u2019s journal which support the principal claimant\u2019s allegations that [XXX] was abusive to the principal claimant and verbally abusive to the minor female claimant. It also supports the assertion that the abuse took such a toll on [XXX] that she was preparing to commit suicide.\n[16] The principal claimant has also provided photographs5 and website print outs6 which show her spouse at various events with Senate candidate [XXX], Former President Alvaro Uribe and current President Ivan Duque, among others.\nCountry Documentation\n[17] The National Documentation Package (NDP) for Colombia indicates that domestic violence is so pervasive and normalized in that country, that it has become virtually invisible to authorities and citizens alike.7 Women are unlike to report such violence to the authorities as they fear being stigmatized or re-victimized by state institutions, and as such spousal abuse \u2013 and specifically spousal rape \u2013 remains a \u201cserious problem\u201d in the country.8\n[18] In considering the totality of the documentary evidence, I find that the principal claimant has established an objective basis for her fear of persecution on a Convention ground, as well as the children\u2019s fears.\nSTATE PROTECTION\n[19] The principal claimant alleges that Colombia has failed to protect her from her husband to date and should she return to Colombia, the state would be unwilling or unable to provide her and her children with adequate state protection.\n[20] According to the NDP for Colombia9:\nAccording to the 2015 National Survey on Demographics and Health, 76.4 percent of women never sought help in cases of violence committed against them (Colombia 2015, 84). The same source indicates that, in cases where the violence was reported, 40.3 percent were reported at a police station, 37.2 percent at the FGR, 19 percent at a Family Commissary, 7.1 percent at \u201canother institution,\u201d and 2.4 percent at a court (Colombia 2015, 83-84). Of all reported cases by women victims of violence, the aggressor was penalized in 21.1 percent of the cases, the victim was summoned to conciliation in 29.5 percent of the cases, the aggressor was not penalized or did not appear in 28.2 percent of the cases, the aggressor was ordered not to go near the victim in 22.1 percent of the cases, and in 5.7 percent the aggressor was prohibited from going back into the home (Colombia 2015, 84). In 4.7 percent of the cases that were reported, the violence did not stop, and in 2.3 percent it got worse (Colombia 2015, 84).\nA report sent to Congress by the President\u2019s High Commissioner for Women\u2019s Equality, regarding the implementation of Law 1257 of 2008, states that, in 2014, the FGN received 74,899 cases of intra-family violence, with charges laid in 10 percent of the cases and a conviction rate of 23 percent (Colombia 26 Jan. 2017). In 2015 the number of cases received was 85,040, with charges laid in 12 percent of the cases and a conviction rate of 24 percent (Colombia 26 Jan. 2017). The same report states that, despite the increase in the rate of charges being laid, that rate remains \u201cvery low, \u201d and the investigation and prosecution of intra-family violence cases remains \u201cinsufficient\u201d and the conviction rate \u201cdeficient\u201d (Colombia 26 Jan. 2017).\nCountry Reports 2016 states that, according to women\u2019s groups such as Sisma Mujer, law enforcement response is \u201cgenerally ineffective\u201d (US 3 Mar. 2017, 37).\n[21] The NDP further states that due to the prevalence of domestic violence throughout the country and a corresponding lack of resources, the state response to such violence is \u201cinsufficient\u201d. As such, spousal abusers are able to act with relative \u201cimpunity\u201d in Colombia.10\n[22] This information certainly accords with the evidence of the principal claimant with regard to her attempts to obtain protection prior to her coming to Canada.\n[23] This of course does not take into account the profile of the agent of persecution which in my view, only further supports the inference that state protection for this family is not available in Colombia.\n[24] The ties between the political class and the various criminal groups in Colombia are well documented and date as far back as the 1960\u2019s and 70\u2019s.11 The principal claimant alleges that but for the threat delivered to her at her step-mother\u2019s home, she would not have believed that [XXX] had ties to the Urabe\u00f1os, but that was the threat and she believed it capable of being carried out.\n[25] The National Documentation Package for Colombia (NDP) indicates that the Urabe\u00f1os are now the dominant criminal band with the \u201cbiggest presence in Colombia\u201d and the ability to \u201cinterfere at the national level.\u201d12 The International Criminal Court describes the Urabe\u00f1os as highly organized and able to exert effective control over its members.13 The Urabe\u00f1os operate through a criminal network composed of nodes that \u201canswer to central command,\u201d and are known to use extortion, threats, killings, and other forms of violence including \u201ckidnapping and selective assassination.\u201d14\n[26] On a balance of probabilities, and in light of the claimants\u2019 particular circumstances, I find that there is clear and convincing evidence that the Colombian state would be unable to provide the claimant with adequate protection. The principal claimant provided reliable and trustworthy evidence of her efforts to obtain state protection, and aside from issuing a report and offering to investigate, the Colombian authorities did not provide specific protection measures.\n[27] The NDP indicates that when victims of armed groups complain to Colombian authorities, the state is often unable to offer operationally adequate protection. This is due in part to the \u201coverwhelming caseload\u201d of prosecutors and \u201cinadequate official investigation\u201d which has \u201cmade it difficult to address threats, attacks and killings.\u201d15 This is especially the case for those who are not \u201chigh profile\u201d16 as the National Protection Unit (UNP) in Colombia focuses on persons \u201cgiven their position or activities, [who] may be subjected to extraordinary or extreme risk,\u201d17 such as well-known human rights defenders. The \u201cvast majority of victims of criminal groups do not receive protection.\u201d18\n[28] The NDP indicates that authorities have \u201cfailed to curb the power of criminal groups\u201d and crimes committed by neo-paramilitary groups are \u201csometimes committed with the collusion or acquiescence of the security forces.\u201d19 Indeed, neo-paramilitary groups are known to use ties to Colombian officials in order to \u201cavoid prosecution\u201d and Colombian police officers have been seen \u201cmeeting with members of criminal groups, including the Urabe\u00f1os.\u201d20\n[29] I note that Colombian authorities have undertaken efforts to capture members of the Urabe\u00f1os.21 However, even if the perpetrators are incarcerated, they can continue to \u201cuse alliances outside to take revenge.\u201d22 The preponderance of the evidence before me is both clear and convincing and rebuts the presumption of state protection in the claimant\u2019s particular circumstances. I find on a balance of probabilities, that that the Colombian state is unable to provide the claimants with adequate protection from either [XXX] or the Urabe\u00f1os.\nINTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE\n[30] I also considered whether a viable Internal Flight Alternative (IFA) exists for the claimants in Barranquilla and Tunja. The former city is [XXX]-hour drive or [XXX] kilometers from her former residence and the latter [XXX]-hour drive or [XXX] kilometers.\n[31] I must consider a two-prong test in order to determine the viability of an IFA location.23 Firstly, I must be satisfied that, on a balance of probabilities, the claimants would not face a serious possibility of persecution or section 97 risk in the proposed IFA. Secondly, I must be satisfied that it would not be unreasonable, in all of the circumstances, including those particular to the claimants, for them to seek refuge there.\n[32] In determining whether [XXX] and the Urabe\u00f1os have both the means and motivation to locate the claimant in the proposed IFA locations, I have considered the Urabe\u00f1os area of operation, its ability to track its victims across Colombia, as well as its level of interest in the claimants. I have also considered the profile of the agent of persecution illustrated by the principal claimant in her testimony.\n[33] With respect to [XXX], the principal claimant alleges that due to his involvement with the Centro Democratico party, he could use his \u201ccontacts\u201d to locate her throughout Colombia. She further testifies that this could be done via access to government databases that contain biographical information which must be kept updated in order to access education, health care, exercise voting rights, etc.\n[34] I have examined the NDP for Colombia, particularly Item 10.2 which is dedicated to privacy and data security. This document discusses the legal rights Colombians have over their own data and incidents of misuse. I do not find any support in this document for the claimant\u2019s suggestion that [XXX] or his colleagues in the Democratic Party could track the principal claimant throughout Colombia or that they would even have access to any of these databases.\n[35] The Urabe\u00f1os are not present in Barranquilla or Tunja according to the NDP.24 However, the Urabe\u00f1os have a national reach and the ability to operate across the country.25 Human Rights Watch notes that \u201cthat there have been documented cases of people being tracked down by the Urabe\u00f1os after fleeing to other parts of the country.\u201d26 The Urabe\u00f1os as an organization don\u2019t appear to have any interest in the claimants, save and except on the part of \u201c[XXX]\u201d who approached the claimant purportedly on behalf of [XXX].\n[36] Neither the principal claimant nor her family members have heard from the Urabe\u00f1os since this single incident in [XXX] of 2017. They have not heard from [XXX] since mid-2018. The principal claimant has no information regarding any recent attempts by either party to locate her and the children.\n[37] I find that based on the information in the NDP and that filed by counsel, the Urabe\u00f1os have the means to locate the claimant throughout Colombia should [XXX] direct them to do so. It does not appear they have a motive to locate the claimants on their own accord, but the [XXX] 17, 2017 incident demonstrates a willingness to intimidate and threaten the principal claimant and her family at the behest of [XXX].\n[38] I therefore find, on a balance of probabilities that a viable IFA does not exist for the claimants in Colombia, including in Barranquilla and Tunja, which is both safe and reasonable for them.\nCONCLUSION\n[39] I find that the claimants are all Convention refugees pursuant to s. 96 of IRPA. The principal claimant has demonstrated a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground which exists throughout Colombia, as a woman fearing gender-based persecution.\n[40] Her claim is therefore accepted.\n[41] I find that the minor claimants both face a serious possibility of persecution as members of a particular social group \u2013 family members of the principal claimant. This possibility exists throughout Colombia, and I find that they too are Convention refugees as per s. 96 of IRPA.\n[42] Their claims are also accepted.\n(signed) David D\u2019Intino\nOctober 29, 2019\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), SC 2001, c 27, as amended\n\n2 Exhibit 2.1\n\n3 Exhibit 4.\n\n4 https:\/\/irb-cisr.gc.ca\/en\/legal-policy\/policies\/Pages\/chairperson-guideline.aspx\n\n5 Exhibit 7.\n\n6 Exhibit 8.\n\n7 Exhibit 3.

Marcovitch\nCounsel for the claimant(s): Adela Crossley\nCountry: El Salvador\nRPD Number: TB8-09319\nAssociated RPD Number(s): TB8-09330, TB8-09365, TB8-09366\nATIP Number: A-2020-01274\nATIP Pages: 000151-000155\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: I\u2019ve considered your testimony as well as the other evidence in this case and I\u2019m ready to render my decision orally.\n[2] [XXX], [XXX] who I will refer to as the principal claimant, [XXX], and [XXX] are citizens of El Salvador and are requesting protection under Sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[3] The claims were joined pursuant to Rule 55 if the RPD rules, and [XXX] was appointed as the designated representative of the minor claimants pursuant to rule \u2026 or pursuant to Section 167(2) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[4] The specific details of this claim are set out in the Basis of Claim Form of [XXX].\n[5] In short, the claimants fear the MS-13 gang in El Salvador as a result of years of extortion and threats, particularly experienced by the adult male claimant. The MS-13, it started approaching him in 2015 seeking small extortion amounts on a regular basis. However, starting in [XXX] 2016 the principal claimant was approached for greater extortion amounts which the principal claimant paid on the [XXX] of every month, and he considered it part of his monthly costs of living.\n[6] However, in [XXX] 2017 the principal claimant was asked by an elder \u2026 elderly neighbour to use his position as the [XXX] of a [XXX] company called [XXX](ph) to provide samples of [XXX] that the neighbour was unable to obtain through the El Salvador social assistance program due to office closers during the holiday season.\n[7] Shortly after doing this favour the MS-13 approached the principal claimant and asked for sample [XXX] as well in addition to the extortion amounts. At this time the MS-13 also advised as to the details that they had regarding the principal claimant\u2019s family, where he worked, when and where his kids went to school, etcetera.\n[8] Later on, the minor claimant [XXX] was stopped by gang members as he got off a school bus and was threatened regarding his father following through on extortion amounts and to try and stop avoiding them.\n[9] INTERPRETER: Would you kindly repeat that (inaudible) last part all about the school bus?\n[10] MEMBER: To try and stop avoiding them.\n[11] INTERPRETER: Can you back to where he got on the school bus (inaudible)?\n[12] MEMBER: And was threatened regarding his father following through on extortion and to stop trying to avoid them.\n[13] The claimants also believe that the MS-13 members had moved into a rooming-house across from their home and were keeping an eye on them.\n[14] My determination is that I find the claimants persons in need of protection pursuant to Section 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[15] With regard to Section 96, I find that the claimants fear criminal entity and I therefore find that their fear of persecution is not based on one of the five Convention grounds. That being so, this case was assessed under Section 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[16] With regard to generalized risk, the documentary evidence that El Salvador is one of the most violence countries in the world with one of the highest homicide rates. In particular, gangs are responsible for about 60 percent of the country\u2019s homicides, as noted in NDP Item 7.1(1).\n[17] El Salvador\u2019s National Documentation Package further indicates that random organized violent crime is endemic throughout El Salvador.\n[18] Based on the documentary evidence contained in the NDP and counsel\u2019s country package I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the risk of violence at the hands of gangs in El Salvador is a generalized risk faced by the general population in El Salvador, and that extortion threats are common. However, I find that the claimant in this particular case face an individualized risk.\n[19] I find that even though some of the extortion faced by the claimants in 2015 or 2016 may have been generalized in nature, the more recent threats they experienced in 2017 and 2018 was personalized in nature. I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimants face a greater risk to their lives than the risk faced by the generalized population in El Salvador, such that they are subject to the generalized risk exception found in sub-paragraph 97(1)(b)(ii) of the Act.\n[20] With regard to identity, I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimants have established their identities by way of certified true copies of their El Salvadorian passports as seized by the Canadian Border Security Agency.\n[21] With regard to credibility, I find that the principal claimant was a credible witness. I find that he was consistent and did not embellish his testimony when there were opportunities for him to have done so. I find that I believe what he said and presented at his hearing.\n[22] I accept the principal claimant\u2019s evidence that before they went to the United States in [XXX] 2017, he was scared of the gangs but did not consider the threats at that time to be significant, as he was paying the extortion amounts and viewed it as a monthly expense.\n[23] Further, the gangs appear to have accepted that monthly amount and had not threatened further at that point.\n[24] I therefore find that the claimants have not experienced such serious threats of a personal nature, that they should have sought protection in the United States\u2026\n[25] INTERPRETER: That they should have?\n[26] MEMBER: That they should have sought protection in the United States. And that I find they did not re-avail themselves of El Salvador\u2019s protection when they returned.\n[27] With regard to State protection, there are numerous documents in the Board\u2019s disclosure packages that describe the ineffectiveness of El Salvador\u2019s police and judiciary. Based among other things, on gang infiltration and corruption.\n[28] The claimants in this case did not approach the police at any point about the threats. While I find this problematic, I\u2019m also of the opinion that even if they had stayed to try to get the benefit of State protection that the protection offered would not have been adequate given the objective country documentation on the issue, and the imminent threats faced by the claimants.\n[29] I therefore find, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimants have rebutted their presumption of State protection available to them in El Salvador and I find, on a balance of probabilities, that State protection would not be available to these particular claimants in the future if they were to return to El Salvador.\n[30] With regard to internal flight alternative, the documentary evidence is clear that gang activity is prevalent throughout El Salvador and that MS-13 has connections throughout the country and that they communicate with each other when new people move into their neighbourhoods.\n[31] That being so and given my determination regarding State protection, I find, on a balance of probabilities, that there\u2019s no viable internal flight alternative available to these particular claimants anywhere in El Salvador.\n[32] To conclude I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimants are persons in need of protection pursuant to Section 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act as they would be personally subjected to a risk to their lives or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment should they return to El Salvador today.\n[33] I therefore accept their claims. Good luck.\n[34] COUNSEL: Thank you, Mr. Member.\n[35] MEMBER: And we\u2019re off the record.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

Thank you.\n[6] INTERPRETER: [XXX] is the daughter.\n[7] MEMBER: Thank you and we\u2019ve got \u2026 they never put these things in the right order.\n[8] So, the mother is, [XXX].\n[9] So, that it\u2019s clear, the claimants are a family, husband\/wife, mother\/father, their minor daughter and the principal claimant\u2019s mother. They are all citizens of Hungary.\n[10] They have all made refugee protection claims under Sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).\n[11] The principal claimant has been designated as the representative for his minor daughter in this matter.\n[12] The Board has taken into consideration the Board\u2019s guidelines for minor claimants in the determination of the daughter\u2019s claim.\n[13] In addition, the Board has taken into consideration the Chairperson\u2019s Gender Guidelines in the determination of the claims for the principal claimant\u2019s wife, the principal claimant\u2019s mother, the principal claimant\u2019s daughter.\nAllegations\n[14] The specifics of the claim are stated in the principal claimant\u2019s narrative, as well as, the principal claimant\u2019s mother\u2019s narrative, that are found in their Basis of Claim Form (BOC).\n[15] They allege the following:\n[16] They are Hungarian citizens whose ethnicity is Roma.\n[17] They fear to return to Hungary as they believe that they will be persecuted based on their ethnicity. They claim that they have been harassed, discriminated, threatened and assaulted due to their ethnicity.\n[18] They claim that there\u2019s systematic discrimination against the Roma in Hungary.\n[19] In addition, they fear the actions of extremists, nationalists and members of the Jobbik Party in Hungary and in general, racist attitudes of the population as a whole.\n[20] They maintain that the police in Hungary have a discriminatory attitude towards members of the Roma community and would not adequately protect them or other members of the Roma community.\n[21] The principal claimant, his wife and child, left Hungary on or about [XXX], 2018. The principal claimant\u2019s mother left on [XXX], 2019.\n[22] When they entered Canada, they made claims for refugee protection soon thereafter.\nDetermination\n[23] The Board finds that the claimants are Convention refugees pursuant to Section 96 of the IRPA.\n[24] The Board\u2019s reasons are as follows:\nAnalysis\n[25] The Board was concerned with the issues of credibility and state protection.\nIdentity and Credibility\n[26] The Board was satisfied with the personal identity of the claimants, that is, the personal identity of the claimants and that they were or are Hungarian citizens based on certified copies of their passport, as well as, other secondary identification documents filed.\n[27] In respect to the claimants\u2019 ethnicity, that of being a Roma, the Board is satisfied that they are Roma based on the testimony of the claimants, as well as, a few secondary identification documents filed on their behalf. As such, the Board accepts that all claimants\u2019 ethnicity is that of a Roma.\n[28] In the hearing, most of the evidence, most of the testimonies, was given by the principal claimant. The principal claimant\u2019s mother did testify for a brief moment, as well. Overall, the Board found that the testimony of both witnesses were credible and reliable.\n[29] The principal claimant testified that he believed that the discriminatory attitude towards Roma was what at best could be described as, widespread. In fact, it would not be far fetched to state that he believed that it was 100%, that all non-Roma are discriminatory and act on that discriminatory basis towards a minority community that he belongs to, the Roma in Hungary.\n[30] The Board has carefully reviewed the country condition articles, reports, filed by both Counsel and the Refugee Protection Division. The Board notes that many of the documents, particularly found in the National Documentation Package, are from independent, reputable, international human rights organizations, as well as, reports from state agencies, departments from well-respected Western democracies such as Canada itself, the United Kingdom and the United States of America.\n[31] It would be fair to say that, the vast majority of information in these country conditions articles and reports, substantiates, supports the claimants\u2019 testimony and allegations found in their narrative in their claim that there is a long history of discrimination towards the Roma community by the general Hungarian society, by the government, by its security apparatus.\n[32] The country conditions articles clearly describes discrimination as widespread. As noted, the principal claimant believes 100% of the population is discriminatory. I\u2019m not sure the documentary evidence states that but it does state that it is widespread.\n[33] In its determination of whether the claimants are Convention refugees or not, the Board has to determine whether the claimants have been persecuted in the past or if they were to return, would they be persecuted as opposed to just being discriminated against?\n[34] The Board notes that there is jurisprudence that states for a matter to be considered persecution that the mistreatment suffered or anticipated by a claimant must be serious. The approach that is used by the courts is and approved by the courts, is equated to a notion of a denial of a core human right.\n[35] The documentary evidence indicates that \u2013 and will be discussed later on in this decision \u2013 that the Roma, members of the Roma communities are discriminated on a continuous basis on all facets of their life from education, employment, health services, accommodation.\n[36] The Board finds that if the claimants were to return to Hungary that they would have a well\u00ad founded fear of persecution.\n[37] The information found in the documentary evidence acknowledges that Hungary has taken steps to improve in the moderating of the rights of the Roma in Hungary. It has maintained a Roma Council bringing in members from different facets of society to ensure that the Roma population in Hungary is not discriminated or abused.\n[38] Nevertheless, the sources clearly indicate that both government and non-government policies for Roma integration has not been implemented.\n[39] The documentary evidence indicates that there are grave problems regarding poverty in the Roma community in Hungary, in particular, child poverty. Many of the reports, particularly from the European Union, from the UN, have not been implemented.\n[40] The annual reports from the United States State Department Reports on Human Rights Practices in Hungary, each year indicates that discrimination continues to significantly limit Roma from access to education, employment, health services and social services.\n[41] The U.S. reports every year indicates that there is a racist attitude perpetrated by the police force against this particular ethnic community.\n[42] Some of the statistics mentioned in the documentary evidence are shocking. For example, 80% of the Roma aged between 15 and 64, have not completed more than 8 years of primary education, compared to 20% among non-Roma and of those Roma, 16% did not finish primary school at all while 63% completed primary school without going on to secondary school. The comparable figures for non\u00ad Roma Hungarians are I% and 90%, respectively.\n[43] The discrepancy narrows among those students who study vocational and trade schools, 15% of Roma versus 25% of non-Roma completed vocational programs.\n[44] The unemployment rate between the Roma and non-Roma Hungarians are significant.\n[45] The Board does acknowledge that the Hungarian government has expressed the willingness to provide protection to all of its citizens. The government has made commitments to the European Union to make efforts to improve the conditions of its minority citizens, including the Roma.\n[46] However, the Federal Court of Canada has held on a number of occasions, that good intentions alone to protect and improve the plight of the Roma in Hungary are not enough. There is a general jurisprudence that states that, having legislation that protects its nationals but is not implemented at all while its nationals are being deprived of core human rights, does not amount to adequate state protection.\n[47] As such, the Board finds that he Hungarian government and its police are unable to provide adequate state protection to its Roma citizens, at this time.\n[48] As such, based on case law, the Board finds that the claimants have rebutted the presumption of state protection with clear and convincing evidence.\n[49] Although not an issue, I would mention internal flight alternative. The Board finds that the country condition articles and reports indicate that the discrimination and harassment and hostile attitudes of the Hungarian population, of the Hungarian government, of the poor services provided by police to this minority group, is systematically widespread and as such, there is no viable IFA available to the claimants should they return to Hungary.\nConclusion\n[50] Based on this brief analysis, the Board finds that the claimants are Convention refugees and accepts their claims.\n[51] This hearing is over.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

I\u2019d like to add that in the event that written are issued a written form of these reasons may be edited for spelling, syntax and grammar and references to applicable case law and documentary evidence may also be included.\n[17] The claimant sorry [XXX] claims to be a stateless Palestinian claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[18] In deciding your claim I have considered your testimony and the documentary evidence filed. In addition I have considered the guidelines on women refugee claimants fearing gender related persecution.\n[19] Your allegations are set out in your basis of claim form which is found in Exhibit number 2. The following is a brief summary of your allegations.\n[20] In 1978 you allege that your father and mother moved to Qatar from Lebanon. In 1981 you allege that you were born in Qatar. In your father or under your father\u2019s sponsorship while you were growing up and attending school in Qatar subsequently your father ended up going, retiring his sponsorship was transferred to another company in Qatar and in your brother in Canada here ended up sponsoring your mother and your father to come to Canada.\n[21] They ended up coming here in 2014. You ended up working at [XXX] for the period from 2010t to the period of 2016 upon which you were also let go. During that particular time you ended up transferring back to your father\u2019s sponsorship for a brief period.\n[22] You ended up going to Lebanon in [XXX] of 2017 to renew your Lebanese travel document and during that time you visited your sister in [XXX] in a Lebanese camp. Subsequently due to the violence that was going on in that particular camp and gunfire you ended up cancelling your trip and ended up going back to Qatar. You tried to find other employment and you had difficulty.\n[23] You ended up coming to Canada on [XXX] 2018 and made an inland claim for refugee protection and subsequently to you being here in Canada your residency permit from Qatar was cancelled due to the fact that you had been out of the country or that particular country for more than six months.\n[24] I find that you are a Convention refugee based on the grounds of membership in a particular social group that being of a female fearing gender related persecution in Qatar for the following reasons.\n[25] Your identity as a stateless Palestinian is established by your testimony and the supporting documentation filed namely a Lebanese travel document issued to stateless Palestinians which appears in Exhibit number 1.\n[26] I find you to be a very credible witness and therefore believe what you have alleged in support of your claim. You have testified in straightforward manner and there were no relevant inconsistencies in your testimony or contradictions between your testimony and the other evidence before me.\n[27] You did not exaggerate or embellish your claim. You also have provided extensive personal documents in Exhibit 7, 8, 9 and 10 to support your life in Qatar and also support your family\u2019s connections to Lebanon.\n[28] These documents include your status in Qatar it also includes your university documents from the [XXX] University. It also includes your secondary education certificates, your birth certificate, your [XXX] (ph) document it also includes your driver\u2019s license, letters of support from your family and therefore the panel believes your story in support of your claim.\n[29] There was one concern the panel had which was your failure to claim in the United States or in other countries prior to 2015, however you have provided a reasonable explanation, that during those periods of time you had a job in Qatar and also you had family still in Qatar and your problems only arose after your family had left Qatar and came to Canada. Therefore the panel did not draw a negative inference as to your credibility.\n[30] Now as for the objective documentary evidence which appears in Exhibit 7b, 7c, 8, 10, 11 and 12 they also support the problem that you may have as a single woman living without a male relatives in Qatar.\n[31] The panel finds that you are a stateless Palestinian you spent all of your life in Qatar even though that you have made visits to Lebanon during your formative years and that you do have some connection to Lebanon as your parents and relatives, your parents were born there.\n[32] Some of your siblings were born there, you also have a sibling who\u2019s still there and even though the panel did not find that as a formal country of habitual residence we proceeded, I don\u2019t want to belabor that point but a lot of time was spent regarding establishing your connection to Lebanon. The panel is making this decision squarely on you would have problems going back to your formal habitual residence of Qatar.\n[33] In Qatar you only have a temporary status, you do not have the same rights as Qatari nationals and you\u2019re not allowed to own your own home or work at certain jobs. You do not have access to public healthcare or education, you had to pay for that on your own and you would also face difficulties the panel finds on a balance of probabilities of finding a job in part because you\u2019re Palestinian and you hold a Lebanese travel document.\n[34] The documentary evidence indicates quite clearly in some of the exhibits that a resident, that you can\u2019t be outside of your country of formal habitual residence Qatar longer than six months. Some people, the documentary evidence also indicates that you might be able to obtain permission to enter but you had to have to obtain it prior to departure.\n[35] You can\u2019t necessarily get it now that you are out of the country. There\u2019s a different set of rules that would apply to you and I believe that particular time period has elapsed. According to the fact that your residence permit has now expired and I do agree that the documentary evidence does support that you can\u2019t enter unless an employer hires you from overseas. So and that\u2019s not the case that we have here today.\n[36] So as a result you can\u2019t return there, that\u2019s one condition that I have to find. You left Qatar in [XXX] 2018 and you can no longer return using your previous residency permit and consequently the documentary evidence also indicates that, that you need to obtain a sponsor.\n[37] Foreign workers have to get the employers consent, have to be able to change jobs. The sponsor controls whether the employee, certain aspects of the employees, existence in that particular country and because you would have an uncertain immigration status in Qatar. Those particular sponsorship rules still apply to you but in any event because you are Palestinian your status in Qatar could only be temporary.\n[38] Now the area that I particularly focused on in this decision is the fact of the documentary evidence which appears in 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4 and 2.5 pertaining to gender issues. The fact that you would have no sponsor, no male guardian there, I find that cumulatively amounts to discrimination in your particular case as a Palestinian woman.\n[39] 2.1 of Exhibit number 6 indicates there\u2019s human rights problems of for women, there\u2019s the guardianship system in place that requires every woman to have a close male relative as her guardian with legal authority to approve whether she works there, files any kind of legal or goes to the police. It also notes that widespread societal exclusion exists for statist institutions in terms of recognizing single women\u2019s rights.\n[40] In addition you may face discrimination in courts and also discrimination under family law because women are not treated as an equal member in society and many laws discriminate against them in Qatar.\n[41] And normally the documentary evidence is also in 5.1 it talks about that husband nor the closest male relative has to set up or has to be involved in the woman\u2019s daily life. I find that this is persecutory in this particular case it would impose important obstacles for your own autonomy to find your own job and would possibly prevent you from renting on your own and it would also limit the range of full activities that you would be able to do on your own in society.\n[42] Therefore I find that there\u2019s more than a mere possibility of treatment amounting to persecution in Qatar in your case. I also find that because these are the laws of the land that you have rebutted the presumption of state protection in this case.\n[43] I also find that there would be no alternative flight alternative in Qatar because this would be the situation that you would face wherever you go and therefore I conclude that you are a Convention refugee and accept you claim.\n[44] In addition I also find that you cannot return to your formal habitual country of residence in this particular case.\n[45] Thank you and welcome to Canada. Thank you I wish to thank you for coming to tell your story and I wish to thank counsel for your participation and everybody have a good afternoon.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2019 RLLR 58\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: May 1, 2019\nPanel: J. Pollock\nCounsel for the claimant(s): A. Mejia-Arias\nCountry: Colombia\nRPD Number: TB8-07483\nATIP Number: A-2020-01274\nATIP Pages: 000129-000138\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] MEMBER: We are back on record. All the same parties are present, except Madam Interpreter has been excused while we were off record.\n[2] While we were off record, while Madam Interpreter was still present, I advised the claimant and counsel that I would be granting the claim here today. Madam Interpreter indicated that she has a headache and is unable to remain in the hearing room. So with \u2014 well, I discussed this issue with counsel.\n[3] And Counsel, my understanding is you have no objection to me providing my reasons and waiving off interpretation.\n[4] COUNSEL: I have no objection.\n[5] MEMBER: Thank you so much.\n[6] All right. While we were off record, I also provided the original documents back to Counsel.\n[7] I have considered your testimony and the other evidence that you presented here today, and I am ready to render my decision.\n[8] This is a decision for Ms. [XXX].\n[9] The claimant claims to be a citizen of Columbia and is making her claim protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[10] In considering your claim here today and in rendering my decision, I have considered and applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 4 on women refugee claimants fearing persecution.\n[11] I find that you are a convention refugee as you have established a serious possibility of persecution upon return to Colombia based upon your particular social group as a religious community worker who was imputed to be opposed to the ELN.\n[12] Your allegations are set out in detail in your basis of claim form which we have at Exhibit 2.\n[13] You allege that you worked in the evangelical sense by providing community religious work to various underserved communities in Columbia.\n[14] You indicated that you provided literacy lessons to adults and children and that you taught people about the bible.\n[15] You allege that the person who you referred to as your spiritual father, Pastor [XXX] (ph), was murdered in [XXX] 2015 by the ELN. You allege that you, along with his now widow, witnessed this murder, and that ever since this time you received multiple threats from the ELN.\n[16] So specifically, you indicate that you were personally approached while you were in [XXX] (ph) in Sincelejo.\n[17] You were approached by members of the ELN, who identified themselves as members of the ELN who demanded that you cease your religious work, and that you were interfering in the community. They ordered you to leave. They explained that they would kill you if you didn\u2019t do as they told you.\n[18] You further allege you experienced two more threatening phone calls, one in [XXX] 2016, the next in [XXX] 2016. You allege that during these calls they again threatened your life and demanded that you cease your evangelical work. They also demanded that you leave the city.\n[19] As a result, you fled the city where you were living in Manaure and you resided with family. You then fled Columbia for Canada where you remained on a visa.\n[20] You allege that even after you fled Columbia, your family members continued to receive telephone threats regarding you specifically.\n[21] Just for clarity purposes, the full name of the ELN is National Liberation Army, hereinafter referred to as the ELN.\n[22] I find your personal identity as a national of Columbia is established on a balance of probabilities by your Columbian passport, which I have at Exhibit 1.\n[23] Regarding the issue of nexus, I do find that the ELN targeted you for reasons beyond the expansion of their criminal enterprise. I am satisfied that on the particular facts of your case, the ELN targeted you because of your community religious work.\n[24] I would note that even if the ELN has expanded into drug trafficking and other criminal enterprises throughout Colombia, it remains at its core a guerilla group with violent political aspirations and a left-wing political ideology that is known to target community workers.\n[25] In my view, from the perspective of the agent of persecution, your particular religious community activities were in opposition to the objectives of the ELN and, as a result, they imputed to you an anti-ELN political opinion.\n[26] And I am satisfied that your religious work in the community is central to your human rights and, therefore, that you do comprise a particular social group as a community religious worker.\n[27] Regarding your credibility, I find you to be generally credible. I did have some credibility concerns. However, I found you to be extremely credible when it came to your commitment to your religious work in Columbia and your continuing religious work here in Canada.\n[28] I do believe that you acted as a religious worker, that you engaged underserved communities in lessons about literacy, as well as lessons about the bible.\n[29] You provided very detailed testimony in this respect which I found compelling. You spoke about the importance of your faith to you personally.\n[30] You spoke in detail about what led you to become involved in this work back in 1997 and I found that to be credible as well.\n[31] You spoke about why you were motivated to engage in this work after you first met your spiritual father, who then later on was murdered. I would note that this testimony was very difficult for you as it required you to remember this very important person in your life. And as a result, an additional break was offered to you today. I did find that to be very credible.\n[32] I also found to be credible your allegation that you witnessed your spiritual father\u2019s murder. Your testimony about this was consistent and it was detailed and very spontaneous.\n[33] I would note that there was a minor inconsistency in your testimony.\n[34] So when I had asked you about what was told to you during the first telephone threat you received from the ELN, you didn\u2019t mention that they indicated they knew where you were living. However, you did mention the vast majority of every other single thing that you allege that they told you on that day.\n[35] And so I have weighed this omission against the consistent nature of your testimony for that threat in particular, and I find that it is minor in nature. You indicated that you may have forgotten this detail and I am affording you the benefit of the doubt with respect to this inconsistency. I haven\u2019t drawn an adverse inference.\n[36] I do find that you were threatened in person, as alleged, and over the phone as alleged in your narrative.\n[37] However, I did and I am drawing an adverse inference based on your submission of a national attorney general report. Specifically, this report appears at Exhibit 6. So it begins at page 25 and it ends at page 28.\n[38] You tendered this report in evidence and you also provided a purported original document to a company, the copy that you put in evidence. However, upon my review of this original document, I noted there were no signatures apparent.\n[39] However, on the copy in the disclosure package, at page 26, your signature appears above the phrase \u201creporting party\u201d. I wasn\u2019t sure why this was and so I asked for your comment on this.\n[40] You indicated that you signed this document in Canada. When it was asked why you had done this, you indicated you believed you were supposed to do this. However, I find that this alteration of a document undermines its veracity before me here today and I am drawing an adverse inference as to your credibility.\n[41] In addition to the fact that the original document doesn\u2019t match the document in evidence, I would note that there is no indication that this report was even filed with the authorities. There is no stamp. There is no signature by the receiving party. You indicated they didn\u2019t sign it. However, I am not satisfied on a balance of probabilities that this report was filed\n[42] I also did have some concerns about the appearance of the report. However, I won\u2019t draw an adverse inference on that basis, given that the comparison report may indeed be a different report and that specifically, the report example specimen that I am referring to is at Exhibit 3, Item 9.5.\n[43] So we do have an example of a report to the national attorney general appears to be generally and we know that there is no variation in the format of reports because they are established by the attorney general in Columbia. However, given that the title of the report is different from the title of the specimen, I won\u2019t draw an adverse inference.\n[44] But I do draw an adverse inference based on the fact that you signed this document and I have no credible evidence before me to indicate that it was ever filed. So I have drawn an adverse inference on this basis.\n[45] However, it\u2019s my job to weigh the evidence before me. Even considering the minor inconsistency about the telephone threat, and the fact that I don\u2019t find this report that you have given me to be credible, I do find that the balance of your evidence is credible and I believe what goes to the core of your claim, which is that you were a community religious worker and that you were threatened by the ELN.\n[46] In addition to these credibility concerns, I also asked you about why you delayed two years in making your claim. So you entered Canada in XXXX or, sorry, in XXXX of 2016 and you made your claim in XXXX of 2018.\n[47] When I asked you for an explanation, you indicated that you \u2014 well, first of all, you indicated that your visa did not expire. But then I confronted you with your stamp which indicates it expired in XXXX of 2016. At that point you indicated that in fact you did try and renew your temporary status. But there is no evidence before me that you did engage in an attempt to renew your status\n[48] I have examined the GCMS notes at Exhibit 1 and I note that there is no reference to an extension being filed. The only dates that are after 2015, that I can see in these notes, refer to your claim in 2018 and refer to the file being archived in 2017.\n[49] And so I don\u2019t find that you have established, on a balance of probabilities that you made an attempt to extend your status here in Canada\n[50] I note that by remaining in Canada without authorization for one and a half years following the expiration of your six months upon entering Canada, you were at risk of removal to Columbia. And I find it unreasonable for you not to have made your claim sooner.\n[51] I have considered your explanation, which is that you remained hopeful that the peace process in Columbia \u2014 and I do appreciate that and I have weighed that explanation. However, this is a significant delay.\n[52] While I may be in a position to accept that as a reasonable explanation for a shorter delay, I simply don\u2019t find it reasonable for two years, especially when I am finding that you were without status for one and a half of those years and at risk of removal.\n[53] So while I do draw an adverse inference against your credibility based on the significant delay, I don\u2019t find that this failure puts your general credibility in doubt. Indeed, I am mindful that it\u2019s not advisable to deny a claim solely based on an adverse inference as to a claimant\u2019s subjective fear.\n[54] I find even when combining this to your delay with my adverse inference as to your submission of the report that I don\u2019t find credible, I still find that the credible evidence in your claim outweighs these adverse inferences.\n[55] And so I do find you credible on a balance of probabilities and I do find that you face the harm that you have alleged in support of your claim.\n[56] So in addition to your generally credible testimony, you did provide a number of documents which I did find to be credible before me here today.\n[57] So you provided me with a letter from your employer in Columbia. I didn\u2019t see the original of that document. However, I saw a copy.\n[58] You provided me with the original church letter and I found that to be very credible. Your testimony about the name of the church, who your pastor was; all of that was consistent and I placed weight on that letter. I do find that you attended the church you have alleged and that you engaged in the community work that is included in that letter.\n[59] I have also considered the affidavit from your mum. I know that this corroborates your allegations and is also accompanied by information about (inaudible) and also a photograph of her upon making the affidavit.\n[60] I have also considered to be quite credible the affidavit from the friend who you had from the church, Ms. [XXX] (ph) and so that appears at page 19 of Exhibit 6, also an affidavit accompanied by a photo of her commenting on that declaration\n[61] I found that to be consistent with your allegations and that it corroborates the specific allegation where you were personally approached by the ELN.\n[62] I have also considered the affidavit from your sister. And while I note that this doesn\u2019t refer to her seeking police protection or protection from the authorities as you have alleged, I am mindful that evidence should be taken for what it does say and not for what it does not say and, I further note, that it does corroborate your allegation that she received threatening telephone calls. So I have waived this in your favour as well.\n[63] Perhaps one of the most compelling pieces of evidence that you provided, however, is the affidavit from the widow of your spiritual father. I found this to be very credible and I placed significant weight on this document.\n[64] I found that its description of the murder of your spiritual father to be very consistent with what you have alleged and I also found it to be written in a very compelling manner as well.\n[65] So specifically, she mentions that, \u201cThis was the most horrible moment of my life. I\u2019m sure it was the most terrible experience also for XXXX and my daughter.\u201d\n[66] I just found this to be a very credible and compelling document and I accorded it significant weight.\n[67] Okay. So in addition to this personal evidence, I also have considered the objective evidence before me.\n[68] I would note that while the Columbian government has signed a final peace accord with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Columbia, also known as the PARC, and they have completed PARC demobilization in XXXX 2017, in contrast, the peace process with the ELN has stalled in Columbia.\n[69] The ceasefire with the ELN ended in XXXX 2018 after the armed group resume attacks and the government suspended the peace negotiations.\n[70] So since the end of the ceasefire with the ELN the armed conflict has intensified in many regions in Columbia and, indeed, many FARC dissidents have been joining the ELN, expanding its territory and its operations.\n[71] The ELN is described as Columbia\u2019s biggest guerrilla group with somewhere between 1,500 and 2,500 combatants, which operate in war fronts or urban militias. The ELN continues to regularly carry out kidnappings, extortion, assassinations, bombings and other terrorist activities.\n[72] Indeed, I am also mindful of counsel\u2019s disclosure of recent documentary evidence which indicates that the ELN took responsibility for targeted attacks in January 2019; an attack against a police academy killing 21 people.\n[73] So these more recent reports can be found at Exhibit 6 at page 29.\n[74] Okay. I further acknowledge that the country condition evidence is clear regarding the consequences of being declared a military objective. So you indicate that during the last telephone call they declared you a military objective.\n[75] The national documentation package indicates that when a person is declared a military objective it means that they have been issued a threat to be killed and that their life, physical integrity and freedom are endangered, and also indicates that these objectives are commonly made by guerilla groups such as the ELN.\n[76] The NDP also corroborates that the persecution of social leaders and community workers in Columbia is increasing. Indeed, scores of activists have been murdered and there is widespread impunity for their killers in Columbia. The problem is getting worse, not getting better, according to the objective evidence.\n[77] Moreover, there is specific reference in the documents to the targeting of religious workers.\n[78] So counsel has provided a very recent report which indicates the murder of a religious worker. That appears at page \u2014\n[79] COUNSEL: Thirty-five (35).\n[80] MEMBER: \u2014 oh, 35. Thank you so much, Counsel. At page 35.\n[81] And we also know from the objective evidence that there is intimidation, violence and killing and targeting of religious leaders and members of religious communities, that Columbia is one of the most dangerous countries in the world in which to be a community leader, including a religious community worker, that non-governmental organizations in Columbia continue to report that in many areas of the country, illegal armed groups threatened leaders and members of religious organizations.\n[82] So I do find based on all this evidence that your claim is objectively well founded and that you face more than a mere possibility of persecution upon return to Columbia.\n[83] Regarding state protection, I find on a balance of probabilities and, in light of your particular circumstances, that there is clear and convincing evidence that the Columbian state would be unable to provide you with adequate protection.\n[84] You allege that you made no less than three attempts to obtain protection in Columbia by contacting the police unsuccessfully and also the attorney general in Columbia in three specific occasions.\n[85] I find that the objective evidence, in your particular circumstances, supports the inadequacy of state protection in Columbia.\n[86] I would note that the Columbian government has undertaken significant efforts to combat the ELN, including through the bombing of ELN camps and the capture of ELN members. However, the documents also indicate that when victims of armed groups complain to Columbian authorities, the state is often unable to provide them with protection. This is especially so for cases like yourself in which you are not high profile.\n[87] I would note that the National Protection Unit, or UNP in Columbia, focuses on persons given their position or activities who may be subjected to extraordinary or extreme risk, such as well\u00ad known human rights defenders. I don\u2019t find on a balance of probabilities that you are of a particularly high profile or that you are a well-known human rights worker. You are a community religious worker.\n[88] I would note that while this program is in place, there is evidence in the documents to show that four social leaders, who were provided with UNP protection, were killed while under protection of that unit in 2017, despite all four of them having been assigned bodyguards.\n[89] The NDP goes on to note that budgetary cuts affecting the unit have negatively impacted protection schemes and that perpetrators of abuses against rights defenders and community workers are rarely held accountable.\n[90] And so while I note that the state isn\u2019t expected to provide or afford perfect protection at all times, authorities must be able and willing to implement law and procedure.\n[91] So based on my review of the objective evidence and, in your particular circumstances, I find on a balance of probabilities that the evidence is clear and convincing and rebuts the presumption of state protection in your own specific particular circumstances.\n[92] I have also considered whether you have a viable internal flight alternative in Columbia. I proposed the city of Sincelejo and the department of Sucre (ph). I would note that the maps that we have in evidence at Items 1.2 as well as Item 7.23 indicate that the ELN is not present or active in Sincelejo or anywhere in the department of Sucre and that\u2019s why I proposed this specific location.\n[93] I asked you a number of questions about whether you could safely relocate there. You indicated that you fear that the ELN are active throughout Columbia that they operate without people knowing that they are there and that you fear for your life and your safety throughout the country.\n[94] In determining whether the ELN has the means and motivation to locate you in Sincelejo, I have considered their area of operation as well as their interest in you in particular. I would note that the most recent response to information request from April 2018 \u2014 that\u2019s Item 7.23 \u2014 indicates that information about the ELN\u2019s ability to track people is scarce.\n[95] However, the same document quotes the Amnesty International Americas director\u2019s observation that, \u201cIt is possible that the ELN can monitor a target across Columbia.\u201d\n[96] In addition, I note that you were declared a military target and the NDP is clear that for those who are declared a military objective, relocation within Columbia is not an option. This appears at Item 7.21.\n[97] I do note that the ELN has undertaken sustained efforts to find you and that they have located you in a number of different locations in Columbia. So they have called you and your family members.\n[98] They have called you while you were in Manaure. They have in Antioquia, the department of Antioquia. They have also located you in Nort Des Centendre. You were also targeted in Centendre when your spiritual father was murdered.\n[99] And so I have weighed all of this in the evidence in determining whether you have a viable IFA as well.\n[100] However, perhaps most importantly, I am mindful that you remain committed to your religious social work in Columbia and based on my assessment of your credibility.\n[101] I have also considered whether you would be able to freely participate in these religious activities in Sincelejo without facing a serious possibility of persecution. I find that you could not.\n[102] In making this determination, I have considered the level of violence and harm directed at religious community workers from armed groups in operation throughout Columbia.\n[103] So based on the evidence before me and based on your particular circumstances, I find that you would face a serious possibility of persecution throughout Columbia and that there is no viable internal flight alternative for you in Columbia, including in Sincelejo.\n[104] So I am accepting your refugee claim and I find you to be a convention refugee, pursuant to sections 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[105] Thank you so much. Thank you.\n[106] Thank you, Counsel.\n[107] COUNSEL: Thank you.\n[108] MEMBER: Thank you.\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 DECISION CONCLUDED \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n",

The case is, thus, assessed according to section 96 of the IRPA.\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] The claimant listed in response to question (2a) of her Basis of Claim (BOC) numerous incidents, where she has been severely beaten by her husband between 1998 and 2017.\n[4] The claimant was forced to marry, [XXX], a man chosen by her aunt when the claimant turned 16 years old. The claimant made objection to this marriage to no avail. She was officially married 5 years later.\n[5] She described in response to question 2(a) of her BOC how she was verbally, emotionally and sexually abused over a period of 20 years of married life with [XXX].\n[6] She was living at her in-law\u2019s house during the first years of her marriage. Members of her in-law\u2019s family were also rude and abusive towards the claimant. She was hit and attacked physically by her sister-in-law and [XXX]\u2019s parents.\n[7] The claimant indicated that she had problems getting pregnant. She was often insulted for this health difficulty. She was beaten and had to be taken to the hospital several times. She was treated at a clinic which was run by [XXX]\u2019 s cousins. She could not make any report to the authorities. All aspects of her life were under the control of the [XXX] family. The worse incidents occurred in 2008, 2010 and 2011 and are fully described in the narrative and its addendum.\n[8] In 2014, the claimant\u2019s sister called for assistance. She had breast cancer. The claimant was given permission to come to Canada to help her sister with her treatment and with her nephew, which needed much attention. During her first visit she overstayed her visa. She was asked to leave Canada.\n[9] During her absence her family had indicated that her husband was told by elders to change his conduct. She returned to Lebanon with her nephew.\n[10] However, soon after the claimant\u2019s return to Algeria, her husband started to beat her up again. The claimant sent her nephew at her parent\u2019s home. After two weeks she went to stay at her parents\u2019 place. Her sister asked her again to return to Canada. The claimant\u2019s brother intervened to obtain permission to leave Algeria from her husband. The claimant obtained permission to leave.\n[11] During that sojourn in Canada, the claimant learned about the possibility of making a refugee protection claim.\n[12] The claimant indicated that she learned from her mother that her husband agreed to divorce her. He would have gone twice to see an imam for the procedure. It is only after the third time that a certificate can be issued. She did not yet receive the divorce certificate. However, she understands that she can make an application for divorce from Canada. She was pleased to hear of this possibility to ensure that she would be fully free from her aggressor who has been abusing her for more than 20 years.\nCredibility\n[13] I find that the claimant was credible on all the aspects of her claim. She described the ordeal that she had suffered. The claimant provided, at Exhibit 6, the mental assessment done by Dr. [XXX]. Moreover, personal documents adduced at exhibit 5 also corroborate the situation of women who are living similar domestic situations. Counsel adduced extra documents on the topic, which corroborates the lack of protection for women fearing gender-related persecution in Algeria.\n[14] Considering the quality of her testimony, which was devoid of exaggerations, incoherence or embellishments, the panel finds the claimant credible.\nState Protection\n[15] The panel, following the Chairperson\u2019s Guidelines for Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution, stipulate in that a woman cannot ask protection from a state who is not respecting women\u2019s rights and offering adequate protection to women. Such is the case in Algeria. According to Response to Information Request: Number: LBN104656.FE, Exhibit 3, item 5.2.: Sources report that Lebanese women are victims of discrimination in their country both in law and practice (AI 23 May 2013; U.S. 19 Apr. 2013, 28; Human Rights Watch Jan. 2013, 4). Some sources specifically note that certain provisions of the legislation relating to the status of the person discriminate against women (ibid.; Freedom House 2013; UN 2011, 14-15). These sources also state that such legislation is linked to the religion to which the person belongs (Human Rights Watch Jan. 2013, 4; Freedom House 2013; UN 2011, 14-15). The treatment of women thus varies based on their religious affiliation (ibid.; U.S. 19 Apr. 2013, 28; Freedom House 2013). These sources state that, in general terms, the legislation is such that women are disadvantaged with regard to divorce, child custody and succession (U.S. 19 Apr. 2013, 28; Human Rights Watch Jan. 2013, 4; Freedom House 2013).\n[16] Moreover: Sources note that there are no official statistics on domestic violence in Lebanon (consultant 8 Nov. 2013; independent researcher 29 Oct. 2013; U.S. 19 Apr. 2013, 27). However, according to a report published by the United Nations Population Fund (UNPF), \u201cgender-based violence is prevalent in Lebanon in different forms, including domestic\/marital physical, sexual and psychological violence\u201d (UN 2012, 8). According to the Country Reports for 2012, \u201cthere was a broad consensus that domestic violence, including spousal abuse, was a serious and widespread problem in the country\u201d (U.S. 19 Apr. 2013, 27). An article published on the website of the international television network TV5 Monde states that [translation] \u201cthe project director for KAFA, a Lebanese organization combating violence against women, is of the opinion that domestic violence against women \u2018is the most common form of abuse and is not subject to economic or community barriers\u201d\u2018 (TVS Monde 19 Nov. 2011). In written correspondence sent to the Research Directorate, a gender consultant who conducts research and writes on violence against women in Lebanon, and who taught at Lebanese University (Universite libanaise) until 2008, states that it is [translation] \u201cwell known that domestic violence (\u2026) is underreported\u201d in the country (gender consultant 8 Nov. 2013). The author of the TV5 Monde article also notes that [translation] \u201cthe phenomenon is more widespread than generally presumed\u201d (19 Nov. 2011).\n[17] Sources report that it is estimated that one woman a month is killed by a family member in Lebanon (gender consultant 8 Nov. 2013; UN 8 Mar. 2012; Nasawiya 27 Feb. 2012).\n[18] Therefore, based on the documentary evidence there is clear and convincing evidence that adequate state protection is not available to the claimant.\n[19] The United States. Department of State. Lebanon. Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2018, (Exhibit 3, item 2.1) states the following in its most recent report:\n[20] The law criminalizes domestic violence, but it does not specifically provide protection for women. Despite a law that sets a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison for battery, some religious courts may legally require a battered wife to return to her home despite physical abuse. Foreign domestic workers, usually women, often suffered from mistreatment, abuse, and in some cases rape or conditions akin to slavery. Some police, especially in rural areas, treated domestic violence as a social, rather than criminal, matter.\n[21] NGOs and activists criticized the domestic violence law, claiming that it does not sufficiently protect victims or punish abusers, whom they alleged often received disproportionately light sentences. On January 29, activists gathered in downtown Beirut to protest perceived inaction by the judiciary and security forces to respond to such cases after at least eight women died in domestic violence incidents through January. Examples included a woman whose husband shot her outside their home in front of neighbors following a dispute. On April 25, a judge issued an indictment and called for the death penalty for the husband who had fled to Syria but subsequently returned and surrendered to investigators.\n[22] Women continue to face discrimination under the 15 distinct religion-based personal status laws. Discrimination includes inequality in access to divorce, residence of children after divorce, and property rights. Unlike Lebanese men, Lebanese women cannot pass on their nationality to foreign husbands and children and are subject to discriminatory inheritance laws. Human Rights Watch, January 2018, (item 2.3, P.4)\n[23] The claimant over the years had asked for divorces several times. Each request was ignored. She had no possibility of complaining to the authorities. The claimant felt that it would make things worse.\n[24] In such a country context for women, the claimant has met the burden of proof that the state turns a blind eye on women victim of domestic violence.\nIFA\n[25] Documentary evidence regarding the lack of state protection shows that it applies to the whole country, thus, confirms a lack of adequate state protection throughout Lebanon. Under such circumstances, as the State is turning a blind eye on the problems of domestic violence done to women, it is reasonable to find that state protection would not be forthcoming in her case. Therefore, there is no viable internal flight alternative (IFA) for the claimant under these conditions.\nConclusion\n[26] Therefore, after finding that the claimant is credible, the objective country condition reports in evidence and the claimant\u2019s supporting documents (exhibit 4 and 6), the claimant demonstrated objectively that she has more than a mere possibility of being persecuted upon return to Lebanon.\nDECISION\n[27] The claim is accepted\n(signed) Marie-Andr\u00e9e Lalonde\nNovember 18, 2019\n",

[XXX] was the designated representative for the minor claimants [XXX] \u2026 [XXX] and [XXX] and [XXX] was the designated representative for [XXX] and [XXX] pursuant to Section 167(2) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[4] Your claims for protection have been made pursuant to Sections 96 and Sections 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[5] The claimants allege that they face a threat to their lives or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if they were to return to Columbia.\n[6] The claimant [XXX] was a [XXX] in Columbia and was actively involved in helping poor claimants \u2026 sorry, poor citizens who had been affected by the various active conflicts that have been plaguing Columbia.\n[7] [XXX]\u2019s immediate family in this claim includes [XXX] his wife and his two children [XXX] and [XXX].\n[8] [XXX] came to the attention of the Clan del Golfo when he attempted to enter a poor neighbour in Cucuta North Santander with the intention of meeting a social leader and setting up forms where he could meet citizens and try to help them with land restitution or other [XXX].\n[9] Before you could enter the neighbourhood [XXX] was stopped and investigated by four armed men who claimed to be part of a neighbour \u2026 to be part of neighbourhood security and members of the Clan del Golfo. He was eventually free to leave but the men had called their commander and advised that they would be calling him later so that he could do them a favour.\n[10] [XXX] went to the police and filed a denunciation.\n[11] In [XXX] 2017 [XXX] received a call from the Clan del Golfo telling him to return to Cucuta within 10 days in order to discuss a business proposal. [XXX] was advised that the Clan de Golfo knew where he was living in [XXX] and knew many other details about him and his family. Nonetheless, [XXX] did not travel to Cucuta for the meeting.\n[12] After this [XXX] was approached and threatened on several more occasions.\n[13] By [XXX] 2017 the Clan de Golfo had stopped trying to gain his cooperation and instead demanded [XXX] pesos every three months in order for him to continue living. This demand was presented in a threat letter from the Autodefensas Gaistanistas de Columbia and was on their letterhead. The letter also declared XXXX and his family military objectives.\n[14] [XXX] went to the police, the Attorney General, and the Ombudsman seeking assistance for the continued threats and demands. He had also hired private security to protect himself while working.\n[15] Despite being a [XXX] and being familiar with State protection mechanisms, [XXX] was unable to get meaningful assistance from any of the previously mentioned government bodies.\n[16] As a result, [XXX] and his family left Columbia in [XXX] 2018.\n[17] The claimant [XXX] and his immediate family which consists of his wife [XXX] and his children [XXX] and [XXX] claim refugee protection based on being threatened by the same Clan de Golfo members that were seeking out his brother-in-law [XXX].\n[18] [XXX] alleges that he was approached on the street in Bogota on [XXX], 2018 by people claiming to be members of the Clan de Golfo and that they were seeking the whereabouts of [XXX]. [XXX] did not provide them with the information as he not seen [XXX] in several months and was unsure of his location. The Clan de Golfo offered [XXX](ph) \u2026 sorry, offered [XXX] financial reward if he had helped them.\n[19] About a week later [XXX] filed a report with the Attorney General about the incident even though he had been turned away from the police twice when he attempted to seek their assistance. [XXX] managed to get a protection order from the Attorney General and provided it to the police. The police dropped by his home and provided three telephone numbers for him to call if he noticed anyone following him.\n[20] The Clan de Golfo contacted [XXX] by phone on [XXX] and then again on [XXX], 2018 to see if he had the requested information. [XXX] reported both of these calls to the fiscalia.\n[21] Eventually, [XXX] received a letter from the Clan de Golfo which declared him and his family military objectives. Along with the letter were also photographs of [XXX]\u2019s family members outside their home and at different locations within Bogota.\n[22] As a result, [XXX] and his family fled Bogota to the United States where they then irregularly crossed into Canada. It was always their intention to come to Canada but could not do directly as their temporary resident visa application had been denied on the basis that [XXX] and his family had already applied for refugee protection.\n[23] [XXX] and his family entered Canada on [XXX], 2018.\n[24] I find that all the claimants are persons in need of protection pursuant to Section 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act as the risk was occasioned as a result of criminality and extortion and not \u2026 and not on the basis of [XXX] political opinion.\n[25] I find that the claimant\u2019s personal identities as nationals of Columbia has been established, on a balance of probabilities, by certified copies of each claimant\u2019s passports which have been seized by Canadian Immigration officials.\n[26] With respect to credibility, I find that the claimants were all credible witnesses.\n[27] I asked extensive questions of [XXX] and he was able to answer my questions clearly and with detail.\n[28] I was concerned about the placement of the fiscalia emblem on the reverse side of his fiscalia reports but in the absence of evidence that such a practice is abnormal, I do not take a negative inference against it.\n[29] I had a few credibility concerns with [XXX]\u2019s testimony as it related to an omission regarding his activities on the day following his first Clan de Golfo contact wherein he went to the United States Embassy in Bogota, but I do not have any clear basis to impugn the core of his allegations on this point alone.\n[30] The claimants also submitted credible documentary evidence in support of their claims, including support letters from politicians, security guards, fiscalia reports, Ombudsman reports, copies of the AGC threat letters, and a text threat message which corroborates their testimony.\n[31] I therefore accept what the claimants have alleged in support of their claims.\n[32] I also note that the objective documentation confirms that Clan de Golfo is an alternative name for the Autodefensas Gaistanistas de Columbia also known as the AGC, and I therefore accept that when the claimants indicate they were threatened by the Clan de Golfo, but the threat letter is from the AGC, that it is the same organization.\n[33] Now, I would normally have considered that the claimants could have had an internal flight alternative in the City of Tunja in Boyaca Department, but because the claimants have been declared military objectives I removed this options as an active issue.\n[34] Documents on file indicate that when a person is made a military objective it means that their life, physical integrity, and freedom are endangered and that this threat extends to the family.\n[35] The National Documentation Package response to information request at Item 7.2(1) suggests that when someone is declared a military objective means they had been marked as someone who is to be killed. I therefore found it odd that [XXX]\u2019s threat letter from the AGC demands money at the same time as declaring him a military objective. This does not directly fit without being declared a military objective plays out according to the NDP document.\n[36] However, on a balance of probabilities, I find that you were, in fact, declared military targets. Further, given that you made several denunciations and sought State protection, I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the risk to [XXX] and his family would have increased.\n[37] Likewise, [XXX]\u2019s family having also been declared military targets and in conjunction with the photographs taken of him and his family, that the threat letter declaring them military target is credible.\n[38] For the following reasons I find that State protection would not be forthcoming for the claimants.\n[39] The objective documentation notes that there\u2019s been some improvement in State response to bacterium groups but the efforts have been mainly confined to a peace with the ELN.\n[40] The State has also managed to see a large demobilization of FARC. However, despite this groups such as the Clan de Golfo which have moved into the territory of the demobilized FARC and have become the largest actrime(ph) group in the country. The Clan de Golfo continues to intimidate opponents and commit other crimes.\n[41] Further, there are reports of complicity and collaboration between bacterium groups and security forces. Investigation of murders by such groups continues at a slow pace and there continues to be issues of impunity for security forces involved in human rights abuses.\n[42] The United Nations High Commission on Refugees reports that witness protection in Columbia continues to be inadequate. They further note that the ability of the government to provide protection is limited due to capacity issues and issues with corruption.\n[43] Further, as a [XXX] who works with disadvantaged citizens, [XXX]\u2019s profile may fall within those profiles considered in the UNHCR refugee eligibility guidelines.\n[44] Further, as the claimants provided evidence that they approached the authorities on a number of occasions but \u2026 but no meaningful assistance was forthcoming, I find that adequate State protection was not available to them in the past and would not be in the future.\n[45] Based on the foregoing I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimants would not receive adequate State protection in Columbia.\n[46] As previously noted with respect to NDP Item 7.2(1), with the claimants having been declared military objectives, the objective evidence suggests that bacterium groups will travel to anywhere in the country in order to find those who have been declared military objectives. As such, an internal flight alternative will not be available to these clients, so excuse me, claimants.\n[47] I therefore conclude that the claimants are Convention refugees. Excuse me. I therefore conclude that the claimants are persons in need of protection and I therefore accept their claims. Good luck.\n[48] COUNSEL: Thank you.\n[49] CLAIMANT: Thank you so much.\n[50] MEMBER: You\u2019re welcome.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

On that same day, the panel rendered its oral positive decision and Reasons for decision. This is the written version of the oral decision and Reasons that have been edited for clarity, spelling, grammar and syntax with added references to the documentary evidence and relevant case law where appropriate.\n[2] This is the positive decision with respect to the matter of TB8-04266 of [XXX]. He is a citizen of Hungary of Roma descent, and claims to be a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection pursuant to the provisions of 96 and Subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act1 on account of his Roma heritage.\n[3] The claimant has asserted that he was subjected to severe and chronic societal and economic discrimination in Hungary because of his Roma ethnicity. He was further attacked on one particular occasion by some so-called \u201cskinheads,\u201d and the police who were called did not seem very interested in protecting this fellow.\n[4] For a more complete and detailed examination or recital of his allegations, one can regard the narrative portion of his Basis of Claim (BOC) Form,2 which has been taken into evidence as Exhibit 2.\n[5] The claimant\u2019s assertions are in keeping with country documents with respect to the plight of the Roma in Hungary. If one were to look at Item 13.5 in the document package, this is Response to Information Request and it is HUN 105586.E and it is dated August 18th, 2016. It says:\nSources indicate that Roma in Hungary face discrimination \u2018in all fields of life,\u2019 including education, housing, employment, health care and political participation. The Hungarian Ombudsman reports that the\u201d[d]isadvantageous social conditions of Roma is aggravated by discrimination especially in the field of education, health, employment, housing and access to services.\u201d According to their 2016 annual report, the office, of the Ombudsman notes that Roma complainants \u201cmost often talk about prejudices present in society, discriminative treatment as well as severe social and accommodation problems.\u201d3 [footnotes omitted]\n[6] It goes on to quote the country reports of the United States State Department of State for 2015 that \u201cstates that unemployment rates for Roma are 3-5 times higher than for non-Roma.\u201d4 [footnotes omitted]\n[7] \u201cIn addition, 78.1 percent of Roma experienced \u201csevere material deprivation in 2014\u2026 \u201c5 and this is in severe contrast to the rest of the population.\n[8] I am also looking at Item 2.1 in the document package which is Hungary: Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, and that\u2019s again the DOS, it\u2019s dated April 23rd, 2018.\nAccording to the EC\u2019s Roma integration indicators scoreboard (2011-16) one-third of Roma lived in households with no toilet, shower or bathroom\u2026.\nIn January the ECHR ruled that police failed to provide adequate protection to two Romani individuals who were attacked with stones and bottles during a demonstration by Jobbik and paramilitary groups in Devecser in 2012 or to conduct a proper investigation of the incident.\nIn February the Supreme Court ruled that local police in Gyongyospata had discriminated against the local Romani community in 2011 by failing to protect them against harassment by extremist groups.6\n[9] Then going on to Item 2.5, which is a United Nations Human Rights Report, it has:\n\u2026 stated that in recent years, Roma had increasingly been victims of displays of intolerance, hostility and racially motivated violence.\u201d [It was recommended] inter alia that Hungary take resolute measures to combat all forms of intolerance, including in political discourse and take further steps to effectively prevent, investigate and sanction all forms of discrimination by members of the police force. HHC recommended that Hungary take measures to combat ethnic profiling by the police affecting the Roma7. [footnotes omitted]\n[10] This speaks to the fact that this young man was continually stopped and asked for identification by the police.\n[11] In Response to Information Request, HUN106145.E, which is 10.1, dated August 17th, 2018, it says;\nA 2018 report by the UN Human Rights Committee indicates that in Hungary there is a \u201cprevalence of hate crimes and \u2026 hate speech targeting minorities,\u201d including Roma, and states that \u201cpolice often fail to investigate and prosecute credible claims of hate crimes and criminal hate speech \u2026 Minority Rights Group \u2026 reports that Roma face a \u201ccontinued hostility\u201d from police forces in Hungary, which includes a \u201cfailure to protect\u201d them from attacks8. [footnotes omitted]\n[12] It goes on and on.\n[13] I am of the view that the country materials disclose that the Hungarian State does not offer effective protection to the Roma minority from hate crimes.\n[14] One of the other pieces of material cited says that the police have a habit of not citing hate crimes as hate crimes upon the due process, they simply process as ordinary criminal offences.9\n[15] The information I have before me indicates that the Roma are subjected to terrible societal discrimination in Hungary, they are subjected to hate crimes on an ongoing basis, they are subjected to harassment by the police, and the Hungarian State through the police force has totally failed to protect these people and for that reason, the claimant I find to be totally credible.\n[16] The claimant has a claim that he is, among other things, a Convention refugee because of his ethnicity, which is a connection or a nexus to a Convention ground.\n[17] Therefore, I find that the allegations of fact made by the claimant in his oral testimony today and in his written narrative are, on the balance of probabilities, true and for the reasons previously stated, the officials and authorities in his own country have failed to protect him. That in my humble opinion makes him a Convention refugee.\n[18] I find that he is a Convention refugee and his claim is hereby accepted.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27 as amended, sections 96 and 97(1).\n\n2 Exhibit 2, Basis of Claim Form (BOC) TB8-04266, received March 5, 2018.\n\n3 Exhibit 3, National Documentation Package (NDP) for Hungary (August 31, 2018), Item 13.5, at pp. 2-3.\n\n4 Ibid., at p. 2.\n\n5 Ibid., at p. 3.\n\n6 Ibid., Item 2.1, at pp. 35-36.\n\n7 Ibid., Item 2.5, at para. 11.\n\n8 Ibid., Item 10.1, at p. 1.\n\n9 Ibid.\n",

On that same day, the panel rendered its oral positive decision and Reasons for decision. This is the written version of the oral decision and Reasons that have been edited for clarity, spelling, grammar and syntax with added references to the documentary evidence and relevant case law where appropriate.\n[1] MEMBER: [XXX], is a citizen of El Salvador seeking refugee protection pursuant to Sections 96 and 97 (1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).1\n[2] Your allegations are described in detail in your Basis of Claim Form (BOC);2 however, they can be summarized as follows:\n[3] You fear persecution at the hands of the Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13), and you believe that this gang caused the disappearance of your brother in [XXX] 2013. Personally, you believe that you have been threatened if you did not transport drugs on their behalf, and you felt this threat was real, given the fate of your brother.\n[4] You left El Salvador on or about [XXX], 2014, for the United States. You were detained, and made a refugee claim, which was denied, and subsequently the appeal was also denied.\n[5] You have indicated in your testimony today that you were extorted, on a regular basis, approximately six months following the disappearance of your brother in [XXX] 2013.\n[6] Finally, on [XXX], 2014, six to seven members of the MS-13 approached you and asked you to transport drugs inside the [XXX] that you were repairing, and when you refused, they immediately punched and kicked you. In your oral testimony today, you also stated that they threatened that you would suffer the same fate as your brother if you did not comply with their demands.\n[7] At the outset of this hearing, I identified the issues of credibility, generalized risk and state protection. Counsel conceded that there was no nexus.\n[8] On a balance of probabilities, I find that your identity has been established as per your passport.3 In considering your credibility, I did not find any glaring omission or contradictions between your testimony and the evidence contained in your record. I did not find that you attempted to embellish the merits of your claim. In totality, I found you to be a credible witness.\n[9] As I indicated earlier, counsel conceded the issue of nexus. There is much case law in this regard, in terms of criminality by gangs, and the country documentary evidence states that the MS-13 are engaged in economically motivated crimes involving extortion, kidnapping, recruitment of youths to aid their cause. There are a number of cases which support the lack of nexus, but since your counsel has conceded this issue, I will go on to consider the issue of generalized risk.\n[10] In examining generalized risk in this particular case, I must look at whether or not there have been consequences as a result of the initial threats, because extortion on its own would be a generalized risk. I must also look at what factors may move your claim from the category of generalized risk into a personalized risk, in other words as it relates to you.\n[11] You have provided much documentation with respect to what happened in El Salvador, with respect to your brother and your father\u2019s attempt to locate him. Therefore, the motive has been established. As I indicated earlier, it began as extortion, and then the precipitating event which led to your departure was a demand for you to transport drugs.\n[12] This may also be the modus operandi of the MS-13 gang. Given the documentation that you have submitted, I concur that this may well be tied to, and certainly indicates that if you did not comply with the perpetrators\u2019 demands, you could meet the same fate as your brother. Therefore, I find that this event removes you from the generalized risk category, into a personalized risk, because of this consequential and heightened risk.\n[13] The objective evidence is extensive in the National Documentation Package (NDP).4 The MS-13 and the 18th Street Gang (Barrio 18) are violent, armed street gangs involved in drug sales, extortion, arms trafficking, murder for hire, carjacking, and aggravated street crime.\n[14] A report by the International Crisis Group indicates that: \u201cThe [MS-13] are both victims of extreme social inequality and the perpetrators of brutal acts of violence.\u201d5\n[15] The murders in El Salvador among the world\u2019s highest rates of homicide,6 the incidents include confrontation with the police, rivalries, score settling, or intimidation carried out by the two outstanding Mara organizations: MS-13 and the Barrio 18.\n[16] I am satisfied that the objective evidence confirms and supports the subjective basis of your fear that you are at risk of harm or death if returned to El Salvador.\n[17] In terms of state protection, you have indicated in your oral testimony about the corruption and the police presence within these gangs. The Immigration and Refugee Board\u2019s NDP indicates that the El Salvadorian authorities are not effective in combating crime.7\n[18] According to the documentary evidence, there have been serious concerns about corruption within the police and judicial systems.8 Therefore, the presumption of state protection is rebutted.\n[19] The United States Department of State\u2019s \u201cEl Salvador 2018 Human Rights Report\u201d indicates that: \u201cimpunity persisted despite government steps to dismiss and prosecute some [officials] in the security forces, executive branch, and justice system\u2026 \u201c9\n[20] The International Crisis Group also indicates that \u201c[c]orruption is prevalent in Salvadoran judicial and security institutions\u2026\u201d10\n[21] Consequently, I conclude that state protection is not adequate.\n[22] Although, not placing the issue of an internal flight alternative (IFA) on the table, in light of the fact that El Salvador is a small country and the Mara Salvatrucha groups operate throughout El Salvador, I do not find a viable IFA in the particular circumstances of your claim.\n[23] I consider that while the average El Salvadorian could be affected by gang related crime, I find that you and your family were singled out.\n[24] Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, I find that you are a person in need of protection pursuant to Section 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, and accordingly your claim is accepted.11\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n1 The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c.27, as amended [IRPA], sections 96 and 97(1).\n\n2 Exhibit 2, Basis of Claim Form (BOC), received January 29, 2018.\n\n3 Exhibit 1, Package of information from the referring CBSA\/IRCC, received January 29, 2018.\n\n4 Exhibit 4, National Document Package (NDP) for El Salvador (September 30, 2019).\n\n5 Ibid., item 7.8.\n\n6 Ibid., item 9.2.\n\n7 Ibid., item 7.6.\n\n8 Ibid., item 9.2.\n\n9 Ibid., item 2.1, Executive Summary.\n\n10 Ibid., item 9.2.\n\n11 IRPA, supra, footnote 1, section 97(1).\n",

        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2019 RLLR 53\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: August 21, 2019\nPanel: S. Seevaratnam\nCounsel for the claimant(s): Ian D. Hamilton\nCountry: India\nRPD Number: TB7-25565\nAssociated RPD Number(s): TB7-25583\nATIP Number: A-2020-01274\nATIP Pages: 000089-000099\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] The claimants [XXX] and her minor son, [XXX], claim to be citizens of India, and they are claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.1\n[2] The adult claimant, [XXX], alleges that she fears returning to India due to membership in a particular social group, as a lesbian. The minor claimant, [XXX] fears returning to Indian, as a member of a particular social group \u2013 family.\n[3] The mother, [XXX], consented to being the designated representative for her minor son, [XXX], for the purposes of the hearing.\n[4] The panel has carefully considered the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9: Proceedings Before the Immigration and Refugee Board Involving Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression (SOGIE),2 prior to assessing the merits of this claim.\n[5] The panel has also carefully considered the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 4: Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution prior to assessing the merits of this claim.3\nALLEGATIONS\n[6] The principal claimant testified that her mother deceased when she was a year old and her father was busy working in the fields, so she was raised by her father\u2019s brother and his wife. The claimant testified that she was born with a [XXX], a [XXX]. She explained that she was constantly compared by her aunt to her aunt\u2019s own children, whom she considered to be beautiful, whereas she would call the claimant \u201cugly.\u201d Furthermore, the aunt would treat her as a servant and keep her busy by making her perform manual labour. This lifelong mistreatment and humiliation led the claimant to attempt suicide at the age of 14 by jumping into a well. She felt isolated and ridiculed. The neighbouring farmers discovered the claimant and saved her.\n[7] The claimant stated that her aunt and uncle sent their children to private schools and she was forced to attend a public school. She befriended a girl named [XXX] ([XXX])4 at school. She stated that [XXX] was in a similar predicament as her and she had a darker complexion. Both the claimant and [XXX] were of the opinion that no man would ever marry them because of their appearances.5 Over time, they formed a good friendship, which led to physical intimacy.\n[8] In grade 11, her relationship with [XXX] was discovered and the claimant was beaten by her father and aunt and her education was prematurely terminated. They arranged a marriage for her which she adamantly opposed. The claimant stated that she was forcibly married at the age of 19 to [XXX],6 who was nine years older than her. She testified that he was a drug addict and alcoholic, and that he was physically and sexually abusive to her. On one occasion, he was so sexually aggressive with the claimant that she started bleeding. She reported the incident as rape to the police and the Inspector of Police asked her to return to her husband and indicated sex was part of marriage.7\n[9] The claimant further explained that she did not enjoy any intimacy with her husband, but he tied her to the bed and frequently forced himself upon her. This led to her unwanted pregnancies. She wanted to terminate her second pregnancy, but the medical staff refused to abort the fetus unless her husband accompanied her to the hospital and consented to the procedure.8 He did not consent and so, she gave birth.\n[10] In [XXX] 2011, her married life of physical and sexual abuse continued and when she continuously attempted to flee her estranged husband\u2019s grip, he forcibly tied her to the bed with a rope and burnt her with a hot rod on five areas of her body.9 The claimant provided photographs of the injuries she sustained and she still bears the physical and psychological scars to this day.10\nDETERMINATION\n[11] The panel finds the claimants to be Convention refugees. The panel\u2019s reasons are as follows.\nIDENTITY\n[12] In Exhibit 1, the claimants have provided copies of their genuine passports issued by the Republic of India which were initially suspected to be fraudulent but later certified to be true copies by an immigration officer on December 24, 2017.11\n[13] In Exhibit 9, the claimant has provided a copy of the minor claimant\u2019s birth certificate12 her 519 orientation training record,13 and her school transfer certificate issued by the Government of Tamil Nadu.14\n[14] In Exhibit 7,15 the principal claimant has provided copies of her membership documents with the 519 Community Centre, a 519 reference letter, photographs of herself with fellow members of the LGBT community, family photos, photos of her scars, and a letter from her brother, [XXX].\n[15] The panel finds the principal claimant to be a lesbian. The panel further finds both claimants to be nationals of the Republic of India.\nCREDIBILITY\n[16] The panel is guided by the leading jurisprudence on the issue of credibility. Maldonado16 stands for the principle that when a claimant swears to the truth of certain allegations, this creates a presumption that those allegations are true unless there is reason to doubt their truthfulness.\n[17] The principal claimant was straightforward when responding to all questions. Her responses were consistent with the notes from the refugee examinations conducted on December 24, 2017, and December 27, 2017.17 Her sworn viva voce testimony was consistent with her Basis of Claim form (BOC)18 and narrative, her personal documents,19 and country condition documents.20\n[18] Having considered the totality of the evidence, the panel finds the principal claimant to be a credible and trustworthy witness. Accordingly, both claimants have established their subjective fear.\nWELL-FOUNDED FEAR OF PERSECUTION\n[19] The panel has sought guidance from reliable and reputable documentary evidence regarding the current plight of homosexual men in India.\n[20] According to the current United States Department of State\u2019s (DOS) \u201c2018 India Human Rights Report\u201d in the National Documentation Package (NDP):21\nOn September 6, the Supreme Court decriminalized same-sex relations in a unanimous verdict. Activists welcomed the verdict but stated it was too early to determine how the verdict would translate into social acceptance, including safe and equal opportunities at workspaces and educational institutions.\nLesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex (LGBTI) persons faced physical attacks, rape, and blackmail. LGBTI groups reported they faced widespread societal discrimination and violence, particularly in rural areas\u2026\n[21] In paving the way for the future of the LGBT community, the landmark decision of Navtej Singh Johar v. Union of India suggests the following:22\nIt is this immense task of combatting the prejudicial attitudes which were encoded in Section 377 which has to continue. Nariman J. was cognisant of this challenge and mandated the Union of lndia to give \u2018wide publicity to the judgment\u2019 and conduct \u2018sensitisation and awareness training for government officials and in particular police officials in the light of observations contained in the judgement\u2019.\nWhile Nariman J. emphasises the role of the Union government in combating prejudice and stereotypes in accordance with the principles of the judgment, Chandrachud J. issues an important plea to civil society to continue to work to combat prejudices and realise full equality for LGBT persons in line with the mandate of a transformative Constitution.\n[22] A World Bank report \u201cestimates homophobia costs India $31 billion (R455bn) a year due to lower educational achievements, loss of labour productivity and the added costs of providing healthcare to LGBT people who are poor, stressed, suicidal or HIV positive.\u201d23\n[23] The Guardian published an article in March 2019 titled, \u201c\u2018There are few gay people in India\u2019: stigma lingers despite legal victory,\u201d24 which states the following:25\nThe stigma still lingers. \u201cIn India, it is a case of ethics,\u201d says Sanjay Paswan, a member of the Bihar state council and former Indian federal minister who opposed the decision to lift the gay ban. \u201c[Gay] people are suffering from some psychological weakness or problem or trauma. There are very [few] of them in India\u2026 \u201c\nThe article further states that \u201c[s]ocial acceptance is lagging far behind legal sanctions.\u201d26\n[24] Counsel for the claimant acknowledged that decriminalizing and eradicating section 377 was a milestone for the LGBT community, but he pointed out that section 377 was specifically targeted at gay men. Counsel further explained that the police have numerous other laws which they utilize to charge members of the LGBT such as Anti-beggary laws,27 Nuisance laws,28 and the Immoral Trafficking Prevention Act.29\n[25] A report by the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) titled \u201cUnnatural Offences: Obstacles to Justice in India Based on Sexual orientation and Gender\u201d, cites the 2015 Report of the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, which has noted:30\n\u201cHuman rights mechanisms continues to emphasize links between criminalization and homophobic and transphobic hate crimes, police abuse, torture, family and community violence and stigmatization, as well as the constraints and criminalization puts on the work of human rights defenders\u201d\u2026\n[26] The documentary evidence highlights the reluctance from many segments of society, including politicians and the police within India, to accept same-sex relationships.\n[27] Accordingly, the panel finds that the claimants are at risk of persecution due to the principal claimant\u2019s membership in a particular social group, as a lesbian, and the minor claimant\u2019s membership in a particular social group, as a family member and the son of a lesbian.\nSTATE PROTECTION\n[28] There is a presumption that except in situations where the state is in complete breakdown, the state is capable of protecting its citizens. To rebut the presumption of state protection, a claimant must provide clear and convincing evidence of the state\u2019s inability to protect its citizens.31\n[29] According to the United Kingdom (UK) Home Office report at item 6.6 of the NDP: \u201cIf the person\u2019s fear is of ill treatment\/persecution at the hands of the state, they will not be able to avail themselves to the protection of the authorities.\u201d32\n[30] The principal claimant testified that she sought police protection when she was raped by her estranged husband and the Inspector of Police asked her to return to him.33 Furthermore, the claimant testified that the police are intolerant towards members of the LGBT community and they have the same biases as the Indian general community. She believes that police protection will not be forthcoming to her as a lesbian and to her minor son, as the child of a lesbian. She further stated that the members of the police force are one of the agents of persecution and they commit violence towards members of the LGBT community. She fears their wrath.\n[31] According an objective and recent Response to Information Request (RIR) conducted by the Immigration and Refugee Board:34\nIn a February 2017 report on obstacles to justice for sexual minorities in India, the ICJ states the following:\nThe attitude and behaviour of the police is one of the biggest barriers to queer persons\u2019 access to the justice system in India. Several people spoke to the ICJ bout the violence, abuse and harassment they suffered at the hands of the police. Furthermore, in several cases, the police have refused to file complaints submitted by queer persons owing to bias or stereotypes.\nThe same source adds that\n[q]ueer people\u2019s trust in the police is further eroded by the frequency of their negative interactions with police, for instance, when attempting to register complaints regarding violence and other crimes against them at the hands of private individuals. The police\u2019s refusal to file such complaints has seriously detrimental impact on queer persons\u2019 access to justice and redress.\nUS Country Reports 2018 states that \u201c[s]ome police committed crimes against LGBTI persons and used the threat of arrest to coerce victims not to report the incidents.\u201d [footnotes omitted]\n[32] In light of the above, \u201cthe ICJ is concerned that the police\u2019s negative attitude towards queer people in India puts them at an increased risk of violence from non-State actors as well.\u201d35\n[33] Furthermore, the ICJ finds that \u201c[d]emands for justice and accountability for police abuses have led to direct forms of reprisal by the police against those denouncing their abuses.\u201d36\n[34] In addition, \u201c[s]everal people also told the ICJ that they believed that a lack of willing and experienced lawyers who were sensitive to issues of gender, sexuality, and queer rights in India hindered the possibility of obtaining justice in courts.\u201d37\n[35] Finally, the ICJ report notes that, \u201cthere are few legal remedies in the law for the violence and discrimination faced by queer persons. This also makes it difficult to approach the court with cases.\u201d38\n[36] The NDP39 and the documents submitted by the claimants40 make clear that the state is the agent of persecution and, in these particular circumstances, is clear and convincing evidence that the state is unable or unwilling to protect the claimant.\n[37] Accordingly, the panel finds that the claimants have met the burden of proof, on a balance of probabilities, and the presumption of state protection has been rebutted.\n[38] For the above-mentioned reasons, it is evident that state protection would not be forthcoming for the principal claimant due to her sexual orientation and her minor son.\nINTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE (IFA)\n[39] The Federal Court of Appeal established a two-part test for assessing an IFA in Rasaratnam and Thirunavukkarasu:\n(1) As per Rasaratnam, \u201cthe Board must be satisfied on a balance of probabilities that there is no serious possibility of the claimant being persecuted in the part of the country to which it finds an IFA exists\u201d41 and\/or the claimant would not be personally subject to a risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture in the IFA.\n(2) Moreover, the conditions in the part of the country considered to be an IFA must be such that it would not be unreasonable in all the circumstances including those particular to the claim, for him to seek refuge there.42\n[40] The claimants bear the burden of proof to demonstrate that they would be persecuted on a Convention ground, or subject personally, on a balance of probabilities, to a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in all of India.\n[41] Regarding internal relocation, the UK Home Office report states that \u201c[w]here the person\u2019s fear is of persecution and \/or serious harm by the state, they will not be able to relocate to escape that risk.\u201d43\n[42] The UK Office further finds that \u201cIndia is a vast, diverse, multicultural country, Communities vary considerable not only in size, but also in their religious, ethnic, economic and political composition \u2013 and in the extent of their adherence to traditional social and family values.\u201d44\n[43] According to a recent Response to Information Request (RIR) conducted by the Immigration and Refugee Board reports the following:45\nIndia Spend reports that single women have to \u201cdepend [on] somebody\u2019s goodwill \u2013 in-laws, parents brothers and sisters-in-law\u201d in order to provide for them and their children \u2026 [Furthermore,] single women encounter \u201cserious struggles with basic life issues such as getting a flat on rent or being taken seriously as a start-up entrepreneur or getting a business loan or even getting an abortion.\u201d [footnotes omitted]\n[44] The claimant testified that was used as a servant by her aunt and uncle and she was forced to perform menial tasks at home. She further explained that this was an obstacle to completing her homework and she was often punished by her teachers at school. In addition, when her father and aunt discovered her relationship with [XXX], a female school mate, they terminated her education and forced her into a marriage that she vehemently opposed. Thus, given her limited education, her estranged abusive husband, the lack of family support and as a single lesbian mother, the claimant would face a reasonable possibility of persecution from the Indian community and the Indian police, irrespective of where she lived within India. He minor son would also be subjected to ridicule and mistreatment due his relationship to his mother, a lesbian.\n[45] A recent article in the New Yorker titled, \u201cIndia\u2019s Historic Gay- Rights Ruling and the Slow March of Progress\u201d46 concludes the following:47\nA country decolonizes itself slowly. The Supreme Court\u2019s decision on Section 377 snips away one more tether binding India to its colonial past. But the verdict resembles a strong beam of light only because it pierces through the stormy, illiberal weather around it. The other problems besetting India- a hideous right\u00ad wing Hindu nationalism; unpunished violence against minorities and lower castes; political corruption; arrests of civic activists under trumped-up accusations; yawning disparities of wealth; the spoiling, perishing environment \u2013 are all homemade. They cannot be blamed on anyone else; that heaviness of responsibility is part of the compact of growing up. For allowing these dysfunctions to flare, and for failing to stamp them out, India will be able to blame no one but herself.\n[46] Having carefully considered the totality of the evidence, the panel finds that there is a serious risk of persecution throughout the Republic of India. Thus, in the particular circumstances of the claimant, who is a lesbian single mother with a minor son, an internal flight alternative is unavailable.\nCONCLUSION\n[47] The panel finds [XXX] and [XXX] to be Convention refugees. They have established that there is a reasonable chance of persecution if they were to return to their country of nationality, India, today.\n(signed) S.

Kushner\nCounsel for the claimant(s): Jasmina Mrkalj-Skelly\nCountry: Lebanon\nRPD Number: TB7-24110\nATIP Number: A-2020-01274\nATIP Pages: 000080-000088\nREASONS FOR DECISION\nINTRODUCTION\n[1] The claimant, a 74-year-old stateless Palestinian, is seeking refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).1\nDETERMINATION\n[2] The panel determines that the claimant is a Convention refugee because she faces a serious possibility of persecution in her country of former habitual residence, Lebanon, due to her membership in a particular social group, namely as the family member of a political opponent of Hezbollah.\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] The allegations respecting the basis of the claimant\u2019s fear in Lebanon are set out in her Basis of Claim (BOC) form.2\n[4] The claimant and several members of her family have been targeted for violence and extortion by armed groups in Lebanon. Most recently, the claimant herself was targeted after her son was kidnapped by Hezbollah after coming into conflict with his wife\u2019s brother, who is a member of Hezbollah. After the claimant attempted to relocate to another part of Lebanon, she was located, threatened and assaulted by members of Hezbollah, who view her and her family as being in opposition to them. Hezbollah view the family as opponents because male members of the family, including her son [XXX], have consistently refused to associate themselves with or otherwise support the group.\n[5] The claimant fears that she will be harmed or killed by Hezbollah if she returns to Lebanon.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity and Statelessness\n[6] The claimant was born in Palestine in 1945, fled Palestine during the war in 1948 and lived in [XXX] in Lebanon until she fled to Canada in 2017. Though born in Palestine and living for many years in Lebanon, the claimant has no citizenship in any country.\n[7] On a balance of probabilities, the panel finds that the claimant has established that she is a stateless Palestinian whose country of former habitual residence is Lebanon. This is based on her testimony, the testimony of her son [XXX], who appeared as a witness, as well as the claimant\u2019s Lebanon ID Card, Lebanon Travel Document for Palestinian Refugees, Lebanon General Security Travel Document, and her various Canadian Temporary Residence Visas.3\n[8] Based on this evidence, the panel finds on a balance of probabilities that the claimant is not a citizen of any country. Her significant period of de facto residence in Lebanon for more than 70 years leads the panel to the conclusion that her only country of former habitual residence is Lebanon. The panel finds that she does not have a right to return to or obtain citizenship in any other country. The country of reference for this claim is therefore determined to be Lebanon.\nCredibility\n[9] The panel had some credibility concerns with respect to certain aspects of the claimant\u2019s testimony. However, in assessing this case the panel was cognizant of the claimant\u2019s advanced age and her limited formal education.4\n[10] The panel\u2019s concerns arose mainly from the claimant\u2019s difficulty in recounting details of incidents set out in her BOC. In testimony, she admitted that her daughter, [XXX] and her son, [XXX] had both been with her while she was completing her BOC and helped her write her narrative.\n[11] A thorough review of the BOC shows that, for the most part, the only incidents in which the claimant was directly involved occurred after her son [XXX] had fled the country. The panel is of the view that, more likely than not, the claimant was assisted to recount stories in her BOC that had occurred to other members of her family (as is clear from the narrative) but of which she had little firsthand knowledge. The panel\u2019s concerns were largely addressed by the testimony of her son [XXX] who was able to recount in greater detail the reasons for his flight from Lebanon and how this situation affected his mother:\nThe claimant\u2019s son [XXX], who is also a stateless Palestinian, fled Lebanon in 2015 and was recognised as a Convention refugee by the Refugee Protection Division in [XXX] 2017.5 [XXX] testimony and the reasons for his recognition as a Convention refugee in Canada, corroborate the claimant\u2019s story as follows: that [XXX] had come into conflict with Hezbollah and with his ex-wife\u2019s brother, [XXX], who was also a member of Hezbollah;\n[XXX] had been kidnapped by Hezbollah outside of Beirut in July of 2015 and suffered fairly severe injuries during his captivity;\nAfter [XXX] departed Lebanon the claimant started to receive threats from the same persons who had kidnapped and threatened him, and;\n[XXX] had tried to have a committee from [XXX] intervene on his behalf with Hezbollah but that these efforts were rebuffed by [XXX].\n[12] As stated above, the panel also considered the claimant\u2019s age and educational background in coming to its decision. The panel finds that the claimant tried to be as forthcoming as possible and to recount events to the best of her ability. As it relates to the events that she experienced following her son\u2019s departure from Lebanon, the panel found the claimant to be credible.\n[13] The panel therefore finds that the claimant does have a credible fear of the persons who had attacked her son and that she did start to receive threats after he had finally departed Lebanon.\nRe-availment and Delay in Claiming in Canada\n[14] While re-availment or delay may not necessarily be determinative of a particular claim, they might be evidence of a lack of subjective fear on behalf of the claimant.\n[15] The claimant travelled to Canada on three previous occasions prior to her arrival in [XXX] 2017, returning to Lebanon each time. There are copies of Canadian Temporary Resident Visas on record for each of these trips.6 The last of these was between [XXX] 2014 and [XXX] of 2015 with the claimant returning to Lebanon on [XXX] 2015.\n[16] With regard to her previous trips to Canada and return to Lebanon, the claimant testified that it was never her intention to claim refugee status on those trips. The panel finds this consistent with her statements that it was only after [XXX] had finally left Lebanon for good, after being assaulted and tortured by Hezbollah in [XXX] 2015, that the claimant herself came into conflict with a member of Hezbollah and she began to fear for her own safety.\n[17] With regard to her most recent trip to Canada, the claimant delayed in making her claim for approximately [XXX] weeks (she arrived in Canada on [XXX] 2017 and submitted her claim on 3 December 2017). In testimony, the claimant stated that her intention was to return to Lebanon once the situation there had settled. However, while in Canada the claimant was informed by her daughter, [XXX], that the claimant\u2019s home in [XXX] had been taken over by Hezbollah and that Hezbollah continued to seek the claimant out. It was then that the claimant realized it would not be possible for her to return to Lebanon.\n[18] The panel finds that this explanation is reasonable under the circumstances and is consistent with the explanation provided in her BOC.\n[19] The panel therefore finds the claimant\u2019s subjective fear is not impugned by this delay or the fact that she had returned to Lebanon after her previous trips to Canada.\nObjective Basis \u2013 Country Conditions\n[20] The country conditions outlined in the National Documentation Package (NDP) include reports which speak to the systemic discrimination facing Palestinians who reside in Lebanon, as well as the general security conditions in the country, particularly within the Palestinian camps.7 It shows that Palestinian refugees in Lebanon suffer from severe discrimination and are denied basic civil and political rights, regardless of their long term residence in the country.\n[21] Lebanon is not a signatory to the 1951 Convention or the 1967 protocol and does not recognize the basic rights of people with refugee status.8\n[22] Palestinian refugees who live in Lebanon are denied citizenship rights and are subjected to racism, arbitrary arrest, kidnapping and torture.9\n[23] Human rights abuses persist within the Palestinian camps and in Lebanon in general. These include the arbitrary arrest and detention of Palestinians by autonomous Palestinian security groups.10 The documentation confirms the claimant\u2019s allegation that Hezbollah and other factions extra-judicially arrest and abuse refugees.\nAuthorities failed to observe many provisions of the law, and government security forces, as well as extralegal armed groups such as Hizballah, continued the practice of extrajudicial arrest and detention, including incommunicado detention.\n\u2026\nNGOs reported that most cases involved vulnerable groups such as refugees \u2026 11\n[24] These armed groups operate without the supervision of any official judicial systems.12\n[25] The documentation also supports the claimant\u2019s assertion that her family had tried to resolve their issue with Hezbollah through a committee in [XXX]. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees [UNHCR] has reported that:\nPalestinian groups in refugee camps operated an autonomous and arbitrary system of justice outside the control of the state. For example, local popular committees in the camps attempted to resolve disputes using tribal methods of reconciliation.13\n[26] The objective evidence therefore corroborates the general elements of the claimant\u2019s allegations, including the impunity with which Hezbollah and other armed groups operate in Lebanon.\n[27] Having considered all of this evidence, the panel finds that the claimant faces more than a mere possibility of persecution based on her membership in a particular social group, namely as the family member of a political opponent of Hezbollah.\nState Protection and Internal Flight Alternative\n[28] A state is presumed to be able to provide adequate state protection. To rebut the presumption of state protection, a claimant must provide \u201cclear and convincing evidence.\u201d14 The claimant must establish that state protection in inadequate. If the claimant is able to show the absence of protection anywhere in the country, there will be no internal flight alternative (IFA).\n[29] The claimant\u2019s testimony and the documentary evidence referenced above make it clear that state protection or relocation within Lebanon are not options for the claimant. Severe discrimination against Palestinians is widespread and systematic throughout all the country, particularly outside of the refugee camps.15 The US Department of State notes that, \u201d \u2026 Hizballah, and other extremist elements operated outside the direction or control of government officials.\u201d16\n[30] Within the camps, UNHCR reports that:\nPalestinian individuals may reportedly be at risk of being subjected to harassment, threats or abuse at the hands of militant factions in the camps. As the Lebanese authorities have no access to the camps (with the exception of Nahr El-Bared Camp), those at risk can reportedly not seek protection from the Lebanese authorities.17\n[31] This is consistent with the claimant\u2019s statement that she did not seek protection from the authorities because Lebanese authorities are not present in the camps and do not protect the refugees there. The panel therefore concludes that the claimant would not be able to access state protection anywhere in Lebanon.\n[32] With regard to an internal flight alternative, the panel further notes that the claimant did try to relocate from [XXX] to [XXX] and that Hezbollah was able to locate her there.\n[33] The panel therefore finds, on a balance of probabilities, that neither adequate state protection nor an internal flight alternative is available to the claimant.\nCONCLUSION\n[34] Having considered the totality of the evidence, based on the foregoing analysis, the panel finds the claimant\u2019s fear of persecution in Lebanon to be well-founded. The panel finds the claimant is a Convention refugee and therefore accepts her claim.\n(signed) D. Morris\nConcurred in by: (signed) L. Hartslief\n(signed) J.

        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2019 RLLR 51\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: September 11, 2019\nPanel: Milton Israel\nCounsel for the claimant(s): Ronald Yacoub\nCountry: India\nRPD Number: TB7-23722\nATIP Number: A-2020-01274\nATIP Pages: 000074-000079\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] [XXX], the principal claimant, and [XXX], his wife and the associate claimant, citizens of India, seek refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).1\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] The Basis of Claim Form (BOC) of the principal claimant (hereafter the claimant) represented both claimants.2\n[3] The claimant alleges in his narrative that he and his wife were threatened and attacked by members of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a Hindu nationalist organization that supports the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the ruling party in India.\n[4] The claimant further alleges that RSS members attempted to kill him on [XXX], 2017, as well as a few times earlier. The reason for these attempts was a statement that the claimant made at his Gurdwara, indicating that people should be able to eat any meat they desired, including beef. This was considered to be an insult to Hindus who considered the cow to be holy.\n[5] The claimant received threats from the RSS and went to the police, but received no help. The threats also made an impact on his health, causing [XXX], [XXX], [XXX], and [XXX]. As a result, he and his wife moved to Amritsar, and stayed with his nephew. However, extremists followed him there, and he received a death threat. He went to the police again, but received no help.\n[6] On [XXX], 2017, the claimant and his wife returned to their home in [XXX]. The next day, members of the RSS attacked his home, and the claimant was beaten. On [XXX], the claimant and his wife went to New Delhi, where he received first aid, and on [XXX], they left India and came to Canada.\n[7] On [XXX], 2017, their house was attacked again. The claimant alleges that they assumed he was there, and would have killed him if he had not left India.\nTHE ISSUE\n[8] The determinative issue in this claim is credibility.\n[9] The panel questioned the claimant concerning his allegations. He was asked how Hindu nationalists heard about his statement as he made it in a Gurdwara. The claimant explained that there was a nearby Hindu temple, and Hindus often came to the Gurdwara.\n[10] The panel noted that the three affidavits he disclosed concerning the incident in the Gurdwara were word for word exactly the same,3 and the claimant was asked how that was possible if they were prepared independently. The claimant explained they were given in Punjabi, and then translated into English. The panel noted the Punjabi originals were not disclosed, and the claimant explained they were prepared for Canada. The panel is not persuaded that the three affidavits were prepared independently, and finds that the word for word replication reduces their evidentiary weight as to the claimant\u2019s allegations.\n[11] The claimant was questioned as to the alleged attempt of the RSS to kill him on [XXX], 2017. He described being dragged out of his house and beaten. The claimant was asked if there was an attempt to kill him, and he testified that they had no knife or gun. He further testified that his wife screamed, and neighbors came and the perpetrators ran away.\n[12] The panel noted that the claimant indicated in his narrative that there were other attempts to kill him, and the claimant was asked to describe those incidents. The claimant testified as to the threats, and his trouble recalling these incidents. The panel notes that no substantive evidence was provided, either in the claimant\u2019s narrative or in testimony, which concerned such alleged incidents. Subsequently, the claimant testified that between 2014, when the Gurdwara incident occurred, and 2017, when his house was attacked, there were only threats.\n[13] The panel noted that the claimant disclosed four affidavits concerning the alleged attack on [XXX], 2017.4 The panel further noted that the four affidavits are exactly the same. The claimant provided the same explanation as in the case of the affidavits concerning the Gurdwara incident. The panel finds, again, that there is a significant doubt that these affidavits were prepared independently, and gives them reduced evidentiary weight.\n[14] The claimant\u2019s son, [XXX], a resident of Canada, appeared as a witness in the hearing. He testified that he visited India, and talked to his parents\u2019 neighbors and officials in the Gurdwara. They confirmed the claimant\u2019s allegations regarding his speech in the Gurdwara, and the attack on his home. He further testified that he visited his parents\u2019 home, and was attempting to repair some broken windows and a door, when he was attacked by two men. He ran to another house, and subsequently received medication and therapy for an injury to his shoulder.\n[15] The witness also testified that his father, who is 70 years old, was being medicated for his diminishing mental abilities, which resulted from the trauma he experienced in India. The panel notes a medical document was disclosed in this regard.5 Moreover, the witness stated that the claimant dictated his narrative to his daughter-in-law, but his mental state was not normal at the time.\n[16] The panel finds that the claimant testified in a straightforward manner. The panel further finds that it has credibility concerns about the affidavits disclosed by the claimant, and the claimant\u2019s allegations about multiple efforts to kill him without evidentiary support. The panel notes that the claimant changed his testimony in this regard in the hearing.\n[17] The panel further finds that while the affidavits have been found to be of reduced evidentiary weight because of the content duplication, their corroboration of the claimant\u2019s allegations is not totally undermined.\n[18] In regard to the panel\u2019s concern about the credibility of some of the claimant\u2019s testimony, it notes that the evidence provided by the claimant\u2019s son and in medical documentation, provides a credible explanation concerning the claimant\u2019s diminished mental condition.\n[19] The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant has been a credible witness as to his allegations concerning his Gurwara remarks, and the resulting attacks by members of the RSS.\n[20] The panel notes that it indicated at the beginning of the hearing that even if the claimant\u2019s allegations concerning his RSS risk are found to be credible, he has an internal flight alternative (IFA) available to him in Mumbai.\n[21] The panel questioned the claimant as to his possible resettlement in Mumbai if he believed he and his wife were unsafe in Punjab. The claimant responded that Sikhs were a minority community, and the RSS was everywhere in India. The panel noted that Sikhs lived in all parts of India, and that there was no constraint on their doing so. The claimant responded that Mumbai was costly, and the panel noted that, like all major cities, there were less expensive communities on the periphery of the expensive center. The claimant further testified that there was a bias in favor of Maharashtrians, but the panel noted that Mumbai remained a cosmopolitan metropolis. The claimant responded that he had lived his life in a small community, and he did not have many more years to live.\n[22] The panel has considered the two prongs of the IFA test, and acknowledges that both prongs must be satisfied for finding that the claimants have an IFA.6 While the panel is satisfied with the requirement of the first prong, that there is no serious possibility of the claimants being persecuted in the part of the country to which it finds an IFA exits, the requirement of the second prong, that the conditions in the part of the country considered to be an IFA must be such that it would not be unreasonable in all the circumstances, including those particular to the claimant, for him to seek refuge there, has not been met.\nCONCLUSION\n[23] The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, and in the context of the evidence concerning the claimant\u2019s age and mental health, that an IFA in India is not available to him. The panel further finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the principal claimant and the associate claimant cannot return to India without the risks pursuant to section 97(1) of the IRPA. Therefore, their claims are accepted.\n(signed) Milton Israel\nDecember 11, 2019\n1 The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c.27, as amended, sections 96 and 97(1).\n\n2 Exhibit 2, Basis of Claim Form (BOC) \u2013 TB7-23722.\n\n3 Exhibit 5, Claimant\u2019s Disclosure, at pp. 23, and 28-29.\n\n4 Exhibit 5, Claimant\u2019s Disclosure, at pp. 24-25, 27, and 30.\n\n5 Ibid., at p. 74.\n\n6 Rasaratnam, Sivaganthan v.

Eng\nCounsel for the claimant(s): John A Salam\nCountry: Hungary\nRPD Number: TB7-23388\nAssociated RPD Number(s): TB7-23443, TB7-23444, TB7-23445, TB7-23460\nATIP Number: A-2020-01274\nATIP Pages: 000069-000073\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: This is the decision in the claims of principal claimant [XXX]; her three children [XXX], [XXX] and [XXX]; along with her common-law partner [XXX]; in RPD File Numbers TB7-23388, TB7-23443, TB7-23444, TB7-23445 and TB7-23460.\n[2] The claimants are citizens of Hungary and they are claiming refugee protection pursuant to Section 96 and Subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[3] The facts and events alleged in support of their claims are set out in their respective Basis of Claim Forms. In summary, the claimants allege persecution in Hungary on the basis of their ethnic Roma identity.\n[4] The panel finds that the claimants are Convention refugees within the meaning of Section 96 of the IRPA.\n[5] The claimants\u2019 identities were established as citizens of Hungary through their passports and the passports which were seized by CBSA. The panel is therefore satisfied that the claimants have met their burden and established their identities.\n[6] Based on its consideration of the totality of the evidence including the claimants\u2019 testimonies, the panel finds on a balance of probabilities that the claimants are ethnic Roma. The principal claimant was the only claimant that testified at the hearing. The panel finds that the claimant testified in a straightforward fashion with regard to the central element of her claim.\n[7] The panel finds that the claimant\u2019s overall testimony was credible and accepts on a balance of probabilities that she has faced discrimination that would rise to the level of persecution and would continue to face a serious possibility of persecution on a forward-looking basis should the claimants return to Hungary.\n[8] In their Basis of Claim Forms and in the principal claimant\u2019s testimony, the claimant provided in detail regarding a number of incidences of discrimination in Hungary which the panel would summarise.\n[9] The claimant has around a grade [XXX] education, which she testified was the result of discriminatory attitudes towards Roma students in school and was not able to continue.\n[10] The claimant testified how her three children also experienced discrimination in school because of their Roma ethnicity. The claimant testified about housing problems in Hungary and visits from the Children\u2019s Aid Society in Hungary. The claimant testified how unpaid debts led to the water and electricity being disconnected to the house and a visit from the Children\u2019s Aid Society over the conditions with her children.\n[11] The claimant had testified how she had moved into this house which was her ex-husband\u2019s around the year 2000. The claimant testified how after the visit from Children\u2019s Aid Society, she moved into a side cabin by her parent\u2019s house and also talked about her divorce from her ex-husband around the same time. The claimant testified about the side cabin not having proper running water or bathroom facilities.\n[12] She indicated how the Children\u2019s Aid Society came to see her again and that she had to move in with the parents of her current common-law partner. The claimant testified how the Children\u2019s Aid Society followed up with another visit and indicated that that house was too small for her and all the children to live in. The claimant described how she tried to find housing to rent but was turned away due to the number of children she had and also because of her Roma ethnicity. Claimant testified about the Children\u2019s Aid Society threatening to take away her children and that being the main reason for fleeing Hungary.\n[13] The claimant also testified about her attempts to obtain employment, but how she was only able to find temporary work under the table because of her Roma identity.\n[14] The claimant spoke about not receiving proper medical treatment and suffering from an infection from a caesarean section delivery.\n[15] The claimant also testified about her common-law partner and her son being attacked by ultranationalist Hungarians by bus stop. The panel found the claimant\u2019s testimonies to be credible and lacking in embellishment.\n[16] The panel did have concerns regarding the claimant\u2019s testimony regarding the auction of her ex\u00ad husband\u2019s house after their divorce, which the claimant would have been entitled to half of the profits of the sale. The claimant testified that she did not know what happened to the house after speaking to the executor and whether it had been auctioned off. The claimant did not follow up again about the matter despite having the phone number and address for the person responsible for this sale, and did not provide any further documentation regarding the proceedings and sale of the house.\n[17] The panel finds the claimant\u2019s testimony regarding the sale not credible as the panel finds the claimant would have sought further information on profits that she would have or might have been able to receive or even to further establish this claim. However, the panel finds that the concerns with the auction or sale of the house do not negate the panel\u2019s other findings where the testimony and evidence were persuasive in showing that the claimants have experienced serious, systemic and repetitive discrimination.\n[18] The panel finds cumulatively that the discrimination the claimants faced including in areas of education, employment, housing and health care, that they have experienced discrimination rising to the level of persecution in Hungary.\n[19] There is also evidence to suggest State protection has not been adequately available to the claimants. The country documentation for Hungary is broadly consistent with what the claimant has indicated will happen to them. The National Documentation Package for Hungary indicates that Roma experienced widespread discrimination in housing, employment, education and treatment and accessing health care. Based on the claimant\u2019s testimony, the panel finds that there has been systematic societal discrimination against the claimants being Roma which affected their access to adequate education, health care and employment.\n[20] Regarding State protection, though Hungary is a functioning democracy and is a member of State of the European Union and though the documentary evidence tells me that Hungary is attempting to make changes to improve the situation for Roma, serious problems remain today.\n[21] Based on these country conditions and based on the claimant\u2019s testimony, which the panel has found to be credible, the panel is satisfied that State protection would neither be adequate or forthcoming. There are multiple instances recorded of Roma individuals seeking protection and being subjected to racist or discriminatory actions by police. The panel finds that claimant\u2019s own actions and failing to seek out State protection are reasonably explained.\n[22] The panel also finds that there is no internal flight alternative available to the claimants as the problems of discrimination and the response by the police and authorities seem to be nationwide.\n[23] Having considered all of the evidence, the panel finds that [XXX], [XXX], [XXX], [XXX] and [XXX] are Convention refugees and have established a serious risk of persecution, and the panel accepts their claim.\n[24] I will now allow the other members to indicate whether or not they concur with the panel\u2019s decision.\n[25] DANIEL MCKEOWN: I concur.\n[26] KATRINA PIKE: I concur, but for slightly different reasons that I will now give.\n[27] Well, I broadly concur with the reasons of my colleagues though different from their finding in one important regard.\n[28] I find that you did not face the issues that you put forward in terms of housing and child protective services before you left Hungary.\n[29] You owned, madam, a home in Hungary. The preponderance of the evidence before me, I find, supports that you continue to live in that home. Your ID documents continue to state that you had that as your address. When you came to Canada, you have listed that as your address, and you provided no documentary evidence to support that you ever lived anywhere else.\n[30] In addition, as noted by my colleagues, you provided one document related to the sale of that home. It showed that the sale did not occur. Despite having the specific contact information for someone intimately involved in that sale, you did not provide any further evidence to support any other aspect of that sale.\n[31] And so on that important point, I do find that the evidence doesn\u2019t support your allegations. However, on a forward-looking basis, I do find that the evidence that you have provided that is credible does support that your housing situation going forward would be precarious given the attempt to sell of the home to recover debt.\n[32] The other evidence you provided today with regard to what you faced as Roma in education and work and with regard to experiencing racist incidents was credible, as it was internally consistent and consistent with the broader country documentation. You are all likely to experience discrimination in housing going forward given the country documentation.\n[33] So, I do agree with the reasons put forward by my colleagues regarding how and why the evidence supports that given what you face upon return to Hungary, you do face persecution, as well as their reasons for why there is no State protection or internal flight alternative available to you.\n[34] MEMBER: Thank you.\n[35] So, that concludes the decision.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2019 RLLR 49\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: April 10, 2019\nPanel: James Waters\nCounsel for the claimant(s): Yasmine Abuzgaya\nCountry: Bangladesh\nRPD Number: TB7-22737\nATIP Number: A-2020-01274\nATIP Pages: 000060-000068\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] The claimant, [XXX], claims to be a citizen of Bangladesh and claims refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).1\n[2] In assessing her claim, I considered Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 4, Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution.2\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] After a brief courtship, the claimant entered into an arranged marriage in Bangladesh with a permanent resident of Canada, in [XXX] 2015.3\n[4] Her husband returned to Canada shortly after the marriage, and in [XXX] of 2016, he submitted an undertaking to sponsor the claimant\u2019s spousal application for permanent residence in Canada.\n[5] Her husband returned to Bangladesh to visit her in the spring of 2016. Problems over dowry issues between the respective families surfaced during this visit, escalating from heated arguments to threats of physical violence.\n[6] The claimant alleges that she was verbally, physically and sexually abused by her husband during this visit.\n[7] The spouses attempted to reconcile, and made a trip together to India in [XXX] of 2016. Her husband returned to Canada at the end of [XXX] of 2016.\n[8] The claimant alleges that she was stalked and threatened by her husband\u2019s family and friends after he returned to Canada.\n[9] The claimant arrived in Canada on [XXX], 2016 with a visa authorizing her to enter Canada, and told the immigration officer she wished to reconcile and reside with her sponsor.\n[10] Her husband was notified of her arrival by an immigration official and attended at the airport, where he advised IRCC that he had withdrawn his undertaking to sponsor her and did not want to reconcile and have her reside with him.\n[11] She made her refugee claim inland on November 3, 2017, after being advised that she was in breach of a condition requiring her to reside with her sponsor. The admissibility hearing was cancelled after she made her refugee claim.\nIDENTITY\n[12] The national identity of the claimant as a citizen of Bangladesh was established by her oral testimony in the Bengali language, and the supporting documentation filed.4\n[13] The supporting documentation included copies of her valid passport, birth certificate and school records.5 Originals of the birth certificate and school records produced by the claimant were made available to the RPD prior to the hearing.\n[14] In the statutory declaration the claimant\u2019s sponsor alleged that the claimant had filed a falsified birth certificate as part of her application for permanent residence to conceal that she was born on [XXX], 1998, rather than [XXX], 1997.6 A translated copy of a birth certificate showing the claimant\u2019s birthdate as [XXX], 1998 was attached to the statutory declaration.7\n[15] An affidavit of a lawyer at the [XXX] described the online searches performed by that lawyer to confirm that the [XXX], 1997 birth date in the birth certificate produced by the claimant matched that in the online records searched by the affiant.8 The affiant described the similar searches she conducted, unsuccessfully, on the online registry to verify the [XXX], 1998 birthdate indicated in the copy of a birth certificate produced by the sponsor in his statutory declaration.\n[16] Having regard to the evidence submitted the claimant established on a balance of probabilities that she is the person she says she is, and that she was born on [XXX], 1997.9\n[17] There were discrepancies between the claimant\u2019s consistent oral and written testimony, and the inconsistent information in the spousal Sponsorship Questionnaire.10 as to when the couple met. The claimant explained that she had signed blank spousal sponsorship forms and returned them to her sponsor who hired an immigration consultant to fill them in and submit them.\n[18] There was abundant evidence in the form of a marriage certificate, wedding photographs11 as well as the statutory declaration of her sponsor to establish on a balance of probabilities the marriage ceremony and the registration of the marriage.12\n[19] A copy of a certificate of divorce was sent to IRCC by her sponsor, which indicates that her sponsor divorced her effective [XXX], 2017.13\n[20] A copy of a pending application and supporting affidavit to set aside the divorce judgment, based on improper service of the Petition for Divorce, was filed.14\nCREDIBILITY\n[21] The standard of proof for assessing evidence as well as credibility is a balance of probabilities that the evidence is, more likely than not, true.15 When a claimant swears to the truth to certain allegations, this creates a presumption that those allegations are true unless there is a reason to doubt their truthfulness.16 In assessing the credibility of a claimant, the panel is entitled to make reasonable findings based on implausibility, common sense and rationality, and may reject evidence if it is not consistent with the probabilities affecting the case as a whole.\n[22] The claimant\u2019s oral testimony as to the spousal abuse she suffered at the hands of her former husband was generally consistent with that described in her personal narrative17 and the description contained in a psychological assessment report filed.18\n[23] The claimant was confronted with the fact that her husband was not aware of her travel plans. She testified that she had tried to inform her husband, but he had discontinued contact. She hoped to reconcile with him after coming to Canada.\n[24] The claimant testified that while their relationship had broken down before she came to Canada, neither her husband, nor IRCC had informed her that he had withdrawn or wished to withdraw his sponsorship until after she had arrived in Canada.\n[25] A credibility concern explored at the hearing was why the claimant would chose to reconcile in Canada with an abusive spouse who had assaulted and sexually abused her on his previous trip to Bangladesh, and who apparently did not want her to come to Canada.\n[26] The claimant noted cultural and social mores, as well as family pressures in Bangladesh against a woman leaving a spousal relationship.\n[27] In her written submissions claimant\u2019s counsel submitted that women facing domestic and intimate partner abuse chose to return to the relationship for a variety of cultural, religious and financial realities including fears of increased abuse post separation.19\n[28] The claimant\u2019s counsel cited excerpts from the expert opinion letter of [XXX], outlining a number of factors influencing abused woman to stay in an abusive relationship.20 Claimant\u2019s counsel also cited a Human Rights Watch Report that mentioned financial dependency amongst other factors relevant to abused woman in Bangladesh.21\n[29] The claimant testified as to her father being harassed and threatened in Bangladesh over unresolved dowry issues, and the breakdown of the marriage both before and after she came to Canada. This oral and written testimony was supported by a translated excerpt from a diary provided to the police.22\n[30] An affidavit from a relative in Canada, and a notarized statement and letters from family in Bangladesh and Canada supported her oral and written testimony as to her fear of harm from her husband and his family and friends, if she returned to Bangladesh.23\n[31] Having regard to all of the evidence submitted that did not include the oral testimony of her former spouse, the claimant established on a balance of probabilities, the allegations of verbal, physical, sexual and psychological abuse outlined in her narrative.\nObjective Basis\n[32] The documentary evidence indicates that domestic violence is rampant in Bangladesh and that it \u201coccurs for many reasons, most often connected to dowry demands.\u201d24\n[33] The documentary evidence indicates that, in Bangladesh, violence within a relationship is generally seen as private matter, and that there is a general acceptance of violence against women and girls.25 Despite a raft of legislation, enforcement remains weak, and the few offenders who are prosecuted receive minor punishments if any at all.26\n[34] Corruption within the police and judicial system was identified in the United States Department of State Report as a general problem preventing fair trials.27 A United Nations Human Rights report on Bangladesh attributes a lack of faith in the court system and the failure to implement the laws as factors in the continued high incidence of acid attacks, rapes and dowry related violence.28\n[35] The claimant\u2019s former spouse lives in Canada. Articles were filed to support the claimant\u2019s fear of an acid attack if she returned to Bangladesh, from her husband\u2019s family, or his associates who had stalked her while she was living in Bangladesh after her husband returned to Canada.29\n[36] The preponderance of the documentary evidence establishes an objective basis for the claim.\n[37] The claimant testified that her former husband is aware of where her family members live in Chittagong. She established a serious possibility of persecution should she return to there. Her nexus is as a member of a particular social group as a single divorced woman who has been subjected to domestic violence.\nINTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE (IFA)\n[38] An IFA arises when a claimant who has a well-founded fear of persecution in his or her home area of the country is not a Convention refugee because he or she has an internal flight alternative elsewhere in the country.\n[39] The test to be applied in determining whether there is an IFA is two pronged:\nThe Board must be satisfied on a balance of probabilities that there is no serious possibility of the claimant being persecuted in the part of the country to which it finds an IFA exists.30\nConditions in the part of the country [considered to be an IFA] must be such that it would not be unreasonable, in all the circumstances [including those particular to the claimant] for [her] to seek refuge there.31\n[40] The Federal Court of Appeal sets a very high threshold for the \u2018unreasonableness test\u2019, requiring nothing less than the existence of conditions which would jeopardize the life or safety of the claimant. There must be actual and concrete evidence of such conditions.\n[41] Dhaka was identified as a possible internal flight alternative.\n[42] The claimant is a young divorced woman who was not employed while living in Bangladesh. She testified that she would be unable to get a job or housing in Dhaka. She testified that her father is an elderly man with health problems, who lives with a son in Chittagong, on whom he relies for financial and emotional support. She testified that none of her family members had the financial resources to support her relocation anywhere, never mind an expensive city like Dhaka.\n[43] Her counsel submitted that a divorced \/ single woman like the claimant cannot realistically relocate within Bangladesh due to three reasons:32\n1. an inability to secure housing;\n2. lack of employment opportunities; and\n3. lack of domestic violence shelters and other social services.\n[44] Counsel buttressed her written submission with references to documentary evidence indicating that:33\n1. divorced woman encounter huge difficulties in accessing housing;\n2. a grim employment situation for single and divorced woman;\n3. single and divorced woman, in general are looked down upon by society;\n4. the limited social services available were difficult to access.\n[45] The claimant established on a balance of probabilities that given the circumstances of single divorced woman in Dhaka, together with the particular circumstances of the claimant, it is not reasonable for her to seek refuge there.\nCONCLUSION\n[46] I find that [XXX] is a Convention refugee. I therefore accept her claim.\n(signed) James Waters\nApril 10, 2019\n1 The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c.27, as amended, sections 96 and 97(1).\n\n2 Guideline 4: Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution: Update, Guideline Issued by the Chairperson Pursuant to Section 65(3) of the Immigration Act, IRB, Ottawa, November 25, 1996, as continued in effect by the Chairperson on June 28, 2002, under the authority found in section 159(1)(h) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n\n3 Exhibit 2, Basis of Claim (BOC).\n\n4 Exhibit 9, Package 1; and Exhibit 10, Package I 0.\n\n5 Exhibit 9, Package 1; at pp 1-12.\n\n6 Exhibit 5, SIRU Part 2, at p. 22, para 2.\n\n7 Ibid, at p. 24.\n\n8 Exhibit 9, Package 1, at pp. 13-19.\n\n9 Ibid.; and Exhibit 10, Package 2.\n",

In your narrative to the Board, filed with your Basis of Claim (BOC) Form, you state that you grew up in the city of [XXX], Kingston, Jamaica.2 On [XXX], 2017, a resident of [XXX] named [XXX] was murdered. A family friend of yours was questioned by the police as a person of interest. This person, named [XXX], accused you of telling the police that [XXX] was likely a suspect. Angered by the allegations against him, [XXX] sent threatening notes to your family while you were visiting your family in Canada. In addition, [XXX] mother also sent similar message to the you and your family.\n[3] You testified that at no time, did you tell the police that [XXX] could be a suspect. In your narrative, it is stated that \u201con [XXX], 2017 [XXX] came to my house and showed me a gun and told me that if he ever gets arrested for anything he didn\u2019t do I would pay a price.\u201d In addition, he made veiled threats against your daughter. Some of [XXX] friends told you that they were waiting for an order from [XXX] to \u201cfinish her.\u201d\n[4] Fearing for your and your daughter\u2019s safety, you went to stay with a friend in [XXX], St. Catherine. While staying there, [XXX] and his friends visited you. Your friend asked you to leave his premises for the fear that [XXX] would harm him for harbouring you.\n[5] Fearing for your safety, you went to another police jurisdiction to lodge a complaint; however, they asked you to go the [XXX] police. Your brother, a [XXX], told you to leave the country as no one could guarantee your safety. You left for Canada for a short stay, hoping that the matter would settle by the time you return. As a result of further threats from [XXX] and his friends, you remained in Canada and made a claim for refugee protection.\n[6] You and your daughter testified about the incidents in Jamaica as stated above. In addition, you stated that you and [XXX] went to the same school, and that his brother was killed by the rival gang. You also stated that you didn\u2019t want to go back to the same environment.\nDETERMINATION\n[7] I find on a balance of probabilities, that you would be subjected personally to a risk to your lives or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, should you return to Jamaica, for the following reasons.\nANALYSIS\nNexus\n[8] I have examined your claims under section 97 as there is no nexus to a section 96 ground.\nCredibility\n[9] Based on the documents in the file, I have noted no serious credibility issues. In particular, the evidence establishes the allegations as set out above. You had proffered a letter from [XXX], a Justice of Peace, in which he confirms you to be a resident of [XXX], and that the gangs in your vicinity would consistently invade your premises and use your home as a strategic location to attack other gangs. Your roof was often used as a shooting range. He also noted that you had to leave as your life was in danger.\n[10] You had also submitted a letter from [XXX], the person you had stayed with. In his letter, he notes that you and your daughter had stayed with him as you feared harm from the gangs led by [XXX]. After reviewing the documents, I have no reasons to doubt their authenticity.\nNature of the harm\n[11] You were threatened at gun point, and the veiled threats made to your daughter created a fear for her safety as a young female. You also feared harm from the gang as you were threatened at gun point and by his friends. You lived in an environment where gang violence was an everyday occurrence. You had accepted this as a way of life but when the threats became personal, you felt the need to move away from the danger. This harm clearly amounts to a risk to your life and that of your daughter.\nState protection\n[12] I find that adequate state protection would not be reasonably forthcoming in this particular case. You had approached the police when the situation turned serious. However, you received no real help from the [XXX] police. Even your brother, a [XXX], was unable to help you. You had no family in Jamaica who could help or support you.\n[13] In the documents provided by you, it states that \u201cresidents in [XXX] are so fearful these days, many refused to speak about the mayhem around them. And those who did, ask for their identities to be kept a secret.\u201d3 I have carefully reviewed the documentary evidence and I find that these articles clearly demonstrate that there could be a risk to your life, should you return to Jamaica as you are being perceived as an informer.4\n[14] The Bertlesmann Stiftung\u2019s 2016 report states that: \u2018The state\u2019s monopoly on the use of force is established nationwide in principle, but it is challenged by organized criminal gangs or networks in specific areas.\u2019 The challenge does not, however, constitute a major threat at the national level. The specific areas are not whole parishes or regions but depressed inner-city communities, varying in population size from 3,000 to 20,000, where violence is directed not always against the state or the security forces but against rival gangs and those civilians labeled as \u201cinformers.\u201d5\n[15] In an article by Amnesty International reported on October 2014, it is stated:\nWomen and girls living in inner-city communities remain particularly exposed to gang violence. They are often victims of reprisal crimes, including sexual violence, for being perceived as having reported or actually reporting criminal activity to the police, or in relation to a personal or family vendetta.6\n[16] I find that it would be objectively unreasonable for you to seek the protection of the state in light of your particular circumstances.\nCONCLUSION\n[17] Based on the analysis above, I conclude that you are persons in need of protection. Accordingly, I accept your claims.\n(signed) Veda Rangun\nDecember 2, 2019\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27 as amended, sections 96 and 97(1).\n\n2 Exhibit 2, Basis of Claim (BOC) Form, TB7-21735.\n\n3 Exhibit 5, Claimant\u2019s Documents, received October 17, 2019.\n\n4 Ibid.\n\n5 Exhibit 3, National Documentation Package (NDP) for Jamaica, (April 30, 2019), item 4.2.\n\n6 Ibid., item 2.2.\n",

Leigh\nCountry: Hungary\nRPD Number: TB6-18781\nATIP Number: A-2020-01274\nATIP Pages: 000050-000054\n[1] MEMBER: [XXX] you are a citizen of Hungary who claims Convention refugee status and refugee protection in Canada based on your alleged well-founded fear of persecution in Hungary for Convention reasons and the alleged risk there to your life risk of cruel and unusual treatment, or danger of torture.\n[2] You state that you are at risk of serious harm in Hungary at the hands of various agents of persecution based on your Roma ethnicity, female gender, young age, and family status. You allege that were you to return to Hungary you would continue to experience serious harm without the prospect of effective state protection there.\n[3] I determine you to be a Convention refugee. In my view there has been supplied sufficient reliable evidence on which to find that you have a well-founded fear of persecution in Hungary for Convention reasons.\n[4] It has been established that there is more than a mere possibility that were you to return to Hungary you would experience the serious harm of persecution, either cumulatively or in isolation, harm that would continue to have on you a substantially prejudicial effect, physically or morally.\n[5] I am satisfied that there has been supplied clear and convincing confirmation of the state\u2019s inability or unwillingness to protect you based on your particular circumstances and prevailing country conditions.\nAnalysis\nIdentity\n[6] I am satisfied that you have the personal, national, ethnic, gender and other identity alleged in the claim. You came to Canada with family and made a refugee claim within weeks of your arrival. You testified in the Hungarian language through an interpreter at the hearing. You provided extensive oral testimony, written documentation and allegations in an affidavit and in your Basis of Claim form that credibly situates you within a Hungarian context.\n[7] You state that with the exception of a short period of time in Germany to visit a close family member you have lived only in Hungary and Canada. You came to Canada on your own Hungarian travel document that was issued in 2016. A copy of that document is before me and at the Port of Entry and at the time that you made your refugee claim inland, there does not appear to have been any concern about your nationality as a Hungarian citizen. Extensive personal documentation has also been filed from Hungary.\n[8] I\u2019m also satisfied that your Roma background has been established on the balance of probabilities. Here too the testimony and written declarations you have provided situate you within a reliable Roma context.\n[9] You have stated that while you don\u2019t know or understand how and why you were identified as a Roma, you testified that it could be because of your dark or brown skin even though you stated that it is not that brown. It is clear, however, that you have been closely associated with Roma persons, including close family members and that you have experienced individual and collective mistreatment, likely based on your Roma ethnicity and at times because of that ethnicity and your female gender and young age. You stated that when a close family member was mistreated, it was as if you were being abused.\n[10] You\u2019ve conceded that you did not know the sub-group of Roma that either your mother or father belonged to but stated that they both have Roma background. You also testified that a large number of your family members have come to Canada and somehow or the other have received permanent status in Canada.\n[11] Your claim was made with your father and your elder brother. Your father\u2019s claim was disjoined from yours because you were alleging serious harm in Hungary on grounds beyond your ethnic background and that it could be uncomfortable and difficult for you to participate in your hearing with your father present. That request was granted.\n[12] You testified about your education and stated that you got to grade [XXX] but because you did not complete one of the final exams, that having to do with language and literature, you would be unable to continue your education in Hungary. While this may have limited basis, I do accept that based on your own personal mistreatment over many years throughout grade school, your family economic and social experience, and other factors, it would be impracticable for you to expect that you would be able to continue your education in Hungary, at least at the university level.\n[13] You stated that you believed that your literature teacher was racist and anti-Roma and did not permit you to write the final exam even though a fellow student, a non-Rome was permitted to sit the final exam despite absence for about half the school year.\n[14] When counsel asked you if you had been sexually harassed in Hungary you responded affirmatively. It was deemed unnecessary to have you elaborate on that in oral testimony.\n[15] I have your written declarations and based on my assessment of your credibility, your identity and other aspects of your claim throughout the hearing, I\u2019m satisfied that more likely than not you have had the gender-based mistreatment alleged.\n[16] Your residential identity is also compelling. You testified that on two occasions about a year apart, you, your father and your elder brother were evicted. You testified that your nuclear family has never owned any property in Hungary and that you have only rented accommodation from the city. In your written declarations you have cited at least three or four residential addresses in and around Budapest and you confirmed those street addresses when you gave testimony in the hearing.\n[17] You stated that local authorities relocated you from your rental accommodation, promising to allow you to return once the renovations were concluded, but neither you nor any other Roma family were permitted to go back to that renovated building.\n[18] You were then evicted from the other building that you had been relocated to and at that time you father, having an interest in fishing, lived in a tent with your elder brother beside the lake. You moved in for a period of time with a friend of yours you described as your best friend. You stated spontaneously that this friend was non-Roma.\n[19] You testified that Roma experience mistreatment in the health care system and while your own experience in the health care system appears to have been more positive most times, at least based on your own testimony, you did concede that that would be one of the reasons for you to fear returning to Hungary. If you were able to pay large amounts of money to physicians you would receive medical care but you stated and fear that if you were to return to Hungary based on your age and other circumstances you would not qualify for health and other social benefits.\n[20] You testified about your recreational life, street life, life on the street cars and stated that you had been mistreated by groups of racist men and that among incidents of mistreatment, that you and closely situated persons including family members experienced. Your elder brother was thrown off public transit and suffered a concussion but received no police help.\n[21] You testified that you fear the police themselves, the very agents one could rely on for protection. When asked why you had this fear you stated that they did not provide any material assistance to you or those you knew. On one occasion although a family member of your experienced mistreatment and made a police report, promises to keep you informed were not met by the police.\n[22] Years earlier a close relative experienced serious harm at the hands of her male partner. Despite repeated incidents by him against her, he was given merely a fine for all of that ordeal.\nCredibility\n[23] I find that you have been a credible witness in the proceeding. You provided testimony spontaneously, directly and with the ring of truth. At times it contained extensive detail. Your testimony conformed with the written declarations in all material areas of the claim. I find that you did not embellish or exaggerate. These are the hallmarks of reliable testimony in my view.\n[24] You also maintained eye contact consistently and had a somber disposition in the hearing.\nObjective basis\n[25] In my view there is a credible objective basis to your allegations. The country conditions documents from wide variety of sources, having no interest in the outcome of your proceeding, indicate that each of the forms of mistreatment you have referred to continues to impact Roma communities in Hungary and that Roma continue to experience serious forms of mistreatment, including discrimination, harassment, humiliation, marginalisation and exclusion in every sector of their civic lives: education, employment, housing, recreation, heath care.\n[26] Sources agree and you also stated in various ways, repeatedly throughout the hearing and in your written claim, that Roma experience serious personal insecurity. This is despite periods of serious efforts by the state to improve conditions for Roma and other national minorities in Hungary and to orient front line police officials and other state authorities on providing improved response and assistance to Roma communities and communities of national minorities in Hungary.\n[27] In view, although you fear serious physical harm were you to return to Hungary, such as from interactions with street groups, it is sufficient that you fear serious discrimination across the sectors of your civic life and there is a reliable objective basis to those fears. These social and economic risks are such that frontline police cannot be expected to provide protection against, and indeed, no state authority can provide immediate response for such conditions. Extensive social and political change would be required for greater security, in your case in particular.\n[28] In my view, were you to return to Hungary, there is more than a mere possibility that you would experience the serious harm of persecution cumulatively. There\u2019s clear and convincing confirmation of the state\u2019s inability or unwillingness to protect you. Accordingly I determine you to be a Convention refugee. The Division therefore accepts your claim.\n[29] That\u2019s it for this hearing. Thank you, Mr. Interpreter.\n[30] INTERPRETER: Thank you.\n[31] MEMBER: Counsel. All the best to you, Ms. XXXX.\n[32] CLAIMANT: Thank you very much.\n[33] MEMBER: Off the record.\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 DECISION CONCLUDED \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n",

The Claimant, [XXX], a citizen of Republic of Congo is claiming refugee protection under Sections 96 and 97.1 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[2] The Claimant, that is you, alleges a well-founded fear of persecution for reason of his membership in a particular social group, as being a homosexual man.\n[3] The tribunal finds that the Claimant has established that there is a serious possibility of persecution on a convention ground. As for your allegations in support of your claim you allege the following.\n[4] You discovered that you were a homosexual at the age of twelve when you kissed a friend or you were kissed by a friend named [XXX] [phonetic] with whom you would continue to have about a three-year relationship. That relationship ended when [XXX] was severely attacked when you both were in a bar and he was attacked because he was perceived as a homosexual man and he was killed.\n[5] After that event you tried to commit suicide and it failed. You then left for South Africa in 2008. You also stated that over the years you had been on a number of occasions detained by the police because of your sexual orientation and then released upon the payment of bribes. When you left for South Africa you entered the country illegally with the help of a friend, [XXX] with whom you would have a relationship for a few years. And then [XXX] when he expressed his sexuality to his father you allege that he was killed by his father for his sexual orientation and you feared for your life as well.\n[6] You also tried living in Namibia with your brother who works as a pastor and because of his association with you and your sexual orientation or perceived sexual orientation by the community, your brother\u2019s church was attacked. Your sister-in-law was also attacked. Her car was attacked and they were threatened and pointed at as performing demonic activities because of your association with them and the fact that you are a homosexual man.\n[7] You fear should you return to the Republic of Congo the police, the community which you describe as homophobic that would randomly attack you knowing or perceiving your sexuality. And you also fear the family of your deceased boyfriend which who attacked your family after [XXX] death and also would hold you responsible for the death of their son.\n[8] As for your identity I find that your identity has been established through the copy of your Congolese passport on file.\n[9] As for credibility the tribunal is bound by the principle laid out in Maldonado whereby a refugee Claimant swears that certain facts are true this creates a presumption that they are true and unless there is a valid reason to doubt their truthfulness. The tribunal did not find any relevant inconsistencies, omissions or implausibilities that weren\u2019t reasonably explained or that would lead it to draw negative conclusions regarding your credibility as to your sexual orientation as a homosexual man.\n[10] In support of your allegations regarding your sexual orientation you had a few supporting letters. You also have a copy of your social media activities which contain photos but also homophobic remarks that are made against you. And you also had a witness that was ready to testify today but since your testimony was found to be very creditable by the board the tribunal did not think it would be necessary today to hear your witness.\n[11] As for testimony, I find that you had a very forthcoming and creditable and spontaneous testimony. You did not try to embellish your testimony and as your lawyer asked you more questions more details arise but it was plain to see that you have lived through some very difficult times and the reminiscing of all these events was emotional at some points and difficult. And this made your testimony very creditable.\n[12] You were able to speak about how you discovered your sexual orientation or you felt different as a child and that your gender expression is different as you said that people told you that you acted like a girl and ostracized you in school and you had a very hard time because of it. You also were able to speak about your relationship with [XXX] and the incident that led to his death.\n[13] As for the time spent in South Africa you were able to reasonably explain why you were not able to stay there with the death of your partner, [XXX], by the hands of his father and xenophobic climate that made you fear for your safety. And you tried to have a better life in Namibia which turned out to be even harder for you in terms of safety because of your sexual orientation.\n[14] Your allegations are supported by the documentary evidence so the National Documentation Package for the Democratic Republic of Congo, the U.S. country report indicates that there is no law that specifically prohibits homosexuality or homosexual conduct but article 330 of the Penal Code of the DRC proscribes imprisonment for three to two years and a fine for those who commit public outrage against decency and this is used by the police officers to persecute the LGBT community in Congo, in the DRC.\n[15] The National Documentation Package also indicates that there is a law that is being studied to criminalize officially homosexuality in the DRC and sexual minorities in this country are stigmatized and ostracized by the general population. They cannot have access to normal schooling as you have also told us about today. They have difficulty obtaining work, access to credit, or other financial or economic means.\n[16] The sexual minorities in the DRC are also victimized by the security forces of the state and are arbitrarily detained, are attacked physically and sexually and threatened. There are no support systems for sexual minorities in Congo, in DRC as you have also told us and this is seen in the National Documentation Package.\n[17] As for state protection and the internal flight alternative. Since state protection is not available as the police themselves persecute homosexuals and the LGBT community the tribunal finds that you would not obtain state protection from the Congolese authorities and they are an agent of persecution.\n[18] As for the IFA, the tribunal finds that you cannot be expected to deny your sexual orientation to live in your country and no matter where you would reside you would continue to have your sexual orientation and it would cause problems across the country so there is not viable IFA for you.\n[19] In conclusion, the tribunal having analyzed the evidence as a whole finds that you have discharged the burden of establishing that there is a serious possibility that you would be persecuted on a Convention ground and therefore the tribunal concludes that you, [XXX] are a \u201cConvention Refugee\u201d. Thank you.\n",

        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2019 RLLR 45\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: November 7, 2019\n\nPanel: Nicole Ginsberg\nCountry: El Salvador\nRPD Number: MB8-25771\nATIP Number: A-2020-01274\nATIP Pages: 000030-000036\n[1] This is the decision of the Refugee Protection Decision in the claim for refugee protection of [XXX], file number MB8-25771. Ms. [XXX], you are claiming refugee protection in Canada pursuant to section 96 and sub-section 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. I have considered your testimony and the other evidence in the case, and I am prepared to render my decision orally. A written version of this decision will be sent to you by mail at a later date.\nDETERMINATION\n[2] I find that you face a serious possibility of persecution in El Salvador on the basis of your membership in a particular social group as a lesbian woman. I therefore find that you are a \u201cConvention refugee\u201d pursuant to section 96 of the Act and I accept your claim. In coming to this conclusion, I have considered the Chairperson\u2019s guideline number nine on sexual orientation and gender identity and expression. My reasons are as follows.\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] Your allegations are contained in your Basis of Claim form, including the narrative your attached and the amended narrative that you submitted subsequently, both of which are found at document two of the evidence. In summary, you fear your former co-worker [XXX] (phonetic) will make good on the death threats he has been making about you as a result of being fired from your place of work. You also allege that as a lesbian who presents in a way you described as being masculine, you are not and will not be accepted by El Salvadorian society generally and your human rights are not respected there. You explained the death threats you suffered from [XXX], the danger he poses to you because of his particular profile, and the adverse treatment of same-sex relations and of LGBTQ people in El Salvador generally, including the lack of regard for LGBTQ rights by El Salvadorian authorities and the unwillingness of the authorities to protect LGBTQ persons there.\n[4] You allege that you are a lesbian and have been in a same-sex relationship with a woman, [XXX], I\u2019ll\u2026 I\u2019ll spell that now [XXX]. Is that correct? Ok. For over 11 years, since [XXX] 2007. Your relationship continues to this day. You allege that you have suffered harassment and ill\u00ad treatment in El Salvador from as far back as 2004 as a result of your perceived sexual orientation and have had to live in fear that people would find out. You relayed several incidents of having endured insults and threats from strangers as a result of being perceived as a lesbian, to the extent that you have feared for your life. You explained that same-sex relationships are not accepted in El Salvadorian society generally and the authorities demonstrate an unwillingness to help LGBTQ people. You allege that you have had to keep your sexual orientation secret and that you come from a religious family that does not accept same-sex relationships. Your mother does not accept your being a lesbian, and your father told you that if he found out one of his children was homosexual, he would poison their soup.\n[5] You allege that as a [XXX] at [XXX] in La Libertad, you told an employee\u2019s supervisor about his lack of respect for work hours and that this person, XXXX, lost his job as a result. He began harassing and insulting you based on your sexual orientation and he showed another co\u00adworker a gun that he said he intended to use on you. You allege the death threats must be taken seriously in a country whose security situation is as precarious as El Salvador\u2019s, particularly as an LGBTQ woman who cannot rely on the protection of the police. And, that [XXX] is known to have\u2026 to take part in criminal activity and has family political ties. You fled El Salvador on [XXX], 2018, soon after the threats from [XXX] began, and came to Canada where you made your claim for refugee protection.\nANALYSIS\nIDENTITY\n[6] Your personal and national identity as a citizen of El Salvador is established on a balance of probabilities by your testimony and by the documentary evidence on file, including a copy of your El Salvadorian passport at document one.\nNEXUS\n[7] Your allegations establish a nexus to the Convention ground I identified earlier and I have therefore analyzed your claim pursuant to section 96 of the Act.\nCREDIBILITY\n[8] Testimony provided under oath is presumed to be truthful unless there is a reason for doubting its truthfulness. In this claim, I have no such reason. I find you to be a credible witness. You testified today to be a straightforward, open and sincere manner. You were spontaneous in your answers to my questions, and I do not find that you tried to embellish or exaggerate your allegations during your testimony. You testified credibly and in detail during the hearing about your attraction to women, how you came to realize that you were somehow different, as you say, as a child, and your attraction to women and girls in your adolescence. You testified credibly about your relationship with [XXX], how you met, how your relationship changed from being co-workers to being romantic partners, and about how you had to carry on your relationship in secret, with people believing you were roommates.\n[9] You further testified credibly about your life in Canada as an openly lesbian woman, and the freedom you have found to express yourself, in particular to dress in a way to you have described as masculine. You explained how your job at a men\u2019s suit retailer is your dream job because you finally are able to wear a suit and tie to work everyday. You testified credibly about the treatment of lesbians and LGBTQ people in El Salvador, in law and society. Specifically, you explained that people don\u2019t want to see LGBTQ people for who they are, and often treat them as invisible. The authorities don\u2019t take their complaints seriously. It would be\u2026 It would not be safe to be out in the open about a same-sex relationship there or to express oneself with a gender expression not considered binary or mainstream. Your testimony was consistent with the allegations in your Basis of Claim form, and also included some more specific details that were not contained in your Basis of Claim form, but these details allowed me to better and more fully understand your claim.\n[10] You further provided corroborative documentary evidence in support of your allegations. Several\u2026 well\u2026 Including the following. Photos of you and your partner and your dogs, who you explained are like your children, at exhibit 1\u2026 C-1. Photos of you at pride events, also at C-1. Photos of you dressed for work at the [XXX] at which you work in Canada in the same exhibit. Letters from LGBTQ organisations in Canada concerning your involvement, including the women\u2019s choir and a Valentine\u2019s dance from exhibits C-2 to C-6. Sworn statements from three co\u00adworkers from [XXX] concerning the threats by [XXX] at exhibits C-15 to C-17. A letter of employment from [XXX] at C-14, declaration of cohabitation with [XXX] at C-13, and several articles concerning the situation of LGBTQ people in El Salvador at exhibit C-20 through C-23. There were\u2026 There were no relevant contradictions, inconsistencies, omissions between your Basis of Claim form, your testimony at the hearing and the documentary evidence on file.\nOBJECTIVE BASIS\n[11] Your allegations are consistent with the objective country documents before me concerning the treatment of lesbians in El Salvador. For example, although we see same-sex relations are not criminalized in El Salvador, as we see from the objective documentary evidence, for example in tabs 2.1 and 6.3, there are some laws prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity enforced in the country including in regards to housing, employment, nationality and access to government services. However, the objective documentary evidence is clear about the significant legal vacuums that exist for the protection of LGBTQ people in El Salvador. There is widespread stigmatisation of LGBTQ people, and no general non-discrimination law to protect marginalized people in El Salvador. That\u2019s found at tab 6.3. The objective documentary evidence indicates that El Salvador LGBTQ people are particularly exposed to violence in El Salvador which is linked to the discrimination they face on various fronts in their family life and working life, and it\u2019s part of society generally. This relates to not only sexual orientation but gender expression as well. This is particularly troubling in El Salvador as it is among the most violent countries in the world. This is at tab 6.1 of the National Documentation Package. There is no official government data on hate crimes or bias motivated violence against LGBTQ people in El Salvador, but the evidence is replete with examples of violence against LGBTQ people and a lack of will on the part of the State to bring perpetrators to justice. That\u2019s found at tab 6.3. The evidence also points to grave deficiencies in the country\u2019s justice system and a lack of access to justice for LGBTQ people.\n[12] Not only do they face obstacles in reporting crimes against them because of the widespread social stigmatisation and the lack of acceptance, including within law enforcement, perpetrators often face impunity in cases of violence, that is at tab 6.3. This document also discusses the bias against the LGBTQ community that is prevalent within the police and justice sectors themselves. One cannot forget the background against which violence against LGBTQ community members occurs in El Salvador, that has been described as the murder capital of the world with a rate of 116 murders per 100 000 people in 2015. That\u2019s also at tab 6.3.\n[13] The claimant has also provided\u2026 or, pardon me, you have also provided documentary evidence concerning the human rights situation of the LGBTQ community in El Salvador, the lack of police protection, and incidences of violence against the community. The research pieces at tab 6.2 also discusses in detail the pattern of systemic discrimination and violence against the LGBTQ people by the Salvadorian law enforcement itself. For all of these reasons and country conditions, I find you to be credible. I therefore find you\u2019ve established on a balance of probabilities that you are a lesbian, that you were subjected to death threats at the hands of your former co-worker [XXX], and that you have otherwise experienced harassment and mistreatment in El Salvador as a result of your sexual orientation and it can also be said as a result of your gender expression. I also find that you have demonstrated subjective fear in El Salvador, that in view of the objective country evidence, is objectively well-founded.\nSTATE PROTECTION\n[14] I find that you have rebutted the presumption of State protection with clear and convincing evidence that the Salvadorian state would be unable or unwilling to provide you with adequate protection. The documentary evidence is replete with information about the risks facing people of the LGBTQ community in El Salvador and the lack of State protection for such people, including a widespread pattern of systemic discrimination and violence by law enforcement itself. This is found most pointedly at tab 6.2 as well as the country documents submitted by you. In addition, I have discussed above the legal vacuums that exist to protect LGBTQ people in El Salvador, including the absence of a general non-discri\u2026 discrimination law and a lack of enforcement of violent crime and harassment against LGBTQ people. For all of these reasons, I find that you have rebutted the presumption of State protection.\nINTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE\n[15] I find that you face a serious possibility of persecution throughout El Salvador as a result of the widespread stigmatisation of same-sex relations through El Salvador, the legal vacuums and lack of willingness from police to protect LGBTQ people, and moreover, the pattern of discrimination and violence actually perpetrated against LGBTQ people by law enforcement itself. The violence and lack of regard for human rights of LGBTQ people persists throughout the country, as does the lack of State protection. You have also testified credibly that people have explained to you [XXX] criminal involvement, his political connections through his father and his pattern of impunity from offenses like drunk driving because of those connections. Moreover, you would not be expected to ignore your sexual orientation if you were to return to El Salvador. I find that if you were to live your life as a lesbian in El Salvador, particularly one who presents in a way that you describe as masculine, you would face a serious possibility of persecution at the hands of members of the public, the authorities and [XXX]. Because you have a serious possibility of persecution anywhere in El Salvador, I will not analyze the second prong of the\u2026 of the IFA. For all of these reasons, I find that there is no viable internal flight alternative for you in El Salvador.\nCONCLUSION\n[16] For all of these reasons, I find that you have established on a balance of probabilities that you have a subjective fear of return to El Salvador that is objectively well-founded. Having considered all the evidence, including your testimony, I find that you, [XXX] face a serious possibility of persecution in El Salvador on the Basis of your membership in a particular social group as a lesbian. I therefore find that you are a \u201cConvention refugee\u201d pursuant to Section 96 of the Act and I accept your claim. So, this concludes your hearing.\n",

        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2019 RLLR 44\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: December 10, 2019\nPanel: Paul Fitzgerald\nCounsel for the claimant(s): Miguel Mendez\nCountry: India\nRPD Number: MB8-21731\nAssociated RPD Numbers: MB8-21773\nATIP Number: A-2020-01124\nATIP Pages: 000022-000029\nREASONS FOR DECISION\nINTRODUCTION\n[1] This is the decision of the refugee protection division in the claim for refugee protection of [XXX], the claimant, and [XXX], the co-claimant, citizens of India. They claim refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (the Act).1\nDETERMINATION\n[2] Having considered all of the evidence, including the claimants\u2019 testimony, the panel finds that the claimants face a risk to their lives or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment at the hands of highly-politically connected gangsters. The panel therefore finds that they are \u201cpersons in need of protection\u201d pursuant to section 97 of the Act and accepts their claims.\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] The claimant\u2019s detailed allegations are contained in his Basis of Claim Form (BOC)2. In summary, the claimant fear serious harm or death at the hands of [XXX] and [XXX], well-known local gangsters that have the political backing of powerful politician Bibi Jagir Kaur and the tacit support of the Punjab police.\n[4] The claimant was working on his farm when he heard shouting and discovered a man being savagely beaten by the local gangsters. He called police who later invited him to make a statement. Two days later, the claimants and their minor son were accosted and beaten by [XXX], who told them to withdraw the complaint.\n[5] The claimants described a cycle of altercations with [XXX] and\/or the police, where an incident would happen, they would report it to the police, and physical violence would occur, sometimes at the hands of the gangsters and sometimes as the hands of the police.\n[6] The claimants described their frustration at realizing that at least in parts of the Punjab, the gangsters have support in certain political quarters and the tacit, if not active, support of the police.\n[7] On two occasions, the claimants fled their village to other parts of India, notably [XXX] in Haryana and [XXX] in the Punjab. They were finally told by a lawyer that they could not prevail against politically-connected gangsters with tacit backing of the police.\n[8] However, the event that provoked their departure from India was the kidnapping of their then 9-year old son and the realization that their enemies would stop at nothing and the police would not protect them.\nIdentity\n[9] The claimants\u2019 personal and national identities as citizens of India are established on a balance of probabilities by their testimony and by the documentary evidence on file, including a copy of their Indian passports.3\nANALYSIS.\nCredibility and State Protection\n[10] Testimony provided under oath is presumed to be truthful unless there is a reason to doubt its truthfulness. In this case, the Panel has no reason to doubt the claimants\u2019 credibility. Their testimony was spontaneous and sincere, and was consistent with the allegations in the claimant\u2019s BOC. Therefore, the Panel finds the claimants to be credible witnesses and believes, on a balance of probabilities, the allegations contained in their claim.\n[11] The claimant told the panel on various occasions that he regretted ever taking an interest in the incident that caused the death of the man on his farm. He had just returned from working 7 years in Saudi Arabia and regretted making that first phone call to the police.\n[12] During their testimony it became obvious that their various attempts to solicit police involvement was nothing less than a sincere, repeated call for State Protection, which fell on deaf ears and in many cases provoked reprisals and\/or torture from the gangsters or the police.\n[13] In their BOC4 the claimants alleged that the Punjab police, now convinced that the claimant was not a criminal, had identified him as a witness who testimony was necessary to secure the conviction of the people who have savagely beat and ultimately killed the man on the claimant\u2019s farm.\n[14] The claimants described how they left Punjab and relocated in the co-claimant\u2019s home town of [XXX], some [XXX] km away, in the neighbouring state of Haryana. At the hearing, the claimant explained how the Haryana police, with the participation and at the request of the Punjab police, had gone to the house in [XXX], detained the claimant and returned him to the Punjabi police in his home town, where he was beaten and reminded of this obligation to cooperate with the Punjabi police.\n[15] The claimant described his complete frustration in realizing that while the police said they wanted to arrest the people responsible for the death of the man on his farm, the police were willing to consider any persons except the two guilty persons, namely, [XXX] and [XXX]. He stated that he was unwilling to falsely accuse an innocent person and stated he desperately wanted to avoid further negative interactions with the police.\n[16] Unwilling to falsely accuse an innocent person, and wanting to avoid further negative interactions with the police, the claimants stated stayed briefly with friends in [XXX], another town in Punjab, returning home after the friend\u2019s wife expressed concerns about possible increased danger to the friend\u2019s family.\n[17] The single most important allegation was that the gangsters, [XXX] and [XXX], had kidnapped or arranged for the kidnapping of their minor son [XXX], then aged 9, on [XXX], 2018, as he played in front of the family home.\n[18] The co-claimant described an initial frantic, desperate search for her son, fainting due to low blood pressure, the network of friends that searched for him and the posters they distributed with his picture.5 The claimants were dismayed at realizing that the police would offer no assistance whatsoever, and told the Panel that they feared that their son had joined the ranks of Indian children, whose organs are harvested.\n[19] They stated that they continued searching for their son, contracted an agent, and came to Canada on [XXX], 2018, by which time the co-claimant was three months pregnant.\n[20] They testified that by chance, on [XXX], 2019, their son was found begging by relatives at a celebration of Sikh culture in [XXX] in Punjab.6 He is now living with the co-claimant\u2019s mother and brother in [XXX], in the neighbouring state of Haryana.\n[21] When asked how the child had fared during the nearly 11 months during which he had been kidnapped, the co-claimant said the child had initially been uncommunicative and a doctor had told them that the child was very scared and should not be left alone.\n[22] The co-claimant testified that the day her mother gave her the news that [XXX] was free she was the happiest person in the world and also the saddest person in the world because she could not be with him.\n[23] The co-claimant testified how she had felt anguish, when her mother had not let her see her son\u2019s face for fear of provoking a reaction that would harm her unborn grandchild. She described her heart retching agony and not being able to answer her son\u2019s repeated question, \u201cMomma bring me closer to you!\u201d Due to the child\u2019s fear, [XXX] has not left his grandmother\u2019s house since arriving there.\n[24] The infant, [XXX], was born in Montreal on [XXX], 2019 and had [XXX], which the mother blames on the stress she was under in her final trimester of pregnancy. Fortunately, surgery on [XXX], 2019 has since cured the infant\u2019s defect.\n[25] The claimants submitted a letter from Sophie [XXX], a Quebec social worker7 who has dealt extensively with the family. It describes the tremendous stress the family is under. To show her support, Ms. [XXX] came to the hearing.\n[26] The Panel finds the claimants\u2019 behavior to be generally consistent with that of persons who cannot return to their country.\n[27] Having found that the claimants are being pursued by highly-politically connected gangsters, with tacit police support, the Panel finds that they face a genuine risk to their lives or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment and that they have rebutted the presumption of state protection with clear and convincing evidence.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[28] The Panel proposed Delhi and Yamuna Nagar as Internal Flight Alternative locations.\n[29] The IFA analysis is a two-prong test:8 (1) the claimants bear the burden of proof to demonstrate, in the proposed IFAs, that they would face a genuine risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or that, on a balance of probabilities, they would be personally subjected to a risk; (2) the claimants bear the burden of proof to demonstrate, on a balance of probabilities, that it would be objectively unreasonable or unduly harsh to relocate to the proposed IFAs: \u201cit requires nothing less than the existence of conditions which would jeopardize the life and safety of a claimant\u201d.9\n[30] Prior to considering seeking refuge in Canada, the claimants had sought refuge in [XXX] in Punjab and as well in the co-claimant\u2019s home town of [XXX] in the neighbouring state of Haryana. They testified that they had been surprised by the level of cooperation between Punjab and Haryana police in finding the mail claimant and returning him to Punjab.\n[31] They testified while they were seeking refuge in [XXX], the Haryana police had escorted the Punjab police to the home in which the claimants were staying and the Punjab police had arrested the claimant and brought him back to Punjab, where he was beaten.\n[32] In order to meet both criteria of the IFA two-prong test in the current context, there cannot, on a balance of probabilities be any information sharing between the police in Punjab and those in other states.\n[33] The objective country documents before the panel establish that the Indian police at a national level are rolling a police database called Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and Systems (CCTNS)10 and that \u201c94 percent of police stations across India have CCTNS hardware deployed\u201d11 but that the degree to which the database is used and whether it is being used efficiently is hard to confirm.12\n[34] The objective country documents before the panel also confirm that the CCTNS is also being connected to tenant registration systems in order to give the police the power to \u201cverify tenant information.13 As with CCTNS itself, this capability has not yet been fully deployed.14\n[35] Although the degree of implementation of CCTNS and its link to tenant information varies by State, the more recent documents confirm progress is being made.15\n[36] Thus, the Panel concludes, on a balance of probabilities that the Punjab police would be able to locate the claimants anywhere in India, and that the claimants face a genuine risk to their lives or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\n[37] Having found that the claimants face a genuine risk to their lives or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment at the hands of highly-politically connected gangsters, with tacit police support, the panel finds that they have a genuine fear of harm in India, that they have rebutted the presumption of state protection with clear and convincing evidence, and that there is no viable internal flight alternative for them anywhere in India.\nCONCLUSION\n[38] Having considered all of the evidence, the panel finds that the claimants face a genuine risk to their lives or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment at the hands of highly\u00ad politically connected gangsters, with tacit police support. The panel therefore finds that they are \u201cpersons in need of protection\u201d pursuant to section 97 of the Act and accepts their claim.\n(signed) Paul Fitzgerald\nDecember 10, 2019\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c, 27, as amended.\n\n2 Document 2.1 \u2013 Basis of Claim Form MB8-21731\n\n3 Document 1 \u2013 Package of information from the referring Canada Border Services Agency.\/ Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada.

        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2019 RLLR 43\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: August 30, 2019\nPanel: Darin Jacques\nCountry: Lebanon\nRPD Number: MB7-22271\nATIP Number: A-2020-01274\nATIP Pages: 000017-000021\n[1] The claimant, [XXX] (file number MB7-22271) is a citizen of Lebanon. He has claimed refugee protection under Sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[2] I find that you have established a well-founded fear of persecution and I conclude that you are a \u201cConvention refugee\u201d as per Section 96 of the Act.\n[3] In your allegations you provided me with detailed information about your discovery that you were different than other people and that you were attracted to men. You mentioned that you went to Dubai to work. You eventually lost your job because your sexual orientation was discovered by a manager because you had to maintain employment to remain in the UAE. You had to return to your country of citizenship, Lebanon.\n[4] You mentioned you weren\u2019t long in Lebanon before you were socializing with other gay men. The police what seems to be harassment techniques were staying outside of these areas and you mentioned this morning that how raids are performed, but in your case they seemed to have picked you up and targeted you. They took you to the police station. They forced you to pay a bribe, but you indicated the implications could have been a lot more serious. They could have held you indefinitely. And there are also laws against that they could have used to charge you.\n[5] So you did pay to secure your release. You just stayed inside. You mentioned this morning that you even ordered food out and that you remained in your apartment. And you decided that you had to leave the country and you came to Canada and claimed refugee protection.\n[6] Now when I\u2019m assessing a claim for refugee status, there are several things I need to take into consideration. Some of those things we discussed this morning directly and for other things I was just able to look at the information in your file.\n[7] Now the first is your identity. The Act, the law requires me to take into account whether claimants have acceptable documentation establishing their identity. In your case, that was easy. You had a passport from Lebanon which contained a visa to Canada. And these documents are sufficient to establish your identity for our purposes this morning.\n[8] The second issue is credibility. When you were testifying this morning, you benefitted from a presumption that your allegations were true. And in speaking with you this morning, I found no reason to doubt your credibility. During the hearing, I asked you numerous questions about your sexual orientation. As an example, you specifically explained the difficulties of living in Lebanese society as a gay man. You also spoke about the\u2026 with particularly poignancy about the emotional impact not being able to tell your family had on you.\n[9] Furthermore, you provided some specific evidence to corroborate your allegations. In particular, you provided photos participating in Pride events and you have provided letters and other communications from individuals who are aware of your sexual orientation. In my view, you have provided sufficient evidence to establish your allegations on a balance of probabilities and I conclude that you fear persecution because you are a gay man from Lebanon.\n[10] Now the law requires that a person have a well-founded fear of persecution that is based on a Convention ground. In your case, I find that you face a serious possibility of persecution because of your membership in a particular social group. Now I\u2019ll explain.\n[11] According to the law in Canada, a particular social group includes persons belonging to sexual minorities. And as I just mentioned, you credibly established that you are a gay man from Lebanon. Furthermore, you demonstrated that you face a violation of your basic human rights and I return most specifically to the incident of arrest and your mistreatment by the police. I\u2019ll also mention that is in a context where you are forced to live your sexual identity clandestinely in Lebanon which in itself has a negative cumulative effect on your ability, your well-being.\n[12] The documentary evidence establishes an objective basis for your fear of persecution beyond what you have told me. In Lebanon, sexual minorities are persecuted perhaps less than elsewhere in the Middle East. However, sexual minority groups remain ostracized by Lebanese society. There are sexual assaults, blackmail and threats are common.\n[13] And for all of these reasons, I find that you face severe mistreatments in Lebanon because of your sexual orientation. And pursuant to my findings on State protection, I conclude that your fear of persecution is well-founded.\n[14] Now I just mentioned State protection. The case law on refugee claims establishes a presumption that a State is capable of protecting its citizens. In your case, however, I find that adequate State protection is unavailable to you in Lebanon.\n[15] As you mentioned in your narrative and you mentioned it again this morning, article 534 of the Lebanese Penal Code prohibits sexual acts which are contrary to nature. And sources report that this provision has been interpreted as banning same-sex relations. Despite other interpretations by the Courts, these provisions are still used by law enforcement to discriminate against sexual minorities and you provided an example of your own experiences this morning and in your narrative.\n[16] The U.S. Department of State reports incidents of violence or discrimination against sexual minorities that are rarely reported. LGBT persons don\u2019t speak to the police or seek legal protection because the authorities consider their relations to be illegal. Sexual minorities fear their exposure of their sexual orientation which represents an obstacle for seeking redress. So in effect, the available documentation indicates that Lebanese authorities are unwilling to provide adequate protection to sexual minorities. And given your particular circumstances, I find that there is clear and convincing evidence sufficient to refute the presumption of State protection.\n[17] Now the final thing I needed to consider was what we call an internal flight alternative, whether you could have moved elsewhere in Lebanon and live safely. This is because the Act requires claimants to demonstrate that they face persecution or risk throughout their countries of nationality. Now in your case, I find that an internal flight alternative does not exist for you in Lebanon.\n[18] According to the documentary evidence \u2026 I\u2019m just hanging on to my voice here\u2026 in the City of Beirut, there is a growing acceptance of the gay community but it is not reflected in the rest of Lebanon. There are bars and there are clubs that specifically cater to the LGBT community which you mentioned. However, as you also mentioned, homosexuality remains strongly condemned. LGBT persons are verbally abused and sometimes attacked in the street. Conditions require members of sexual minority in Beirut to exercise considerable \u201cdiscretion\u201d.\n[19] In the present case, I find that you could not relocate within Lebanon and avoid a serious possibility of persecution. You could not live openly as a gay man, as is your right. In effect, I conclude that a viable IFA is not open to you in your country of nationality.\n[20] So in conclusion, I find that you face a serious possibility of persecution based on your membership in a particular social group.\n[21] I conclude that you are a \u201cConvention refugee\u201d as described under Section 96 of the Act. Your claim for refugee protection is therefore granted.\nBY CLAIMANT\n[22] Thank you.\n",

        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2019 RLLR 42\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: April 26, 2019\nPanel: Daniel Carens-Nedelsky\nCountry: Bangladesh\nRPD Number: MB7-18164\nAssociated RPD Number: MB7-18193\nATIP Number: A-2020-01274\nATIP Pages: 000012-000016\n[1] This is the decision for the claimant [XXX] and [XXX], under principal file number MB7-18164. I note for the record these claims were initially joined with that of the minor claimant [XXX] (phonetic) [XXX]. Immediately prior to rendering my decision, the claimants withdrew the claim, as he is a US citizen. I have considered your testimony and the documents you have provided, and I am ready to render my decision orally. You are claiming to be citizens of Bangladesh and are claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97 sub 1 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[2] BY THE INTERPRETER:\n96 and\u2026 ?\n[3] BY THE PANEL:\n97 sub 1.\nDETERMINATION\n[4] I find that you are \u201cConvention refugees\u201d for the following reasons.\nALLEGATIONS\n[5] Your full allegations are set out in your Basis of Claim forms. In brief, you fear persecution because of Mr. XXXX status as a Bihari. You have faced discrimination through much of your life because you are a Bihari, or a stranded Pakistani. This discrimination reached a tipping point when members of an Awami League Cadre began extorting you for money. They assaulted you multiple times, and ultimately kidnapped your wife and child, during which time you, Madam, were treated very terribly. After this, they continued to threaten you and you sought refuge in another part of your country, but the threats continued, making you realize you would not be safe anywhere in Bangladesh and sought Canada\u2019s protection.\nANALYSIS\nIDENTITY\n[6] I find on a balance of probabilities that your personal identity and identity as nationals of Bangladesh, have been established through your testimony and your documents, in particular your Bangladeshi passports.\nCREDIBILITY\n[7] There were no significant omissions, errors, or contradictions in your testimony and you both testified in a spontaneous and forthcoming manner. I therefore accept that events have occurred as you allege. Sir, you testified credibly about your experience as a Bihari and the discrimination you faced. You testified in detail about a couple of the assaults you received from the Awami League, including who attacked you, where they attacked you, what they looked like, and what you did after you were attacked. Your wife credibly testified on how she met you, about what it was like to move into the neighbourhood where you lived, and why she felt unsafe there. You supported your testimony with a number of documents, including hospital and\u2026 hospital reports corroborating your claim, police reports you filed, a number of documents showing your parents\u2019 and your status as a Bihari, psychological reports of your wife following her traumatic events, and affidavits from friends and family. I note there is\u2026 was a minor inconsistency between the letter that your friend wrote in support of your testimony and your testimony and your Basis of Claim form. You explained part of this discrepancy, and given your otherwise wholly credible testimony and well-supported documenting evidence, I do not find that this minor inconsistency undermines your credibility. Based on your credible testimony, I find that you have a subjective fear of returning to Bangladesh.\nNEXUS\n[8] I find that the persecution, you Sir, face has a nexus to the Convention due to your membership in a particular social group, specifically as a Bihari. And, Madam, I find that you have a nexus to the Convention also as a member of a particular social group, in this case as a woman fearing gender-based violence as well as being\u2026 as well as being targeted for being the family member of an individual facing persecution. In this case, for marrying a Bihari.\nOBJECTIVE BASIS\n[9] The country condition documents support your allegation that Biharis face persecution in Bangladesh. Tab 1.15 of the National Documentation Package, states that Bihari tend to live in ghettos, that the government sees them as an enemy, and that\u2026 and discusses that they only recently received citizenship in Bangladesh due to a Supreme Court decision. Tab 1.17 of the National Documentation Package notes that following independence, many Biharis faced reprisal including violence, that laws intended to manage properties caused many Biharis to lose their possessions and forced them into camps, and that many Biharis have reported difficulties obtaining passports as well as jobs in government. Item 9.3 of the National Documentation Package notes that in 2014, nine Biharis were burned alive and one killed by police shots, and that the first response of law enforcement was to pick up seven local Biharis\n[10] BY THE INTERPRETER:\nNine or seven, Sir?\n[11] BY THE PANEL:\nSeven. And, that calls to bring the allegedly involved local Awami League leaders to justice remained unheeded. You also supported newspaper articles referring to these events. Based on this evidence, I find that there is an objective basis for your fear.\nSTATE PROTECTION\n[12] The individuals you fear have a connection with the government. One of those you fear is the nephew of a local Awami League member. You provided some documentary support of this with an online post that specifically mentions this member of parliament in relation to these events. And, you sought the protection of police on a number of occasions, and found that they were either unable or unwilling to help you as the persecution remained constant. In these circumstances, I find that adequate State protection would not be forthcoming to you if you were to return.\nINTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE\n[13] You credibly testified that you sought safe haven in Chittagong after the kidnapping of your wife and son, but that the (inaudible) discovered you there and threatened the friend you were staying with. You\u2026 you fear you will be found anywhere you go in Bangladesh, and you will be located because you will be forced to show your I.D. card that will also show your parents\u2019 status. Given that your agents of persecution have already found you when you sought to flee quite far away from where you had lived, that they have a connection to the ruling party, and that there is a serious possibility you will face the same discrimination for being a Bihari anywhere you go in Bangladesh, I find that you do not have an internal flight alternative available to you.\nCONCLUSION\n[14] Based on the totality of the evidence, I find that you face more than a mere possibility of persecution for the nexus reasons discussed above. I therefore find that you are \u201cConvention refugees\u201d. Your claims are therefore accepted. Thank you both for your testimony.\n",

His son, [XXX] is a citizen of South Africa. They are seeking asylum in Canada under sections 96 and 97(1) of the IRPA.\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] The claimant is seeking asylum in Canada because of the threats and mistreatments he endured following his activism in the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) community in the DRC and South Africa\n[3] He also claims to fear a return because of his involvement in UNAFEC, the Union National des Federalistes du Congo.\n[4] If he were to return to South Africa, he fears that underground militias working for Kabila would mistreat him, or that he would be detained and secretly deported to DRC. He also fears that he would be mistreated in South Africa because of his work with the LGBT community.\n[5] He claims to have been detained in [XXX] 2014 in the DRC when he was returning from a UNAFEC meeting. He claims to have been beaten, and suffered serious injuries as a result of this detention. He claims to have been released on bail after this detention by bribing a guard.\n[6] After this incident, the claimant alleges that he left the DRC for South Africa, where he had permanent residency. He claims to have been attacked and raped in South Africa because of his advocacy work to further the rights of members of the LGBT community.\n[7] He sought medical treatment and made a police report after this attack, yet he claims that no action was taken by the authorities. He left South Africa on [XXX], 2017 for Canada. He signed his Basis of Claim form (BOC) on August 14 2017.\n[8] His son, [XXX] bases his claim on the allegations of his father.\nDECISION\n[9] The tribunal concludes that [XXX] is a \u201cConvention refugee\u201d. However, the tribunal does not believe that his son, [XXX] is a \u201cConvention refugee\u201d, or a \u201cperson in need of protection\u201d.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[10] The claimants\u2019 identity was established by their passports, issued by Congolese and South African authorities.1\nExclusion under section 1E \u2013 Permanent Residency in South Africa\n[11] As mentioned, the claimant declared that he was a permanent resident of South Africa. The tribunal therefore examined whether the claimant had a reasonable fear of persecution or if there exists, on a balance of probabilities, a risk of harm under section 97(1) of the IRPA in this country.\n[12] At the hearing, the claimant testified credibly about a brutal attack that he endured while living in South Africa. The claimant testified that he was attacked and raped in his home by unknown agents, as a means to repress his work advancing the rights of the LGBT community in South Africa. The claimant also submitted credible evidence confirming this attack, such as a detailed medical report describing his injuries.\n[13] The tribunal noted the visible effort, anguish, and pain required to recall these events at the hearing. The tribunal noted no contradictions, omissions, or incoherencies that could affects its appreciation of the claimant\u2019s credibility concerning these allegations.\n[14] Given the nature of his advocacy work \u2013 working with LGBT youth \u2013 and the credible account of the claimant being brutally attacked because of this work, the tribunal examined the documentary evidence pertaining to the treatment of LGBT activists and members of this community to ascertain whether an objective basis for his claim exist against South Africa.\n[15] The NDP points to systemic patterns of abuse and violence towards members of the LGBT community, including incidents of rape by security forces, and \u201csecondary victimization\u201d by state actors of members that reported abuse. The evidence also points to a higher degree of vulnerability of members of this community because of societal and police attitudes against them2.\n[16] The tribunal concludes that the documentary evidence establishes that there is an objective basis to support his fear of persecution if he were to return to this country. This establishes that there is exist a serious possibility of persecution for the claimant in South Africa, as someone with an imputed sexual orientation as belonging to the LGBT community.\nState Protection\n[17] Although South Africa does not criminalise same-sex relationships, the documentary evidence consulted by the tribunal indicates that members of the LGBT community face violence and victimization by the police, with investigations in crimes committed against this community \u201coften insufficient\u201d. There are also reported incidents of security forces members raping members of the LGBT community during arrests3. Given this evidence, the tribunal does not believe there is adequate state protection in South Africa for the claimant.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[18] Given the documentary evidence that indicates that a majority of the South African population believed that same-sex activity was morally wrong4, and that state agents have been found to commit some of the more brutal acts of violence against the LGBT population, the tribunal believes that there exist no viable internal flight alternative in the country as the claimant would face a serious possibility of persecution throughout South Africa.\n[19] In summary, given that the tribunal believes the claimant in his account of being brutally attacked for his activism in the LGBT sector in South Africa, coupled with the documentary evidence of systemic abuse and violence against this community, the tribunal believes that the claimant faces a serious possibility of persecution because of activism and imputed sexual orientation where he to return to South Africa. For this reason, the tribunal determines that he is not excluded following section 1E of the Convention because of his status as a permanent resident of South Africa.\nInclusion\nCredibility\n[20] The tribunal found significant credibility issues with the claimant\u2019s testimony concerning the specific allegations of political involvement and mistreatment in the DRC.\n[21] Firstly, the tribunal noted a contradiction between the claimant\u2019s written narrative, and the declarations he made in the IMM5669 form, at question 9 concerning his political involvement in the DRC.\n[22] In his written narrative, the claimant alleges that he belonged to the UNAFEC political organization. He claims to have been designated to represent this party in South Africa, as part of an international expansion effort. Additionally, at the hearing, the claimant further explained that he was drawn to the organization because he adhered to their programs, and believed in their philosophy. He finally stated that he joined in 2010.\n[23] However, the tribunal noted that the claimant did not indicate any form of participation in this party in his IMM5669 form, at question 9. When confronted by this contradiction, the claimant answered that he disclosed his involved with this organization in his written narrative, and did not want to duplicate the information.\n[24] The tribunal considers that this explanation in unreasonable.\n[25] The claimant\u2019s alleged participation in this organization seems to be the main reason he was arrested, detained, and mistreated in his home country. It is therefore a central allegation of his claim, and as such the tribunal would have expected the claimant to mention his participation in this organization when asked to declare \u201cwhat organizations you supported, been a member, or been associated with?\u201d5. The tribunal does not see how \u201cduplicating\u201d the declaration that he belonged to this political organization would be detrimental in establishing this central allegation of his claim. Moreover, the tribunal noted that the claimant listed a number of other organizations he supported, such as the Liberal Party of Canada, Amnesty International, and others. The tribunal finds it therefore further unreasonable that he omitted to indicate his participation in UNAFEC in this form.\n[26] The tribunal draws a negative finding from this contradiction, which undermines the claimant\u2019s credibility.\n[27] Moreover, the tribunal noted a significant incoherence in his oral testimony concerning the means by which he was released from detention.\n[28] At the hearing, the claimant testified that one of the prison guards told him that he looked like one of his old professor, Mr. [XXX]. The claimant then alleges to have answered that professor XXXX was in fact his brother. The claimant would have then pleaded with the guard, asking him to contact his brother, which eventually led to his release through the payment of a bribe. However, the tribunal noted in the claimant\u2019s BOC form indicates that his brother [XXX] passed away on XXXX XXXX, 20136, before the claimant was allegedly placed in detention in [XXX] 2014. Consequently, the claimant\u2019s brother could not have arranged the alleged bribe that would have secured his released.\n[29] When confronted by this incoherence, the claimant answered that his brother passed away in 2014, and not 2013.\n[30] The tribunal finds that this explanation is unreasonable.\n[31] At the beginning of the hearing, the claimant confirmed that his BOC form was true, complete, and accurate, and that he had no amendments of modifications to make. Indeed, the claimant seems to have added the date at which his brother passed away after the initial signature of the form, as this information was added by hand next to his typewritten answers. The tribunal therefore believes that the claimant had all the opportunities to make changes to his BOC form and notice this alleged mistake, yet no changes were made.\n[32] Given the significance of the claimant\u2019s brother\u2019s involvement in securing his released from detention that allegedly occurred in [XXX] 2014, the tribunal draws an important negative finding from this incoherence, which once again affects the claimant\u2019s credibility.\n[33] Moreover, the tribunal noted that the claimant\u2019s Congolese passport7 was renewed after he had been released, and while he was residing in South Africa. The claimant mentioned at the hearing that after his released from detention, and subsequent trip to South Africa, he had not returned to his home country. He added that he believes that the Congolese government still \u201chas eyes on [me]\u201d, that he is still in their system because he was detained and escaped (through bribery), and if he were to return, he could be persecuted, tortured, and killed.\n[34] However, the tribunal noted that his current passport was issued in Kinshasa. When asked to explain how his passport was issued in Kinshasa if he hadn\u2019t returned to his country, the claimant mentioned that his brother renewed his passport on his behalf.\n[35] Although not an expert in Congolese administration, the tribunal finds it at the very least unusual that the claimant\u2019s new passport contained his signature, despite being renewed without his direct involvement. When asked to explain how his new passport could contain his signature if he did not renew it himself, the claimant answered that the Congolese authorities already had his information from his previous passport, which they copied into his new one. The claimant added that there was no security background check when they issued him the new passport.\n[36] Given the circumstances that led the claimant to flee his country, the tribunal confronted the claimant with section 3.5 of the National Documentation Package for the DRC which states that the government had refused to issue new passports to civil society activists and opposition members critical of the government.\n[37] When confronted with this information, which is drawn from credible sources, the claimant answered the people were bribed, and that they simply copied the information from his old passport to his new one.\n[38] The tribunal notes that the information contained in the NDP indicates that passport agents are easily influenced by bribes. On the other hand, the tribunal finds it unusual that an alleged prominent member of civil society, and a member of an opposition party that had the mandate to expand the party\u2019s reach internationally, and that was allegedly jailed as a result of this political involvement would have been able to renew his passport. The tribunal does not impute a direct credibility finding from this incoherence, but it does raise some doubt as to whether the claimant returned to Kinshasa to obtain his passport, and whether he is, as alleged, sought after by the Congolese government.\n[39] Nevertheless, upon review of the other credibility issues outlined above, the tribunal concludes that the claimant did not establish, on a balance of probabilities, that he was a member of an opposition party, nor that he was arrested, detained, and mistreated because of this involvement.\nProfile as civil society member and imputed sexual orientation\n[40] Although the tribunal does not believe that that claimant was mistreated in relation to his work as a political activist in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, his residual profile as an active civil society member was analyzed to ascertain the prospective risk for him if he were to return to his home country.\n[41] Despite the credibility issues outlined above, the tribunal does believe that the claimant was indeed an active member of Congolese civil society, work that he continued in South Africa and in Canada. Because of this profile, especially his work related to LGBT issues, the tribunal believes that the claimant would face a serious possibility of persecution if he were to return to the DRC.\n[42] The tribunal noted that the claimant was interviewed in the media about this work on this subject, and that these articles appear extensively online8. Consequently, the tribunal believes that the claimant has demonstrated on a balance of probabilities that he was, and continues to be extensively involved in advocating for LGBT rights.\n[43] The tribunal is aware of the documentary evidence contained in the National Documentation Package for the DRC. It states that although homosexuality itself is not a crime, the state does use accusations of \u201cindecency\u201d to criminalize homosexual acts9. Furthermore, the NDP states sexual minorities face \u201csocietal discrimination and abuse\u201d, affecting their chances of having a normal education and employment. The NDP also states that \u201csexual minorities are viewed poorly and mistreated by the government\u201d, and victims of harassment from authorities.\n[44] Considering the visible and extensive advocacy work done by the claimant in this domain, the tribunal believes that he may be perceived as a member of the LGBT community. Consequently, the tribunal believes that the imputed sexual orientation of the claimant as a member of the LGBT community would create for him a serious possibility of persecution if he were to return to his country.\nState Protection\n[45] The tribunal believes that there is clear and convincing documentary evidence establishing that sexual minorities are harassed and mistreated in the DRC by state authorities10. Therefore, the tribunal does not believe that the Congolese state could offer adequate protection to the claimant if he were to return to his home country.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[46] Given the pervasiveness of the harsh societal attitudes that considers homosexuality a \u201ctaboo\u201d in the DRC, and that it is generally not accepted in the country, the tribunal does not believe that there is a viable internal flight alternative for the claimant in his country. The tribunal also notes the extensive documentary evidence about the claimant\u2019s advocacy work in this domain available online and that is available by a simple search of the claimant\u2019s name. Consequently, the tribunal believes that there exist a serious possibility of persecution for the claimant throughout his home country.\n[XXX]\n[47] The tribunal examined the claim for the claimant\u2019s son, [XXX], who is a citizen of South Africa. For the following reasons, the tribunal does not believe that the claimant established that his son would face a serious possibility of persecution, or, by balance of probabilities, a risk under section 97(1) of the IRPA if he were to return to his home country.\n[48] At the hearing, the claimant testified that he fears for his son, since he has always been under his care, and that he fears that he could also be a target in South Africa. He also states that there may be psychological issues of being separated by his father.\n[49] The tribunal considered these allegations, but does not believe that the claimant has demonstrated any prospective risk for his son upon a return to South Africa. Indeed, the tribunal believes that the claimant\u2019s attack was targeted toward him in response of his advocacy work. There is no indication that these attackers were interested in also targeting his family members.\n[50] Furthermore, [XXX] mother still lives in South Africa, with his half-sister. There is no indication that either of these individuals have been targeted.\n[51] For these reasons, the tribunal believes that the claimant has not established that there exist a serious possibility of persecution, or, by balance of probabilities, a risk under section 97(1) of the IRPA if he were to return to his home country.\nCONCLUSION\n[52] The tribunal concludes that there is a serious possibility of persecution for Mr. [XXX] based on his imputed sexual orientation and activism. His claim is accepted.\n[53] Having considered all the evidence, the tribunal finds that Mr. [XXX] has not met his burden of establishing a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground, or that it is more likely than not that he would be personally subjected to a danger of torture or face a risk to his life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, were he to return to his country. As a result, he is neither a \u201cConvention refugee\u201d, nor a \u201cperson in need of protection\u201d. Therefore, the tribunal rejects his claim.\n(signed) Jason Benovoy\nApril 24, 2019\n1 Document 2 \u2013 Package of information from the referring Canada Border Services Agency \/ Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada.\n\n2 Document 3 \u2013 NDP for South Africa, Section 2.13\n\n3 Document 3 \u2013 NDP for South Africa, Section 2.1\n\n4 Document 3 \u2013 NDP for South Africa, Section 6.1\n\n5 Document 2 \u2013 Supra note 1, IMM 5669 form, Question 9.\n\n6 Document 1 \u2013 Basis of Claim form, Question 5\n\n7 Document 2 \u2013 Package of information from the referring Canada Border Services Agency \/ Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada.\n\n8 Document 4 \u2013 Exhibit C-2\n\n9 National Documentation Package, Congo, Democratic Republic of the, 31 July 2018, Tab 6.1: Response to Information Request, Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada, 22 April 2014, COD104815.FE.\n\n10 National Documentation Package, Congo, Democratic Republic of the, 31 July 2018, Tab 2.1\n",

Gibson\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): John Savaglio\nCountry: Pakistan\nRPD Number: TB8-01706\nAssociated RPD Number(s): TB8-01741, TB8-01743\nATIP Number: A-2021-01124\nATIP Pages: 000231-000243\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] [XXX] (the \u201cprincipal claimant\u201d), his wife [XXX] (the \u201cassociate claimant\u201d), and their four children [XXX], [XXX], [XXX] and [XXX] claim to be citizens of Pakistan and seek refugee protection pursuant to s. 96 and s.97(l) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).1\n[2] The panel heard these claims jointly pursuant to RPD Rule 55.\n[3] The principal claimant was appointed as designated representative for the claimants [XXX] and [XXX] as they are still minors. Claimants [XXX] and [XXX] are both adults over the age of 18 as of the date of the hearing in this claim.\n[4] The panel has considered Chairperson\u2019s Guidelines: Proceedings Before the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada Involving Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression (SOGIE GUIDELINES) in reaching a determination in these claims.2\nALLEGATIONS\n[5] The claimants\u2019 allegations are set out in detail in their Basis of Claim (BOC) forms.3 In summary, the principal claimant, a 49-year-old man, alleges to be bisexual. He further alleges that his brother-in-law [XXX] and other members of Muslim extremist group Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan (SSP) discovered him being sexually intimate with his same sex partner in Pakistan in [XXX] 2017 and that his wife, members of her family and other members of the extremist group were all subsequently informed of the principal claimant\u2019s sexual orientation. The principal claimant alleges to fear persecution in Pakistan by his wife\u2019s family, members of SSP and by society in general on the basis of his sexual orientation. The associate claimant and her four children allege fear of persecution by the same agents of harm based on threats received after the discovery of the principal claimant\u2019s sexual orientation.\n[6] The claimants left Pakistan and travelled to the United States on [XXX] 2017. They then traveled to Canada on [XXX] 2018 where they made a refugee claim at the port of entry.\nANALYSIS \u2013 PRINCIPAL CLAIMANT\nIdentity\n[7] The principal claimant\u2019s personal identity and his Pakistani citizenship has been established on a balance of probabilities by his Pakistani passport, a copy of which is on file.4\nNexus\n[8] The principal claimant alleges fears based on his sexual orientation as a bisexual man. The panel therefore analysed his allegations under the Convention ground of particular social group, namely bisexual men.\nCredibility\n[9] The principal claimant testified in a largely straightforward and spontaneous manner about his sexual orientation and the challenges he experienced in living as a bisexual man in Pakistan, and hiding this aspect of his identity from almost everyone, including his family, for much of his life. There were no inconsistencies in his testimony that go to the heart of the claim or that have not been satisfactorily explained.\n[10] The claimants provided several documents in support of their claims, including affidavits from three of the principal claimant\u2019s brothers;5 a letter from relative [XXX] who hosted the family in [XXX] when they fled their home in Lahore prior w leaving Pakistan;6 photos of the principal claimant and his former same-sex partner and of the principal claimant at a Pride event in 2018;7 marriage and family registration certificates;8 a letter from the principal claimant\u2019s former business partner who learned of the principal claimant\u2019s sexual orientation and forced him to relinquish his share of the business;9 documents related to the principal claimant\u2019s position with and co-ownership of his former business in Pakistan;10 a medical document for treatment the principal claimant received after he was assaulted on discovery of him with the former partner;11 and, a number of documents from The 519 Church Street Community Centre confirming that the principal claimant is a member, that he attended newcomer orientation and peer support group events there more than 20 times after his arrival in Canada.12\n[11] The panel is concerned about the lack of additional documentation related to the principal claimant\u2019s former same-sex partner [XXX], given the very long duration and importance of this relationship, as no documents were provided other than a few photos taken in the 1990s. The principal claimant testified that they were together for 32 years, from when the principal claimant was a teenager until he left Pakistan in [XXX] 2017 just before his forty-eighth birthday. The principal claimant also testified that he and [XXX] communicated via WhatsApp for a few months after the principal claimant came to Canada before losing touch with one another around [XXX] 2018. When the panel asked the principal claimant as to why he does not have copies of these messages or a support letter from [XXX] he testified that they lost touch around [XXX] 2018 when [XXX] moved from Lahore to Karachi, and that the prior WhatsApp messages between them were lost when the principal claimant changed cell phones.\n[12] The panel considered the inherent difficulties often found in providing corroborating documentation in many sexual orientation claims, as highlighted in the SOGIE Guidelines, in weighing this concern. Given the consistency of the principal claimant\u2019s testimony around this relationship and within his claim generally, and the detailed answers the principal claimant provided regarding the concerns raised, the panel accepts the principal claimant\u2019s explanations regarding these concerns as reasonable and draws no negative inference as to his credibility.\n[13] The panel therefore finds that the principal claimant began questioning his sexual orientation as a child around age 13 or 14. The panel finds the principal claimant began a relationship with [XXX] in secondary school that continued after the principal claimant married the associate claimant in 2012, and that the associate claimant was at that time unaware of the principal claimant\u2019s sexual orientation or the ongoing relationship with [XXX]. The panel finds that [XXX] the brother of the associate claimant, is a supporter of Muslim extremist group SSP, and that he and several other members of SSP discovered the principal claimant and [XXX] together in [XXX] 2017. [XXX] subsequently informed the associate claimant and her family members and threatened to kill the principal claimant.\n[14] Considering the entirety of the evidence, and in the absence of evidence to the contrary, the panel accepts the principal claimant\u2019s allegations regarding his sexual orientation as true. The panel finds that the principal claimant is a bisexual man,\nProspective Risk of Return\n[15] A claimant must demonstrate that they would face a serious possibility of persecution based on a Convention ground if they were to return to their country or that, on a balance of probabilities, removal to their country would subject them personally to a danger of torture within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture or to a risk to their life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\n[16] In gauging the principal claimant\u2019s prospective risk of return to Pakistan, the panel has taken into consideration his personal profile and particular situation at the present time.\n[17] The panel has also taken into consideration the objective evidence regarding the current situation in Pakistan particularly for bisexual men. The documentary evidence in the National Documentation Package (NDP) for Pakistan along with documents provided by counsel, show that LGBT individuals from privileged backgrounds do enjoy some degree of openness in certain circles provided that they lived discreetly.13 The evidence dearly states that consensual same-sex relationships are criminalized in Pakistan, but also indicates that these laws are rarely enforced.14 However, they are often used to threaten or blackmail people.15 There are also consistent reports of attacks and physical violence against men who are known to engage in homosexual relationships in Pakistan.16 Objective sources also confirm that there are no laws to protect against discrimination based on sexual orientation.17 They further provide that openly LGBT individuals would be subject to a high risk of societal violence.18\n[l8] Considering the entirety of the evidence, the panel finds that bisexual men may suffer discrimination and violence that could amount to persecution based on their sexual orientation in Pakistan at present. As the principal claimant has demonstrated that he is a bisexual man and therefore a member of this community, the panel further finds that he has established that his claim has an objective basis and his fear is well-founded.\nState Protection and Internal Flight Alternative\n[19] Claimants must establish through clear and convincing evidence that the State would be unwilling or unable to provide adequate protection if they were to return to their country. Claimants must also establish that they have a well-founded fear of persecution throughout their country of nationality. The panel finds that the principal claimant has rebutted the presumption of state protection and that an internal flight alternative (IFA) would not be available to him.\n[20] According to the objective evidence, the LGBT community faces widespread discrimination and violence throughout Pakistan.19 There is a national law against same sex activities in Pakistan and although the authorities rarely prosecute cases, the law is in place and it may be applied.20 These laws also deter members of the LGBT community from acknowledging their sexual orientation or reporting abuses to the police. The evidence shows that treatment of members of the LGBT community is not limited to any particular area of Pakistan, but is widespread.21\n[21] The panel also notes that there are reports of corruption and impunity within the police forces. Reports indicate that the police are under-sourced, poorly trained, badly paid, low in morale, and viewed with suspicion by the courts and society because of their poor human rights record.22\n[22] Considering the entirety of the evidence and in consideration of all the elements noted, the panel concludes that there is clear and convincing evidence that at this time the State is unable or unwilling to provide the principal claimant with adequate protection in Pakistan. The panel finds that the presumption of State protection has been rebutted in these particular circumstances. The panel further finds there is a serious possibility of persecution for the principal claimant throughout Pakistan at this time, Therefore, a viable internal flight alternative is also not available at present for the principal claimant in his country of nationality.\nANALYSIS \u2013 ASSOCIATE CLAIMANT AND THE FOUR CHILDREN\n[23] The determinative issues in the associate claimant\u2019s and the four children of the principal and associate claimants\u2019 cases are credibility and the well-foundedness of their allegations regarding Pakistan.\nIdentity\n[24] The personal identities of the associate claimant and the four children and their Pakistani citizenship has been established on a balance of probabilities by their Pakistani passports, copies of which are on file.23\nNexus\n[25] The associate claimant and the four children allege fears based on their familial relationship to the principal claimant. The panel therefore analysed their allegations under the Convention grounds of particular social group, namely family of a bisexual man.\nCredibility\n[26] A claimant\u2019s sworn testimony is presumed truthful unless there are reasons to doubt the veracity of their allegations.24 After considering the principal claimant\u2019s testimony in its entirety, the panel finds that material aspects regarding threat to the associate claimant and the four children are not credible. The areas of concern are outlined below.\n[27] The panel notes that the principal claimant provided the majority of the testimony at the hearing as his experiences are the most central to the present claims. However, the associate claimant and claimants [XXX] and [XXX] were all given opportunities to testify themselves, and each indicated they agreed with the testimony the principal claimant had provided.\n[28] The claimants allege that [XXX] repeatedly tried to pressure the associate claimant and oldest son [XXX] to abandon the principal claimant after his sexual orientation was discovered. The claimants also allege that [XXX] and other family members tried in [XXX] 2017 to forcibly abduct [XXX] who was then 18 years old, to take him to [XXX] home and away from his father.\n[29] At the hearing, the principal claimant testified that during the failed abduction attempt [XXX] threatened that if [XXX] continues to support the principal claimant then [XXX] is also implicated in the sin associated with his father\u2019s sexual orientation. The panel asked the principal claimant why he didn\u2019t mention this threat in his BOC. The principal claimant testified that the failed abduction attempt was mentioned in the BOC. The panel repeated its question. The principal claimant testified that if the abduction attempt were to take place then there must be solid reason behind that incident.\n[30] The panel finds the principal claimant\u2019s testimony was evasive and failed to address the question. The claimants state in their BOCs that the abduction attempt was an effort to get the principal claimant\u2019s family to abandon him. Threatening [XXX] instead when the abduction and other efforts to isolate the principal claimant were unsuccessful is a significant and distinct component to the claimants\u2019 allegations. Threat migrating from the principal claimant to his family members is not a minor detail and the panel finds the failure to mention this in the BOCs is a material omission.\n[31] The panel further notes that the principal claimant wrote in his BOC that he and the associate claimant did not believe [XXX] meant to harm his son Haris in the abduction attempt and \u2018that he had taken such actions in a fit of emotion because of his extremist religions background\u2019.25 The BOC further states that the associate claimant did not want to implicate her only brother in any kind of criminal case regarding the attempted abduction.26 The panel notes that all the claimants used the narrative of the principal claimant in their BOCs.\n[32] The panel finds these BOC statements further undermine the credibility of the principal claimant\u2019s testimony regarding [XXX] threatening [XXX] during the alleged failed abduction. The panel therefore finds the claimants failed to establish on a balance of probabilities that such an abduction attempt or threats to [XXX] ever took place.\n[33] The principal claimant in his oral testimony stated that the associate claimant and their other three chidlren would also be at risk from [XXX] as they, too, would be seen as supporting him in his so-called sin having not divorced or otherwise left the principal claimant The principal claimant also testified, however, that there had been no actual threats against the associate and remaining claimants. Everything in the BOC regarding the associate claimant and the four children and [XXX] indicates he pressured them repeatedly to leave the principal claimant but there is no mention of harm directed at them. As the panel has found the claimants failed to establish the threat against [XXX] took place, it further finds on a balance of probabilities that the other claimants were not threatened by [XXX] either.\nProspective Risk of Return\n[34] The panel considered whether the associate claimant and the four children would be at risk from SSP or otherwise in Pakistan based on their relationship with the principal claimant and given that his bisexual orientation was discovered by the associate claimant\u2019s family and through them by the SSP. The panel finds the associate claimant and the four children failed to establish that they would face a serious possibility of harm or a danger of torture or a risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment should they return to Pakistan.\n[35] At the hearing, the principal claimant testified that he believed the associate claimant and the four children would be at risk of harm al the hands of SSP should they return to Pakistan. The panel notes that the claimants did not allege any threats by SSP against the associate claimant or the four children in the BOC forms. The only allegations in the BOC involving the associate claimant and the four children involve claimant [XXX] and [XXX] and the panel has determined those allegations are not credible.\n[36] Even accepting that SSP is aware of the associate claimant and the four children and their relationship to and continuing support for the principal claimant as a bisexual man, the available country condition evidence does not indicate that this relationship would result in harm to these claimants. In reviewing the NDP evidence, along with submissions from counsel, the panel finds that the claimants have foiled to establish on a balance of probabilities that SSP and other extremist groups in Pakistan have any interest in the families of LGBT individuals or have engaged in acts of violence or other persecution against them.27\n[37] Given the country condition documents provided by the claimants, and the more than 4,700 pages of country conditions documents in the NDP, it is reasonable to expect that there would be clear reports of the SSP or other groups engaging in this type of harm if it was something they actually did. The absence of such reports is indicative of SSP and other groups not having the interest and ability to persecute families of LGBT individuals.\n[38] The panel has found that the allegations of threats against the associate claimant and the four children by [XXX] are not credible. The objective evidence also does not establish that wives or children of bisexual men typically face any risk of harm in Pakistan at present from SSP or other extremist groups. The panel therefore finds that the associate claimant and the four children do not face a serious possibility of harm should they return to Pakistan.\nDETERMINATION \u2013 PRINCIPAL CLAIMANT\n[39] The panel finds that the principal claimant has established that he faces a serious possibility of persecution in Pakistan based on his sexual orientation as a bisexual man. The panel concludes that the principal claimant is a Convention refugee and therefore accepts his claim.\nDETERMINATION \u2013 ASSOCIATE CLAIMANT AND THE FOUR CHILDREN\n[40] The panel further finds that the associate claimant and the four children of the associate and principal claimant have not established a serious possibility of persecution in Pakistan on a Convention ground nor have they established, on a balance of probabilities, that they would be personally subjected to a danger of torture, or face a risk to their lives, or a risk of unusual treatment or punishment upon their removal to Pakistan. The associate claimant\u2019s refugee claim and those of the four children are rejected.\n(signed) K.

        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2019 RLLR 39\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: November 14, 2019\n\nPanel: Kari Schroeder\nCountry: Mexico\nRPD Number: VB9-01375\nATIP Number: A-2021-01124\nATIP Pages: 000226-000230\n\u2014 DECISION\n[1] PRESIDING MEMBER: This is the decision of the Refugee Protection Division in the claim of [XXX] as a citizen of Mexico who is claiming refugee protection pursuant to ss. 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[2] In rendering my decision, I have applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guidelines on sexual orientation and gender identity.\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] The following is a brief synopsis of the allegations put forward by the claimant:\n[4] The claimant fears returning to Mexico due to her sexual orientation as a bisexual woman. The claimant had her first homosexual relationship after high school. The two women were caught one day by a teacher and the claimant was refused entrance to the school for the following school year. The claimant and her girlfriend were also attacked on the street, and her girlfriend\u2019s car was destroyed. On one occasion, they were threatened at gunpoint. The claimant went to the police but nothing was done.\n[5] In 2013, the claimant moved to Playa del Carmen for a work opportunity. The claimant was approached and threatened by a group of men who had seen her holding hands with another woman. On another occasion, a group of men threw stones at her house. The claimant moved several times to avoid the threats. Her car was also damaged in an attack, and in 2018 her house was broken into with all of her belongings destroyed. The intruders left a threatening note stating that she was going to die.\n[6] The claimant entered Canada on [XXX], 2018 and claimed refugee protection in February of 2019.\nDETERMINATION\n[7] I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to s. 96 of the Act for the reasons that follow:\nANALYSIS\n[8] The claimant\u2019s identity today has been established through her sworn testimony as well as a certified copy of her passport on file.\n[9] In terms of credibility, when assessing credibility there is a presumption that claimants are telling the truth unless there is a reason to doubt the claimant\u2019s allegations. In this case I have no reason to doubt the truthfulness of the claimant\u2019s story. She testified in a straightforward manner with no embellishments and there were no inconsistencies between her testimony and her basis of claim form.\n[10] The claimant testified that she felt she was different starting in high school. Once she finished high school, she began studying translation and met a girl named [XXX]. [XXX] was openly a lesbian and helped the claimant accept her own sexuality. The relationship evolved and eventually, became physical. The claimant described [XXX] as intelligent and confident and that she was physically attracted to her. The relationship lasted four years, and at first, only the claimant\u2019s best friend knew. The claimant described how she cried when she first opened up to her friend.\n[11] The claimant testified that two days after a teacher discovered her and [XXX] kissing in a classroom, that she was not allowed to go back to the school. She testified that if she and [XXX] ever held hands or displayed any affection in public, people on the street would give them nasty looks. The relationship eventually ended after a violent attack in 2006 which made them both afraid to go out together. The claimant described details of the attack and what was said to the two women. The claimant went to the police and when she told them why she had been attacked, the police told her that there was no case.\n[12] The claimant has had four relationships during her five years in Playa del Carmen, three with women and one with a man. She experienced several threats during that time period, even though she tried to keep those relationships with women discreet. The claimant self-identifies as bisexual. She testified that she is not currently in a relationship in Canada. She also testified that her family in Mexico does not know that she is bisexual and that they believe she is just working in Canada. She testified that when she tried to tell her mother on one occasion, her mother told her that she would rather the claimant be a drug addict than be attracted to women.\n[13] After hearing the claimant\u2019s testimony, I believe her allegations and accept that she has a subjective fear of returning to Mexico due to her sexual orientation as a bisexual woman. Further, although she did visit Canada in 2017, I find that her failure to claim refugee protection at that time does not detract from her subjective fear. She testified that it was the attack and threatening note left in her home in 2018 that prompted her to leave the country, as at that point she was not even safe in her own home. I accept this explanation as reasonable.\n[14] I find there is a nexus in this case to the Convention ground of membership in a particular social group; namely, sexual orientation. Having accepted the claimant\u2019s allegations as credible, I turn to the objective evidence before me.\n[15] According to the US Department of State Report on Human Rights, which is document 2.1 of the National Documentation Package, a Mexico City municipal law provides increased penalties for hate crimes based on sexual orientation and gender identity. However, civil society groups claimed that police routinely subjected LGBT persons to mistreatment while in custody. Discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity was prevalent despite the new laws and despite a gradual increase in public tolerance of LGBT individuals. There were reports that the government did not always investigate and punish those complicit in abuses, especially outside Mexico City.\n[16] For example, on August 5th of last year, and 18-year-old man was beaten to death allegedly by a group of 10 taxi drivers outside of a gay bar. Local human rights defenders claim the killing was a hate crime because the victim was attacked due to his sexual orientation. Advocates have also argued negligence in investigating the case, due to homophobia in police ranks.\n[17] According to an Immigration and Refugee Board response to information request, this is document 6.2, the vague terminology in the laws such as, \u201cabnormal sexual life\u201d, makes LGBT people vulnerable to the interpretation of these laws by local authorities. The concept of machismo is still embedded in Mexican culture which increases homophobia and discrimination against sexual minorities.\n[18] With respect to the situation in Yucatan, where the claimant previously lived, this report states that,\n\u201cMore LGBT individuals were killed in 2017 and 2018 than in previous years for reasons believed to be due to their real or perceived sexual or gender identity.\u201d\n[19] And with respect to the situation in Mexico City, a response to information report at document 6.4, states that there are,\n\u201cgay-friendly zones where the LGBT community feels more safe from being abused. Although, there are police officers that look for any way to intimidate or extort couples wherever they are.\u201d\n[20] In a 2015 report on the situation of human rights in Mexico, the Inter-American Commission for Human Rights reports that it does not know of any \u2014 sorry, that notes there have been some improvements in Mexico City in terms of discrimination against LGBT persons, unlike other parts of the country.\n[21] However, this same document goes on to state,\n\u201cAn alarming pattern of homicides of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals and the broad impunity for these crimes, sometimes with the suspected complicity of investigative authorities.\u201d\n[22] After reviewing the objective evidence before me, I find that despite some improvements to the legal situation for same-sex couples, and some improvements to the laws preventing discrimination, LGBTI people in Mexico face an ongoing risk of violence in a culture that still places a significant stigma on sexual orientation that is anything other than heterosexual. With the exception of a few safe zones in one or two cities, the claimant would not be free to live openly as a bisexual woman in Mexico. Based on the evidence before me I, therefore, find that the claimant has established that she would face a serious possibility of persecution in Mexico based on her sexual orientation.\n[23] In terms of state protection, the evidence established that authorities are often complicit in crimes against the LGBT community and in any event, often fail to protect the victims. The claimant herself went to the police on a couple of occasions to report the attacks against her and nothing was done. I, therefore, find that state protection would not be reasonably forthcoming to the claimant in this case.\n[24] In terms of any internal flight alternative, the evidence before me establishes that the treatment of LGBT persons varies from state to state. According to document 6.4 of the National Documentation Package, the worst places where sexual minorities are most ostracized are Merida, Yucatan, Leon, Guanajuato, Monterrey, Nueva Leon and Jalisco. Even though Mexico City and Guadalajara are said to be friendlier, the evidence establishes that LGBT people are not immune from violence in any city. The claimant cannot be expected to hide in any internal flight alternative or restrict her movements to one or two neighbourhoods in a city where she may or may not be safe. I, therefore, find that there is no viable internal flight alternative available to the claimant in this case.\nCONCLUSION\n[25] I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to s. 96 of the Act and the Board, therefore, accepts her claim today.\n[26] All right, thank you very much everyone, that concludes our hearing, and I wish you the best of luck.\n\u2014 DECISION CONCLUDED\n",

        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2019 RLLR 38\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: December 10, 2019\n\nPanel: Isis van Loon\nCountry: Nigeria\nRPD Number: VB9-00362\nATIP Number: A-2021-01124\nATIP Pages: 000217-000225\n\u2014 DECISION\n[1] PRESIDING MEMBER: [XXX], the principal claimant, and [XXX], the minor claimant, seek refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. I maintain the designation of [XXX] as the representative for the minor claimant pursuant to subsection 167(2) of the Act in Rule 20 of the Refugee Protection Division Rules. These claims were joined according to Rule 55 of the Refugee Protection Division Rules. When rendering my Reasons, I have considered and applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guidelines on Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution.\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] The principal claimant alleges that if she returns to Nigeria she will be forced to marry her brother-in-law, who has sexually assaulted her a number of times. The brother-in-law will also take her son and force him to undergo rituals. As well, the claimants are at risk from Fulani herdsmen, who burned down their village in [XXX] 2016, which forced the claimant to live with her missing husband\u2019s family in their village.\n[3] I find that the claimant has established she faces a serious risk of persecution on a Convention ground in Nigeria. My reasons are as follows. I also find the minor claimant faces a serious risk of persecution on a Convention ground.\nIDENTITY\n[4] The claimants\u2019 identities and citizenship as nationals of Nigeria was established by the principal claimant\u2019s testimony and supporting documentation filed, including certified true copies of their passports in Exhibit 1.\nCREDIBILITY\n[5] The principal claimant testified in a straightforward manner with no inconsistencies in her testimony or contradictions between her testimony and the other evidence before me. I found her to be a credible witness and, therefore, have accepted as generally true the facts that she alleged in support of her claim. Unless I specifically note in my analysis, as I said, I found her generally credible and the minor claimant did not testify.\n[6] The principal claimant provided the following relevant and probative documents in Exhibit 4. There was a Nigerian Police report from [XXX], 2015, reporting her missing husband; a medical report from [XXX], 2017, after a sexual assault, and numerous affidavits from friends and family, all attesting to the treatment by the principal claimant\u2019s brother-in-law, as well as her subsequent actions. I found those documents were relevant and served to corroborate the principal claimant\u2019s core allegations, in terms of nexus, I found the persecution the principal claimant faces has a nexus to the Convention ground of membership in a particular social group, as a woman at risk of sexual violence and forced marriage. With the minor claimant, there\u2019s a nexus to that of a child at risk of literal abuse.\n[7] In order to be considered a Convention refugee, a claimant has to demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution, including subjective fear and objective basis for that fear. Based on the testimony, supporting documents and country condition documents, I found the claimants do have a well-founded fear of persecution for the following reasons.\n[8] In terms of subjective fear, the principal claimant initially attempted to resist the forcible advances of her brother-in-law, [XXX]. After a sexual assault by [XXX] on [XXX], 2017, she escaped with the minor claimant to [XXX]. [XXX] located her there within a week, continued to threaten her. With the assistance of her friend, she made arrangements to leave as quickly as possible and did so when they had sufficient funds, arriving in the USA on [XXX], 2017.\n[9] Fearing Trump policies against refugees, she decided to come to Canada, which she did [XXX] of 2017, and claimed asylum. Based on her actions and the timing thereof, as well as her credible testimony, I found the claimants have adduced sufficient credible evidence to establish a subjective fear of persecution in Nigeria.\n[10] The principal claimant testified about the series of events that started with the disappearance of her husband on [XXX], 2015. She reported this to the police and checked in with them, but no progress on the investigation had occurred. When the Fulani burnt her home on [XXX], 2016, she fled to her husband\u2019s village to stay with her in-laws there. In [XXX] of 2016, her brother-in-law [XXX] sexually assaulted her. On [XXX], 2017, the family had a meeting where they decided that tradition should be followed or bad things would happen in their village and to them and this meant that the principal claimant would have to marry her brother-in-law [XXX] as they believed by that time that her husband was deceased.\n[11] She refused to follow this tradition and fled after [XXX] sexually assaulted her with a weapon on [XXX], 2017. Sam located the claimants in [XXX] about a week later and threatened them again that they needed to undergo the ritual and the principal claimant needed to marry him. She testified about the specific ritual that was to be undergone by both her and her son, where they were to be cut and marked in various areas and have cow\u2019s blood and other things rubbed into these during an event that would take about three days.\n[12] She also spoke of [XXX] (phonetic), a woman from her husband\u2019s village that she knew. She met her after she got married and a similar type of thing happened. Her husband went missing at the hands of the Boko Haram or the Fulani herdsmen and, according to tradition, the people would force the woman to marry the husband\u2019s brother. This woman, however, [XXX], she refused and she was killed when she refused to marry the brother by the brother. This was in 2014 and apparently she knew that [XXX] had gone to the police and the police said that they couldn\u2019t do anything and said it was just a family matter. In effect, the country documentation confirms that these traditional things are often treated as a family-related incident and the police tend not to get involved. The country documentation evidence also confirms that sexual violence against women is common and that ritual activities continue. Based on all the evidence before me, I found the claimants would face a serious possibility of persecution if the were to return to Nigeria and be found by [XXX].\n[13] In terms of state protection, except in situations where a state is in complete breakdown, states must be presumed capable of protecting their citizens. I found, however, that adequate state protection would not be reasonably forthcoming in this particular case. The principal claimant described how she had not reported the sexual assaults by [XXX] as she was afraid the same thing would happen to her as happened to Nagosi and she described how [XXX] actually threatened to kill her if she did report to police.\n[14] There are a number of laws that exist to protect women against violence and these have been strengthened by the Violence Against Persons Prohibition Act in 2016. However, they are not effectively implemented in practice and are quite variable. There is no comprehensive law for combatting violence against women and, as a result, victims and survivors had little or no recourse to justice, according to the NDP 2.1. Police response is often poor and despite the existence of some laws, the persecution rates for domestic violence are low. It\u2019s uncommon for cases to reach persecution. The burden of proof is on the victim according to NDP 5.3. Additionally, there are few shelters and restraining orders provide minimal, if any, protection in practice.\n[15] In a Response to Information Request from the IRB, a doctoral candidate states about victims of ritual practices that to his knowledge the police response is not recognized and institutionalized. He further stated that based on his direct observation and research experience over five years in Southern Nigeria, that Nigerian police officers tend to be discriminatory in their treatment of victims of ritual practices, particularly for women, and that this attitude is formed by customary norms and the subjugation of women in most Southern Nigerian societies.\n[16] The same source added that a lack of trust in the police also inhibits the reporting of ritual practices, especially by women. Furthermore, according to this source, police officers are themselves often a part of the culture in which ritual practices take place and they can have difficulty recognizing whether ritual practices are criminal or not and they weigh the evidence also against the religion rights and intent of the ritual practices.\n[17] Similarly, another source noted that because Nigerian police officers themselves come from communities where different rituals apply, they have to respect the culture and traditions and they\u2019re reluctant to provide protection to someone who is refusing to undergo a ritual. So I find that in terms of both the sexual violence and the traditional and ritual aspects of this that state protection would not be adequate nor reasonably forthcoming for the claimants in this case and, therefore, the presumption of state protection is rebutted.\n[18] At the beginning of the hearing, I proposed several cities as internal flight alternatives, Benin City, Port Harcourt or Abuja. The principal claimant testified that there are family members of her in-laws in both Port Harcourt and Abuja, so I primarily focused from then on, on Benin City. An internal flight alternative arises when a claimant, who otherwise meets all the elements of the definition of a person in need or protection or as a Convention refugee in their home area of the country, nevertheless is not in need of protection because they would live safely elsewhere in that country.\n[19] There is a legal test, which has two prove to be satisfied that the claimants would not face a serious possibility of persecution in the part of the country in which I found an IFA exists and conditions in the part of the country considered to be an IFA must be such that it would not be unreasonable, in all the circumstances, including those particular to the claimants, for them to seek refuge there.\n[20] If either prong of the internal flight alternative test fails, then there is no viable internal flight alternative. I\u2019ve started, in fact, with the second prong about whether or not the proposed IFAs are reasonable. At the beginning of the hearing I proposed, as I said, Port Harcourt, Abuja and Benin City, but primarily focused on Benin City. Having found the claimants face a serious possibility of persecution from the agent of harm, I have turned to the second prong of the IFA test, the test used in Canadian refugee jurisprudence, to assess whether a claimant could travel to and remain in a safer area of their countries, whether it would be unduly harsh to expect the claimant to do so. There\u2019s a very high threshold for this unreasonableness test. It requires nothing less than the existence of conditions which would jeopardize the life and safety of a claimant in travelling to or relocating to a safe area and it requires actual and concrete evidence of such conditions.\n[21] I\u2019ve considered whether it would be reasonable to expect the claimants to travel to and relocate in any of the proposed IFAs. An IFA has to be realistically accessible. If a claimant would encounter physical danger travelling there, if they would encounter persecution while en route or they would otherwise be barred from travelling to an area then an IFA location would not be viable. However, the Nigerian Constitution provides for the right to travel within Nigeria. The country condition documents show that Nigerians, including women, can and do move freely throughout most of the country, including the IFA proposed cities.\n[22] With respect to the burden of proof, the Court of Appeal in Rasaratnam (phonetic) has held that once an IFA is raised, the onus is on the claimant to show that they don\u2019t have one. The burden, as I said, is fairly high in order to show that an IFA is unreasonable. In fact, the Federal Court of Appeal stated that to show an IFA is unreasonable requires nothing less than the existence of conditions jeopardizing the life and safety of a claimant in relocating to that place.\n[23] The Chairperson identified the Refugee Appeal Division decision for TB7-19851 as a jurisprudential guide. I\u2019ve considered this guide and the decision of the Refugee Appeal Division in which the jurisprudential guide in question is based analyzes the viability of an internal flight location within Nigeria for single women. That concludes more broadly than internal relocation and Nigeria is generally considered to be viable for refugee claimants fearing non-state actors. In this case, the RAD decision established there are several large multilingual, multi-ethnic cities in South and Central Nigeria which include the IFAs mentioned, where persons fleeing non-state actors may be safely able to establish themselves, depending upon their particular circumstances.\n[24] There\u2019s a non-exhaustive list of factors that may be considered in determining whether the conditions in an IFA render it objectively unreasonable for the claimant. These factors are travel, transportation, language, education, employment, accommodation, healthcare, culture, (indiscernible) and religion. Additionally, the Chairperson\u2019s Gender Guidelines specifically instruct decision makers to consider whether and how these factors affect women in the IFA.\n[25] The cm before me is both a single woman and the mother of a young son, so she\u2019s a single mother, unlike the single woman who had no children in the jurisprudential guide case. The principal claimant has some post secondary education, but in this case her work experience is quite limited. She worked partly while as a student and then on her husband\u2019s farm after she was married. So she does have some experience in farming.\n[26] The principal claimant testified, and the country documents support this, there are real difficulties for women in obtaining employment and housing and that this is exacerbated when a woman does not have family assistance and support. Family can help members to find housing, as well as work. In Nigeria, women need adult male members of family or other males to provide references and sign for them, particularly with respect to housing. Usually this is done by male family members. The claimant herself stated that if she had family in the IFA she could rely upon them to care for her son, if she was able to find work, and that she would need to support herself and her son. Her family has to date refused to support her and, in fact, advised her to follow the traditional practices that her brother-in-law has been demanding.\n[27] She initially fled to [XXX] to stay with her sister, but her sister turned her out. So her family has told her to follow traditional practices, marry [XXX] and undergo the ritual that will ensure her husband\u2019s ghost did not return to haunt the family. I\u2019m satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that these claimants have no family support in Nigeria and this will negatively impact their ability to find housing and employment, as well as assisting with childcare.\n[28] According to the jurisprudential guide, unemployment is generally high in Nigeria and work can be difficult to find. There are more female-headed households in the south than in the north and it is generally easier for women to obtain work in the south than in the north but, quite frankly, this is not saying a lot and it certainly doesn\u2019t say that it is easy for women to find work. The J.G. says that where a claimant has achieved post secondary education or has meaningful work experience, they may be in a better position of securing employment than the average Nigerian.\n[29] This claimant does have some post secondary education, but her Nigerian work experience is limited to farming and some past office work that she did as a student. Additionally, she has a young child, the minor claimant, in her care, and without family or contacts, she would have to find a way to ensure safe childcare while she worked if she was able to find work. She has no connections in the IFAs. She speaks a different dialect from the locals and she would face great difficulty in finding employment, which is sometimes based on indigeneship or family connections. The J.G. states that in order for a single woman to get a reasonable job in \u2014 they were talking about Port Harcourt or Ibadan in that case, or presumably other large cities, she would need to have the help of someone influential or rich and also that it is easier for single women with high education and high social status to use this status to give them access to people who are in power who could assist her to find work. I\u2019m satisfied that the principal claimant, as a single mother, albeit with some degree of education, but with limited work experience and with no high status standing and, therefore, no connections that that would bring, she would face extreme difficulty in finding work.\n[30] The NDP 5.9 shows that it can be difficult for women to find housing, in part due to the cost and in part if they do not have male assistance. While the north of the country is once again even worse, the south is still very difficult for women. In particular, the ability to find gainful employment, according to NDP 13.1, is a key factor in finding housing. I\u2019ve already discussed my views on the difficulty this claimant faces in finding employment and I am satisfied that without work she would have great difficulty in supporting herself and her son in terms of housing, as well as food and other necessary item and the Nigerian state has little to no social supports available to assist her.\n[31] The claimant stated the indigeneship would be a factor, making it difficult to relocate. The documents show that this is less of an issue in large cities, such as Benin City. However, there are difficulties for those who are not indigenes. The EASO states that indigenicity facilitates settling in a given area. However, it does not constitute a requirement. This document notes that non-indigenes, such as the claimants, without familial connections or financial means, may find relocation more difficult. The claimant also testified that language would be an issue as she does not speak local dialects. While she does speak some English and, in fact, testified occasionally in English during the hearing, I am still cognizant that despite English being an official language of Nigeria, her inability to speak the local dialects would also put her at a disadvantage among those who do not speak English and who might potentially assist her with housing or employment.\n[32] The claimant also testified that single mothers are frequently discriminated against and seen as sexually available, which leads them to experience high levels of sexual violence and sexual harassment. She said this was both through work and potentially with landlords. The country documents show that women in general and single women or women heading households do indeed experience high levels of this mistreatment, particularly when there are no family members, most likely male family members, to protect them. I accept as a single mother that the claimant would be more vulnerable to gender-based mistreatment than would a woman who was supported with or by a adult male and family.\n[33] In terms of religion, the country evidence shows that Christianity is widespread in Nigeria, particularly in the south, and thus I don\u2019t find religion, in itself, to be a barrier to relocation. A recent Response to Information Request said that sometimes religious communities can assist in the process of resettlement in some of the similar cities to Port Harcourt, Lagos and Abuja. While religious community may, in fact, be helpful despite the principal claimant\u2019s belief that it would be largely limited to the occasional donation of food, I\u2019m not satisfied that we can rely on religious assistance to be sufficient to overcome the more serious impediments to the claimants in resettling that I have already mentioned with respect to lack of family support, housing and extreme difficulties in obtaining employment.\n[34] Finally, I further note that the principal claimant testified of having an anxiety attack which necessitated a 911 intervention here in Canada. Her demeanour during the hearing clearly demonstrated emotional fragility and she broke down several times during the hearing, necessitating time to compose herself in order to continue. Her emotional state is supported by a psychological assessment in which she was diagnosed with [XXX] and [XXX] in [XXX] of 2029. That\u2019s Exhibit 4, pages 35 to 40. She has attended counselling as a psychologist recommended, based on their assessment and she said that she plans to continue.\n[35] Based on the psychologist\u2019s findings, they concluded that, based on her trauma-related conditions with which they diagnosed her, it would impair her recovery if she had to return to Nigeria where she is convinced that [XXX] would find and harm her and the minor claimant. There are facilities for both basic medical and mental healthcare according to NDP 1.9. The country condition documents though show that Nigerians have to pay for healthcare, as well as education, and that access can be difficult for this reason. For a single mother with many impediments to finding access to money such as employment, I\u2019m satisfied that she would face significant difficulties in accessing mental healthcare if she wished to continue treatment in Nigeria as well.\n[36] The claimant testified there would be difficulties with education for her child and that she would be unable to pay fees if she was not employed as the country condition document I\u2019ve just referenced shows that education comes with costs and concerns that the minor claimant would be negatively impacted with respect to his basic education. Having considered the conditions in the internal flight alternatives, particularly Benin City, and all the circumstances of this case, including those particular to the claimants, I find that the claimants have established on a balance of probabilities that it would be objectively unreasonable or result in undue hardship as those terms are understood in Canadian refugee law for them to seek refuge in the proposed IFAs of Benin City, Port Harcourt or Abuja.\n[37] Based on the totality of the evidence, I\u2019ve concluded the claimants are Convention refugees and accordingly, I have accepted their claims.\n\u2014 DECISION CONCLUDED\n",

This is the decision of the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada for the claims of the principal claimant, namely [XXX] and her minor son [XXX] and the associate claimant, her common-law spouse, [XXX], who are citizens of Mexico who are seeking refugee protection pursuant to s. 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[2] The principal claimant was appointed as the designated representative of the minor claimant. I have also reviewed and applied the Chairperson\u2019s guideline on women refugee claimants fearing gender-related persecution.\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] The specifics of the claims are set out in the narrative of the basis of claim forms. In summary, the claimants fear further abuse from the principal claimant\u2019s ex-husband, namely [XXX], who is also the father of the minor claimant.\n[4] The claimants allege that in October 2009 the principal claimant met [XXX]. In [XXX] 2010 the principal claimant found out she was pregnant and decided to get married. During the pregnancy [XXX] started controlling and becoming abusive towards the claimant. On [XXX], 2011 the principal claimant married [XXX] and days after the marriage the abuse got worse.\n[5] I am not going to list all the incidents that the claimant testified to and described in the narrative attached to the basis of claim forms, but I will note that the incidents occurred in Mexico and involved verbal, physical, emotional and sexual abuse. The minor claimant witnessed some of the abuse, and at least in one instance involving [XXX] violently shaking the child. An incident on [XXX], 2014, led to the principal claimant deciding to move out with help from her family. The principal claimant also filed a police report but the response from the authorities was that they expected a husband and wife to solve their own problems.\n[6] [XXX] filed for divorce in [XXX] 2014 and shortly after, the divorce was granted. The principal claimant was awarded custody and [XXX] retained his parental rights. At the end of 2014 [XXX] started dating someone else and the principal claimant barely heard from him for two years. In late 2016 the adult claimants reconnected after they knew each other from junior high school and eventually moved in together. In [XXX] 2016 [XXX] found out about the new relationship and he threatened the principal claimant that he would break them up.\n[7] On [XXX], 2017, the principal claimant went to the U.S. to work to raise money and her sons stayed with her mother. [XXX] started threatening to report the principal claimant to U.S. authorities and to take away their son so the principal claimant decided to return to Mexico. On [XXX], 2017, [XXX] asked for a visit with their son, which the principal claimant allowed. When the principal claimant went to pick up her son [XXX] yelled and physically assaulted the principal claimant and violently shook the minor claimant. [XXX] was angry that the claimants were living together.\n[8] The principal claimant called the police and left with their son and filed a police report. The police again said that they should resolve their problems themselves.\n[9] The associate claimant has also been threatened seven or eight times and has been physically assaulted by [XXX]. For example, on [XXX], 2017, around [XXX]. the associate claimant was approached by [XXX], who yelled things such as, \u201cLeave my wife alone,\u201d and threatened the associate claimant if he did not stop seeing the principal claimant. During this incident [XXX] punched the associate claimant in the stomach, winding him, and then left.\n[10] In early 2018 the associate claimant finished his architectural program and to celebrate his parents paid for him to travel to Canada. While the associate claimant was in Canada [XXX] continued to harass the principal claimant, including at her workplace. On [XXX], 2018, the joint claimant\u2019s family paid for the principal claimant and her son to travel to Canada as well to join the associate claimant.\n[11] Since the claimants have been in Canada [XXX] has continued to try and locate the principal claimant through her family. In the past few months the principal claimant\u2019s brother, aunt and two cousins have all been contacted by [XXX] in his attempts to locate the claimants. [XXX] also started a court action in Mexico regarding custody of the child. The claimants believe through that action, amongst other ways such as through [XXX] wealthy family, [XXX] is able to locate the claimants anywhere in Mexico.\n[12] On [XXX], 2019, the adult claimants were married and the principal claimant is currently seven months pregnant.\nDETERMINATION\n[13] I find that the claimants are Convention refugees pursuant to s. 96.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[14] The claimants\u2019 identities as citizens of Mexico have been established by the Mexican passports located at Exhibit 1.\nNexus\n[15] The allegations support a nexus to a Convention ground for the principal claimant based on her membership in a particular social group as a woman. The allegations further support a nexus to a Convention ground for the associate claimant and minor claimant based on their membership in a particular social group as members of the principal claimant\u2019s family.\nCredibility\n[16] I find on a balance of probabilities that the principal claimant has been the victim of domestic violence, as has the minor child who witnessed the abuse and in at least one instance was violently shaken by his father. In making that finding I am relying on the principle that a claimant who affirms to tell the truth creates a presumption of truthfulness unless there are reasons to doubt their truthfulness.\n[17] In this regard the claimants testified in a consistent and straightforward manner that was consistent with their basis of claim forms and supporting documents. There were no relevant inconsistencies in the testimony or contradictions between the testimony and other evidence. I find that the claimants are credible witnesses.\n[18] The claimants also provided documents to support their claims. For example, documents found at Exhibit relate to reports to the police of domestic violence toward the principal claimant and the minor claimant. I have no reason to doubt the genuineness of these documents, and since they relate to the alleged domestic abuse, I place significant weight on these documents to support the allegations and overall claims.\n[19] I find that [XXX] has threatened the associate claimant and abused the minor claimant due to those claimants being a part of the principal claimant\u2019s family. [XXX] threatened the associate claimant by saying: Get away from [XXX].\n[20] And: I am going to kill you.\n[21] Aside from witnessing the abuse of his mother the minor claimant was also violently shaken by [XXX] when [XXX] was abusing the principal claimant. There is no evidence that [XXX] ever threatened or abused the associate claimant or the minor claimant when he was not related to the principal claimant. As such, I find that the harm toward the associate claimant and the minor claimant are an extension of [XXX] abusive behaviour towards the principal claimant.\n[22] I find that the claimants have established on a balance of probabilities the facts that they have alleged in their claim. The claimants testified that they fear being persecuted because [XXX] will locate and continue to harm them if they were to return to Mexico.\nObjective Basis\n[23] The objective basis supports the claimant\u2019s fear of returning to Mexico. Domestic violence continues to be prevalent in Mexico. Numerous reports in the national documentation package found at Exhibit 3 indicate that domestic violence is prevalent in Mexico. For example, NDP items 5.10 state that:\n\u2026 violence against women in Mexico is a \u201cpandemic.\u201d\n[24] The report goes on to note that 63 percent of women in Mexico have suffered abuse by men, and that most of the violence is at the hands of their partners.\n[25] While the objective evidence indicates that the Mexican government has attempted to enact legislation and policies to reduce the violence faced by women, as noted in NDP 5.2, violence against women continues to be a widespread problem. This is also indicated in the U.S. State report for Mexico at NDP item 2.1. that states:\nState and municipal laws addressing domestic violence largely failed to meet the required federal standards and often were unenforced.\n[26] Based on the totality of the evidence before me I find that the claimants have established a well-founded fear of persecution if they were to return to Mexico. I further find that the principal claimant\u2019s testimony regarding her ex-husband demonstrates that he has a continuing interest in locating and harming the principal claimant and her family, and therefore they have established a serious forward-looking risk if they were to return to Mexico.\nState Protection\n[27] With respect to domestic violence the objective evidence as noted above supports the claimants\u2019 testimony that there is no operationally-effective state protection available to them in their particular circumstances. Numerous items in the NDP indicate the challenges facing Mexico regarding state protection against crime generally. For example, NDP item 7.18 notes that Mexico has an extremely low rate of prosecution for all forms of crime. Prosecutions can take years to complete and that crime is unreported due to the generalized mistrust in authorities.\n[28] Additional information in the NDP item 2.1 regarding violence against women indicate that while:\nThere were justice centres that provided services, including legal services and protection. However, the number of cases far surpass institution capacity.\n[29] NDP item 5.10 states that:\n\u2026violence against women are not properly investigated, adjudicated or sanctioned.\n[30] This report goes on to state that:\n\u2026 police, do not perform their duties adequately, treating domestic violence as though this was the \u2018normal\u2019 state of affairs.\u201d\n[31] I note that this is the response the principal claimant received both times she tried to report violence against her to the police. Based on the evidence I find there is no operationally- effective state protection available to the claimants in their circumstances. As such, the claimants have rebutted the presumption of state protection.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[32] For the reasons below I find the claimants do not have an internal flight alternative. When determining whether an internal flight alternative is available in Mexico, I must find both that a claimant would not be subject personally to a danger of torture or to a risk of life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or face a serious possibility of persecution in the proposed internal flight alternative, and two, the conditions in that part of the country are such at it would be objectively reasonable in all the circumstances including those particular to the claimant for them to seek refuge there.\n[33] The burden placed on claimants is fairly high in order to show that an internal flight alternative is unreasonable. It requires nothing less than the existence of conditions that would jeopardize their life and safety if they relocated to the internal flight alternative. Actual and concrete evidence of adverse conditions is required. The objective evidence supports finding a serious possibility of persecution would exist for the claimants throughout Mexico.\n[34] In a response to information request at NDP item 5.9 on the right of a parent to know the location of their child when a spouse relocates within Mexico indicates that a parent who has parental authority but who does not live with the child has the legal right to know the child\u2019s address and telephone number. The report further indicates that parental authority is automatically granted to both parents, but family judges can order that a parent loses that right.\n[35] With respect to the minor child the ex-husband retained his parental rights in the order granting the divorce and there has been no further orders with respect to parental authority. As such, the ex-husband would have the right to apply through the courts to obtain the child\u2019s address. I find that the ex-husband\u2019s history of behaviour indicates he has a continuing motivation, and given his parental authority, he also has the means to use the Mexican legal system to be able to track the principal claimant throughout Mexico.\n[36] Based on the totality of the evidence I find the claimants have established that there is no viable internal flight alternative available to them. I find that the claimants would face a serious possibility of persecution throughout Mexico given that the ex-husband has shown a history of continuing to abuse the claimants and his ability to use the Mexican state to assist in locating them.\nCONCLUSION\n[37] For the reasons above I determine that the claimants are Convention refugees pursuant to s. 96 of the Act, given they have established that they would face a serious possibility of persecution and the Board therefore accepts their claims.\n[38] Given I am granting protection under s. 96 of the Act, I find it unnecessary to consider their claims under s. 97.\n\u2014 DECISION CONCLUDED\n",

        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2019 RLLR 36\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: January 22, 2019\n\nPanel: Michal Fox\nCountry: Nigeria\nRPD Number: VB8-04811\nATIP Number: A-2021-01124\nATIP Pages: 000203-000209\n[1] PRESIDING MEMBER: [XXX], [XXX], and [XXX] claim to be citizens of Nigeria and the United States. You claim refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[2] At the hearing the claimant was appointed the designative representative to the minor claimants, [XXX] and [XXX].\nAllegations from the Basis of Claim forms, Exhibits 2.1 and 2.2\n[3] The claimant, [XXX] is a citizen of Nigeria. The claimant is Yoruba and is from the western part of Nigeria, from [XXX] (ph). The claimant is a devout Jehovah\u2019s Witness. She attends the Kingdom Hall two times a week and preaches as well.\n[4] The claimant is the mother of the minor claimants, [XXX] and [XXX]. [XXX] is a citizen of Nigeria, being born there on [XXX], 2013. The minor claimant [XXX] is a US citizen, born in the United States on [XXX], 2017.\n[5] The claimant\u2019s mother and father were from [XXX] \u2013 state, Nigeria. On [XXX] 2012 the claimant married her husband, [XXX]. He\u2019s from Delta State and he is [XXX] by ethnicity.\n[6] The claimant\u2019s family were quite hostile to the claimant. They were against this inter-tribal union and the claimant became a Jehovah\u2019s Witness. She wasn\u2019t born into that religion and the husband\u2019s family rejected not only her but that their son and brother became Jehovah\u2019s Witness as well before he married the claimant.\n[7] The claimant\u2019s Ogun state ethnicity being Yoruba but mostly her religion is the main reason of their hatred toward her. On several occasions the claimant was attacked and beaten by the claimant\u2019s family so that she would get away from her husband. Her husband\u2019s sister threatened to kill her if she didn\u2019t step away from the marriage and it is because of this that she developed psychological problems.\n[8] In [XXX] 2015, she had a heated confrontation with a sister-in-law and thereafter miscarried at ten weeks of pregnancy.\n[9] The claimant was verbally attacked so many times that she would go to her parents\u2019 home in Ogun state for refuge. One time was in [XXX], 2017. Her husband\u2019s family followed her there and set the house ablaze. Her room was set on fire and all of her personal documents were burned. The claimant\u2019s family went to the police but they refused to get involved.\n[10] The claimant herself was born in to a different Christian religion or sect called Church of Christ Family and her own family rejected her for becoming Jehovah\u2019s Witness. They turned against her. They burned her clothes. They burned her religious publications and study materials. She was beaten, denied access to food and locked out for attending Christian meetings.\n[11] Her father showed up at the Kingdom Hall and embarrassed her. Her father threatened to burn down the Kingdom Hall if the claimant did not leave there and he threatened to disown her for being part of the Jehovah\u2019s Witness community.\n[12] She was forced out of her home and the elders of the church had to take her in. The claimant supported herself without her family\u2019s support when she went for higher education.\n[13] Many occasions when the claimant\u2019s husband and herself were going for the door to door ministry, his family members would mock them and throw rocks at them and yell insults. They became fearful that there were people going to kill them because of their religious beliefs.\n[14] The claimants left Nigeria, came to United States, where the minor claimant was born. The claimants thereafter came to Canada and applied for refugee protection.\nFor the claim of the minor claimant [XXX]\nDetermination\n[15] I find that the claimant is not a Convention refugee in that she does not have a well-established fear of persecution for a Convention ground in Nigeria. I also find that the claimant is not a person in need of protection in that her removal to Nigeria would not subject her personally to a risk to her life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment and in that there are no substantial grounds to believe that her removal to Nigeria will subject her personally to a danger of torture.\nAnalysis\n[16] The minor claimant is a citizen of United States. See Exhibit 1, her US birth certificate. As well, the claimant averred in Basis of Claim form that the minor claimant is a citizen of the United States.\n[17] At the hearing, in consultation with the claimant, who is the minor claimant\u2019s designated representative, counsel stated that the claimant has no claim per section 96 and 97 against the United States.\nConclusion\n[18] For the foregoing reasons, I conclude that the minor claimant [XXX] is not a Convention refugee and not a person in need of protection and I therefore reject her claim.\nThe claims of [XXX]\nDetermination\n[19] I find that you are Convention refugees and that you do have a well-founded fear of persecution in Nigeria by reason of religion and race or ethnicity for the following reasons.\nAnalysis\n[20] Your identities as nationals of Nigeria are established by your testimony and supporting documentation filed, namely your Nigerian passports found in Exhibit 1.\n[21] I have found you to be a credible witness and I therefore believe what you have alleged in support of your claim. You testified in a straightforward manner and you corroborated your case with extensive documentary evidence, found in Exhibits 4 through 10.\n[22] I find your fears to be well-founded for the following reasons.\n[23] You have been attacked and even had part of your house burned down by family members due to you and your husband\u2019s conversion to be Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses over the years and also because of your husband\u2019s family rejecting you due to your tribe being Yoruba while they are Osoko \u2013 O-S-O-K-O.\n[24] You\u2019ve had stones thrown at you and at your husband when you were preaching your religion to others. You\u2019ve been threatened with death and abused verbally countless times. You also had a miscarriage due to the violence perpetrated against you for these very reasons and you still grieve this child to this day.\n[25] There is clear and convincing evidence before me that the state is unable or unwilling to protect you.\n[26] You filed police complaints on two times, see Exhibit 6 at page 3 and 4, and Exhibit 5 at page 16 and 18. Even neighbours filed police diary notices based on \u2013 to the police \u2013 about what they saw. Even when the agents of harm had been identified the police did nothing to investigate or take action. It would be futile to expect protection in the future when the police, with the full evidence from even your neighbours, about who the agents of harm are, failed to take any action whatsoever in your case.\n[27] I have considered whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for you. On the evidence before me, I find that you would not be at risk in Port Harcourt. The claimants fear family members who reside in Delta, Lagos and Ogun state. She fears no one in Port Harcourt. The jurisprudential guide addressed this issue in decision TB7-19581. It states that those who fear non-state actors who have a viable internal flight alternative under such facts.\n[28] The claimant has no family members in Port Harcourt as well. She fears that perhaps family members of her husband would show up or visit Port Harcourt as Delta state is right next door, an hour away. I find that her evidence is speculative that such a risk of harm would take place. I thus find there\u2019s no serious possibility of persecution in Port Harcourt.\n[29] However, on the evidence before me I find that it is objectively unreasonable in all the circumstance, including those particular to the claimants, for the claimants to seek refuge in Port Harcourt for the following reasons.\n[30] Psychological evidence is central to the question of whether an internal flight alternative is reasonable and cannot be disregarded. See the case of Cartaga \u2014 C-A-R-T-A-G-A \u2013 v. Canada, 208.FC.289. In this case, the court noted that in considering whether internalflight alternative was unreasonable, the Board must take into account a claimant\u2019s fragilepsychological state. See also Okafar v. Canada \u2014 O-K-A-F-O-R \u2013 2011.FCl.002 andmore recently Kayhonini v. Canada-K-A-Y-H-O-N-I-N-I-2018.SC.1300.\n[31] In this case the claimant has a long history of mental health issues that only arose in her life after she converted to be a Jehovah\u2019s Witness. The psychological stress of losing her own family in this conversion compounded with the persecution she faced by her own family and her husband\u2019s family, induced depression and psychosomatic illnesses since about 2013.\n[32] She\u2019s been hospitalized for this in Nigeria. She received psychotherapy and has been medicated for her psychological condition since that time. The claimant continues to receive treatment here for these conditions. See Exhibit 4, page 10.\n[33] The [XXX] hospital in [XXX], in Exhibit 5 at page 4, specifically refers to when the claimant was hospitalized there for a week to address her psychological conditions that this was caused by the family violence towards here.\n[34] The report states that the violence perpetrated against the claimant by her in-laws on account of her religion and different ethnicity caused her poor sleep, headaches, weeping spells and low mood. The claimant was placed on anti-depressants. She deteriorated medically despite these interventions and had to change medications.\n[35] Even here in Canada, Exhibit 9, the claimant\u2019s physician stated that her medical concerns today include depression and migraine type headaches, which were both pre-existing conditions diagnosed in Africa. The claimant is on various medications and to this day meets with her doctor every two to three months.\n[36] The claimant testified that because of all of her fears which started due the persecution she faced in Nigeria and with all of her worries and being rejected by everyone in her world, she would have epileptic attacks all over her body. Here in Canada she still has this condition but it is manageable with medication and ongoing assessment by her physician.\n[37] The claimant stated that with fears about Nigeria, she will be debilitated. She fears that she will run into someone from her family and they will tell others and that she will be attacked. With such a condition she would not be able to hold a job because she would miss more work because of her fears.\n[38] She had at times stopped working in Nigeria due to her \u2013 due to the physical condition that she suffered which was psychological in nature. The claimant also stated that she won\u2019t be able to parent the minor claimant and her other child because she\u2019d become so debilitated due to fear.\n[39] The claimant stated that with her fears that she is not safe in Nigeria, in Port Harcourt, just with those fears her psychosomatic symptoms will debilitate her and this is exasperated because of the claimant\u2019s religion.\n[40] The claimant\u2019s religion as Jehovah\u2019s Witness requires her to go out as much as possible and spread the word. Jehovah\u2019s Witness goes out every week, almost two days a week and weekends here in Canada, knocking on doors on strangers\u2019 homes in unknown areas that are designated by her church. This would be the same, she did this also in Lagos, she did this in Ogun state, she did this in the United States. She would also have to do this \u2013 she would also want to do this and is required to do so in Port Harcourt.\n[41] She takes her children with her when she witnesses. This is essential to her religion. And that\u2019s every week. If she were to return to Port Harcourt in Nigeria she would go into new areas, much more than other people do, knocking on doors, worrying that she will see someone on this street or that street who might know someone in her family, who might be visiting because of the closeness of Delta state and just this fear that she\u2019ll be harmed once again, the claimant would psychologically fall apart.\n[42] The claimant has a chronic condition. It\u2019s only ameliorated here but it\u2019s not disappeared, even with medication and ongoing assistance and psychotherapy.\n[43] I find that due to the chronic nature of the claimant\u2019s psychological condition just worrying about her situation and in conjunction with the way that she practices her religion, which is protected by a Convention ground, that she would be in a constant state of fright and dysfunction based on that she would be witnessing on average two times a week and sometimes even more if she were to return to Nigeria.\n[44] Even here she says, where she can witness freely, she still has her condition. In Nigeria it would be complete debilitation. The claimant said that she would be terrified, hyper-vigilant at all times, worrying. The claimant has suffered persecution in the past and that harm she carries with her emotionally and psychologically and physically.\n[45] Similarly, the internal flight alternative is unreasonable for the minor claimant as his mother will not be able to parent him. She will be recurrently disabled physically due to her psychosomatic illnesses and depression that have already caused her to be hospitalized, to lose work. She will not be able to support her child and take care of him when she is in so much pain herself. That pain will only be increased if she\u2019s returned to Nigeria.\nConclusion\n[46] For the foregoing analysis, I conclude that the claimant [XXX] and [XXX] are Convention refugees and I therefore accept their claims.\n[47] That is the end of my decision.\n\u2014PROCEEDINGS CONCLUDED\n",

        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2019 RLLR 35\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: October 29, 2019\n\nPanel: Isis van Loon\nCountry: Nigeria\nRPD Number: VB8-04562\nAssociated RPD Number(s): VB8-04561, VB8-04579\nATIP Number: A-2021-01124\nATIP Pages: 000196-000202\n\u2014 DECISION\n[1] PRESIDING MEMBER: [XXX], the adult claimant and her two children, [XXX] and [XXX], the minor claimants, citizens of Nigeria are seeking refugee protection pursuant toss. 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[2] I maintained the designation of [XXX] as the representative for the two minor children, pursuant to s. 167 of the Act and Rule 20 of the Refugee Protection Division Rules. These claims were joined according to Rule 55 of the Refugee Protection Division Rules. In assessing this case, I have considered the Chairperson\u2019s Guidelines on proceedings before the IRB involving sexual orientation and gender identity and expression to ensure that appropriate accommodations were made in questioning the claimants, in the overall hearing process and in substantively assessing the claim.\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] The adult claimant alleges that she is bisexual and that she and her two children, the minor claimants will be persecuted for this reason if they return to Nigeria.\nDETERMINATION\n[4] I find that the adult claimant is a Convention refugee. The minor claimants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection as defined under 97(1).1\nANALYSIS\n[5] The determinative issues in this case, in the case of the adult claimant was credibility, and in the case of the minor claimants the determinative issue is whether or not they had a well-founded fear of persecution.\nIdentity\n[6] I find the claimants\u2019 identities as nationals of Nigeria are established by their testimony and the supporting documentation filed including certified true copies of their passports in Exhibit 1.\nCredibility\n[7] When a claimant swears to the truthfulness of certain facts there is a presumption that what the claimant has said is true unless there is sufficient reason to doubt its truthfulness. The adult claimant was straightforward. There were no relevant inconsistencies in her testimony or contradictions between her testimony and other evidence before me. She provided details of her sexuality and how she has come to accept herself for who she is. I found the claimant to be a credible witness and, therefore, believed what she alleged in support of her claim. The minor claimants did not testify.\n[8] The claimant provided the following relevant \u2014 the adult claimant provided the following relevant and probative documents:\n[9] An affidavit and a letter from her ex-husband\u2019s friend which states that her family stayed with this friend for a few days before fleeing to the USA after she was accused of being a homosexual. The letter gives further details including the condition which the adult claimant was in when her husband brought her to this friend\u2019s house. The friend included copies of his identification; this is all in Exhibit 4.2.\n[10] There was an affidavit and a letter from her ex-spouse\u2019s employee as well. This employee states that the claimants were travelling to the USA to escape persecution for a homosexual offence. This employee said that they witnessed the events at the claimant\u2019s home on [XXX], 2017. He said that the adult claimant was found in the act with a fellow lady, which is against the law. Both women were beaten and the fellow lady was sent to hospital and later confirmed to be in a coma. He assisted the adult claimant\u2019s ex-spouse to help her escape. The police were looking for the adult claimant as were the neighbours. This letter states that the police and the neighbours will persecute her if she returns to Nigeria and the employee did include a copy of his identification as well on Exhibit 4.\n[11] Finally, in Exhibit 4, there\u2019s a letter from a [XXX] dated [XXX], 2017. This lists first aid and treatment administered for severe body pain, arm bruises, lower abdominal pain, severe headache, minor eye and ear pain sustained from an attack.\n[12] I found these documents were relevant and served to corroborate the principal claimant\u2019s core allegation that she has been persecuted due to her bisexuality.\nNexus\n[13] I find that the persecution the adult claimant faces has a nexus to one of the five Convention grounds; that of membership in a particular social group as a bisexual. The minor claimants have a potential nexus as membership in a particular social group; children of a women persecuted for a Convention ground. I note the minor claimants have made no allegations \u2014 or, there have been no allegations that the minor claimants are being targeted for any 97 reason, or that they\u2019ve been at any personal targeted risk of harm under s. 97(1).\nWell-founded Fear\n[14] In order to be considered a Convention refugee, claimants must demonstrate that they have a well-founded fear of persecution including both a subjective fear and an objective fear, as well, it needs to be forward-looking. Based on the adult claimant\u2019s testimony and supporting documents and the country condition documents I find the adult claimant has a well-founded fear of persecution; however, the minor claimants have not established a well-founded fear of persecution or a risk of harm under 97(1). My reasons follow:\n[15] The principal claimant alleges that she was discovered with another woman and assaulted on [XXX], 2017. She, her then-husband and the two minor claimants left the country on [XXX], 2017 for the USA as they already had visas. Shortly afterwards, She was separated from her husband and received a divorce on [XXX] of 2018. Unable to afford the expense of claiming asylum in the States and fearing Trump\u2019s homophobic policies, she came to claim asylum with the minor claimants and with the permission of their father, her now ex-husband, came to Canada [XXX], 2018. I find by her timing and her actions that the claimants have educed sufficient credible evidence to establish that they have a subjective fear of persecution in Nigeria.\n[16] The adult claimant says,\n\u201cGod does not make mistakes. That is how God created me, there are people like me in Nigeria, it was just unfortunate that I was caught.\u201d\n[17] She described a somewhat fraught relationship with a woman named [XXX], a former schoolmate. Her ex-husband provided testimony as a witness over the phone. He confirmed that he knew [XXX], and he knew of his wife\u2019s bisexuality. In fact, as the adult claimant had earlier testified, it was [XXX] who told him about the adult claimant\u2019s bisexuality. He described the events of [XXX], 2017 which was consistent with that described in the basis of claim form by the adult claimant. He said that the cousin had called him from the house after discovering the two women together. He said that she\u2019d been beaten and her clothes were torn and that he took her to a friend\u2019s place. He expressed concern over the children and said that for this reason he took them all to the USA on [XXX] of 2017. He said they hadn\u2019t been getting along for a while and they did divorce, and he expressed the hope that she could be accepted for the way that she is. I note that his testimony is consistent with that of the adult claimant, as well as the affidavits from his friend and his employee.\n[18] The country documentation is consistent with the adult claimant\u2019s fear of persecution in Nigeria. The NDP 6.8 says that,\n\u201cThe relatively new anti-gay law that was brought in has had a devastating effect on Nigeria\u2019s LGBTI community. Although life was extremely difficult for LGBTI people before the law\u2019s passage, and blackmail, extortion and violence against LGBTI people were common, the law significantly heightened LGBTI people\u2019s vulnerability. Apart from the harsh criminal penalties it imposes, many interviewees stated that that the law has essentially declared open season on LGBTI people. The climate of fear, intimidation and violence created by the anti-gay law has led to numerous other human rights violations, threatening the right to free expression, literary and cultural freedoms, online expression, democratic participation and freedom of association.\u201d\n[19] There was a recent survey at NDP 6.3 that found in 2017, 83% of persons polled would not accept a family member if they were homosexual. Nation wide, 90% of citizens support the same-sex marriage prohibition Act. 94% of those surveyed said that constitutional rights of freedom of association and assembly should be denied to LGBT persons. Another survey at NDP 6.5 found that 55% of the LGBT respondents surveyed reported being physically or sexually attacked or threatened with violence either at home or in the workplace in the past 10 years.\n[20] I find there is a serious possibility that the claimant would face persecution in Nigeria by both state and non-state actors for reason of her being a bisexual. Bisexuality is against the law in Nigeria, and in addition to homophobic laws that are on the books, homophobia is rampant in the country and that\u2019s also well-documented in the National Documentation Package which shows that 90% of Nigerians believe the country would be better off without homosexuals. That\u2019s NDP 6.3.\n[21] In terms of the minor claimants; the principal claimant said that her children would suffer societal discrimination as the children of an LGBT parent. Her ex-husband, who lives now in the USA, testified that he was concerned that they would be depriving his children of a mother if they had remained in Nigeria and she had gone to jail, and that this was why he had brought them all from Nigeria.\n[22] A response to information request \u2014 or, pardon me. A document at NDP 6.11 says that,\n\u201cFamilies disown family members who identify as sexual minorities due to the shame that the family members might face from society, their church and friends.\u201d\n[23] Similarly, other sources explain that families of sexual minorities face stigmas; however, there are also cases where family members of sexual minorities face no risks at all. As such, it could be relative whether family members of sexual minorities face any risk from society, and it seems that whether or not family members of sexual minorities face risks depends on whether the person who is the sexual minority is public about their sexuality, is an activist who is widely known and whether the family members are openly in support of the person who is a sexual minority.\n[24] In this case, the adult claimant was not an activist and she was not open in public about her bisexuality, and her children are too young to have been publicly supportive and, therefore, their profiles do not fit those of family members who may face risks. I also note that they have a supportive father who is no longer in Nigeria and; however, because he is no longer in Nigeria and is not openly supportive, that does not put them at any risk, either. Thus, there is insufficient evidence before me to show children of LGBTI parents are at direct risk of harm.\n[25] Counsel did allege that children could be arrested to harass the adult claimant, but he was unable to provide any evidence and I gave his assertion little weight. So, in the end, as I said there is insufficient evidence before me to show the children of LGBTI parents are at any direct risk of harm, and in this case I also note that their father, who is no longer in Nigeria is supportive of these children, thus, I do not find that the minor claimants have a well-founded fear of persecution on a Convention ground, nor do they face a risk of harm as per 97(1).\n[26] So, based on all the evidence before me, I find the adult claimant would face a serious possibility of persecution by both state and non-state actors if she were to return to Nigeria; however, the minor claimants do not have a well-founded fear of persecution, nor face a risk of harm as understood under 97(1) if returned to Nigeria.\nState Protection\n[27] Except in situations where the state is in complete breakdown, states must be presumed capable of protecting their citizens. To rebut this presumption, the onus is on the claimant to establish on a balance of probabilities through clear and convincing evidence that their state\u2019s protection is not adequate.\n[28] In this case the agent of persecution, at least one of them, is the state and the persecution the claimant would face if returned to Nigeria is at the hand of the authorities. I find that the adult claimant has provided clear and convincing evidence that rebuts on a balance of probabilities any presumption of state protection. Accordingly, I find there is no state protection available to the principal claimant.\n[29] An internal flight alternative arises when a claimant who otherwise meets all the elements of the definition of a Convention refugee in their home area of the country, nevertheless, is not a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection because they could live safely elsewhere in that country. There\u2019s a legal test which has two prongs; I\u2019d have to be satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the claimant would not face a serious possibility of persecution in the part of the country to which I have found an IFA existed and conditions in the part of the country considered to be an IFA must be such that it would not be unreasonable in all circumstances including those particular to the claimant for her to seek refuge there.\n[30] The state of Nigeria is one of the agents of harm and it is in control of all of its territories, therefore, I find that the adult claimant faces a serious possibility of persecution throughout the entire country of Nigeria. There is no internal flight alternative for the adult claimant in Nigeria.\n[31] Based on the totality of the evidence before me I\u2019ve concluded that the adult claimant is a Convention refugee and accordingly, I\u2019ve accepted her claim. Similarly, based on the totality of the evidence before me I have concluded that the minor claimants are not Convention refugees, nor are they persons in need of protection under 97(1) and accordingly, have not accepted their claims.\n\u2014 DECISION CONCLUDED\n1 The recording of this oral decision is not available, it appears, because of a technical malfunction. Therefore, this written version is based not on a recording but on the notes used by the member in rendering her oral decision on the recording on November 1, 2019.\n",

These are the reasons for the decision in the claim of Madam [XXX] a citizen of Haiti who is claiming refugee protection pursuant to Sections 96 and 97 of the Immigration Protection Act.\n[3] In rendering my reasons I have considered and applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guidelines on women refugee claimants fearing gender related persecution throughout the hearing and in my decision as this is a case of domestic violence.\nALLEGATIONS\n[4] The Claimant detailed her allegations in her Basis of Claim form which can be summarized as follows. The Claimant is 69 years old from Haiti fearing domestic violence at the hand of her ex-partner [XXX] (phonetic) who is 15 younger than her. The Claimant endured close to 10 years of domestic violence which included armed death threats, even after she left him in [XXX] 2013.\nDETERMINATION\n[5] I find that you are a Convention refugee as you have established a serious possibility of persecution on account of your membership in a particular social group as a woman facing domestic violence.\nANALYSIS\nIDENTITY\n[6] I find that your identity as a national of Haiti has been established by your testimony and the supporting documentation in file including a certified copy of your passport at Exhibit 1.\nCREDIBILITY\n[7] I find you to be a credible witness and therefore believe what you said in support of your claim. You testified in a straightforward manner and there were no relevant inconsistencies between your testimony and the other evidence before me which have not been satisfactorily explained.\nNEXUS\n[8] Given your history of domestic violence I find that your fear of persecution in Haiti has a nexus to the Convention ground of membership in a particular social group as a woman facing gender based persecution. For this reason your claim will be assessed under Section 96 of The Act.\nWELL-FOUNDED FEAR OF GENDER BASED PERSECUTION\n[9] I find that you have established an objectively well-founded fear of gender based persecution for the reasons that will follow. You testified that you entered a romantic relationship with a friend and former customer of yours in 2009, named [XXX] (phonetic). Your house was affected by the 2010 earthquake to the point where you had to move out. You moved in with him. At the beginning he was not aggressive to you as you helped him financially through the small business you had where you sold [XXX]. However when you started telling him that you no longer had money to give him he became violent to you. He assaulted you physically to the point of breaking your left arm. You submitted a photograph of yourself with a cast at Exhibit 4 and brought the original picture at the hearing.\n[10] It was difficult for you to talk about the domestic violence as you were so embarrassed and ashamed that you were dating a younger man which is stigmatized in Haiti. As such you kept the violence to yourself and did not talk about it with your children until it went too far. In [XXX] 2013 you decided to finally leave [XXX] (phonetic) thinking that your struggles would be over. You moved in with your niece, [XXX] (phonetic) who submitted a support letter to that effect at Exhibit 4.\n[11] Over a year later in [XXX] 2014 [XXX] (phonetic) found you at work at the [XXX] (phonetic). He assaulted you physically once more, hitting you in the face and breaking your teeth. You submitted documentary evidence of your consultation at the dentist you had following the assault at Exhibit 4.\n[12] [XXX] (phonetic) continued to threaten, harass and assault you up until [XXX] 2017 even if you had separated in 2013. He attacked you once when you were at the [XXX] on your way home and left you lying in the streets.\n[13] In [XXX] 2017 you received the last threat from him. He showed up at your house when your daughter [XXX] (phonetic) was there and squeezed your hand while threatening you. [XXX] (phonetic) witnessed the assault and she reported it to the police. Given the numerous instances of gender based violence you suffered at the hands of [XXX] (phonetic), despite the fact that you separated in 2013, you are afraid that he may locate and harm you if you return to Haiti.\n[14] Objective evidence included in the National Documentation Package overwhelmingly points to alarming rates of domestic violence throughout Haiti and inadequate protection available to victims of domestic abuse. Items 5.13, 5.3 and 2.4 are examples of such.\n[15] For instance a research from the IRB\u2019s research unit states that \u201csources report that domestic or family violence is widespread in Haiti. According to a Haiti mission report in 2017 domestic violence is a real societal problem. It is recorded in all social strata and is particularly prevalent in the impoverished areas of Port aux Prince as well as in remote rural areas.\u201d Item 5.3.\n[16] The same report indicates that domestic violence is tolerated and considered normal by society and that violence against women and girls is trivialized in Haitian society. Human Rights Watch emphasises that Haiti has no specific legislation against domestic violence, sexual harassment or other forms of violence targeted at women and girls.\n[17] Based on all of the evidence before me, including the sources cited in your testimony, I find that you have established a serious possibility of gender based persecution in Haiti.\nSTATE PROTECTION\n[18] I find that there is clear and convincing evidence before me that the state is unable or unwilling to provide you with adequate protection. You testified that you went to the police station in order to file a police complaint for domestic violence in 2016. The police response was humiliating as they referred to you as a desraee (phonetic) which in Creole means a woman without morals. They told you that you were simply an old woman looking for attention from younger men and that they had bigger issues to deal with than your family affairs.\n[19] The Immigration and Refugee Board\u2019s research on violence against women at Item 5.3 corroborates the experience you described and lack of adequate state protection for women like you who are victims of gender based violence such as domestic violence. The sources point to a lack of means and education of police as well as their lack of sensitivity. Furthermore it describes the number of obstacles in seeking justice for women victims of violence in Haiti. Notably corruption and disfunction of the legal system, impunity of aggressors and victims\u2019 lack of confidence in the legal system.\n[20] As an elderly woman with no education I find that you are particularly vulnerable and may face additional barriers in seeking state protection. For these reasons I find that the presumption of state protection has been rebutted in your case.\nINTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE\n[21] Based on the totality of the evidence before me I find that it is not objectively reasonable in all of the circumstances, including those particular to you, for you to seek refuge in Haiti for the following reasons.\n[22] You are currently 69 years old and will tum 70 years old by the end of this month. You do not have access to pension in Haiti nor to health care. You have never been to school, in fact not even a day so you cannot read or write. Even through you have proven to be quite resourceful in raising three of your four children by yourself, by running a small [XXX] business it would be unreasonable to expect you to relocate to another city within Haiti considering your personal circumstances such as your age, your lack of access to employment, your lack of access to pension or any revenue and by your limited capacity to seek housing as an elderly single woman. While I note that you have three children living in Port aux Prince at the moment, I do not find it reasonable for you to relocate there in light of your personal circumstances. I find \u2014 for this reason I find that it would be objectively unreasonable to expect you to relocate anywhere in Haiti. As the internal flight alternative test fails on the second prong of the test I find that there is no viable internal flight alternative available to you in Haiti.\nCONCLUSION\n[23] Based on the analysis above I conclude that you are a Convention refugee, accordingly I accept your claim.\n\u2014 PROCEEDINGS CONCLUDED\n",

Adeoye\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Amedeo Clivio\nCountry: Turkey\nRPD Number: TB9-19724\nATIP Number: A-2021-01124\nATIP Pages: 000186-000190\n[1] MEMBER: I\u2019ve considered your testimony and your other evidence before me today, which includes your documentary evidence, and I\u2019m ready to render my decision orally.\n[2] This is a claim for refugee protection made by [XXX], who claims to be a citizen of Turkey and is seeking refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nAllegations\n[3] The summary of the claimant\u2019s allegations are contained his Basis of Claim form and I will not repeat them all here.\n[4] In summary, the claimant alleges that he fears to return to Turkey because he\u2019s involved in the Hizmet Movement, which is also known as the G\u00fclen Movement.\n[5] He alleges that he supports the ideas of the movement\u2019s leader or founder, Fetullah G\u00fclen, and that these ideas deal with, among other things, religion, society, charity, and education.\n[6] He further alleges that due to his Kurdish ethnicity and his family\u2019s longstanding history of being involvement with pro-Kurdish politics, he may be imputed to be a separatist Kurd or HDP supporter.\nDetermination\n[7] The Panel finds that the claimant is a Convention refugee because he faces a serious possibility of persecution on the Convention ground of his imputed political opinion in Turkey as a Hizmet follower.\nIdentity\n[8] The claimant\u2019s identity as a national of Turkey is established by his testimony and certified true copy of his Turkish passport attached to Exhibit 1.\n[9] Also, the Panel finds that the claimant has established his Hizmet identity based on his affiliation with the Hizmet Movement, again through his testimony and supporting documentation attached to Exhibit 5.\nCredibility\n[10] Overall, the Panel has found the claimant to be a credible witness on a balance of probabilities on what is core to his claim. In this case, his imputed political opinion as a follower of the Hizmet Movement.\n[11] The Panel therefore believes what he has alleged in support of his claim.\n[12] He testified in a straightforward manner and there were no relevant inconsistencies in his testimony or contradictions between his testimony and other evidence before the Panel that were not satisfactorily explained.\n[13] The claimant testified generally in a straightforward manner regarding his involvement in the Hizmet Movement, his reasons for becoming involved in the movement, his actions, his roles in support of the movement and affiliated institutions, and also he provided credible testimony regarding the movement as a whole, as well as providing information about members of the movement being mistreated by the Turkish authorities, which includes his family members.\n[14] Therefore the Panel finds on a balance of probabilities that the claimant has been able to -\u00ad that the claimant was involved in the Hizmet Movement since he was a child and in 2003 when he attended \u2014 was a child when he attended meetings with his uncle, and 2003 when he attended Hizmet affiliated prep school, and finds on a balance of probabilities \u2014 also finds on a balance of probabilities that he volunteered with Hizmet affiliated charities, purchased Hizmet affiliated, and subscribed to Hizmet affiliated publications.\n[15] So the Panel therefore finds on a balance of probabilities that the claimant is credible, accepts his allegations as credible, and that he has established his subjective fear.\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution\n[16] As it relates to the well-foundedness of the claimant\u2019s fear of persecution, the Panel finds that the claimant\u2019s subjective fear has an objective basis based on the objective documentary evidence before the Panel.\n[17] There is ample corroborating evidence in the country condition documents about the Turkish authority\u2019s harsh treatment of members of the Hizmet Movement, which was worsened after the attempted coup in July 2016, for which the Turkish regime held the Gillen Movement responsible.\n[18] Item 2.3 in the National Documentation Package titled, \u201cFreedom in the World 2017\u201d states that:\n[19] \u201cTurkey has a large number of active non-governmental organizations. However, authorities have mentioned and harassed many NGOs in recent years. In particular, those affiliated with the Gillen Hizmet Movement.\n[20] In the aftermath of the coup, 1,229 foundations and associations and 19 trade unions were shut down without judicial proceedings.\u201d\n[21] Also:\n\u201c375 more associations and NGOs were closed for alleged links to terrorists and their assets were seized by the government.\u201d\n[22] The National Documentation Package also reports that:\n\u201cThere are significant problems with arbitrary and indefinite detention and mistreatment of those arrested or suspected to be Hizmet Movement and increasing lack of judicial independence, especially after the dismissal of more than 3,000 judges following the attempted coup, relaxation on restrictions on the use of torture, and widespread impunity for officials who commit human rights abuses persist in Turkey.\u201d\n[23] There is also considerable evidence that:\n\u201cThe authorities in Turkey have targeted family members of suspected Hizmet sympathizers or those who are wanted for arrest and cancelled their passports or even detained them.\u201d\n[24] Furthermore, the evidence in the National Documentation Package notes the:\n\u201cClosing of Hizmet affiliated universities in Turkey and the broader negative effects on academic freedom and freedom of speech in Turkey that have resulted from Turkish authority\u2019s crackdown on Hizmet followers, affiliated educational institutions, and other academics who have voiced criticism of the regime and its actions.\u201d\n[25] After reviewing all this evidence which the Panel finds \u2014 after reviewing all this evidence, the Panel finds that the claimant\u2019s allegations are consistent with the objective country condition documents with regards to the harsh treatment currently being made out against Hizmet supporters in Turkey, including dismissal from employment, increased closing down Hizmet affiliated education institutions, seizure of assets, detention, and mistreatment.\n[26] Therefore, based on this country documentary evidence and the credible allegations, the Panel finds that the claimant has a well-founded fear of persecution in Turkey by reason of his imputed political opinion.\nState Protection\n[27] As the state is the agent of persecution \u2014 as the agent of persecution is the Government of Turkey, the Panel finds that it would be objectively unreasonable for the claimant to seek protection of the Turkish Government in light of the claimant\u2019s particular circumstances.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[28] The Panel also finds that the claimant faces a serious possibility of persecution throughout Turkey, especially given the objective documentary evidence that the Turkish authorities operates similarly throughout Turkey.\n[29] Therefore the Panel finds that there is no viable internal flight alternative available to the claimant.\nConclusion\n[30] The Panel finds that the claimant has established that he will face a serious possibility of persecution upon his return to Turkey on the Convention ground of his political opinion.\n[31] And based on the foregoing analysis, the Panel has determined that the claimant is a Convention refugee as per section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act and therefore accepts his claim.\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 DECISION CONCLUDED \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n",

They seek refugee protection against Iran pursuant to sections 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. For the following reasons, the Panel finds that the Claimants are Convention refugees, and this claim is accepted:\n[3] This claim is based on the following allegations:\n[4] The Claimants are citizens of Iran but have lived in Turkey on work permits since 2013. The Claimants started attending church in Turkey in December of 2017 and have continued attending church ever since that time. The Claimants arrived in Canada on [XXX] \u2014 excuse me \u2014 in [XXX] of 2018 as visitors. While they were here, they continued to develop their faith as Christians and they decided to seek protection here. They signed their Basis of Claims on June 12th, 2019.\n[5] The identities of the Claimants were established on the basis of their Iranian passports, the originals of which were seized by the Minister.\n[6] The Panel\u2019s primary concern about this claim was the appearance on the face of the allegations that the Claimants were misrepresenting themselves as genuine Christian followers in order to gain immigration status in Canada. That possibility was suggested on the face of these facts, wherein the Claimants only sought protection in Canada in June 2019, despite having been here as Christians since [XXX] 2019. The Claimant explained that they came to Canada initially simply as tourists and had no intention to seek protection here when they initially arrived. It was not an easy decision to make to leave their country and families behind, so it was not until April 2019 that they finally decided they could never return to Iran again.\n[7] The Panel was concerned about why the Claimants were still in Canada in April 2019 if it was only their intention to come here as tourists. The Claimant explained that originally they had a round-trip return ticket to leave Canada after one month, but they extended their stay simply because they enjoyed being here. The Claimants then sought advice from immigration consultants about trying to remain in Canada on student visas.\n[8] The Panel is very concerned about this testimony. It does appear to the Panel on its face that the Claimants were not simply in Canada with the intention of visiting, but rather, that they did have the intent to immigrate. However, while the Panel is significantly concerned, the Panel cannot at this time unequivocally conclude on a balance of probabilities that immigration was their actual underlying intention. The Panel is not prepared to conclude that this concern over their delay undermines their presumption of truthfulness nor the ultimate threshold that they must meet which is a serious possibility of persecution. Despite the Panel\u2019s concerns, in all other respects the Panel found that this claim was credible.\n[9] The Claimant spoke about his life \u2014 their life in Iran and then in Turkey. He spoke about how they became interested in Christianity and how their conversion was a slow and drawn out process, occurring over many months. The Claimant also spoke about how his education in Christianity developed so fast and so early that he was even considering becoming a pastor.\n[10] The Panel find this testimony was compelling. The Claimant was consistent, straightforward, and spontaneous, and there did not appear to be any attempt to embellish this part of the Claimant\u2019s testimony. Where the Panel did have any other concerns, they were either reasonably explained or minimal in nature, and did not ultimately impact on the credibility of this claim. While the Panel has its concerns, therefore, on a balance of probabilities the Panel is prepared to accept the Claimants\u2019 conversion to Christianity as genuine.\n[11] The Panel has access to credible and reliable sources in the National Documentation Package, such as the U.S. Department of State Report, which makes clear that apostasy is punishable by death in Iran. The Panel is satisfied that the Claimants fit the profile of persons at a high risk of persecution. Whereas the state is the agent of persecution, the Claimants have rebutted the presumption that state protection would be adequate and forthcoming to them. Likewise, there is no location in Iran the Claimants could go where they would not face a serious possibility of persecution. For all these reasons, the Panel finds that this claim is credible. The Claimants\u2019 fear is well-founded. The Claimants face a serious possibility of persecution in Iran on account of their religion. The Claimants are Convention refugees, and this claim is accepted.\n[12] Just for one more point of clarity. Where this Panel has referred to the Claimant in the singular throughout this \u2014 these reasons, that refers to the male Claimant, although these reasons apply to both Claimants equally.\n[13] Thank you both very much for being here. Thank you very much, Mr. Interpreter, thank you.\n[14] INTERPRETER: You\u2019re welcome.\n[15] MEMBER: Everyone have a good afternoon.\n\u2014 HEARING ADJOURNED\n",

On that same day, the panel rendered its oral positive decision and Reasons for decision. This is the written version of the oral decision and Reasons that have been edited for clarity, spelling, grammar and syntax with added references to the documentary evidence and relevant case law where appropriate.\nINTRODUCTION\n[1] I have considered your testimony, and the other evidence in the case, and I am ready to render my decision orally.\n[2] These are the reasons for the decision in the claims of [XXX] (the Principal Claimant or PC), [XXX] (the male claimant), [XXX] and [XXX], who claim to be citizens of Iran, and are claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] The allegations of your claims are fully set out in your Basis of Claim (BOC) forms. In short, you allege that you, the PC, practiced Christianity in secret in Iran, and your home was raided by intelligence officers who searched the house and arrested and detained you overnight. You were released on bail and called to court later that month. You, the male claimant, were suspended from your job as a [XXX] and [XXX] as a result of the charges of apostasy against your wife. Fearing further detention and mistreatment at the hands of the Iranian authorities because of the PC\u2019s conversion from Islam to Christianity, you fled to Canada to make refugee claims.\nDETERMINATION\n[4] I find that you are Convention refugees as you have established a serious possibility of persecution.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[5] I find that your identities as nationals of Iran are established by the documents provided, including certified true copies of your Iranian passports, and the testimony of the PC.\nNexus\n[6] I find that you have established a nexus to section 96 by reason of your religion.\nCredibility\n[7] I found you, the PC, to be a credible witness. There were no material inconsistencies between your testimony and your BOC, and other documents before me. Your testimony about your Christian faith appeared to be heartfelt. Based on your testimony, the documents you have provided, and the information in your BOC forms and narrative, I note no serious credibility issues. You submitted two letters from the Pastor of your church in Toronto that corroborate that the four claimants attend church regularly and have done so for the past eight months, and the three adult claimants are on a waiting list to be baptized. You also submitted the court summons that you received by mail in Iran, the letter suspending the male claimant from work, as well as a support letter from a friend who is a Pastor at an Iranian Christian Church in California. I have no reasons to doubt the authenticity of the evidence, and accept, on a balance of probabilities, that you are practicing Christians, and that the PC was accused of apostasy in Iran.\nWell Founded Fear of Persecution\n[8] Your subjective fear of persecution as Christian converts is objectively well founded. Based on the country condition evidence in the National Documentation Package (NDP) for Iran, March 2019, the country condition documents submitted by you, and your credible allegations, I find that you have a well-founded fear of persecution in Iran by reason of your conversion to Christianity.\n[9] The preponderance of the documentary evidence corroborates that one of the most significant human rights problems in Iran is the severe restriction on civil liberties such as freedom of religion.1 Iranian law prohibits citizens from converting from Islam to another religion and Christian converts are not recognized as Christian under the law. Christians who convert from Islam experience arrest, detention, and high levels of harassment and surveillance. Many Christian converts are forced to practice their religion in secret.2 Severe human rights violations targeting religious minorities, especially Christian converts, continue.3\nNature of the harm\n[10] The harm you would face upon return to Iran, detention and mistreatment by the authorities, clearly amounts to persecution.\nState protection\n[11] Since the state is the agent of persecution in your case, I find that it would be objectively unreasonable for you to seek the protection of the state and, therefore, you have rebutted the presumption of state protection.\nInternal flight alternative\n[12] I find that there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout Iran, given the documentary evidence that the authorities operate similarly throughout the country. Therefore, I find there is no viable internal flight alternative.\nCONCLUSION\n[13] Based on the analysis above, I conclude that you are Convention refugees and accept your claims.\n1 Exhibit 3, National Documentation Package (NDP) for Iran (March 29, 2019), Item 2.1.\n\n2 Ibid., Item 12.1.\n\n3 Ibid., Item 12.2.\n",

He indicates that his family, including his mother and father, are Hizmet members and that his brother and nephew have been granted protection in Canada.\n[4] The claimant indicates that after the coup attempt took place in July 2016, Hizmet media was closed, Hizmet schools were closed and Hizmet-affiliated business were seized. He indicates that he and his family were concerned, as people affiliated with the Hizmet Movement were being arrested for being members of the FETO terrorist organisation.\n[5] The claimant alleges that at the end of December 2018, he was advised by a lawyer that his name was being mentioned in a Hizmet case by the authorities, and the claimant made an application for a US visa and departed Turkey for the United States on the [XXX] 2019, and travelled to Canada on the [XXX] 2019.\nDetermination\n[6] The panel finds the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to s. 96 of the IRPA.\n[7] Should the claimant return to Turkey, the panel finds he has established a serious possibility that he would be persecuted on the ground of his perceived or imputed political opinion.\nAnalysis\nIdentity\n[8] The claimant\u2019s personal and national identity- of Turkey has been established through a copy of his passport, found in Exhibit 1.\n[9] I am satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant is who he says he is and is a citizen of Turkey.\n[10] The panel notes that while the claimant\u2019s parents were born in Bulgaria, they do not hold citizenship in Bulgaria.\n[11] The panel further notes that the claimant provided an excerpt from his father\u2019s passport, which includes a visa for Bulgaria, and has further reviewed Item 3.1 of the National Documentation Package for Bulgaria.\n[12] The panel is satisfied that Bulgaria is not a country of reference in these particular circumstances.\nCredibility\n[13] The panel found the claimant to be a credible witness, who provided detailed testimony consistent with his BoC narrative and forms.\n[14] While the panel has concerns with the claimant\u2019s failure to claim for protection in the United States, the test is forward-looking, and the panel finds a serious possibility of persecution, should the claimant return to Turkey.\n[15] The claimant explained in detail his involvement with the Hizmet Movement, his family\u2019s history with the movement and the basic principles of the movement as examples.\n[16] Several corroborative documents are found in Exhibits 6 and 8, including, but not limited to: the investigation letter from the Office of the Prosecutor, dated 25th December 2018, in regards to the claimant; and the Notice of Decision and Reasons for the claims for protection in Canada for both his brother, who was here today but did not testify, and his nephew, both of whom were granted protection; the hearing record for the claimant\u2019s fellow shareholder in his coffee business, who was sentenced to six years and three months of imprisonment for what the claimant indicates was his involvement in the Hizmet Movement.\n[17] While the claimant did not provide the original documents to the panel today, the claimant was credible and explained that these documents were sent via the application WhatsApp and via e\u00ad mail through his brother and his nephew and through himself. Counsel was able to show the panel on his e-mail some of the documents sent to his e-mail by the claimant\u2019s nephew, [XXX] (ph.).\n[18] Counsel also indicated that the claimant\u2019s brother was available this morning to testify. As the claimant indicated, he had assisted the claimant in e-mailing some of the documents. The panel accepts the claimant\u2019s allegations as credible and his brother [XXX] (ph.) was not called upon to testify.\n[19] As indicated in Item 4.6 of the National Document Package for Turkey, Turkish authorities blame the failed coup attempt in July 2016 on Gulen and the Turkish government has characterised the Gulen Movement as a terrorist organisation.\u201d\n[20] As indicated in Item 2.1 of the NDP for Turkey, the government engaged in a worldwide effort to apprehend suspected members of FETO, a term the government applied to followers of Fetullah Gulen, also known as members of the Gulen Movement.\u201d\n[21] Item I.7 indicates that,\n\u201cFollowing the coup attempt, there was a large number of arrests, detentions and dismissals from jobs, as the government took measures against those suspected of involvement in the Gulenist Movement.\u201d\n[22] Item 2.1 further indicates that the authorities used anti-terror laws broadly against alleged Gulen Movement members, resulting in the detention of the member.\n[23] The claimant in these particular circumstances indicates he has come to the attention of the Turkish authorities, as indicated by the documentation found in Exhibit 8 from the Office of the Prosecutor.\n[24] The panel finds an objective and subjective basis to the claimant\u2019s fears on a balance of probability.\nState Protection\n[25] I find that State protection would not be reasonably forthcoming since the authorities themselves are the agents of persecution.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[26] Given that the State is the agent of persecution, the panel finds no internal flight alternative in your particular circumstances. There is a serious possibility of persecution throughout the country.\nConclusion\n[27] The panel concludes that the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to s. 96 of the IRPA and accepts his claim.\nDECISION CONCLUDED\n",

I have carefully considered the evidence in this case and have decided to render my decision today orally. You will receive your notice of decision in the mail and your council will also received a copy.\n[2] The claimants, [XXX] and [XXX], claim to be citizens of China and are claiming refugee protection pursuant to Sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. I find that you are Convention refugees for the reason that you have established that you face a serious possibility of persecution in China base on your Falun Gong practice and spiritual beliefs.\n[3] The allegations are fully set out in your Basis of Claim Form, sign on January 16, 2019. To summarize, you a mother and daughter from China, alleged that your fear persecution in China because of your Falun Gong beliefs and involvement in the practice of Falun Gong. Your mother introduced you to Master Lee\u2019s book Zhuan Falun in [XXX], 1997, while you were a senior at the [XXX], and before the persecution of Falun Gong practitioners started in July 1999. At that time, people were already talking about the book and you were curious, so you began to read it during your winter holidays. You were profoundly impacted by the theory and principals described in the book as they reverberated with your own thinking about the universe, time, space and the human body. You have been studying and practicing Falun Gong since then.\n[4] After the persecution in 1999, you and your family were constantly harassed by the PSB. You were arrested and detained eight times from October 1999 to September 2008. The last being for four years during which you suffered abuse and torture and went on hunger strikes. Upon release since September 2008, you continued practicing Falun Gong in secret and your health improved quickly. Although the psychological scar of your experiences in prison remained.\n[5] You introduced your daughter to Falun Gong and by 2016, she was reading the Zhuan Falun on her own. Although you were busy with your career, you continued to be monitored by the PSB who would harass your husband. Fearing persecution for your daughter and yourself by Chinese authorities who have banned Falun Gong everywhere in China, you decided that you and your daughter would leave the country. You planned to leave China after your daughter had arrived safely in Canada in [XXX] 2018 and after the [XXX] 2018 was over. You applied for a passport in [XXX] 2018 and for a visa to Canada in [XXX] 2018.\n[6] After repeating attempts by the PSB to locate you, you went into hiding until the end of the summit and waited until [XXX] 2018 to move forward with your plan to come to Canada to rejoin your daughter. You left China for Canada on [XXX], 2018, from the [XXX] city airport and you wanted to avoid the [XXX] and [XXX] airports for fear of detection. Once in Canada, you immediately got involved with the Falun Gong community along with your daughter who had already been in contact with the community. You both filed for refugee protection on January 16, 2019.\n[7] I find that you have established your identities as nationals of China, on a balance of probabilities, through your testimony and the supporting documentation you presented including your Chinese resident identity cards in Hukou and copies of your passports issued by the People\u2019s Republic of China which you provided to authorities at the time you formalized your claim.\n[8] You have also presented today at the hearing, your original resident identity cards, your Hukou and your marriage certificate. You testified in a straightforward, spontaneous and unhesitating manner and you answers to the questions, the Panel posed about the central aspects of your claim were detailed and unrehearsed. There were no material inconsistencies in your testimony or contradictions between your testimony and the other evidence before the Panel.\n[9] Your testimony was consistent in content and chronology with this and the other documents you provided. In particular, your testimony about your practice of Falun Gong and in China and Canada, and your knowledge of Falun Gong was detailed, natural and clearly based on your personal experience as a practitioner. Although, I initially had concerns with the delay in claiming refugee protection in Canada, you explained that you approached the Falun Dafa Association for support in [XXX] 2018 who investigated you for two months and who referred you to council who spent the rest of time with you and your daughter gathering data and documents.\n[10] Your claim was extensively corroborated with supporting documentation which includes photographs of your participation in various Falun Gong activities in Canada, supporting letters from five Falun Gong practitioners in Canada including two supporting letters from your-, for your daughter, a supporting letter from your mother, who introduced you to Master Lee\u2019s Book, the Zhuan Falun, in [XXX] 1997, supporting letters from your brother, sister and husband, supporting letter from the Falun Dafa waist drum band in Toronto of which you are a member, a news report from [XXX] a website that reports on the worldwide Falun Gong community about your [XXX] at the [XXX] provincial women\u2019s prison where you were imprisoned from 2004 to 2008, dated June 3rd, 2005. You have also provided a decision on re-education through labour documents, a detention notice, an arrest notice, an expert opinion, conclusion from the prison in [XXX] where you were detained, the indictment, the criminal judgments, the criminal ruling and a release certificate.\n[11] More significantly, there is also the letter of support from the Falun Dafa Association [XXX] dated [XXX], 2019. The Panel has taken particular note of the letter written on your behalf from the Falun Dafa Association which verifies your Falun Gong practice here in Canada. The Panel places great weight on that letter which is supported by an Immigration and Refugee Board response to information request on the Falun Dafa Association [XXX]. In that response to information request, it states that the asso-, association set out that credibility is very important because it can save the lives of genuine practitioners who risk persecution if returned to China. They therefore only support those practitioners who are known to them and take serious steps to determine the validity of each individual claim before agreeing to support them. The document goes on to provide the list of those people that are responsible for signing these support letters and I note that in the [XXX] region it is [XXX]. The letter that you had provided is from [XXX] and he confirms that you are both Falun Gong practitioners. I find that this letter corroborates your identity as a Falun Gong practitioner with respect to you and your daughter.\n[12] In the letter, Mr. [XXX], who [XXX] president of the Falun Dafa Association [XXX], went over the rigorous procedures for the Falun Dafa Association supporting a Falun Gong practitioner in his letter. While a letter of support from the Falun Dafa Association is not determinative of any refugee claim in the Panel\u2019s experience, such a letter is a relatively rare occurrence and is certainly one piece of evidence that the Panel takes seriously. In this case, we have a letter from the Falun Dafa Association [XXX].\n[13] For these reasons, the Panel finds that you have established, on a balance of probabilities, your Falun Gong practitioner identities and the Panel believes that your commitment to your spiritual practice is genuine. On the basis of your credible and consistent testimony and because of his consistency with the documentary evidence you have presented which I accept, the Panel believes what you have alleged, namely that you were both Falun Gong practitioners, that you were arrested and detain, that you were abused and tortured by the Chinese authorities and harassed for being a Falun Gong practitioner. And I find that you have established that you have a subjective fear of persecution in China based on your Falun Gong practice and identity as a Falun Gong practitioner with respect to you and your daughter.\n[14] The objective evidence is also consistent with your account of fearing persecution as Falun Gong practitioners in China and Canada. Specifically, I have considered the objective documentary evidence in Exhibit 3, namely the National Documentation Package, known as the NDP for China, version 31 October 2019. At Item 2.1 of the NDP, the U.S. Department of State confirm of the People\u2019s Republic of China is an authoritarian state in which the Chinese Communist Party commonly known as the CCP is the paramount authority. Repression and cohesion persist including as against members of banned religions and or sp\u00ad, spiritual practices such as Falun Gong. In Item 12.23, an Immigration Refugee Board response to information request on the treatment of Falun Gong practitioners contains information that further confirms that there is a serious possibility that the practice of Falun Gong will be met with persecution.\n[15] In Item 12.22, a 2008 report by the Falun Dafa Information Center states that family members of those who practice Falun Gong have suffered various degrees of persecution ranging from lost of employment to detention and torture. The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom 2019, annual report in Item 12.2 indicates that the Chinese government has classified Falun Gong as an evil cult. Under article 300 of the Chinese criminal code, belonging to a banned group such as the Falun Gong is punishable with three to seven years of imprisonment or more. Throughout 2018, authorities harassed, detained, intimated Falun Gong practitioners simply for practising their beliefs. There were reports that many of the detainees suffered physical violence, psychiatric abuse, sexual assault, forced drug administration, organ harvesting and sleep deprivation. Items 2.1 and 12.23 also reference the State\u2019s use of harassment, intimidation, imprisonment and torture against Falun Gong practitioners.\n[16] Base on the credible evidence provided by you, with respect to your Falun Gong activities both in China and in Canada, as well as the documentary evidence before the Panel, the Panel finds that your fear of persecution in China at the hands of Chinese government has an objective basis and therefore, you have a well-founded fear of persecution.\n[17] Having found that, you face a well-founded fear of persecution, on the basis of being Falun Gong practitioners, the Panel must consider whether state protection is aval-, available to you or whether you could safely live elsewhere in China without facing such risks. In this case, the Panel finds that the State is the agent of persecution. It is the state authorities who have outlawed the practice of Falun Gong whom you fear. The Panel, therefore, finds, on a balance of probabilities, that it is objectively unreasonable for you to seek the protection of the State.\n[18] The Panel has also considered whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for you. On the evidence before this Panel, I find, on a balance of probabilities, that there is a serious possibility of persecution for you throughout China given that the State is the agent of persecution and is in control of the whole country. The Panel, therefore, finds that there is no viable internal flight alternative for you in China. Based on the forgoing analysis and considering the totality of the evidence before the Panel, I therefore find that you are a Convention refugees and I accept your claims.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

Robinson\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Richard Wazana\nCountry: Nigeria\nRPD Number: TB9-02835\nAssociated RPD Number(s): TB9-02920, TB9-02921, TB9-02922, TB9-02933\nATIP Number: A-2021-01124\nATIP Pages: 000165-000169\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: This is the decision for the following claimants, [XXX], [XXX], [XXX], [XXX] and [XXX] and file numbers TB9-02835, TB9-02920, TB9-02921, TB9-02922 and TB9-02933, respectively.\n[2] [XXX] was appointed as the designated representative for the minor claimants, whom I refer to as, [XXX], [XXX], [XXX] and [XXX].\n[3] I have considered your testimony and the other evidence in the case. I\u2019m ready to render my decision, orally.\n[4] The claims were heard jointly pursuant to Rule 55 of the Refugee Protection Division Rules. The principal claimant was appointed as the designated representative for her children, the minor claimants.\n[5] In making this decision, the panel has considered the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9, Proceedings Before the IRB Involving Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression and the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 4, Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-related Persecution.\n[6] Having considered the totality of the evidence, the panel finds that the minor claimant, [XXX], that is, [XXX], is not a Convention refugee, pursuant to Section 96 of the IRPA or a person in need of protection, pursuant to subsection 97(1) of the IRPA.\n[7] Counsel indicated clearly at the beginning of the hearing that he was not leading any evidence with respect to this minor claimant, a U.S. citizen.\n[8] With respect to this claim, I do not have any persuasive evidence before me to suggest that the minor claimant would face a serious possibility of persecution in the U.S. or that she would face a risk of torture or a risk to her life or cruel or unusual treatment or punishment in the U.S., were she to return there.\n[9] Therefore, the panel rejects the claim of the minor claimant, [XXX].\n[10] The remainder of these reasons shall be in reference to the four remaining claimants.\n[11] The panel finds that the claimant, [XXX], is a Convention refugee pursuant to Section 96 of the IRPA on the basis of her membership in a particular social group, namely, as bi-sexual.\n[12] The panel finds that she would face a serious possibility of persecution in Nigeria.\n[13] The panel finds that the female minor claimant, [XXX], is a Convention refugee, pursuant to Section 96 of IRPA on the basis of gender discrimination because she faces a serious possibility of persecution in Nigeria in so far as the principal claimant\u2019s husband\u2019s extended family wishes to perform female genital mutilation, FGM, upon the female minor claimant.\n[14] The panel finds that the minor male claimants, [XXX] and [XXX], are Convention refugees pursuant to Section 96 of IRPA on the basis of religious belief, in so far as the principal claimant\u2019s husbands extended family wishes to perform ritual incision upon them and they do not agree.\n[15] The allegations in the claim are found in the respective Basis of Claim Forms, filed by the claimants. The claimants fear that they will be killed or seriously harmed because the principal claimant is bi-sexual and because the minor claimants have refused to undergo ritual mutilation to purge or atone for the perceived transgressions of the principal claimant.\n[16] The identity and country of reference for the claimants have been established, on the balance of probabilities, by the claimants\u2019 Nigerian passports.\n[17] The principal claimant is a member of a particular social group, as a bi-sexual, as is the female minor claimant, who has been threatened with FGM. I am, therefore, satisfied on the available evidence, that the principal claimant and the female minor claimant have established a nexus to a Convention ground under Section 96 of the IRPA, on the basis of gender-based persecution.\n[18] I am also satisfied, on the basis of the available evidence, the male minor claimants have established a nexus to a Convention ground under Section 96 of the IRPA, on the basis of religious belief because the male minor claimants are Christians who do not wish to undergo a ritual incision.\n[19] In terms of your general credibility, I have found you to be a credible witness and I, therefore, believe what you have alleged in your oral testimony and in your Basis of Claim Form.\n[20] You have explained that your difficulties in Nigeria arose in [XXX] 2018 when your sister-in-law discovered your affair with your same-sex partner and sent compromising pictures from your cellphone to your husband.\n[21] Thereafter, your husband\u2019s family became angry about your bi-sexuality and having advised the King, the claimants were each ordered to undergo a ritual cleansing through the imposition of FGM upon the minor female claimant, facial and chest incisions upon the minor male claimants and facial and genital incisions upon the principal claimant.\n[22] When the principal claimant refused to attend to the appointed place for the ritual, representatives of the community attended at the home of the principal claimant, beating her and torturing her by the application of a hot iron to her abdomen and by lashing her legs with cables.\n[23] The claimants fled to [XXX], where, after three weeks, the story of these events followed them and their host asked them to leave.\n[24] Hence, the fled to [XXX], where the principal claimant received threatening phone calls from the agents of persecution.\n[25] Thereafter, the claimants fled to Canada.\n[26] I, therefore, find that your subjective fear is established by your credible testimony and the corroborating documentary evidence and I believe what you have alleged, on a balance of probabilities.\n[27] I find that the agent of persecution in this case is the extended family of the husband of the female claimant, the principal claimant and the broader Nigerian community in which same-sex relationships are illegal and homophobia is the prevailing attitude.\n[28] You have testified that your mother has since been beaten by representatives of your extended family in an attempt to discover your whereabouts.\n[29] Your testimony is consistent with the objective documentary evidence. Exhibit 3 consists of relevant extracts of the National Documentation Package for Nigeria. At Tab 3.2, the country conditions reports confirm that, state sponsored homophobia exists in Nigeria.\n[30] At Tab 5.28 and 6.12, the country conditions reports confirm the prevalence of FGM.\n[31] The foregoing country conditions report is consistent with the personal experiences reported by the claimant, principal claimant.\n[32] Although the country conditions reports do not specifically address the ritual mutilation ordered for the male, minor claimants, I found the testimony of the principal claimant on that matter to be compelling, consistent and credible. I am satisfied, on the basis of her testimony, that this threat did actually occur.\n[33] The principal claimant\u2019s testimony, I found, to be credible overall. It was given directly. It was broadly consistent. There were no inconsistencies that went to the heart of the claim.\n[34] I find the events as described did, in fact, occur.\n[35] Based on your personal circumstances, as well as, the objective country documentation, I find that you have rebutted the presumption of state protection. The country conditions reports confirm that, as a bi-sexual woman, the principal claimant would be persecuted through Nigeria.\n[36] The country conditions reports confirm that the position of the police forces with respect to the enforcement of traditional norms, such as, FGM and ritual mutilation is to regard it as a family matter, rather than as a police matter.\n[37] State protection is not available for you.\n[38] I have also considered whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for you. The evidence shows that with respect to the persecution of a particular social group, the State is itself the agent of persecution with reach throughout the country and a motivation to pursue the principal claimant.\n[39] I find that the test fails on the first prong with respect to her.\n[40] With respect to the minor claimants, I find that the claimants were unsuccessful in hiding in [XXX] and that the agents of persecution would able to confirm the presence of the claimants in [XXX].\n[41] Their willingness to harm the principal claimant\u2019s mother in order to locate the claimants, demonstrates, on a balance of probabilities, that the agent of persecution has the motivation and the reach to find the claimants in Nigeria.\n[42] In all the circumstances, I find the claimants have no reasonable flight alternative within Nigeria.\n[43] Based on the totality of the evidence, I find the claimants to be Convention refugees and I accept their respective claims.\n[44] Thank you.\n[45] So, we are off the record.\n[46] Returning to the record for just a moment to confirm that I have returned the original documents to Counsel.\n[47] Thank you very much.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2019 RLLR 27\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: October 17, 2019\nPanel: Dian Forsey\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Roger Rowe\nCountry: Nigeria\nRPD Number: TB9-02164\nAssociated RPD Number(s): TB9-02208, TB9-02229, TB9-02230, TB9-02231, TB9-12232\nATIP Number: A-2021-01124\nATIP Pages: 000162-000164\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: This is a decision for the claimant in file number TB9-02164. The male claimant was appointed the designated representative for the four minor children. I have also considered the Guidelines 3 and 4 with respect to look at-, looking at the evidence today. One deals with women and the other one deals with child-, with children that are before me. I\u2019m sure Counsel\u2019s familiar with those Guidelines.\n[2] I have considered your testimony and the other evidence in this case and I am ready to render my decision.\n[3] You are claiming to be citizens of Nigeria and are claiming refugee protection pursuant to Sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA). I find that you are a-, that you are Convention refugees and persons in need of protection for the following reasons.\n[4] You alleged the following, that you are citizens of Nigeria and of no other country. The documentation on file provided by your Counsel, which were in the form of your passports, your US visas, your educational documentation, the documentation with respect to your role within your church as a Pastor and Deacon for the female claimant, clearly, and the birth certificates also of your children, provide a basis for me to-, to declare that you are indeed citizens of Nigeria based on your testimony and supporting documentation filed in the Exhibits.\n[5] Therefore, on a balance of probabilities that your identity and country of reference have been established. In terms of your general er-, credibility, I\u2019ve found that you are ere-, were credible witness and therefore I accept what you have alleged in your oral testimony and in your Basis of Claim form. In support of your claim, you provided document-, documents confirming your role as a Pastor and your wife\u2019s role as a Deacon within the Christian Church.\n[6] You in fact performed your duties for more than seven years in that church in Nigeria. You continue today to be a parishioner of churches within Canada, which confirms to me that you are following your Christian faith. Your testimony was straightforward and in keeping with your Basis of Claim form and there were no significant inconsistency or admissions in your evidence today. Your evidence was clear, there were times when you had an opportunity to exaggerate your claim, but you did not do so. So, I find therefore that you are credible with respect to the fear that you have in returning to Nigeria.\n[7] I find there is a link between your fear, there\u2019s no\u2013, no link between your fear and one of the five Convention grounds, therefore I\u2019m going to assess the claim under Section 97, and that is the fear upon your return to Nigeria given your profile. The objective evidence supports your allegations that individuals in your circumstances face being persecuted by persons that you have named as Kingsman and their-, and their group and organization, this is also supported by the documentary evidence quoted by the Counsel. It speaks of the difficulty of leaving such cults once you are born into it. In this particular case, however, it appears to be particularly offensive to them, because you have become a Christian and in fact a Pastor within the Christian Church. And that was clear from the evidence in your BOC and in your oral evidence today.\n[8] You have also provided me two police report and the originals of those police reports. The law and principle are clear that they do provide protection in some matters in Nigeria, but in your particular case, the practice is not always available to claimants who are bringing forth complaints about cults or the cult activity towards them. The police also appear as Counsel has alleged in his submissions under Chap. 2, page 12, and that the police appear to be discriminatory toward women with respect to traditional rituals. The claimant has spoken of those traditional rituals when speaking to me about the rituals that were performed, that would be performed on his family should he return to Nigeria.\n[9] The claimants also-, claimant has also-, principal claimant has also testified that he is strong within his Christian faith and does not believe in these traditional rituals that occur within his family-, the main group of his family. He has also indicated to me that he swore to his father that he would not take on the chieftainship of-, of this family group. He also would not take it on because of-, he would lose his marriage to his wife who is a strong Christian person. He\u2019s also fearful for his children should he take on any such position. And indeed, his own beliefs would prevent him from taking on such a role.\n[10] Therefore, I find that you face a risk of serious harm, as set out in Section 97, should you return to Nigeria today. I find that adequate state protection would not be available to you were you to seek it in Nigeria. The objective evidence that I\u2019ve stated already indicates that would not be possible for you, and more likely than not, they would continue to inform you that you should settle matters within your family and within that group.\n[11] You have testified that you made attempts to seek state protection, as we-, as I\u2019ve just spoken about, and that the State was not forthcoming to you, and in fact advised you that you should settle it among yourselves. In light of the objective con-, country documentation which counsel has referred to and is in the documents from the Board, I find that the claimant has rebutted the presumption of state protection based on your personal circumstances as well as the do-, objective documentary evidence. I find that adequate state protection would not be available to you should you return to Nigeria.\n[12] I\u2019ve also considered whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for you and identified Abuja and Port Harcourt as the possible IFA locations. I\u2019ve also that the failure to claim in the US is reasonable under their circumstances that you found yourself in that particular time and place. The Panel finds that th-, your efforts also to seek state protection is reasonable in the circum-, that your efforts to seek state protection is reasonable under the circumstances that you found yourself in, in that particular time and place in Nigeria, and I have two report-, police reports that both indicate they had referred you back to the group to be able to negotiate some sort of arrangement with them. Which seems highly unlikely given the documentation about these cults.\n[13] The-, in this particular case, I just want to point out that the claimant\u2019s profile is heightened by his work within his Christian Church as a Pastor. He would be well known and would make it even easier to find in Nigeria, should he be seriously sought by these groups of people, and there\u2019s no doubt from the evidence that he would be continued to be sought by this group, should he return to Nigeria.\n[14] The country documentation indicates that the situation for individuals, in circumstances such as yours, would be the same throughout the country because of your profile as a Christian Pastor in the church. So, having considered your personal circumstances, I found it unreasonable for you to relocate in either of the IFA locations. I therefore find it would not be reasonable in the circumstances that you have indicated to reside in any of the IFAs. As such, I find there is no viable flight-, internal flight alternative for you and or your family in Nigeria today.\n[15] Therefore, based on the totality of the evidence, I find you to be a person-, to be a person in need of protection, your claim is therefore accepted.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

The claimants seek refugee protection against China pursuant to Sections 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. For the following reasons, the Panel finds that the claimants are Convention refugees and this claim is accepted.\n[2] This claim was based on the following allegations. The claimants are ethnic Uyghurs. They left China in 2014 so that the adult male claimant could work in Malaysia fearing current pol-, Chinese policies towards Uyghurs. The claimants fear for their lives if they were to return to China. The claimants left Malaysia and came to Canada on November 20th, 2018. They signed their Basis of Claims on December 8th, 2018.\n[3] The identity of the claimants were established on the basis of their Chinese passports. The originals of which were seized by the Minister.\n[4] The Panel had no significant concerns about this claim. There was one potential exclusion issue, given that the claimants had Malaysian residence permits in their passports. However, those residence permits are also-, also clearly state that their residence was dependent upon the validity of their passports. Which means that in order for the claimants to continue legally residing in Malaysia, they would have to renew their passports with the Chinese government at some point in the foreseeable future. Given the claimants ethnicity and the government of China is the agent of persecution, it would not be reasonable to expect the claimants to have their Chinese passports renewed. They could not reasonably exercise any right to residency in Malaysia, therefore even if it was available to them and of akin to Malaysian citizenship.\n[5] The sole determinative issue in Uyghurs-, in Uyghur claims in this Panel\u2019s view is the identity of the claimants as Uyghur. That is because of the brutally persecutory nature of the Chinese government towards the Uyghur people. This Panel has access to reliable and credible resources such as the U.K. Home Office report and the US DOS report. Each of which make clear that the Chinese government has oppressed the Uyghur people in virtually every aspect of their lives. Some reports even suggest that as many as two million Uyghur people are now detained in concentration camps.\n[6] The country conditions evidence is suggestive that the Chinese policy of assimilation has now arguably moved into the realm of genocide. For this reason, in this Panel\u2019s view, identity as an ethnic Uyghur is sufficient to establish persecution.\n[7] In this claim, the claimant presented their passports which noted their places of birth in [XXX] province. The claimants spoke Uyghur. And the Panel had no reason to disbelieve any of the evidence or testimony. The Panel finds that the claimants are indeed likely ethnic Uyghurs. Whereas the State is the agent of persecution, the claimants have rebutted the presumption that state protection would be adequate and forthcoming to them. Likewise, there is no location in China where they can go where they would not face a serious possibility of persecution.\n[8] For all these reasons, the Panel finds that this claim is credible. The claimants\u2019 fear is well-founded. The claimants face a serious possibility of persecution on account of their ethnicity.\n[9] The claimants are Convention refugees and this claim is accepted.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

I find that you are a Convention refugee for the following reason.\n[2] For making this decision and in formulating questions for the hearing, I considered Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9, with regarding to proceedings before the Immigration and Refugee Board involving claims of Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression.\n[3] You allege the following. That you are a citizen of Turkey, and that if you were to return, you will face persecution as a member in a particular social group, which is your sexual orientation. You also allege that your work, that criticized the conservative society in Turkey, led you to be targeted by the police in addition to your sexual orientation. In addition, you alleged that you will be considered as a draft dodger by the Turkish authorities since the extension to the deferral from the mandatory service ended. You allege that there is no state protection for you or an internal flight alternative.\n[4] Your personal identity as a citizen of Turkey has been established by your oral testimony and the supporting documents, which is your passports. I find that on a balance of probabilities that identity and country of reference have been established.\n[5] I find that there is a link between what you fear and one of the five Convention grounds, specifically particular social group, namely your sexual orientation. Therefore, I assessed your claim under Section 96.\n[6] In terms of your general credibility, I have found you to be a credible witness and I therefore believe what you have alleged in your oral testimony and in your Basis of Claim form. In support of your claim you provided documents for your claim, including the letters from your mother, friends, medical report and photographs. Your oral testimony was straightforward and was largely in keeping with your Basis of Claim form and there were no significant inconsistencies or omissions that went to the heart of the claim. I therefore find the following to be credible. That you are a bisexual man facing persecution in Turkey due to your sexual orientation.\n[7] Your o-, oral testimony today included details regarding your initial revelation that you are also attr-, attracted to person of the same gender as well as person of the opposite gender. You also provided details regarding your same-sex relationships in Turkey and the violence you faced from the society as well as from the police that led you to believe that you were targeted by the state authorities. You also provided details about your activities in Turkey such as attending the pride parade, which led to your detainment by the police, and attending social events hosted by the LGBTQ+ focus groups in Turkey. You also provided documents in support of your testimony that you are a bisexual man, those documents include letters of support from your friends, your parents, photographs and the membership statement from the 519 Organization. Your testimony and the supporting documentation all established that you are a bisexual man.\n[8] The objective documentation supports your allegation that individuals in your circumstance face human rights abuse for LGBT person, and that although there\u2019s no law that criminalize LGBTQ+ communities, the provisions of law on offences against public morality, protection of family, and unnatural sexual behaviour are used as a basis for abuse according to NDP dated March 29, 2019 Item 2.1. Bans on LGBTQ+ events by the State officials in recent years as demonstrated in NDP Item 2.7, show that the LGBTQ+ communities and their members face discrimination and violence based on their sexual orientation and gender identity. Information on both the NDP and the country condition package submitted by the counsel Exhibit 4, all corroborate the heightened level of violence against the LGBTQ+ communities and their rights by the State authorities. I therefore find that you have a well-founded fear of persecution.\n[9] I find that adequate state protection will not be available to you if you were to seek it in Turkey. You testified that you never sought prate-, state protection because the State will be unwilling to protect you, and because the police were the ones who were targeting you. And this is corroborated by the objective documentary evidence dat-, it indicates that NDP Item 1.14, that the government is unable or unwilling to protect vulnerable LGBTQ+ people from viol-, violence and discrimination. Impunity for crimes against LGBTQ+ individuals continue to be reported as a problem. And that according to NDP 2.1, there is no protection based on sexual orientation or gender identity on the criminal code. In light of the objective country documentation, I find that the claimant has rebutted the presumption of state protection. Based on your personal circumstances as well as the objective country documentation, I find that the adequate state protection will not be available to you, as the state will be unwilling and unable to protect you in Turkey.\n[10] As you have rebutted the presumption of state protection and since the country documentation indicates that the situation for individuals in circumstances such as yours is the same throughout the country, I find that you do not have a viable internal flight alternative.\n[11] Based on the totality of evidence, I find that you have established that there is a serious possibility of persecution on the Convention grounds, namely your membership in a particular social group as a bisexual person. I therefore find that you are a Convention refugee and I accept your claim.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2019 RLLR 24\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: June 26, 2019\nPanel: Keith Brennenstuhl\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Kristina Cooke\nCountry: Pakistan\nRPD Number: TB8-27592\nATIP Number: A-2021-01124\nATIP Pages: 000151-000155\nREASONS FOR DECISION\nOn June 26, 2019, the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) heard the claim of [XXX] who claims refugee protection under sections 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA). On that same day, the panel rendered its oral positive decision and Reasons for decision. This is the written version of the oral decision and Reasons that have been edited for clarity, spelling, grammar and syntax with added references to the documentary evidence and relevant case law where appropriate.\nINTRODUCTION\n[1] These are the reasons for the decision in the claim of [XXX], who claims to be a citizen of Pakistan, and is claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] The allegations are fully set out in the claimant\u2019s Basis of Claim form. The claimant identifies her religion as the Shia sect of Islam. Her problems arose during her teaching of her grade 10 students, when she spoke out against terrorist acts that had happened the day before when a girls\u2019 school was destroyed in a nearby province. She expressed her view that the real culprits were Madrasahs and that they were incubators for terrorism. She talked about terrorist organizations including the Lashkar-e-Jhangvi (LeJ) saying that people who gave them refuge were equally culpable for their terrorist acts.\n[3] Accused of preaching religion and speaking out against Sunnis, the principal terminated the claimant\u2019s employment the next day. Rumours spread that she had been terminated because of her involvement in \u201cimmoral activities\u201d.\n[4] Three days later, while waiting at a bus stop, two men on a motorbike drove by and fired two gunshots around her. She registered a First Information Report (FIR) at the police station. On the same night, she received a call on her cell phone from a man claiming to be a member of LeJ, saying the attack earlier that day had been a warning from them and that they would not tolerate a Shia pervert who was involved in spreading hatred in school against Sunni Islam.\n[5] She relocated to [XXX] and changed her cell phone number. A week later, she learned from her former neighbour that two men knocked at her door and had inquired about the claimant, indicating that the claimant was on their hit list. She contacted the police to update them on the situation but they had nothing to update her with or help to offer.\n[6] The claimant raised funds for an airline ticket and visa and fled Pakistan to the USA. Shortly thereafter she made her way to Canada where she made her refugee claim.\n[7] The claimant is afraid of returning to Pakistan because she has been targeted by the LeJ for spreading, what is perceived to be, anti-Sunni sentiments.\nDETERMINATION\n[8] I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee as she has established a serious possibility of persecution should she return to Pakistan based on the grounds in section 96.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[9] I find that the claimant\u2019s identity as a national of Pakistan is established by the documents provided, including a certified true copy of her Pakistan passport.\nNexus\n[10] I find that the claimant has established a nexus to section 96 by reason of religion.\nCredibility\n[11] The claimant\u2019s evidence is, on the balance, internally consistent, inherently plausible, and consistent with the documentary evidence on country conditions in Pakistan. Furthermore, the allegations are corroborated by personal documents that I do not have sufficient reason to discount, including corroboration of the claimant\u2019s identity as a Shia, and as a teacher, and that she was terminated from her teaching position on the false allegation of spreading hatred against Sunni Islam. The FIR supports her allegation that you were fired upon by two unidentified persons on a motorbike. I, therefore, find this evidence to be credible and that the allegations are probably true.\nObjective basis of future risk\n[12] Based on the credibility of her allegations, and the documentary evidence set out below, I find that the claimant has established a future risk that she will be subjected to threats, violence and even death at the hands of Sunni militant groups if she were to return to Pakistan.\n[13] Country condition documents indicate that Shia Muslims face increasing threats in Pakistan. They are being systematically targeted and shot dead by Sunni militants who do not consider them as Muslims. There is a general lack of effective state protection for those Shia Muslims who are targeted by Sunni militant groups. The Pakistani government\u2019s response to violent attacks against Shia is characterised as grossly inadequate; it is described as lacking political will to address violence against Shia. Militants targeting Shia Muslim act with \u201cimpunity\u201d (National Documentation Package (NDP) for Pakistan (January 31, 2019), Item 12.5). Shi\u2019ites, according to the UNHCR Eligibility Guidelines for Assessing the International Protection Needs of Members of Religious Minorities from Pakistan (Item 1.8) face a growing threat of sectarian attacks with attacks primarily targeting ordinary individuals. I should add that the claimant would have a heightened vulnerability in that she is a female educator as well. Anti\u00adShi\u2019ites speech reportedly permeates all sectors of society, and extremist groups are reported to have publicly called for the killing of Shi\u2019ite individuals and have used methods to instill fear and force them to flee. According to a document entitled Everything has shattered- rising levels of violence against Shi\u2019a in Pakistan (Item 12.23), the Pakistani government completely fails to protect its Shia population and has not been able to successfully counter allegations that it is protecting militants.\nNature of the harm\n[14] The harm that the claimant would face if she were to return to Pakistan clearly amounts to persecution.\nState protection\n[15] The objective evidence confirms that state protection, as it relates to sectarian violence against Shia, is ineffective as already canvassed earlier. I am satisfied, therefore, that the claimant will not be able to avail herself of adequate state protection in the face of persecutory acts from non-state actors if she must return to Pakistan.\nInternal flight alternative (IFA)\n[16] I have considered whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for the claimant. According to the UNHCR Eligibility Guidelines, given the wide geographic reach of some armed militant groups, a viable IFA will generally not be available to individuals at risk of being targeted by such groups.\n[17] I am satisfied, given the claimant\u2019s profile as a Shia\u2019 female educator, she will face a serious possibility of persecution based on her profile and in particular her religious profile anywhere in Pakistan. Attacks by extremists targeting Shia in Pakistan is widespread (Item 12.23) and police often fail to protect religious minorities, including Shia, from attacks.\nCONCLUSION\n[18] Based on the forgoing analysis, I conclude that you are a Convention refugee. Accordingly, I accept your claim.\n",

The claimants are citizens of, yeah, the-, the-, the claimants that remain at this point in the claim are citizens of Mexico claiming refugee protection pursuant to Section 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[2] The allegations of the claimants is contained in the Basis of Claim form narratives. I\u2019m going to briefly summarize those allegations. [XXX], the principal claimant was a [XXX] and dump [XXX] and [XXX] in Mexico from [XXX] 2014 until [XXX] 2017. He worked in a number of States that bordered the United States. In [XXX] 2016, he was befriended by 8 men who became very friendly with him and they spent some time eating together at a near-, at a restaurant. After a number of different encounters with the same men, the men indicated to the principal claimant that they wanted him to work for their company. These men indicated they knew about his wife, his children, he-, they knew where they lived and so on. They said that they were members of the Gulf cartel and they needed his assistance.\n[3] The principal claimant told them he needed time to think about this offer. On [XXX] 2016, the principal claimant was kidnapped, taken to a ranch and tortured. They showed him on a video phone that his wife had been kidnapped as-, had been taken, she was being-, and she was being raped, while their youngest child-, while the child was in a different room. They also showed him a video in which they were killing people and chopping up their bodies. They ordered the principal claimant to get the company\u2019s [XXX] and take them to the border with the United States. On [XXX], they shot up his car and left pictures of people that had been chopped up. On [XXX], they-, they went to his house, kidnapped him from the home, took him to an isolated area where he was beaten. Another man was brought to this area and murdered in front of the principal claimant. The principal claimant returned to his work on [XXX] the [XXX], he gave notice that the was going to be resigning from his position. He quit his job on [XXX] the [XXX]. Two days later he and the other claimants relocated to hide themselves at the principal claimant\u2019s in-law\u2019s home. Unfortunately, the death threats continued, the principal claimant was able to leave Mexico and travelled and made his way to Canada. His wife and two children remained in Mexico and left at a later time, until July of last year when they-, they were all joined together in Canada. They are now afraid to return to Mexico.\n[4] After the purposes, the reason I just want to clarify that the claim of Justice [XXX], this couples\u2019, this couples\u2019 oldest child was withdrawn at the outset of hearing as this child is an American citizen and who is not intending to pursue a claim against the United States.\n[5] The three remaining claimants that is [XXX], [XXX] and [XXX] I find that they are not Convention refugees as they do not have a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention ground in Mexico. However, I find that they are people in need of protection, as their removal to Mexico would subject them personally to a risk to their lives.\n[6] The claimant\u2019s identities as-, as citizens of Mexico is established by the documents on file which include copies of their passports.\n[7] With respect to credibility, as I indicated to the principal claimant, I have some concerns which are properly called plausibility concerns. Specific plausibility of the family remaining at their in-law\u2019s home after they had been found there. The plausibility of their continuing to send their son to school. The plausibility of the principal claimant giving notice that he was going to be leaving his work, rather than just working-, just leaving quietly. However, notwithstanding these concerns, there are a number of corroborative documents that are helpful in establishing the credibility. I do believe the principal claimant has been traumatized in some fashion. The female adult claimant was questioned and provided some evidence which I thought was quite credible and referred to her being subject to rapes. The claimant\u2019s allegations are not inconsistent with country conditions and the types of things that can happen to people there who are-, who are in some form of conflict or trouble with the-, with the Gulf cartel. So, on a balance of probabilities, I accept the claimant\u2019s allegations to be credible. That is, I accept that because of the principal claimant\u2019s ability as a [XXX], as a [XXX], he was of interest to the Gulf cartel. I accept that he was pursued by the Gulf cartel to work for them and I accept that Gulf cartel was intent on harming him and his family when they came to believe that he was not going to be co-operative.\n[8] Given that I accept those allegations, the current conditions in Mexico indicate that there is an objective basis to their fear of returning to that country. Gulf cartel and other-, other organized criminal groups have been implicated in numerous killings and acting with impunity and most tragically at times in league with corrupt federal state, local and security officials. Criminal organizations have been involved in forced disappearances, torture, sexual violence, kidnappings and-, and so on. So, I believe if these claimants return to Mexico, their lives would be at risk of these agents of harm.\n[9] I have considered whether adequate state protection would be available or whether there might be a viable internal flight alternative. I find given the complicity, the documents referred to of the criminal organizations working with federal, state, local and security officials, that adequate state protection would not be provided. I would note, that the principal claimant described how he would be escorted by the army and the police when he [XXX], they wanted him to drive to the-, to the border with the United States, which obviously suggests again, corrupt officials being involved in these activities. So, I don\u2019t believe adequate state protection would be available with respect to a viable internal flight alternative, I find there would not be one. There\u2019s insufficient evidence before me that the Gulf cartel cannot reach to anywhere in Mexico, if so desired. In particularly, in light of the corruption, I\u2019ve just referred to it is quite reasonable to assume that if they were intent on finding someone they could find a person who is living above ground, that is leaving and operating in-, in any free manner. So, I did not believe there would be a\u00ad \u2018 a viable internal flight alternative.\n[10] So, to conclude, I find the claimants face a risk to their lives if returned to Mexico and accordingly, I find the claimants to be people in need of protection pursuant to Section 97(1)(b) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

Written reasons will be provided.\n[2] This is the decision in the claims for refugee protection of [XXX], [XXX], [XXX], and [XXX]. They claim to be citizens of Iran from Tehran. They\u2019re claiming refugee protection under Section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[3] The principal claimant was designated representative for the minor claimants.\n[4] I\u2019m satisfied that the claimants are citizens of Iran and as to their personal identity based on their passports which can be found in Exhibit 1.\n[5] The details of the allegations appear in the answers to the principal claimant\u2019s Basis of Claim Form which is Exhibit 2.1 and were elaborated upon by him in oral testimony during the hearing this morning. The central allegations of a much longer narrative are the following.\n[6] The principal claimant made police complaints in regard to a business dispute with a well connected landlord. The landlord retaliated by using connections in the police and the courts to have the complaints dismissed. He then had the principal claimant arrested, detained, and accused of insulting the Iranian regime. The principal claimant therefore fled to Turkey in [XXX] 2017.\n[7] Iranian authorities harassed and threatened the female claimant after the principal claimant went to Turkey. The claimants therefore fled to Canada on temporary residence visas in July 2018 and initiated these inland refugee protection claims a few weeks after their arrival.\n[8] The claimants have been politically active against the Iranian regime while they\u2019ve been in Canada. They fear political persecution if they return to Iran.\n[9] For the following reasons I find that the claimants are Convention refugees.\n[10] The affirmed testimony of refugee claimants is presumed to be true, unless it is internally inconsistent, inherently implausible, or contradicted by documentary evidence on country conditions. In this regard I am relying on the Federal Court of Appeal decision in Maldonado.\n[11] For the most part there was no such fault with the principal claimant\u2019s testimony. Furthermore, the allegations in the case are corroborated by a number of personal documents that I do not have sufficient to discount including probative photographs, a court order, a lease, and a statement from the principal claimant\u2019s former business partner. These documents can be found in Exhibits 4 and 5.\n[12] For all these reasons I find that the principal claimant is a credible witness and that the central allegations in this case are all true, on a balance of probabilities.\n[13] The country documentary evidence before me indicates that peaceful political opposition to the Iranian Government and its policies and perceived opposition in this regard will attract a serious possibility of persecution by the government in Iran. The country documents in this regard can be found in Sections I, 2, 4, 5, 9, 10, and 12 of Exhibit 3 which is the National Documentation Package for Iran for March 29, 2019.\n[14] Therefore, based on this country documentary evidence and the credible allegations, I find that the claimants have a well-founded fear of persecution in Iran by reason of their perceived anti\u00adgovernment political opinion and\/or their family relationship to the principal claimant.\n[15] As the Government of Iran is an agent of persecution, I find that adequate State protection and viable internal flight alternatives are not available to the claimants.\n[16] I therefore conclude that they\u2019re Convention refugees. The \u2026 these claims are therefore accepted. This decision is concluded. Thank you for corning. Good morning.\n[17] Thank you, Madam Interpreter.\n[18] INTERPRETER: Thank you.\n[19] CLAIMANT: Thank you.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\n",

Fox\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Aleksandr Radin\nCountry: Turkey\nRPD Number: TB8-23829\nATIP Number: A-2021-01124\nATIP Pages: 000141-000144\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: This is the decision in the claim for refugee protection made by [XXX] herein after the claimant, pursuant to Section 97 and 97-, 96, sorry, and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[2] She alleges she cannot return to Turkey, her country of citizenship where she\u2019ll be persecuted because of her sexual orientation. The Panel has considered your testimony and other evidence in the case and is ready to render its decision orally.\n[3] The Panel finds the claimant to be a Convention refugee as she has established a well-founded fear of persecution in Turkey based on the Convention ground. Having membership in a particular social group, namely a lesbian. Panel considered Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9 in relation to proceedings before the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada involving sexual orientation and gender identity and expression. In rendering its decision, the Panel has concern for the particular challenges that the LBGT individuals from Turkey may face in presenting their case. Since this case involves allegations of gender related violence, the Panel considers Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 4, Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender Related Persecution. These Chairperson\u2019s Guidelines assist in assessing the key evidentiary elements in determining to what extent women making a gender related claim of fear of persecution may successfully rely on any convention ground and under what circumstances gender violence constitutes persecution.\n[4] The claimant\u2019s allegation are set in her Basis of Claim Form, marked as Exhibit 2 on the consolidated list of documents in this matter. The claimant\u2019s fears being seriously harmed and or o-,ostracized by her family members and fears being seriously harmed or killed by members of the Turkish community or her father on account of her sexual orientation. The claimant has-, was raised in a conservative and religious-, conservatively religious Turkish family. In high school she realized that she was attracted to girls, however, she was never able to talk about it with students or her parents or express any feelings about this with her brother as well. In her first year of university, the claimant met and became friends with [XXX], this relationship developed into a sexually intimate relationship while they were rooming together. Although they were partners for over seven years, the claimant had to hide their relationship from her family and society because of Turkey\u2019s conservative culture.\n[5] In [XXX] of 2-, 2018, the claimant traveled to Canada to study. Two weeks after arrival in Canada, she met and became sexually intimate with a-, a lady named [XXX]. On [XXX] the claimant disclosed this to [XXX], that she had this relationship with [XXX], however, [XXX] did not take this news very well and threatened revenge. The next day, the claimant received a phone call from her father during which he threatened her life for dishonouring and shaming the fa-, family after [XXX] had reaz-, revealed families, sorry, a photo to her family with respect to intimate pictures. The claimant then decided to claim refugee status in August of 2018.\n[6] The Panel is satisfied with the claimant\u2019s personal identity and status as a citizen of Turkey on a balance of probabilities based on a certified copy of her passport included in the documents marked as Exhibit 1 on the consolidated list of documents in this matter. The determinative issue in this claim is credibility. I find the claim to-, to be a credible witness on a balance of probabilities. She testified in a very straight forward, very candid manner and credible manner without embellishment. Her oral testimony was consistent with her Basis of Claim and tes-, and the documentary evidence in support of her allegations. Most notably, a letter from her brother Segan, e-mails with respect to her father listing her as a missing person, photographs of the claimant playing basketball and other sports, photographs of the claimant\u2019s mother in traditional headdress, photographs, a plethora of photographs of her former girlfriend [XXX], 519 documents in-, indicating that she has attended the community centre and on 519 Church Street, a letter from her present girlfriend, [XXX], [XXX], who was unable attend today because of an accident she had the day before and the-, there was a document indicating that she had received medication which we didn\u2019t enter into as an Exhibit but I will make note of that, that I had seen the prescription for pain killers, also a bachelors degree from university and photographs of the claimant attending pride festivities, a call history with her father which-, with translation, various other childhood pictures and photographs with [XXX] as well and additional photographs confirming sexual orientation and her activities in the LGBT community, messages from dating apps and-, and a letter from her friend [XXX], I guess, I pronounced that again, get worse the second time, okay.\n[7] While the Panel finds that this plethora of documentation and documentary evidence is not demonstrative of sexual orientation on its own, it does corroborate the claimant\u2019s alleged sexual orientation. Moreover, given that there were no major credibility issues, the Panel finds that these documents are relevant to corroborative ev-, evidence. The Panel ful- is, the Panel is mindful that the standard of proof as to the claimant\u2019s sexual orientation is a balance of probabilities. On the bases of the claimant\u2019s consistent testimony regarding her same sex partners and events that led to her claiming in Canada, the photos of her same sex partners and supporting letters from her friend and brother, the Panel finds that based on factors unique to this claimant\u2019s case that she has established on a balance of probabilities that she is a lesbian. The Panel finds there is clear and convincing evidence on the record to rebut the presumption of state protection. This information is contained in documents in the current National Documentation Package for Turkey compiled by the Board\u2019s research directorate and marked as Exhibit 3 on the consolidated list of documents in this matter.\n[8] In recent years, there has been an increase in aggressive behaviour and threats to the LGBT community by non-state actors including family, but especially from conservative religious groups. Documentary evidence reported in the country reports on human rights practices for 2018 from the United States Department of State and the bureau of democracy of Human Rights and Labour reports the following. While the law does not explicitly criminalize LGBT status or conduct, provisions of the law concerning offences against public morality, protection of the family and unnatural sexual behaviour sometimes served as a basis for abuse by police and discrimination by employers. Numerous LGBT organizations reported a heightened sense of vulnerability under the state of emergency as well as growing restrictions on their freedom of speech, assembly and association. During the year, the Ankara\u2019s Governor\u2019s office continued its indef-, indefinite ban in 2017 on all public GB-, LGBT events in the province assigning public safety concerns.\n[9] The criminal code does not include specific protections based on sexual orientation or gender identity. The laws allow for up to three years in prison for hate speech or injurious acts related to language, for race, nationality, colour, gender, disability, political opinion, philosophical beliefs, religion or sectarian differences but human rights groups criticize the law\u2019s failure to include protections based on gender identity. As noted, it was sometimes used to restrict freedom of speech rather than to protect my-, minorities. Judges routinely apply the law to reduce the sentences of persons who killed LGBT individuals. Courts of Appeal upheld these verdicts based in part on the immoral nature of the victim. The report also indicates that the LGBT persons could not get a-, access to healthcare. The UK Home Report in item 1.14 and Section 224 also states that, while there\u2019s some protection in the law and avenues of rej-, redress and practice operationally, these resources are not effective.\n[10] Section 244 states in particular that government does not effectively protect vulnerable LGBT persons from social abuse, discrimination or incidents of violence. Impunity for crimes against LGBT individuals continues to be reported as a problem and in practice, law enforcement officials and judiciary have taken a lenient attitude towards crimes committed against the LGBT persons. According to paragraphs 2,5,4 of this report, internal relocation will not be an option if it depends on the persons concealing their sexual orientation and or gender identity, in the proposed new location for fear of persecution. When taking all this evidence together the Panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant would face a serious possibility of persecution if she was return to Turkey for her membership in a particular social group as a lesbian.\n[11] With respect to internal flight alternative, while states are presumed to be capable of protecting nationals, it is open for the claimant to rebut the presumption of protection with clear and convincing evidence that adequate protection would not reasonably be forthcoming. In this claim, the state is an agent of persecution and the objective evidence establishes that Turkey does not have effective mechanisms to protect citizens who are abused by police or security forces. In fact, on the contrary, the evidence indicates that police sometimes operate with impunity in Turkey.\n[12] The previous cited DOS report, items-, at item 2.1 states that in its executive summary, that Turkey suffers from official impunity and a weak administration of justice. Later in the same report it cites some instances of the disproportionate use of force by police against the LGBT community and police intimidation and harassment of the community. Having considered the claimant\u2019s testimony and the documentary evidence about the role and conduct of the police in Turkey, the Panel finds that the claimant has rebutted the presumption of adequate state protection as the state is the agent of persecution and still remains in control of its territory. The Panel further finds there is no reasonable internal flight alternative within Turkey for the claimant in her circumstances. The claimant testified that she should not live-, that she could not live openly as a lesbian woman alone in any place in Turkey without experiencing a fear of harm at the hands of either her family and also persuasive, in that she would also face societal discrimination.\n[13] In this case the Panel agrees, the situation of homophobia and insufficient state protection exists across the country, accordingly the Panel also finds, on a balance of probabilities, that there is no safe or reasonable internal flight alternative for the claimant in Turkey. The Panel finds that there is a serious possibility that the claimant would be persecuted upon her return to Turkey, based on her sexual orientation. Hence, her claim is accepted. [XXX] is recognized as a Convention Refugee pursuant to Section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

Riley\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Tina Hlimi\nCountry: Haiti\nRPD Number: TB8-20008\nATIP Number: A-2021-01124\nATIP Pages: 000137-000140\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: These are the reasons in relation to this claim. The reasons given orally today will be rendered into writing and the transcript of the reasons will be sent to the claimant and his lawyer within a matter of weeks.\nALLEGATIONS:\n[2] The claimant alleges that he is a citizen of Haiti. The claimant says that he is targeted by armed bandits associated with [XXX] the Mayor of [XXX]. He states that he was attacked in [XXX] 2018. He was told by the attacker to stop inciting the youth against the mayor of [XXX] and he was also accused of being a member of the opposition.\n[3] He left Haiti in [XXX] of 2018, spent approximately six weeks in the United States and came to Canada to claim refugee protection. The claimant alleges that the Government of Haiti will not protect him and that there is no safe place for him anywhere in Haiti.\nANALYSIS:\nIDENTITY:\n[4] The claimant provided his Haitian passport, a certified copy of which is found in Exhibit 1. The claimant also provided his birth certificate, a copy of which is found at page 7 at Exhibit 4 and his school records, copies of which are found at pages 2 to 6 of Exhibit 4.\n[5] The panel is satisfied as to the Haitian citizenship and the identity of this claimant.\nCREDIBILITY:\n[6] The testimony of the claimant was straightforward and reasonably consistent. The claimant may have exaggerated the role of the person he feared having promoted the deputy mayor to the position of Mayor, nevertheless this was a minor matter, overall the panel detected no serious contradictions or omissions.\n[7] The claimant\u2019s testimony that he promoted worthy deeds and thoughts in Haiti is worn out by music video he presented as well as his testimony. The claimant states that he and other students volunteered to clean up streets after it rained in [XXX]. The claimant was involved in donating books to an orphanage.\n[8] The music video showed the claimant performing a song with numerous images of young persons on the street and showing the classrooms where those young persons should be studying.\n[9] The video also demonstrated the claimant\u2019s commitment to encouraging the youth of Haiti to go to school. All of these good deeds appear on the surface to be non-controversial.\n[10] The reality is that the claimant\u2019s good intentions and his declarations were interpreted by the deputy mayor of [XXX] as being implicitly critical of the city administration. By engaging in the actions he did, the claimant was seen to be stating that the city administration was not up to doing it\u2019s job.\n[11] This is clear case of attribution of political opinions where perhaps none were originally intended.\n[12] The panel accepts the claimant\u2019s testimony that he could continue to write and perform songs about the social conditions in Haiti and that those in authority in Haiti could easily interpret such declarations as statements critical of those politicians who are not doing a good job for the benefit of other Haitians if he were to return to Haiti.\n[13] On a balance of probabilities, the testimony of the claimant is credible and trustworthy. Linked to Convention ground, the claimant\u2019s declarations and good deeds were an indirect expression of a political opinion, those good deeds are illustrated by the photos found at Exhibit 5 of the evidence.\n[14] The claimant\u2019s declarations and deeds were certainly interpreted as political opinions which were encountered to the opinions of those in power in [XXX].\n[15] The peaceful expression of that political opinion caused the claimant actual and prospective harm. Violence was committed against him, his life was threatened.\n[16] The panel is satisfied that this type of claim falls within the definition of a Convention refugee when he was under threat of persecution due to political opinion.\nDOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE:\n[17] The panel has paid attention to the Medical Report found at pages 16 to 18 of Exhibit 4 as well as the police report found at page 19 of Exhibit 4. These documents are supportive of the claimant\u2019s declaration that he was assaulted in late [XXX] 2018.\n[18] The claimant also provided support letters from various witnesses in Haiti, those letters are found at pages 9 to 11 of Exhibit 4 and they tend to corroborate the allegations of the claim, in short the documentary evidence supports the credibility of this claim.\nSTATE PROTECTION:\n[19] The agents of persecution belong to or are affiliated with a person in power namely the deputy mayor of the city of [XXX], the deputy mayor appears to have at her disposal a group of thugs who will engage in violent acts to punish those who are against her or who are perceived to be against her.\n[20] The documentary evidence indicates that the police in Haiti are known to be corruptible and not to be very good at protecting citizens from those in power.\n[21] The panel here is referring to the National Documentation Package. This claimant has no reasonable expectation of protection from persons in authority who are threatening him. It would not be reasonable for this claimant to seek State protection under these circumstances.\nINTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE:\n[22] The National Documentation Package also indicates that persons who are fleeing persecution within Haiti can easily be traced.\n[23] There is no satisfactory evidence that there would be, on a balance of probabilities, a safe place of refugee for this claimant within Haiti. The panel concludes that it would not be reasonable for this claimant to seek an internal flight alternative.\nCONCLUSION:\n[24] Having considered all of the evidence, the panel determines that the claimant has discharged his burden of establishing that there is serious possibility of persecution if he were to return to Haiti. The panel therefore concludes that the claimant, [XXX], is a Convention refugee by reason of his perceived political opinion and the Division accepts his claim and I wish you the very best in future, sir.\n[25] CLAIMANT: Thank you.\n[26] MEMBER: Thank you counsel for you assistance.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

Perhan\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Abba Chima\nCountry: Nigeria\nRPD Number: TB8-19949\nATIP Number: A-2021-01124\nATIP Pages: 000132-000136\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: This is the decision for [XXX] File number TB8-19949. I have had an opportunity to consider your testimony and examine the evidence before me and I am ready to render my decision orally. You will receive an unedited transcript of this decision in the mail, your counsel will also get a copy so if you have any questions you are welcome to ask him.\n[2] You claim to be a citizen of Nigeria and you are claiming refugee protection pursuant to Section 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[3] I find that you are a Convention refugee for the following reasons.\n[4] The allegations of your claim can be found in the basis of claim form and its amended version in Exhibit 2 and 5. The details were elaborated today in your testimony.\n[5] In summary you fear persecution in Nigeria due to your sexual orientation as a member of a particular social group namely because you are a lesbian.\n[6] Based on the type of claim I have carefully considered chair person\u2019s Guideline 9 relating to sexual orientation and gender identity and expression.\n[7] I find that your identity as a national of Nigeria has been established on a balance of probabilities both through your testimony and through the valid Nigerian passport which is presented, which was presented to us when you made your claim found in Exhibit 1. I find no reason to doubt the authenticity of that document.\n[8] In terms of your general credibility, I have found you to be a credible witness. You have testified in a straightforward manner and there were no relevant inconsistencies in your testimony or contradictions between your testimony and the other evidence before me.\n[9] I also find that there were no embellishments made within your testimony. Therefore I accept what you have alleged in support of your claim including the following.\n[10] As the central issue of your claim is sexual orientation I have put a lot of weight into your testimony about your past and current same sex partners in Canada.\n[11] You were able to present affidavits of support from your roommate, your former partner, your cousin, you current same sex partner in Exhibit 4. I find that these letters corroborated the key elements of your claim for protection namely your former and current same sex relationships in Canada as well as when your family members became aware of your sexual orientation and how it affected your decision to stay permanently in Canada.\n[12] You also presented a witness in this claim who you have alleged to be your current same sex partner. I know that she herself was apparently a successful refugee claimant on the issue of sexual orientation where you appeared as her witness.\n[13] She testified at today\u2019s hearing for you, her general oral had almost no inconsistencies. Your partner seemed very nervous and stressed, when she was asked why she was unable to speak freely she admitted that she was very stressed for you and she was afraid to lose you in case the decision for your claim was negative. I find it is a reasonable explanation for situations like yours today.\n[14] But in general you seem to know your partner well and spend a lot of time with her. You celebrated holidays together, you have plans for the future and you talk freely about each other\u2019s likes and dislikes as well as preferences.\n[15] You also detailed in your testimony your involvement in LGBTQ communities since coming to Canada. You presented attendance log and orientation training record from the 519 in exhibit 4. Though you did attend 519 only briefly but you explained that you felt this was more a place for newcomers and you have been in Canada for awhile. In addition you started working late shifts and were unable to make it to the meetings.\n[16] I find that your testimony about participation in the pride festivities over the past two years adds to the credibility of your allegations especially in regards to your motivation to do so based on your described past in Nigeria.\n[17] At the same time you have been living in Canada since 2007 either as a student or with a work permit. I understand the delay is not the determinative issue in any claim especially because you did have status in Canada up until the end of 2016.\n[18] However I do draw a negative inference from a two year delay in applying for refugee protection since you did not have status in Canada for the last two years.\n[19] I find however you provided a reasonable explanation as to why you did not seek refugee protection sooner. You did consult two lawyers during that time who helped you to try to extend your work visa in Canada twice but you were refused and the lawyers advised you to return to Nigeria to reapply from there.\n[20] Because of social, excuse me because of your sexual orientation you decided to remain in Canada without status up until 2018 when your current partner advised you to claim refugee protection.\n[21] Therefore I find that on a balance of probabilities you are a lesbian and that you have a subjective fear of returning to Nigeria.\n[22] I find that there is a link between what you fear and one of the five convention grounds. As I noted earlier the convention ground for you claim is particular social group, so I accept on a balance of probabilities that you are indeed a lesbian.\n[23] The overall objective evidence supports your claim for convention refugee protection based on the membership in a particular social group.\n[24] The national documentation package we have for Nigeria in Exhibit, in Exhibit 3 says that same sex relationships are criminalized in Nigeria. There is a same sex marriage prohibition act enacted in the months of January 2014 and it effectively renders illegal all forms of activity supporting or promoting LGBTQ rights.\n[25] According to item 2.1 in the NDP the government has formal charges for same sex relationships anyone who is convicted or aiding or assisting homosexual activities faces a punishment of ten years in prison. Anyone convicted of entering into a same sex marriage or civil union may be sentenced to up to fourteen years in prison.\n[26] Items 6.7 indicates that any sexual orientation that is not heterosexual is considered to be unnatural, demonic and immoral in Nigeria.\n[27] Based on these personal circumstances and the country conditions in Nigeria I find that you have an objective basis to your claim. You fear the police and state and authorities in Nigeria.\n[28] I find that it would be objectively unreasonable for you to seek the protection of the authorities in Nigeria in your particular set of circumstances. Adequate state protection would not be available to you as you fear the state.\n[29] With regards to possible viable internal flight alternatives in Nigeria, given the laws, the federal laws of Nigeria criminalizing same sex relations applicable, that they are applicable throughout Nigeria I find there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout Nigeria for you and therefore a viable internal flight alternative does not exist for you in Nigeria.\n[30] Having considered all the evidence I find here is a serious possibility that you would face persecution in Nigeria pursuant to Section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. I conclude that you are a Convention refugee based on your membership in a particular social group namely as a lesbian and I therefore accept your claim.\n[31] CLAIMANT: Thank you so much.\n[32] MEMBER: Thank you. Okay so this is the end.\n[33] COUNSEL: Thank you madam member.\n[34] CLAIMANT: Thank you\n[35] MEMBER: In your life in Canada now in the permanent status. Goodluck. I am going off the record.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

Can I interrupt for just one moment? [XXX], I know you have a little bit of difficulty expressing yourself, but your English is quite good in terms of understanding.\n[4] CLAIMANT: Sometime.\n[5] COUNSEL: Do you need the Interpreter to translate the decision, or\u2026\n[6] CLAIMANT: No. Yes. It is okay.\n[7] INTERPRETER: It is okay?\n[8] CLAIMANT: Yes.\n[9] INTERPRETER: So, I do not have to translate.\n[10] CLAIMANT: No.\n[11] COUNSEL: Yes. I do not think she needs the Interpreter to translate.\n[12] MEMBER: Okay.\n[13] COUNSEL: She is quite, quite, good at understanding English.\n[14] MEMBER: The principal Claimant was designated representative for the minor Claimants.\n[15] The Minister intervened in this case on credibility grounds, but withdrew the intervention shortly before the hearing. Minister\u2019s Counsel did not appear at the hearing.\n[16] I am satisfied that the Claimants are citizens of Pakistan, and as to their personal identity based on their passports which can be found in Exhibit 1.\n[17] The details of the allegations appear in the answers to the principal Claimant\u2019s basis of claim form, which is Exhibit 2.1, and were elaborated upon by her in oral testimony during the hearing this afternoon.\n[18] The central allegations of a much longer narrative are the following.\n[19] The Claimants are practicing members of the Ahmadi faith. They have suffered a history of persecution in Pakistan because of their faith, including severe restrictions on their freedom of worship, ostracism, vandalism, assault, verbal abuse, threats, and harassment. Their Ahmadi relatives have also been persecuted.\n[20] They therefore came to Canada on temporary resident visas in mid June 2018, and initiated these in-land refugee protection claims shortly after their arrival. They are afraid of further religious persecution if they return to Pakistan, and that they will not be able to freely practice their religion.\n[21] For the following reasons I find that the Claimants are Convention refugees.\n[22] The affirmed testimony of refugee claimants is presumed to be true, unless it is internally inconsistent, inherently implausible, or contradicted by country documents. In this regard, I am relying on the Federal Court of Appeal decision in Maldonado. There was no such fault with the principal Claimant\u2019s testimony in the hearing this afternoon.\n[23] Furthermore, the Claimants Ahmadi religion and the rest of the allegations in the case are confirmed by a substantial number of personal documents that I do not have sufficient reason to discount, including their passports indicating that they are Ahmadis, a travel permission from the minor Claimants\u2019 father, a reliable Ahmadi certificate, Ahmadi identity cards, Ahmadi donation receipts, other Ahmadi documents, claim specific news reports, and a letter from the [XXX]. These documents can be found in Exhibits 1, 7, and 9.\n[24] Furthermore, the principal Claimant displayed reasonable knowledge of the Ahmadi faith in response to the religious knowledge questions I asked her during the hearing. I therefore find that the principal Claimant is a credible witness, that the Claimants are practicing members of the Ahmadi faith, and all of the rest of the allegations in this case are also true on a balance of probabilities.\n[25] Based on the credible allegations and the documentary evidence on country conditions before me, which can be found in Sections 1, 2, and 12 of Exhibit 3, which is the National Documentation Package for Pakistan for January 31, 2019, as well as in Claimant Exhibits 7 and 9, I am following Jurisprudential Guide TB7-01837 which holds that practicing members of the Ahmadi faith, like the Claimants, have a well-founded fear of persecution in Pakistan by reason of their Ahmadi religion, that adequate State protection is not available to them, and that they do not have viable internal flight alternatives.\n[26] I therefore conclude that the Claimants are Convention refugees. The claims are therefore accepted. Thank you for coming.\n[27] COUNSEL: Thank you very much.\n[28] CLAIMANT: Thank you.\n[29] MEMBER: Good afternoon.\n[30] INTERPRETER: Thank you, Mr. Member.\n[31] COUNSEL: So, I will give you your documents back, the originals.

You are claiming to be citizens of lran and are claiming refugee protection pursuant to Sections 6 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[13] The panel finds that the claimant\u2019s face serious possibility of persecution on the grounds of particular social group to victims of domestic abuse or gender violence or women\u2019s discriminatory moves against women making you both Convention refugees.\nALLEGATIONS:\n[14] The principal claimant alleges that they are citizens of lran, the principal claimant alleges that if the claimant\u2019s should return Iran they will suffer persecution by the state due to being a member of a particular social group as women fleeing gender related violence or discrimination against women.\nIDENTITY:\n[15] The claimant\u2019s personal identity and citizenships as citizens of Iran are accepted on a balance of probabilities. The finding is based on your testimony and the supporting documentation namely Exhibit 1 the passports and the national identity documents.\nNEXUS:\n[16] The panel finds that there is a link between what the claimant\u2019s fear state persecution and gender violence, gender discrimination and one of the five convention grounds namely a particular social group and therefore the group assessed the claims under Section 96.\nCREDIBILITY AND FINDINGS OF FACT:\n[17] The sworn evidence of the claimant is presumed true unless there\u2019s a valid reason to doubt the veracity of the basis of claim form. Since the claim involves allegations regarding gender related persecution the panel considered the chair person\u2019s guidelines on women refugees fearing gender related persecution.\n[18] The guidelines assist in assessing the key evidentiary elements in determining the harm and behaviour of women facing domestic violence. The panel found the principal claimant to be a credible witness and the panel therefore believes what you have alleged in your oral testimony and in your basis of claim form.\n[19] You especially face gender related violence in an escalating amount and had no state protection and indeed later your husband accused you of adultery a stoning offence.\n[20] The claimant presented as a candid honest and forthright witness in particular in oral evidence the claimant waves her dowry(ph) rights to secure permission to leave her country.\n[21] Dowry(ph) rights are the obligations of the husband to pay to the wife a certain amount of money to ensure the quick pro quo for the waiver it was witnessed by two individuals and the exchange of promises the quick pro quo was reduced into writing and registered.\n[22] The husband about a month later changed his mind and revoked the permission to remove the child from the country, the claimant retained a lawyer and sued and the husband withdrew the objection and consequently they were both able to leave.\n[23] None of these details were in the basis of claim forms as it was not relevant but such detail and plausibility buttress the claims of their testimony. Furthermore the documentary evidence especially Exhibit 5 also supported the oral testimony.\nTHE FINDINGS OF FACT:\n[24] The panel finds for the following facts 1.) the principal claimant is a woman, born Muslim and now an atheist, refuses to wear a Hijab, was repeatedly beaten and raped by her husband for her religious behaviour and sexual refusals, her husband had slandered her by accusing her of adultery, adultery is an offence punishable by stoning in Iran.\n[25] In the absence of the mother the minor claimant would be handed over to the (inaudible) side of the family which is (inaudible) orthodox dismissive of women, would no doubt repeatedly remind the daughter that her mother was a whore and an apostate and raised in a society where women for cultural and religious reasons are denied full human rights and the right to choose.\n[26] The crux of the claim is the claimant\u2019s social group namely women fearing gender related violence and lack of human rights for any women resulting in forced adherence to religious tenets and attendant punishments ecclesiastic offences such as adultery.\n[27] The panel therefore firstly finds that the claimant\u2019s subjective fear of harm is established by her credible testimony and the panel believes what she has alleged. Your social membership as a woman in a gender, subject to gender violence without state protection will lead to your persecution and imprisonment as well as the accusation of adultery.\n[28] Secondly there\u2019s an objective basis for the claimant\u2019s fear based on the fact that women suffer imprisonment, lashes and death for ecclesiastic offences and domestic violence is not deemed criminal.\n[29] In support of this and the statement that Iran is an authoritarian theocracy I quote from the national data package the NDP 1.7 Home Office report, 1.9 Adultery, 1.23 Domestic violence, 5.1 Iranian women annual report, 5.3 Violence against women, 5.9 Attacks on women sexual and reproductive rights, 5.11 Women, children LGB and disabled moral crimes.\n[30] I also note that atheist is subject to the death penalty here I quote Exhibit 5 Pages 57 to 74. Consequently the panel finds that together there\u2019s a well founded fear of persecution against both claimant\u2019s.\nSTATE PROTECTION:\n[31] Both the state and the husband and his family here are the agents of harm, the state with respect to the allegations of adultery, the husband for domestic abuse. In the ladder instance there\u2019s no protection for women suffering from domestic violence. In the former instance the state enforces religious tenets on women concerning belief, dress and punishment including capital punishment.\n[32] This is a matter of not of mere rogue agents or geographically restricted actions the persecution is throughout the state, state protection is therefore not feasible.\n[33] The NDP coupled to the evidence adduced provides clear and convincing evidence that rebuts the presumption of adequate state protection. Consequently the panel finds that there is no state protection for the claimants.\nINTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE:\n[34] The panel has also considered whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for you. The claimant must face a serious possibility of persecution in all parts of the state; the state poses the threat to the claimant with respect to the adultery charges.\n[35] There is no safe location for women anywhere in Iran. Therefore there is no viable IFA.\nCONCLUSION:\n[36] Based on the totality of the of the evidence the panel finds that both claimant\u2019s face a serious possibility of persecution in Iran due to membership in a social group be it gender related violence, be it denial of human rights to women.\n[37] Consequently the panel finds that the claimant\u2019s both the mother and child to be Convention refugees and the panel accepts your claims.\n[38] Thank you.\n",

Your first relationship was with [XXX] when you were 24. It lasted more than one year and ended after you were attacked on [XXX], 2017, by local vigilantes or local police who were tipped off by your stepdad. You ended that relationship because you wished to spare [XXX] from exposure due to his relationship with you. You then had a subsequent relationship with [XXX] which ended when you left for Canada on a student visa. Just before leaving you experienced other attacks. You made a claim for protection at the airport.\nDETERMINATION\n[4] I find that you are a Convention refugee as you have established a serious possibility of persecution should you return to Nigeria based on the grounds in section 96.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[5] I find that your identity as a national of Nigeria is established by the documents provided, your passport with student visa.\nNexus\n[6] I find that you have established a nexus to section 96 by reason of your sexual orientation as a gay man in Nigeria.\nCredibility\n[7] Based on the documents in the file and your testimony, I have noted no serious credibility issues. In particular, the evidence establishes the allegations as set out above. You provided a medical report and corroborating letters. After reviewing the documents and the testimony, I have no reasons to doubt their authenticity.\nObjective basis of future risk\n[8] Based on the credibility of your allegations, and the documentary evidence set out below, I find that you have established a future risk that you will be subjected to the following harm. The claimant faces a risk of further exposure in Nigeria and possibility of vigilante attacks and arrests because homosexuality is criminalized.\n[9] The fact that you face this risk is corroborated by the following documents: National Documentation Package (NDP) for Nigeria \u2013 April 30, 2019, items 1.3, 2.1, 6.1, 6.2 and 6.4.\nNature of the harm\n[10] This harm clearly amounts to persecution.\nState protection\n[11] I find that it would be objectively unreasonable for you to seek the protection of the state in light of your particular circumstances. You were attacked by local police.\nInternal flight alternative\n[12] I have considered whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for you. On the evidence before me, I find that there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout Nigeria. As homosexuality is criminalized in Nigeria, there is no viable internal flight alternative.\nCONCLUSION\n[13] Based on the analysis above, I conclude that you are a Convention refugee. Accordingly, I accept your claim.\n(signed) Harvey Savage\nMay 13, 2019\n",

To summarize, the principal claimant fears persecution by corrupt state actors on the basis of her political opinion and her work as a [XXX] in Mexico. The associate claimant fears persecution as the spouse of the principal claimant and also a risk to his life or of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment by the same corrupt state actors.\nDETERMINATION\n[3] I find that the principal claimant is a Convention Refugee pursuant to s. 96 of the IRPA, as she faces a serious possibility of persecution on account of her member in a particular social [XXX]. I also find that the associate claimant is a Convention refugee on the basis of membership in a particular social group, a family member of a [XXX], as the spouse of the principal claimant.\nIDENTITY\n[4] The claimants have established their identities as nationals of Mexico by their Mexican passports3.\nANALYSIS\nCredibility\n[5] The claimants were credible witnesses. Their evidence was logical, consistent and free from material contradictions, omissions or implausibility. They offered spontaneous details without prompting and were both highly articulate when discussing specifics. The principal claimant in particular was impressive when discussing her passion for [XXX] and the ideals of freedom of expression, despite her young age.\n[6] As such, I make the following findings of fact:\na. The principal claimant was a journalist in Mexico. She started her career in 2011 while she was still in University. She began working as a [XXX] but felt that she was only being used to attract men to the publication and not for her intellect, so she subsequently began working for [XXX] in or around 2017;\nb. In 2016, the associate claimant began working for the [XXX] in the state of [XXX]. After working for the [XXX] for a short time, in or around [XXX] of 2016 the associate claimant was approached by his superior and told he was being considered for an \u201cunder the table\u201d supervisor position. All he had to do was to fudge some numbers and sign off on the invoices;\nc. The associate claimant was not comfortable in doing this because he knew it was wrong and so discussed the offer with his spouse. The principal claimant saw this as an opportunity to have her work taken seriously and to expose corruption within the [XXX] and so they attempted to collect further information and further details of the scheme;\nd. The associate claimant testified that his superior [XXX] wanted him to call the vendors of supplies to the [XXX] and modify the invoices, effectively engaging in \u201cmoney laundering\u201d. In order to not arouse suspicion, the associate claimant played along for a while, in order to gather more evidence for the principal claimant to write her story;\ne. The principal claimant wrote a draft of the article, which was never published.4 She testified that she shared her notes with only four people. Her editor warned her to be careful because of what she was getting involved in, but did not discourage her from investigating and writing the article;\nf. The day before the [XXX] 2016 holidays, after work the associate claimant was leaving work to pick up his spouse when he was cut off by two vehicles. Armed men exited one of the vehicles, surrounded the claimant and threw him to the ground. They put a gun to his head and told him that if the principal claimant published her article on the Health Ministry fraud, that they would gang rape her in front of the associate claimant, chop her up into pieces and the burn the associate claimant to ashes;\ng. The claimants agreed that the associate claimant would play along and pretend to call vendors and pretend to cooperate so that his employers who were watching him would not suspect anything untoward;\nh. The claimants then left Mexico on [XXX], 2017 and came to Canada. They did not claim refugee status until April 3, 2018 when the associate claimant was detained by Ontario Provincial Police during a traffic stop.\nNEXUS\n[7] I find that the principal claimant [XXX] has multiple nexuses to the Convention. Counsel argued that she faces persecution on account of her political opinion, given that the fraud and corruption she has uncovered is directly tied to the government of [XXX]. She also faces persecution on account of her gender as a woman in Mexico who has been threatened with sexual violence. Lastly, counsel submits that she is a journalist and faces persecution on that basis and which is a particular social group under s. 96.\n[8] For the purposes of this decision I will conduct my analysis on the basis of her membership in a particular social group, journalists.\n[9] The associate claimant also has multiple nexuses to the Convention. I will conduct my analysis on the basis of his membership in a particular social group, the family member of a [XXX].\nWELL FOUNDED FEAR OF PERSECUTION\nSubjective Fear\n[10] The claimants each fear persecution on a Convention ground. The principal claimant fears sexual violence and death on account her work as a journalist to expose corruption within the [XXX].\n[11] The associate claimant fears torture and death on account of his refusal to engage in the same corruption but also as retaliation for his common-law partner\u2019s [XXX].\n[12] The claimants knowingly remained in Canada for over a year before claiming refugee status. It was only the associate claimant\u2019s arrest in [XXX] of 2018 following a traffic stop that prompted them to make their asylum claim. Such a delay is assessed vis-a-vis the claimants\u2019 credibility and subjective fear5.\n[13] The principal claimant testified that they did not intend to remain in Canada, but rather were hoping to return to Mexico after the Federal election (which resulted in the victory of Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador). Unfortunately, the claimant says that the election did not spur positive change vis-a-vis the protection of journalists and combatting institutional corruption, and therefore claiming refugee status was a last resort.\n[14] Given that I found the claimants to be very credible, I accepted this explanation and made no adverse finding regarding their credibility. I accept that the claimants subjectively fear persecution on Convention grounds if they returned to Mexico.\nObjective Basis\n[15] The principal claimant\u2019s article on the fraud at the Health Ministry was never published, though she testified that she did attempt to have it published. She provided a copy to me in the claimants\u2019 disclosure package.6 The principal claimant testified that only four people knew about that article, and yet someone with an interest in preventing its publication was informed of its existence which then prompted a violent attack and threats of death against the associate claimant.\n[16] I have already found the claimants to be credible. Therefore, the only reasonable inference I can draw is that one of those four people at [XXX] leaked the existence of that article to corrupt actors in the [XXX], who then directed armed men to intercept and threaten the associate claimant.\n[17] Corruption is endemic throughout all levels of government in Mexico. The NDP for Mexico paints a bleak picture of the police, prosecution and security services overall. For example, item 9.6 describes how some members of the Public Ministry will not even register a complaint without first receiving a bribe.7\n[18] Item 9.108 highlights the following about the Mexican political and judicial system:\nAt least 14 former or current governors are currently under investigation for corruption, some of them for colluding with the organized crime groups that are largely responsible for Mexico\u2019s rising violence. 1 In 2017, Mexico placed last among OECD countries in Transparency International \u2018s Corruption Perceptions Index, with an overall ranking of 135 out of 180 countries, putting it in the company of Honduras, Paraguay, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, and others.\nBlatant corruption and government abuse in a moment of such extreme violence has greatly weakened Mexicans\u2019 confidence in public institutions. A September 2017 Pew Research Center survey found corruption to be Mexicans\u2019 top public concern, with 84 percent of those surveyed saying corrupt political leaders were a \u201cvery big problem\u201d in their country and 79 percent saying the same about corrupt police officers-up 12 and 9 percent, respectively, from 2015.\nHigh public perception of corruption extends into the judicial sector as well: as seen in Figure 1, Mexico\u2019s most recent national victimization survey suggests over 60 percent of the population perceives the country\u2019s prosecutors and judges as corrupt.\nAccording to the same victimization survey, an estimated 94 percent of crimes in Mexico are never reported or investigated, primarily because victims distrust authorities or because they believe reporting crimes is a waste of time. This fuels violence and impunity, as any crime that goes unreported also goes unpunished, allowing criminal groups and corrupt officials to perpetrate crimes without fear of being held accountable. In 2017, Mexico had the fourth highest impunity index on the Global Impunity Index, and it ranked first out of the 21 countries in the Americas that were analyzed.\n[19] In considering all of the evidence available to me, I find that the claimants have established an objective basis for their fear of persecution in Mexico.\nSTATE PROTECTION\n[20] There is a presumption that, except in situations where the state is in complete breakdown, the state is capable of protecting its citizens. The presumption that a state is capable of protecting its citizens underscores the principle that international protection comes into play only when a refugee claimant has no other recourse available9. Having canvassed the country conditions documents, the panel finds that the Mexican government is in effective control of its territory and has in place a functioning security force to uphold the laws and constitution of the country10. Therefore, the burden of attempting to show that one should not be required to exhaust all avenues of domestic recourse is a heavy one11.\n[21] The documentary evidence before me indicates that Mexico is a democracy, and there are free and fair elections. There is a relatively independent and impartial judiciary. Therefore, in countries such as Mexico the claimant must do more than merely show that he or she went to see members of the police force and that those efforts were unsuccessful.\n[22] There is a high incidence of violence in Mexico. The violence is largely attributable to drug trafficking and organized crime. While there is corruption in Mexico, the government is making efforts to deal with this problem12.\n[23] However, though the state of Mexico may have the best of intentions and has the appropriate laws in place, the concern for the panel is the operational adequacy of those efforts in providing adequate state protection. Based on all of the materials available to me, it is evident that Mexico is simply unable to protect journalists from persecution, torture or death.\n[24] For example, item 2.1 of the Mexico NDP contains a human rights report issued by the U.S. Department of State13 and I note the following passage:\nHuman rights issues included reports of the involvement by police, military, and other state officials, sometimes in coordination with criminal organizations, in unlawful or arbitrary killings, forced disappearance, torture, and arbitrary detention by both government and illegal armed groups; harsh and life-threatening prison conditions in some prisons; impunity for violence against journalists and state and local censorship and criminal libel; and violence targeting lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex (LGBTI) persons.\nImpunity for human rights abuses remained a problem, with extremely low rates of prosecution for all forms of crimes. The government\u2019s federal statistics agency (INEGI) estimated 94 percent of crimes were either unreported or not investigated.\nThe same document14 at page 15, states the following:\nViolence and Harassment: Journalists were murdered or subject to physical attacks, harassment, and intimidation (especially by state agents and transnational criminal organizations) due to their reporting. This limited media\u2019s ability to investigate and report, since many of the reporters who were killed covered crime, corruption, and local politics. According to the NGO Article 19, as of December 5, nine journalists had been killed because of their reporting.\nPerpetrators of violence against journalists acted with impunity. According to Article 19, as of August the impunity rate for crimes against journalists was 99.7 percent. In 2017 there were 507 attacks against journalists, according to Article 19. Since its creation in 2010, the Office of the Special Prosecutor for Crimes Against Journalists (FEADLE), a PGR unit, won only eight convictions, and none for murder, in the more than 2,000 cases it investigated. On August 25, FEADLE won its first conviction in the new justice system, obtaining a sentence against Tabasco state police officers for illegally detaining a journalist because of his reporting.\nGovernment officials believed organized crime to be behind most of these attacks, but NGOs asserted there were instances when local government authorities participated in or condoned the acts. According to Article 19, in the last five years, 48 percent of physical attacks against journalists originated with public officials. Although 75 percent of those came from state or local officials, federal officials and members of the armed forces were also suspected of being behind attacks against journalists.\n[25] Furthermore, in this claim the agents of persecution are apparently acting at the behest of rogue state actors. Where the agent of persecution is the state itself or acting at the behest of corrupt state actors, there is no state protection. Furthermore, where the failure of state to protect its citizens forms a broader pattern of failure throughout the country, the inadequacy of state protection is made out.15\n[26] In considering all of the evidence presented, particularly the objective country documentation which supports the testimony of the principal claimant, I find that on a balance of probabilities, state protection for this claimant is inadequate and would not be reasonably forthcoming. I further find that had the claimants approached the authorities for protection, that they would be putting their lives at risk.\nINTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE\n[27] I proposed Merida, Yucatan as a potential internal flight alternative for the claimants. Merida is almost 1800 kilometres or a 23 hour drive from [XXX], where the claimants resided.\n[28] I asked the principal claimant if she could move to Merida and be safe. She replied as follows:\n\u201cNo, because I am [XXX] and that is not going to change. That\u2019s what I studied for and worked so hard for and I am not going to throw that away. I always try to expose the truth and expose the power they have. They [NDP for Mexico] can say its [Merida] safe but cannot guarantee your safety regardless of what your career may be\u201d.\n[29] Given that the claimants fear corrupt state actors because of their knowledge of a misuse of public funds, I find on a balance of probabilities that the agents of persecution would have both the desire and the means to locate the claimants throughout Mexico.\n[30] Furthermore, I find that the principal claimant would not cease her [XXX] work. It is a fundamental part of her identity and is clearly important to her. The objective evidence strongly supports the conclusion that journalists are subject to persecution everywhere in Mexico and therefore the principal claimant faces a serious possibility of persecution everywhere in Mexico.\n[31] The associate claimant is going to follow his common law spouse wherever she goes. He faces a similar risk of violence, torture or death as a consequence of her work as journalist and I find that there is no viable IFA in Mexico which is both safe and reasonable for him as well.\nCONCLUSION\n[32] I find that the principal claimant is Convention refugee as she faces a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground, as a member of a particular social group \u2013 [XXX], on a forward-looking basis. Her claim is accepted.\n[33] I similarly find that the associate claimant is a Convention refugee as he faces a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground, as a member of a particular social group \u2013 the family of a [XXX], on a forward-looking basis. His claim is also accepted.\n(signed) David D\u2019Intino\nAugust 30, 2019\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), SC 2001, c 27, as amended.\n2 Exhibit 2.1.\n3 Exhibit 1.\n4 Exhibit 4.\n5 Toure v.

        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2019 RLLR 14\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: December 18, 2019\nPanel: Teresa Maziarz\nCounsel for the claimant(s): Jordan Duviner\nCountry: China\nRPD Number: TB8-14763\nATIP Number: A-2020-01124\nATIP Pages: 0000104-0000108\n[1] MEMBER: This is the decision of the Refugee Protection Division in the claim relating to File Number TB8-14763, and to the Claimant, who is [XXX], [XXX]. The Panel has heard the claim at two sittings, on September 23rd, 2019 and December 18th, 2019, and is prepared to make a decision in the claim that is favourable to the Claimant.\n[2] The Panel finds that the Claimant is a Convention refugee in accordance with section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. Given this decision, the Panel will not provide an analysis with regard to section 97(1) of the Act.\n[3] The Panel makes the decision in favour of the Claimant because she meets all of the elements of the definition of a Convention refugee.\n[4] Starting firstly with the unspoken element of identity, the Claimant has produced ample evidence of who she is in terms of her name and date of birth and country of citizenship of China, which includes a certified true copy of her passport that is found in Exhibit 1, the original of which has been seized by authorities when she made her claim for refugee protection in Canada. There are other supplementary documents which support her identity, as is noted in the exhibits.\n[5] The Panel did have a concern that her Canadian visa application provides a different account in terms of who her husband is and her family structure and her educational and work history. The Panel accepts on a balance of probabilities that it does not materially undermine the Claimant\u2019s account of her identity. The Panel notes that in terms of her own identity, the application was made in the same name and date of birth and country of citizenship, and the Panel finds on a balance of probability that the other information was amended as she testified for the purpose of enhancing the likelihood of obtaining a Canadian visa in circumstances in which she was fearing persecution.\n[6] I would note in this regard, also, that having described herself as a XXXX in the Canadian visa application. And without any offence to the Claimant, she did not come across as a sophisticated witness who is indeed someone in that profession. Having said that, while she did not have such sophistication, she was eloquent in regard to her religious belief, and I\u2019ll turn to that later.\n[7] The Claimant also satisfies the element of nexus in that she has established credibly a Basis of Claim that relates to the ground of religion. Specifically, the Claimant is an adherent of the Church of Almighty God, which is banned in China, and in that regard, she provided credible and trustworthy evidence in support of her faith. As noted in counsel\u2019s submissions, she had a wealth of knowledge of the basis of her faith and she has letters of support that indicate she is an adherent of that faith, including a letter from one of the leaders of the faith in Canada, who discusses in his letter a verification process that the Claimant underwent.\n[8] The Claimant also had a witness who came and testified about how they hold meetings of worship in Canada, and that information was substantially consistent with the information provided by the Claimant. It was the witness\u2019s opinion that the Claimant is a genuine worshipper of the faith of the Church of Almighty God, and while that is a decision for the Panel to determine, it\u2019s still relevant testimony to consider the opinion of a worshipper of the same faith who attends the same meetings, as does the Claimant, in Canada at the same place of worship and location.\n[9] While the Claimant had some difficulty in terms of identifying some aspects of the Church of Almighty God as stated in her disclosures, I find that in the context of all of her knowledge that those concerns are remedied and are not determinative of the issue of credibility or of the issue of her genuineness of her faith. For example, I had asked \u2014 the Panel had asked at the first and second sittings about the view of the Church of Almighty God in regard to the Communist Party, and the answer provided, as I reflect further on the testimony, responded to what the church thinks in China of how the Communist Party treats its adherents, and so the Claimant went on to discuss how adherents are jailed, maltreated, et cetera. Further questions did not elicit the information that is in her disclosure; however, when counsel asked the question another way in terms of what name does the Church of Almighty God give to the Communist Party, the Claimant did answer correctly that it calls the Communist Party the Red Dragon.\n[10] The Panel was also concerned that the Claimant was unable to discuss what is said to be, in her disclosure, a core tenet of the Church of Almighty God, and that is to participate in essentially battling the Communist Party. I accept that the Claimant understood the question to be in terms of physically slaying Communist members of the government, which is against their core belief.\n[11] So those are just two examples. There were others, but as the Panel notes, in the context of the totality of the evidence of the Claimant\u2019s knowledge of this faith, those concerns are no longer determinative of the claim and of the issue of credibility.\n[12] The Claimant has also continued her faith in Canada, and that is supported by, again, the witness who testified, by her own consistent testimony, by the letters of support, by the letter of one of the leaders of the church in Canada, and by the photographs that have been provided, as well as, earlier noted, her knowledge.\n[13] Turning to the element of the definition of a Convention refugee relating to prospective risk, the Claimant has credibly established on a balance of probabilities that she would face a reasonable chance of persecution in China if she were to return to that country. And while I have kept the videos or snapshots of the videos that were provided in her disclosure, I don\u2019t make the finding on that basis. I make the finding on the basis that the Claimant has shown credibly on a balance of probabilities that she is a genuine adherent of the Church of Almighty God and that it is not reasonable to expect that she drop that faith and return to China, and also, the totality of her evidence shows that she would indeed continue in that faith, and as an adherent of that faith she would therefore be persecuted if she returned to China.\n[14] Now, I did consider the possibility of the Claimant\u2019s activities in Canada coming to light to the Chinese authorities, and I have considered their response to information requests in that regard and other objective evidence in the disclosures, but I don\u2019t find that to be a determinative factor because I don\u2019t have sufficient evidence on a balance of probabilities to find that she would be identified from the snaps of the videos that are shown in Exhibit 6, wherein she does not appear to be named, and the name that is on those snaps has been placed after their printing for my benefit so that \u2014 or whoever the Panel were to have been \u2014 so that the Panel would know that she is in those snaps of the video. And in any case, it\u2019s her genuineness and the likelihood that she would continue her genuine faith in the Church of Almighty God if she were to return to China that raises and meets the risk of a reasonable chance of persecution from Chinese authorities.\n[15] So turning to the matter of state protection. Given that the state is the agent of persecution, as is well-documented in the National Documentation Package for China, and in counsel\u2019s and the Claimant\u2019s own disclosures, there is no possibility of the Claimant receiving adequate state protection at the operational level relevant to her personal circumstances as a genuine adherent of the Church of Almighty God, and so therefore, that aspect of the definition of the \u2014 of a Convention refugee is also met.\n[16] Just to give one example from the Claimant\u2019s evidence: There is, in Exhibit 6, starting at page 15, evidence from a professor from the University of Nevada that talks about the church in China. And that\u2019s one example, but from what I understand is that if someone is indeed a genuine member of the Church of Almighty God then these documents support the reasonable chance of persecution of such members in China, as does, of course, the National Documentation Package that I\u2019ve mentioned.\n[17] Turning to the matter of internal flight alternative. I find that because the state is the agent of persecution and has the means to find the Claimant in every part of the country, especially given that she would continue to express her faith as a member of the Church of Almighty God were she returned to China, that there is no viable internal flight alternative for her in China.\n[18] And \u2014 so I\u2019ve given further consideration to the file and to some more testimony, but I believe that I have reviewed everything for the decision that is relevant to support the finding of the Claimant being a Convention refugee. Of course, the Panel\u2019s examples are truncated and the record will speak for itself, not only in terms of the objective evidence, but also the Claimant\u2019s testimony that demonstrates her genuine faith in the Church of Almighty God.\n[19] So for all of these reasons, I find that the Claimant is a Convention refugee in accordance with section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, and that her claim is allowed.\n[20] Thank you, everyone for your participation. This hearing is concluded.\n\u2014 HEARING ADJOURNED\n",

        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2019 RLLR 13\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: July 9, 2019\nPanel: M. Vega\nCounsel for the claimant(s): Ian Wong\nCountry: Pakistan\nRPD Number: TB8-13766\nATIP Number: A-2020-01124\nATIP Pages: 000099-0000103\n[1] MEMBER: This is the oral decision in the case with respect to [XXX], file number TB8-13766. I have considered your testimony, Mr. [XXX], and I\u2019m now ready to render a decision in this case. Okay.\n[2] You have made a claim to be a citizen of Pakistan and you are claiming refugee protection pursuant to Sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. I find that you are a convention refugee for the following reasons:\n[3] Your allegations are found in your basis of claim form in summary and I won\u2019t repeat them all. Basically, you were born into a Sunni family and you, yourself, partly because of your career as a [XXX], you became \u2014 and also because you were brought up to believe that \u2014 by your father that other \u2014 that religions were to be treated well, all of them, you become exposed to the Shia faith or the Shia sect of Islam and became friends with someone who was involved in the Shia faith and whose uncle was a guardian of one of the prominent imambargahs in Lahore.\n[4] And through this friendship you started answering questions, you started believing that this was the right path and that it was the right path for you. And you then converted in \u2014 first major interest known in 2016 and in 2017 you formally converted at the imambargah where this friend had taken you to.\n[5] And when this became known to your family, and this became known as a result of a beating that you received by extremist persons who had become aware of your being a convert to the Shia sect, and they beat you up.\n[6] And this was one of several encounters that you subsequently had with extremists associated to either the Sipah-e-Sahaba or the Lashkar-e-Jhangvi \u2014 and I\u2019ll refer to the Lashkar-e-Jhangvi from now on as the LEJ and the Sipah-e-Sahaba as the SSP. Okay?\n[7] So basically, your family members became aware of your conversion. They were very angry with you. All the family was angry, as were your friends who were also Sunnis, including your employer who was not happy about it either.\n[8] It would appear that the only \u2014 but despite their anger, you still were able to find some assistance from these family members \u2014 from some, with the exception of your eldest brother who is very involved in politics as he\u2019s \u2014 give me a second.\n[9] Your brother has continued to be involved and to contest elections as recently as 2018. In your basis of claim form, you had indicated that this brother, Shabazz (Ph), in 2015 he became a member \u2014 sorry. No, not that.\n[10] Your brother became the [XXX] of the [XXX]. He was very close to the Chief Minister of the Punjab. And he has continued to be in the [XXX] until, as I\u2019ve already said, even recently in 2018.\n[11] Your brother was very upset about your having become a convert to the Shia Sect. He also has influence and power because of his political position. He became very also concerned that not only was your family at risk, as your brother was targeted and was beaten up when they couldn\u2019t find you, and your mother \u2014 there was a threatening letter sent to you at your mother\u2019s house, but he was also very concerned about his own political career and that this would affect the family\u2019s honour and that it would also have repercussions on his career.\n[12] He asked \u2014 told your mother to disinherit you and she proceeded to do that in XXXX 2018, to fill out a disinheritance certificate and file it. And he also went as far as to tell the police, with whom he had friendships, to stop helping you.\n[13] Because at first the police were taking your information down. They even took a first information report, but then subsequently the police just took information but they did nothing with it and they stopped even doing anything that might assist you.\n[14] And so, you decided you couldn\u2019t stay there and you came to Canada to live in the end of XXXX 2018. Okay?\n[15] So when you became known to be a Shia convert, that\u2019s when your problems started for you. You were not \u2014 the fact that you were a Shia was problematic for you, but it was more so because you had converted from the Sunni faith.\n[16] So the nexus to the convention ground is that of your religion, because as a Shia \u2014 as Shias -\u00ad the documentary material provides a lot of information with respect to how they are treated by the Sunni majority population and how their extremist groups, as you\u2019ve encountered, that deal with them \u2014 with people that \u2014 with minority religions, but they deal very badly with minority religions, but they deal also very badly with any person who\u2019s a convert from the Sunni Sect. In some ways, some would say they deal worse with the converts.\n[17] I\u2019ll get to the documents in just a moment. I want to speak about your credibility. Your credibility, I found you to be \u2014 I found you to overall to have \u2014 to be a credible witness. Your documents corroborated much of what you say in your basis of claim form.\n[18] I did not find problems or discrepancies between what you said in your basis of claim form, in your documents, with what you said today orally. The only \u2014 we seemed to encounter problems towards the end, that you were having some problems or understanding.\n[19] Now I have to say, in cases where a person speaks English or understands enough English, I\u2019ve had this happen. So it\u2019s not an interpretation problem. It\u2019s a problem where the person understands enough to listen to the question and before the interpreter can even translate it, the person is already coming up with the answer. And then I find that the answer I get is confusing.\n[20] So because I find that it\u2019s happened in many cases where they have that similarity to your case, I don\u2019t find that you\u2019re trying to trick me or to try \u2014 that you\u2019re trying to make things up.\n[21] So I do believe that your allegations, your evidence, overwhelmingly indicates that you are a Shia convert. You have letters from the imambargah here in Canada. You have letters from the imambargah back in Pakistan, you have receipts, donation receipts.\n[22] When you spoke about issues to do with your family and to do with your faith, there was this sincerity in the way you said it and I find that I can accept your allegations as credible. Okay?\n[23] So the documentary material, we have a lot of information, both from your counsel\u2019s packages as well as from the National Documentation Package. And what it says about the religious minorities in Pakistan is not very good for the religious minorities.\n[24] It states that the Shia population is about 25 percent of the Pakistani populations and that hey have suffered and often are the targets of violent attacks by Sunni fundamentalist groups throughout the country.\n[25] The LEJ is a banned extremist group that was connected and linked to the earlier group, the Sipah-e-Sahaba, which was also banned. These groups have caused problems in Pakistan, continue to do so, as well as to the Shia Sect of Muslims, as well as to other minority religions.\n[26] There\u2019s a document in the package at item 1.8, from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. It is called the UNHCR Eligibility Guidelines for assessing the international protection needs of members of religious minorities from Pakistan.\n[27] This document speaks of the type of violence that these fundamentalist groups carry out. And it speaks about the targeting of Shia Muslims as well as of other religious minority groups.\n[28] This document also speaks in the summary about how if a person has come to the attention of these militant groups, these groups have quite the network, and then these people who come to the attention of these terrorists, these people are not safe throughout the country because of the network that these militants have.\n[29] The documentary material also speaks about how Sunnis clerics make the situation worse by preaching over loud speakers hatred, prejudice and violence against Shias as well others.\n[30] There\u2019s another document which is found at item 12.5. It\u2019s a response to information request and it states there that according to human rights watch, the LEJ reportedly has had links to the Pakistani military and intelligence services in Pakistan and that they act, these groups that is \u2013 act with impunity in area where state authority is well established, such as in the Punjab Province.\n[31] It also states in other sources, in the same document, that the government efforts to address the violence against Shia Muslims has been insufficient. And this is according to the JINNAH, J-I-N\u00ad-N-A-H, Institute.\n[32] And another document at item 1.6, written by the Asylum Research Center, it\u2019s also by the United Nation\u2019s High Commissioner for Refugees \u2014 or rather the UNHCR commissioned this document and they called it, \u201cThe Pakistan Country Report September 2016\u201d.\n[33] And it speaks in that document with regards to Sunni militants and other militant religious groups and how these groups target religious minorities, especially Shiites, Ahmadis, Sufis and Christians. And how the LEJ was also responsible for much of the violence.\n[34] Information from the Jamestown Foundation in the documentary material indicates that there\u2019s nowhere in Pakistan that you would be safe without facing serious grounds for persecution on the basis of your religion.\n[35] And also, in my opinion, I want to say that given the fact that the choice in your career is that of a journalist, the documentary material also speaks about journalists. Because of the high-profile nature of their work and also because then your name becomes known, journalists are \u2014 as well as because they often write about sensitive issues and human rights issues, they are also in a position of risk back in Pakistan.\n[36] In your case, I found that because you have written under your own name \u2014 you\u2019ve written under reporter \u2014 a reporter, but you\u2019ve also written under your own name as part of your credentials and part of your inventory of writing, I find that for you to try to relocate throughout the country, as you have tried to do, would be difficult for you.\n[37] In your particular case, it\u2019s not just that these organizations know you and could try to find you, but any assistance that was \u2014 that you tried to obtain on your own seems to have been sabotaged by your brother who is in a position of power and influence and he\u2019s used that power and influence rather than to help you, he\u2019s \u2014 and he even said that the reason the police had paid attention to you was because of him, but then when you asked him to stop helping you that makes it puts you in a worse situation and I believe that you would face a risk of persecution because of your brother\u2019s influence.\n[38] Therefore I find that in your case there is not adequate protection for you provided by the government, in your particular situation, Mr. XXX, and therefore I find that you face a serious possibility of persecution in Pakistan by reason of your religion as a Shia Muslim anywhere in the country where you may go, because you have converted and I also \u2014 and as I\u2019ve said there\u2019s no state protection available to you and no internal flight alternative available either. I therefore find you to be a convention refugee and I accept your claim.\n[39] Do you understand, Mr. XXXX?\n[40] CLAIMANT: Thank you.\n[41] MEMBER: You\u2019re very welcome. This hearing is \u2014\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 HEARING ADJOURNED \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n",

        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2019 RLLR 12\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: November 7, 2019\nPanel: A. Lopes Morey\nCounsel for the claimant(s): Shelley S Levine\nCountry: China\nRPD Number: TB8-10761\nATIP Number: A-2020-01124\nATIP Pages: 000093-000098\n[1] This is the decision in the claim of [XXX] (\u201cthe claimant\u201d). She claims to be a citizen of China and is claiming refugee protection pursuant to ss. 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] The allegations are set out in the claimant\u2019s Basis of Claim form (BOC)i and were detailed further in her oral testimony. In summary, the claimant alleges she fears persecution at the hands of Chinese authorities due to her violation of the Family Planning Policy.\nDETERMINATION\n[3] The panel finds that the claimant has established that she faces a serious possibility of persecution in China on the basis of her membership in a particular social group, namely as a woman who violated the family planning policy.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[4] The panel is prepared to accept the identity of the claimant on a balance of probabilities based on the certified true copy of her passport at Exhibit 1.\nCredibility\n[5] The determinative issue in the claim was credibility. The determination as to whether a claimant\u2019s evidence is credible is made on a balance of probabilities. The panel found the claimant entirely credible in this claim. Her testimony was detailed, spontaneous, expressive and entirely consistent with her narrative and with the documentary evidence that she provided. The panel finds the claimant was forthcoming where the panel had questions about missing documents, and that minor inconsistencies were reasonably explained. The panel therefore finds that the claimant has established her allegations on a balance of probabilities.\na. Forced insertion of IUD, Abortion, Fine, and threat of Sterilization\n[6] The panel finds that the claimant established on a balance of probabilities that she was forced to wear and IUD and then forced to undergo an abortion when it was discovered she was pregnant for a third time, as alleged.\n[7] The claimant was able to describe in detail her experience under the family planning policy as it impacted her directly. She testified that she was first forced to wear an IUD in 2008 after the birth of her first child. Given the child was a female, the claimant was allowed to apply for a permit to have a second child. The claimant testified that she made the application and had her IUD removed in 2012. After her second daughter was born in [XXX] 2015, the claimant was again forced to wear an IUD and undergo pregnancy checks three times per year. Due to medical complications, however, the claimant had her IUD removed in [XXX] 2017.\n[8] The claimant provided a document from [XXX] Hospital to corroborate the insertion of the IUD in 2015 after the birth of her second child, and the removal of the IUD for health reasons in 2017.ii On examination of the original documents, the panel found no inconsistency with its form or its content as compared to the claimant\u2019s testimony. The panel therefore finds that the document is genuine on a balance of probabilities, and finds that the claimant has established both that she was forced to wear an IUD and that it was removed in 2017 for health reasons.\n[9] The claimant testified that after the removal of the IUD she was put on the birth control pill and required pregnancy checks four times per year. On [XXX], 2018 during one of these checks, it was discovered that the claimant was pregnant. The claimant was therefore not allowed to leave the hospital and was put under anesthesia, at which time she underwent an abortion against her will. When she woke up, the claimant was informed that she had not been sterilized because after the abortion she had bled too much and was too weak to endure another procedure. However, she had been left with two documents from Family Planning officials: the first was a notice to pay a fine, and the second a notice instructing her or her husband to report for sterilization. The claimant has provided these two documents in evidence.iii As the panel found no issues with the content or form of the documents, they are presumed genuine. The panel finds that the claimant underwent an abortion and was targeted for sterilization by authorities as alleged.\nObjective Basis\n[10] Country condition documents are consistent with the claimant\u2019s allegations that there is a serious possibility she would face persecution should she return to China. Further, the Courts have found that forced abortion constitutes persecution, which the claimant has established she has already endured.\n[11] The panel acknowledges that the country condition evidence in the National Documentation Package (NDP) about China\u2019s family planning policy and implementation is varied within and between provinces.iv There is a lack of information on implementation specific to Jiangsu province; however, despite variances, existing documentation suggests that common tools used to implement the family planning policy are still in practice across China. Until there is a clearer picture of whether and to what extent the local and provincial levels are relaxing implementation of the family planning polices, decisions must be made on available information, which suggest that coercive measures are still in effect.\n[12] For example, item 5.5 of the NDP, from October 2019, indicates that \u201cdespite the change in demographic landscape, the two-child policy is still being \u2018strongly\u2019 enforced.\u201dv It points to the discrepancy between the views of Chinese leadership, which recognizes the need for higher birth rates, and the interests of local government officials who derive a large amount of revenue and power from the continued strict implementation of the policy. The same document notes \u201cdespite the encouragement from Chinese leaders for couples to have more children, local government officials\u2026 have a vested interest in \u2018maintaining the rules that justify their jobs and authority\u201d, even if violence is used.vi It cites multiple sources which each indicate that, while less common, forced abortions, sterilizations, and other invasive measures such as the coerced insertion of IUDs and regular pregnancy checks continue to be used.vii This is further corroborated in the documentary evidence provided by counsel.viii\n[13] Further, the United Kingdom Home Office Country Information and Guidance Report on China entitled Contravention of National Population and Family Planning Laws states that \u201ccouples who exceed their government-mandated birth limit continue to be punished with crushing fines equal to two to ten times their annual household income.\u201dix\n[14] The panel therefore finds that overall the documentary evidence corroborates the claimant\u2019s allegations that the government continues to impose harsh penalties on those who violate the family planning policy, that she herself underwent an abortion against her will upon discovery of her third pregnancy, that she was subject to a significant fine as a result of that pregnancy, and that she has been targeted for sterilization.\n[15] The claimant already has two children, as evidenced by their birth certificatesx, and, as indicated above, she has already been identified by family planning officials as a target for a fine and forced sterilization. Therefore, even if implementation of the family planning policy in Jiangsu province is relaxed in the future, the claimant is unlikely to benefit from the change on a forward-looking basis such that she would no longer face a serious possibility of persecution.\n[16] Having considered all of the evidence, both in testimony and the documentary evidence, the panel finds the claimant has established that there is a serious possibility of persecution should she return to China, in the form of sterilization and the limiting of her future reproductive choices. The panel finds that the claimant\u2019s fear is well-founded.\nState Protection\n[17] States are presumed to be capable of protecting their citizens except in situations where the state is in a state of complete breakdown. To rebut the presumption of state protection, a claimant has to provide clear and convincing evidence of a state\u2019s inability or unwillingness to protect its citizens.\n[18] In this case, the agent of persecution is a branch of the State itself which is implementing an official State policy. The panel therefore finds on a balance of probabilities that State protection would be unavailable to the claimant in China.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[19] Given that the State is the agent of persecution, and that the claimant is known to State authorities, the panel finds that there is a serious possibility of persecution for the claimant throughout China. Therefore, there is no internal flight alternative available to her.\nCONCLUSION\n[20] Based on the totality of the evidence, the claimant has established that she faces a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground, namely her membership in a particular social group, as a woman who has violated the family planning policy. Therefore, the panel finds that she is a Convention refugee and accepts her claim.\n(signed) A.

Hartslief\nCounsel for the claimant(s): Steven Beiles\nCountry: Turkey\nRPD Number: TB7-25589\nAssociated RPD Numbers: TB7-25593\nATIP Number: A-2020-01124\nATIP Pages: 000089-000092\n[1] MEMBER: This is the decision for [XXX] and [XXX], file number TB7-25589. You are both claiming to be citizens of Turkey, and you are claiming refugee protection pursuant to Sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[2] I have considered both your testimonies and the other evidence in the case and I am ready to render my decision orally.\n[3] I find that you are both convention refugees for the reason that you have established there is a serious possibility of persecution in Turkey based on your political opinion as HDP supporters. By way of background you allege the following.\n[4] Since 2014 you both have been actively supporting the HDP Party in Turkey, which is a leftist party focused on social justice as it relates to the Kurdish people and other minorities. The principal claimant has been arrested and detained for his political activities, and you both experienced a police raid on your home as a result of your political beliefs and involvement with the HDP.\n[5] You say that if you return to Turkey you will be targeted by the police and security forces and arbitrarily arrested and detained for your political views.\n[6] Your personal identities as citizens of Turkey has been established by your testimony and the supporting documents, including your passports, your national identity cards and your family registry documents.\n[7] I therefore find on a balance of probabilities that identity and country of reference have been established for both of you.\n[8] I find that there is a link between what you fear and one of the five Convention grounds; specifically, your leftist political opinion as HDP supporters. This claim is therefore assessed under Section 96 of The Act.\n[9] I have considered all of the documentation before me, as well as your testimony, and I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that you would face a serious possibility of persecution should you return to Turkey.\n[10] In terms of your general credibility, I found you both to be credible witnesses. You both described your involvement with the HDP Party, including your election campaign activities distributing brochures, talking to members of the public, and garnering support for your local candidate.\n[11] The principal claimant accurately described the party\u2019s platform, and you explained in detail what motivated you to support the party both with your volunteer activities and your monetary donations.\n[12] You both described in detail the circumstances of the police raid on your home just prior to leaving Turkey. The principal claimant described the various times he has been questioned, threatened and detained by the police in retaliation for his activities as an HDP supporter.\n[13] You presented your descriptions in a clear and consistent manner, and I have no reason to doubt your testimony.\n[14] Finally, you provided documentary evidence in support of your testimony, including a supporting letter from the HDP Party in Turkey; a letter from the Alevi Cultural Association in Canada; and pictures confirming your presence at various anti-government gatherings of Kurdish business people.\n[15] Throughout the hearing you both presented your testimony in a clear and consistent manner, and you both responded spontaneously to questioning. Your testimony was straightforward and was in keeping with your basis of claim form.\n[16] I therefore find that your subjective fear is established by your credible testimony, and I believe what you have alleged on a balance of probabilities.\n[17] The objective evidence regarding the current situation in Turkey supports your position that you will face a serious possibility of persecution should you return to Turkey. I looked at a number of documents in the National Documentation Package dated March 29th of this year and the objective evidence is consistent with your allegation that members of the HDP Party experience persecution at the hands of the government.\n[18] In particular, I considered Item 1.6 from the U.K. Home Office which confirms the arrest and detention of various high level HDP members. In addition, Item 1.12 from the U.K. Home Office confirms that activists and other actors no in line with the government views may be targeted by the authorities.\n[19] Finally, the defat item at 1.17 from Australia confirms that the restrictions on the ability of Turkish citizens to express dissent to the government, individually or collectively, has increased, particularly under the state of emergency.\n[20] In its 2018 Freedom in the World Report, Freedom House ranked Turkey as not free.\n[21] The objective evidence supports your allegations that you will continue to be targeted by the Turkish government as active HDP supporters and individuals with perceived anti-government opinions.\n[22] As the state is the agent of persecution in your situation, I am satisfied that you have rebutted the presumption of state protection because you cannot access or otherwise expect to receive adequate state protection throughout Turkey.\n[23] Furthermore, as the state is the agent of persecution, I am satisfied that there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout Turkey, and therefore there is no viable internal flight alternative.\n[24] Based on the foregoing analysis I find that you have established there is a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground; namely your political opinion as HDP supporters.\n[25] Therefore, I find that you are convention refugees, and I accept your claims.\n",

Genjaga\nCounsel for the claimant(s): John Savaglio\nCountry: Pakistan\nRPD Number: TB7-09089\nAssociated RPD Numbers: TB7-09090\nATIP Number: A-2020-01124\nATIP Pages: 000075-000088\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] This is the decision in the claims of [XXX] (the principal claimant) and [XXX] who claim to be citizens of Pakistan and are claiming refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).1\n[2] In deciding these claims, the panel considered the principal claimant and claimant\u2019s testimonies, documentary evidence, and counsel\u2019s oral submissions at the hearing. In addition, the panel considered the Chairperson\u2019s Guidelines number 9 on Proceedings Before the IRB Involving Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression2.\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] The principal claimant alleges in his Basis of Claim Form (BOC)3, BOC amendment4 and in testimony that he fears the Pakistan authorities, religious extremists and society in general if he were returned to Pakistan today. The principal claimant fears being arrested, tortured and even killed due to his sexual orientation of being a homosexual. The claimant relies on the BOC and BOC amendment of the principal claimant and fears she will be harmed for her role in assisting the principal claimant to escape Pakistan. While the details of the claim are in the BOC and BOC amendment, the following is a brief summary of the principal claimant\u2019s allegations.\n[4] The principal claimant alleges he was born and raised in [XXX]. The claimant alleges that he grew up with three sisters and knew he was a homosexual from an early age.\n[5] The principal claimant alleges he fell in love with his childhood friend, [XXX]. The principal claimant alleges that he started a relationship with [XXX] when they were 16 years old.\n[6] When the principal claimant was in grade 12, he alleges that his parents found out about him secretly going to a hotel with [XXX] and confronted the principal claimant.\n[7] On [XXX], 2016, [XXX] father suspected that [XXX] and the principal claimant were involved in same sex activities and beat them both after he found them in his house in a locked room for over an hour. The claimant alleges that [XXX] father threatened to hand him over to the police if he did not stop his activities with [XXX] and phoned the principal claimant\u2019s father to advise him of the suspected homosexual activities.\n[8] The next day, the principal claimant alleges his father warned him of the severe consequences he would face by the religious extremists if he did not abandon his homosexual activities. The principal claimant alleges his father cursed and beat him up after the principal claimant admitted his homosexual orientation. The principal claimant alleges that the claimant cursed him and said it was better if she had another daughter than him.\n[9] After some time, the principal claimant alleges he resumed his relationship with [XXX] and started to meet him in different guestrooms in [XXX]. The principal claimant alleges his father asked the local Sunni Masjid, [XXX] to try to convince him to change his sexual orientation.\n[10] On [XXX], 2016, the principal claimant alleges he and [XXX] were in a [XXX] guestroom in [XXX], when four bearded men entered with a key. The principal claimant alleges that these men started to punch and kick him and [XXX]. The principal claimant alleges he and XXXX were then handed over to the police and taken to the police station.\n[11] The principal claimant alleges that he and [XXX] were verbally abused, humiliated and physically assaulted by the police during their detention. The principal claimant alleges that the police called the principal claimant\u2019s father who came down to the police station and bribed the Station House Officer to release the principal claimant. The police warned the principal claimant\u2019s father that his son should not be seen in the area otherwise he may face serious harm in the future.\n[12] The principal claimant alleges that word spread through the neighbourhood quickly about his arrest and sexual orientation. The principal claimant alleges that his father was called to appear before a council of elders the next day to address the matter. The principal claimant alleges he went into hiding in [XXX] at his father\u2019s friend\u2019s house.\n[13] On [XXX], 2016, the principal claimant alleges that that the council of elders decided that he and [XXX] should be punished with death for their homosexual activities and to preserve the dignity of their Islamic faith. The principal claimant alleges that Sunni radical extremists were also in the council and who vowed to carry out the punishment.\n[14] The principal claimant alleges that at the insistence of the claimant, the principal claimant\u2019s father contacted an agent to assist getting the principal claimant and the claimant out of the country for safety. The principal claimant alleges that the claimant had to accompany him because he was still a minor.\n[15] On [XXX], 2016, the principal claimant and the claimant came to Canada. In May of 2017, the principal claimant and the claimant made claims for refugee protection.\nDETERMINATION\n[16] This is a split decision. The panel finds that the principal claimant is a Convention refugee based on the grounds of membership in a particular social group that being a homosexual. The panel finds that the claimant is not a Convention Refugee and not a person in need of protection. The panel\u2019s reasons are as follows.\nANALYSIS\n[17] The determinative issues in this claim are identity, credibility, well-foundedness of the claim and internal flight alternative.\nIdentity\n[18] On a balance of probabilities, the panel accepts the claimants are citizens of Pakistan based on their testimony and copies of their Pakistani passports.5\nCredibility\n[19] Credibility is an issue to be considered in all claims before the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB). In order to determine whether the claim is well-founded, the panel must find, on a balance of probabilities, that the evidence is credible and trustworthy. A claimant\u2019s testimony is presumed to be true unless there are valid reasons to doubt its truthfulness.6\nThe principal claimant\u2019s claim\n[20] The panel found the principal claimant to be a credible witness on his sexual orientation and incidents that have happened to him in Pakistan. The principal claimant testified in a straightforward and clear manner. The principal claimant was able to provide details of events in his life in Pakistan and in Canada. His testimony was consistent with the BOC, Port of Entry documents and documentary evidence provided in support of his claim. There were no inconsistencies between the principal claimant\u2019s testimony and the other material before the panel. The principal claimant did not embellish or exaggerate his claim. As a result, the panel believes the principal claimant\u2019s story as it pertains to him.\n[21] In addition, the principal claimant has provided personal documentary evidence7 including certificate of domicile, driving license, national identity card, educational documents, educational documents of [XXX], family registration documents, certificate for the children below 18 years of age, affidavits in support from family and friends, photographs, 519 letters and donation receipts. As a result, the panel believes his story in support of his claim.\n[22] There is considerable objective documentary evidence8 put forward by the Board and counsel that highlights the problems that claimants who are homosexual may face in returning to Pakistan today.\n[23] In the United States. Department of State. Pakistan. Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 20189 states,\nActs of Violence, Discrimination, and Other Abuses Based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity\nConsensual same-sex sexual conduct is a criminal offense. The penalty for same-sex relations is a fine, two years\u2019 to life imprisonment, or both. Lesbian, gay, bisexual, male transgender, and intersex persons rarely revealed their sexual orientation or gender identity. There were communities of openly transgender women, but they were marginalized and were frequently the targets of violence and harassment.\nViolence and discrimination continued against lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex (LGBTI) persons. The crimes often go unreported, and the police generally take little action when they do receive reports. Outreach by NGOs in KP, however, improved interactions between police and the transgender community there.\nAccording to a wide range of LGBT NGOs and activists, society generally shunned transgender women, eunuchs, and intersex persons, collectively referred to as \u201chijras\u201d\u2013a word some transgender individuals view as pejorative, preferring the term \u201ckhawaja sira\u201d-\n-who often lived together in slum communities and survived by begging and dancing at carnivals and weddings. Some also were prostitutes. Local authorities often denied transgender individuals their share of inherited property, and admission to schools and hospitals. Landlords frequently refused to rent or sell property to transgender persons. On May 9, Parliament passed the landmark Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2018, which addresses many of these problems. The law accords the right of transgender individuals to be recognized according to their \u201cself-perceived gender identity,\u201d guarantees basic rights, and prohibits harassment of transgender persons, and outlaws discrimination against them in employment, housing, education, healthcare, and other services.\nA 2012 Supreme Court ruling allows transgender individuals to obtain national identification cards listing a \u201cthird gender.\u201d Because national ID cards also serve as voter registration, the ruling enabled transgender individuals to participate in elections, both as candidates and voters. The Election Commission of Pakistan and the National Database and Registration Authority, with support from international donors, conducted an identification card and voter registration drive prior to the July general elections. Thirteen transgender candidates ran in the elections, although none were elected. Election observers and the transgender community reported incidents of harassment of transgender voters on election day, and the Sindh Home Department reportedly confiscated the Election Commission of Pakistan accreditation cards of 25 transgender observers citing security concerns. A Free and Fair Election Network report, which included observations of 125 transgender election observers, noted that in Islamabad, Lahore, and Karachi law enforcement officials were largely helpful and gave preferential treatment to transgender voters. In Peshawar and Quetta, by contrast, transgender voters faced harassment (emphasis is mine).\n[24] Under Sharia Law, homosexuals may face the death penalty in Pakistan for their activities.10 While homosexual activities are still considered to be a crime, some documentary evidence indicates the government rarely prosecutes individuals while other documentation indicates that there has been documented arrests of homosexuals in Pakistan for the past three years.11\n[25] The documentary evidence12 indicates that sexual minorities are not socially accepted with the major part of society denying their existence and there is little public acceptance of the notion that someone can love a person of the same sex. The documentary evidence13 indicates that individuals who are of non-heterosexual orientation are reluctant to reveal their sexual orientation or gender identity because then life becomes miserable as he or she can become the victim of teasing, bashing, beatings, threats and even being killed. The documentary evidence14 indicates that lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and intersex (LGBTQI) persons are victimized by the state, by society, by religious extremist groups and even by their own families.\n[26] The documentary evidence15 indicates that sexual minorities may face a risk of discrimination, violence, social boycott and degradation in social class and rank. The documentary evidence indicates there is widespread and systemic state and societal discrimination against LGBTQI individuals in Pakistan including harassment and violence. The documentary evidence indicates Pakistan is homophobic society that has anti-homosexual statutes and that it suffers from serious levels of ongoing anti-homosexual violence. The documentary evidence also indicates that the Pakistani authorities do not provide adequate state protection to the LBGTQI persons suffering serious human rights abuses and are often one of the agents of persecution as they tend to share and support the homophobia found in Pakistani society as a whole.16\n[27] Therefore, the panel finds on a balance of probabilities that the principal claimant has come to the attention of the Pakistan authorities and local Sunni extremists and local religious clerics as being homosexual. Therefore, the panel finds on a balance of probabilities that there is more than a mere possibility that the principal claimant would face persecution if he returns to Pakistan today.\n[28] The panel finds that the principal claimant has rebutted the presumption of state protection because the state is one of the agents of persecution in this case and it would be unreasonable to expect him to seek state protection in this case.\n[29] The panel also finds that there is no Internal Flight Alternative for the principal claimant because the situation would be the same wherever he lives in Pakistan.\nThe claimant\u2019s claim\n[30] The panel did not find the claimant\u2019s testimony credible as it relates to events in Pakistan and the well-foundedness of her claim. The panel find\u2019s that the claimant on a balance of probabilities will not face harm or persecution upon return to Pakistan. The panel noted that the objective documentary evidence17 does not support that the family members will face harm or persecution if their family member is homosexual. It states that gay activists who openly campaign for gay rights are likely to be at real risk in Pakistan from non-state actors. The claimant in this case is not a gay rights activist but a concerned mother and parent who assisted her son in coming to Canada for his safety.\n[31] The panel finds the claimant was evasive and did not want to answer the panel\u2019s questions. The panel found the claimant very emotional throughout her testimony and kept on crying. The panel found that the claimant often did not listen to the questions being asked and was often rambling in her answers and in hysteria that she could not leave her son and go back to Pakistan which she repeated often. The panel does not find the claimant credible in the following areas;\nOmission in the BOC narrative that the claimant and her husband were visited by Sunni radical extremists, mulvis or religious clerics and were abused and beaten in Pakistan\n[32] The claimant testified that while her son was in hiding in [XXX] that Sunni radical extremists, mulvis or religious clerics visited her home in Lahore and questioned her and her husband about the location of the principal claimant. The claimant testified that they were abused and beaten by these individuals in Pakistan. The panel asked the claimant how many times these people came. The claimant testified that they came many times to her home. The panel asked the claimant again to specify how many times these people came to her house in the four month period that the principal claimant was in hiding in Gujranwala. The claimant kept repeating they came too many times and they came several times.\n[33] The panel asked the claimant why the visits to the house and subsequent abuse and beatings were not mentioned in the BOC narrative. The claimant testified that the lawyer\u2019s assistant said that there was no need to give more details of her problems in Pakistan. The panel asked the claimant if she told her lawyer about the visits, abuse and beatings by the Sunni radical extremists, mulvis, religious clerics or goons. The claimant testified that she did not. The panel asked why she did not tell the lawyer about these incidents she testified that she is uneducated and that she did not know that she had to tell him.\n[34] The panel does not find that the claimant has provided a reasonable explanation for the omission in the BOC narrative. It would be reasonable to expect that a claimant would state all incidences of harm or threats in the BOC narrative that she has experienced pertaining to her son\u2019s activities. The claimant in this case did not file her own separate BOC narrative but instead relied on the BOC narrative of the principal claimant. The panel also noted that the claimant and her husband did not move or go into hiding after the arrest of the principal claimant or after the council of elders meeting. Instead they remained in their home for four months. The panel also noted that the council of elders did not issue punishments to the principal claimant\u2019s mother or father for their son\u2019s homosexual activities. Also, the panel noted that the recent affidavit18 of the claimant\u2019s husband does not outline that he or his wife were abused or beaten by the extremists, religious clerics or the goons. The panel put this matter to the claimant and asked for an explanation. The claimant testified that her husband wrote about the principal claimant\u2019s problems and did not write about the visits and beatings because he is also uneducated.\n[35] The panel finds that if the claimant truly feared for her life it would be reasonable to expect her to move or go into hiding as her son did after the principal claimant\u2019s arrest and release from the police station. The panel noted that the claimant\u2019s husband has submitted two affidavits19 outlining their family\u2019s problems in Pakistan. It would also be reasonable to expect the claimant\u2019s husband to put in the affidavits that he and his wife were abused and beaten by the religious extremists as a result of their son\u2019s homosexual activities. The claimant\u2019s husband did not do so. In contrast, the claimant\u2019s husband indicated that the reason his wife came to Canada was to assist her son in travelling and reaching Canada safely because he was a minor at the time he left Pakistan. The panel noted that the claimant in her testimony also repeatedly stated that she came here to take care of her son and save his life. The panel noted that the principal claimant at the time he applied for Canadian visas was a minor and when he arrived in Canada in [XXX] of 2016 he was 18 years old.\n[36] The panel does not find the claimant credible in this area of her testimony. The panel finds on a balance of probabilities that the visits, abuse and beatings by the Sunni radical extremists, mulvis, religious clerics and goons did not happen as alleged and that the claimant is embellishing her claim so that she can stay here in Canada with her son.\nClaimant\u2019s family problems back in Pakistan since she has been in Canada\n[37] The claimant testified that since she has been in Canada, the local Sunni extremists and local religious clerics have approached her husband as recently as last week and asked him where the principal claimant is. The claimant alleges that her husband did not tell her that he was beaten and that she found out later from him and from her daughters. The panel asked the claimant when this occurred and when she found out about this matter. The claimant testified that her husband told her a week ago and that it happened about three to four months ago. The panel asked what her husband told her. The claimant testified that he said don\u2019t come back here and that he has received life threats against the principal claimant and that is very good there in Canada. The claimant also testified that her daughters do not go outside anymore or to school because they get teased and harassed by local boys because their brother is homosexual.\n[38] The claimant also testified that when she and the principal claimant came to Canada her remaining family consisting of her husband and daughters moved to another location in [XXX]. The claimant testified that the Sunni radical extremists and the local religious clerics were able to locate her husband in the new location and again inquired about the location of the claimant and the principal claimant. The claimant testified that her husband was beaten again and that he had to move to a relative\u2019s house. The panel asked the claimant when this happened. The claimant testified that this happened a week ago. The panel asked the claimant if she told the principal claimant about this. The claimant did not tell her son because he is a child and she did not want him to worry about this.\n[39] The panel does not find the claimant to be credible in this area of her testimony. The claimant provided conflicting testimony as to when her husband was beaten. The claimant first testified that he was abused earlier when the religious extremists would hold him by the neck with their hands to get him tell them where the principal claimant was. Later on her testimony she testified that he was beaten three to four months ago and most recently a week ago.\n[40] The panel noted that the most recent affidavit of her husband dated 2019\/03\/04 does not indicate that he was beaten by religious extremists. However, the panel noted the affidavit of the claimant\u2019s husband contradicts the claimant\u2019s testimony regarding actions taken against him by the religious extremists and also that the religious extremists have threatened to kill the principal claimant only and not the claimant. The panel put the matter to the claimant and the claimant testified that that her husband was uneducated and only put down the problems that the principal claimant experienced.\n[41] The panel noted that the claimant repeatedly testified that the principal claimant is her only son and she cannot be apart from him. The claimant testified that she came to Canada to safe her son\u2019s life and assist him here in Canada.\n[42] The panel finds on a balance of probabilities that the claimant\u2019s version of what has been happening to her husband in Pakistan since she has been in Canada is not credible. The panel finds that the claimant\u2019s husband has not been beaten by the religious extremists as the claimant has alleged. Therefore, the panel finds on a balance of probabilities that the local Sunni extremists and local religious clerics are searching only for the principal claimant and not the claimant.\n[43] After reviewing the evidence in its totality, the panel finds that the claimant is not a credible or trustworthy witness with respect to the central allegations of her case that she is being pursued in Pakistan because her son is homosexual. In addition, the panel finds there is insufficient credible and trustworthy evidence before the panel upon which to reach a positive determination under s.96 ors. 97(1) of IRPA. Therefore, the panel finds that the claimant\u2019s account of problems she faced in Pakistan lacks credibility. As a result, the panel does not believe her story in support of her claim.\nInternal Flight Alternative (IFA)\n[44] In the alternative, even if the panel finds the claimant to be credible, which it does not, the panel also finds that there is a viable IFA for the claimant in Pakistan. The panel proposed at the beginning of the hearing Islamabad, Multan and Karachi as possible and viable IFAs for the claimant in Pakistan. During the course of the hearing and after hearing testimony from the claimant, the panel changed the proposed and viable IFAs to Faisalabad, Sialkot and Multan.\n[45] The panel asked the claimant if she could live in the IFAs proposed in other parts of Pakistan like Faisalabad, Sialkot or Multan and be safe. The claimant testified that she cannot because they will chase her and her husband to find out where her son is living. The panel asked the claimant what her husband tells these people when they approach him. The claimant testified that her husband has told them various lies like he does not where were they are and sometimes he tells them they have gone to Islamabad or Karachi. The claimant also testified that if her family goes somewhere else to live and her son goes out it, can be more serious. The claimant also testified that if she returns to Pakistan they will kill her because she escaped with him to Canada. The claimant testified that she has only one son and she can\u2019t live without her son.\n[46] The panel finds that the claimant is similarly situated to other members of her family like the claimant\u2019s husband and other family members who may have been harassed to disclose the location of the principal claimant. The panel noted that the claimant\u2019s family has only moved to another location in Lahore when they were allegedly found. The panel finds that the claimant may be able to move to the potential internal flight alternatives of Faisalabad, Sialkot and Multan and be safe if her son remains in Canada. The panel noted that the claimant was a homemaker supported by her husband. The claimant testified that her husband worked from home as he was a tailor and the daughters helped him because he suffered from diabetes, high cholesterol and heart issues for which he was taking medications.\n[47] The panel does not see any reason why the claimant cannot return to Pakistan and live with her family without her son in the cities discussed as potential internal flight alternatives outlined above and be safe. The claimant testified that she cannot and the religious extremists and clerics and goons will locate them there. The panel asked why they could not go to the police and get help if they are harmed or threatened. The claimant testified that the police sides with them.\n[48] The panel finds on a balance of probabilities that the local religious clerics and local Sunni extremists would not pursue the claimant as they are interested in the principal claimant only and would not have an interest to seek the claimant even if she moves to any of the proposed internal flight alternatives. In addition, the panel finds that the claimant has not rebutted the presumption of state protection in this case as the family has not approached the police for protection in the various places they have lived in Lahore since the claimant has been in Canada when they allegedly encountered problems in Pakistan from the local religious clerics and local Sunni extremists.\n[49] The panel notes that the motivation to find the claimant, if any exists, would be to simply obtain information about her son\u2019s location. The panel does not find on a balance of probabilities that the local Sunni extremists and local religious clerics would be interested to seriously harm the claimant as they have not done serious harm to the existing family that are still in Pakistan. In addition, the panel finds on a balance of probabilities that the claimant\u2019s problems are localized to local Sunni extremists and local religious clerics in Lahore.\n[50] Therefore, the panel finds that the claimant has not established, on a balance of probabilities, that these individuals who she alleges are pursuing her would have the ability to locate her in any of the proposed IFAs which are outside the Lahore area. Moreover, the claimant has not established, on a balance of probabilities, that the assailants would have been motivated to seek her out elsewhere in Pakistan.\n[51] The panel further finds, based on the claimant\u2019s testimony, that the claimant is a homemaker who relies on support from her husband who works from home as a tailor. The panel finds no reason why her husband could not find employment in any of the proposed IFAs. The panel noted that the claimant\u2019s family moved to various places in Lahore only and finds that they should be able to relocate to another part of Pakistan without any difficulties.\n[52] Accordingly, the panel finds that Faisalabad, Sialkot and Multan meet the test of being viable IFAs for the claimant and her family as there would not be, on a balance of probabilities, any serious possibility of persecution or risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or danger of torture in the IFAs.\nCONCLUSION\n[53] Based on the foregoing analysis, the panel concludes that the principal claimant is a Convention refugee under section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. The panel accepts his claim. The panel concludes that the claimant is not a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection and rejects her claim.\n(signed) K.

        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2019 RLLR 9\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: November 19, 2019\nPanel: C. Ruthven\nCounsel for the claimant(s): Rasaq Ayanlola\nCountry: Nigeria\nRPD Number: TB7-04392\nAssociated RPD Numbers: TB7-04402, TB7-04424, TB7-04425\nATIP Number: A-2020-01124\nATIP Pages: 000065-000074\nREASONS AND DECISIONS\n[1] These reasons and decision are in regards to the claims for protection made by [XXX] (principal claimant), [XXX]1 (adult male claimant), [XXX]2 (eldest minor claimant), and [XXX] (youngest minor claimant).\n[2] Each is claiming protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.3\n[3] The panel heard the claims jointly, pursuant to Refugee Protection Division Rule 55.4 The principal claimant was the designated representative for each of the two minor claimants.5\nALLEGATIONS\n[4] The principal claimant\u2019s full allegations are set out in her Basis of Claim Form and related narrative.6 In summary, the principal claimant is a bisexual woman. She had three intimate female partners in Nigeria, prior to marrying the adult male claimant in [XXX] 2007.\n[5] On [XXX], 2016, the principal claimant restarted a sexual relationship with her third female partner, [XXX]. [XXX] was married, and residing with her husband and some of her male cousins. When [XXX] complained to her husband, [XXX], about her cousins\u2019 criminal activities in their home, [XXX] set up hidden security cameras, unbeknownst to [XXX].\n[6] Upon reviewing his hidden camera footage on [XXX], 2016, [XXX] discovered the sexual relationship between his wife and the principal claimant. [XXX] called the principal claimant to confront her, and he informed the adult male claimant about the sexual relationship between their respective wives. When the adult male claimant and [XXX] spoke in person at [XXX] residence, the male claimant discovered that [XXX] had quickly been sent to [XXX] family home after the discovery of her adultery and sexual intercourse with the principal claimant.\n[7] Although disappointed in the principal claimant for her adultery, the adult male claimant did not want the principal claimant to be harmed by [XXX], his family, or homophobic members of the community. As such, the principal claimant and the two minor claimants relocated to the house of the principal claimant\u2019s cousin, [XXX].\n[8] On [XXX], 2016, the adult male claimant was visited by two police officers, in the company of [XXX]. The adult male claimant was arrested, as an accomplice to the crimes related to the sexual orientation of the principal claimant. The adult male claimant was held at the [XXX] police station for two days, until he was released on the condition that he produce the principal claimant.\n[9] Instead of complying with his bond conditions, the adult male claimant went into hiding at a hotel in [XXX], and arranged for the four claimants to depart Nigeria. The claimants departed Nigeria on [XXX], 2016, and they each made their claims for protection in Canada the following month. The adult male claimant and both of the minor claimants rely on the narrative of the principal claimant.\nDETERMINATION\n[10] The panel finds that the principal claimant is a Convention refugee, pursuant to section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, based on her membership in a particular social group, namely her sexual orientation as a bisexual female.\n[11] The panel further finds that there is sufficient nexus between the claim of the adult male claimant and the persecution of the principal claimant, and that there is sufficient nexus between the claims of each minor claimant and the persecution of the principal claimant.7\n[12] The adult male claimant faces a risk of criminal prosecution related to the perception of the authorities of Nigeria that he aided and abetted the principal claimant in evading prosecution, for crimes related to her sexual orientation. The minor claimants face risks related to spiritual cleansing rituals, at the hands of their family members in Nigeria.\n[13] As such, the panel finds that the adult male claimant, the eldest minor claimant, and the youngest minor claimant are each Convention refugees, pursuant to section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, as they each face a serious possibility of persecution due to membership in a particular social group, family members of the principal claimant.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[14] The panel finds that all four claimants have established their identities as nationals of Nigeria, each based on a balance of probabilities. Each claimant presented their Nigeria passport.8\nCredibility\n[15] Based on the nature of the four claims, the panel carefully considered the contents of Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9: Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression,9 during both sittings of the hearing, and while rendering the decision.\n[16] The panel is mindful that section 8.3 highlights that persecution may be faced by individuals who provide support for persons with diverse sexual orientation (or diverse gender identity and expression). In addition, family members of individuals with perceived diverse sexual orientation (or perceived diverse gender identity and expression) may also have a nexus to a Convention ground.\n[17] The panel finds that the principal claimant testified at the hearing in a straightforward and consistent manner, without the use of embellishments, contradictions, or omissions from the details which were presented when she made her claim for protection.\nSexual Relationship with [XXX] in Canada\n[18] The panel finds that the principal claimant and the witness each provided spontaneous testimony regarding the development of their intimate relationship in Canada, at the July 8, 2019 sitting. The panel also finds that this separate testimony from each intimate partner was also consistent with the relationship details that were presented in the letter signed by the witness, in advance of the July 8, 2019 sitting.10\nParticipation with the LGBTIQ Community in Canada\n[19] In support of the principal claimant\u2019s participation in the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans, Intersex, and Queer (LGBTIQ) community during her time in Canada, she presented two photographs depicting an indoor gathering,11 eight photographs depicting her attendance at a Pride festival,12 an [XXX], 2017 letter signed by a coordinator at The 519 Community Centre,13 as well as an [XXX], 2017 letter and a [XXX], 2019 letter signed by leaders of the [XXX] Community Church of Toronto.14\n[20] Although participation in LGBTIQ community groups in Canada is generally open to anybody who wishes to join and participate (including The 519 Community Centre and the [XXX] Community Church of Toronto), the panel finds that the testimony of the principal claimant, the testimony of the witness, and the presented written evidence provided support for the central allegations which were made by the principal claimant, in regards to her sexual orientation.\n[21] Based on the above considerations, the panel finds the principal claimant to be credible in the core elements of her claim, namely that she is a bisexual woman.\nObjective Basis of the Claim\n[22] The overall objective evidence supports the claim for Convention refugee protection for the principal claimant based on her membership in a particular social group, namely her sexual orientation as a bisexual woman.\n[23] The overall objective evidence also supports the claims for Convention refugee protection for the adult male claimant and each minor claimant, based on their membership in a particular social group, namely family members of a bisexual woman.\nTreatment of Bisexuals in Nigeria\n[24] Consensual female with female relationships are criminalized in Nigeria. The Same Sex Marriage Prohibition Act, enacted in the month of January 2014, effectively renders illegal all forms of activity supporting or promoting LGBTIQ rights.15 Any sexual orientation that is not heterosexual is considered to be unnatural, demonic, and immoral in Nigeria.16\n[25] The government brought formal charges for the first time last year. Anyone who is convicted of aiding and abetting homosexual activities faces a punishment of ten years in prison. Anyone convicted of entering into a same-sex marriage or civil union may be sentenced to up to fourteen years\u2019 imprisonment.17\n[26] As a result of the referenced country condition documentation from the National Documentation Package, the panel finds that the principal claimant and the adult male claimant have each established an objective basis for their claims (as a bisexual woman and as the spouse of a bisexual woman), and that their respective fears are well-founded.\nRitual Practices in Nigeria\n[27] In Nigeria, there are some ritual practices that dehumanize, deprive, and economically dispossess the victims. The custodians of cultural or traditional rites ultimately determine the fate of the individual who is undergoing ritual practices. Nigerian police officers appear to be discriminatory in their treatment of victims of ritual practices. Prosecutions for ritual practices are rare, and police protection relies on influence and financial resources.18\n[28] The adult male claimant testified at the October 16, 2019 sitting that he expects that the two minor claimants would be subjected to ritual cutting, based on their descent from the principal claimant. The panel finds that the testimony established that, on a balance of probabilities, that ritual practices were performed in family of the adult male claimant and that members of his family would be motivated to perform these cutting rituals on the two minor claimants.\n[29] The eldest minor claimant is eleven years old and the youngest minor male claimant is eight years old.19\n[30] The panel notes the widespread problem of violence against children in Nigeria. Aside from physical violence endured by half of children, approximately 60% of children under the age of eighteen experienced some form of emotional, sexual, or physical violence in Nigeria.20\n[31] In consideration of these ages (in regards to granting consent), and in consideration of the unregulated nature of ritual practices in Nigeria, the panel finds that the evidence adduced has established that it is more likely than not that the described cutting rituals cross the threshold into violence against children, and that undergoing these type of rituals might have a material impact on the life or on the health of each minor claimant.\n[32] In addition to the above, the panel finds that the risk of harm to each minor claimant is directly tied to the sexual orientation of their mother, the principal claimant. As such, the panel finds that each minor claimant, as a family member of the principal claimant, has established an objective basis for their claim, and that their fears are well-founded.\nState Protection\n[33] LGBTIQ individuals in Nigeria often do not report acts of violence to the police.21 Given the illegal nature of same-sex intercourse in federal legislation, the panel finds it unreasonable to expect the principal claimant to seek redress or protection from the police or any other authorities in Nigeria.\n[34] The adult male claimant also fears the authorities in Nigeria. In light of the referenced country condition evidence, the panel finds that it would also be objectively unreasonable for the adult male claimant, in his particular set of circumstances, to seek the protection of the authorities in Nigeria.\n[35] The panel finds that the principal claimant and the adult male claimant have each rebutted the presumption of state protection with clear and convincing evidence of the state\u2019s inability to protect them. The panel finds that on a balance of probabilities, adequate state protection would not be available to the principal claimant or to the adult male claimant, should they return to Nigeria.\n[36] Given the limited nature of police protection for those without influence or financial resources who face ritual practices in Nigeria, as well as the lack of prosecutions against perpetrators in the court system, the panel finds that each minor claimant has also rebutted the presumption of state protection with clear and convincing evidence of the state\u2019s inability to protect them, in their particular sets of circumstances.\nInternal Flight Alternatives\n[37] With regards to possible internal flight alternatives for the principal claimant and the adult male claimant in Nigeria, given that federal laws criminalizing same-sex relations and the enumerated violence against the LGBTIQ community are each applicable throughout Nigeria, the panel finds that there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout Nigeria for both the principal claimant and the adult male claimant.\n[38] The panel finds that a viable internal flight alternative does not exist for either adult claimant in Nigeria, as the state and police are their agents of persecution.\nThe Two Minor Claimants\n[39] The principal claimant testified at the July 8, 2019 sitting that the two minor claimants would also face constant harassment, based on her own sexual orientation. In consideration of the current country condition evidence, the panel finds this testimony to be reasonable. The panel considered this harassment (from homophobic members of society) in conjunction with the adult male claimant\u2019s testimony regarding risk of harm faced by each minor claimant from ritual practices.\n[40] The panel finds that, on a balance of probabilities, there would be no family member protection for either minor claimant in any part of Nigeria. As such, the panel finds that a viable internal flight alternative does not exist for either minor claimant in Nigeria.\nCONCLUSION\n[41] The panel finds that there is a serious possibility that each of the four claimants face persecution in Nigeria.\n[42] The panel concludes that the principal claimant is a Convention refugee based on her membership in a particular social group, namely her sexual orientation as a bisexual woman, pursuant to section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[43] The panel also concludes that the adult male claimant and both minor claimants are Convention refugees, as they are each members of a particular social group, namely family members with a sufficient nexus to the principal claimant, a person with a serious possibility of persecution in Nigeria.\n[44] The panel therefore accepts all four claims.\n(signed) C.

Short\nCounsel for the claimant(s): Luke McRae\nCountry: China\nRPD Number: TB6-02224\nATIP Number: A-2020-01124\nATIP Pages: 000058-000064\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] [XXX] (the claimant) is a 27-year-old man who is a citizen of the People\u2019s Republic of China (China). He claims that he is a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection pursuant to the provisions of section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).1\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] The claimant is a gay man. He alleges that should he return to China, he would run a significant risk of being subjected to electroshock therapy and other cruel and abusive treatments in order to \u201ccure\u201d him of his gay sexual orientation.\nAllegations of material fact\n[3] The claimant\u2019s story is a sad one and can be seen in its entirety in the narrative portion of his Basis of Claim Form (BOC).2\n[4] Briefly put, the claimant was subjected to severe and even appalling mistreatment by his parents (mainly by his mother) while he was young. This resulted in the claimant running away from home. He was, however, found by his father, returned home, and subjected to more mistreatment.\n[5] The mistreatment had a significant negative effect on the claimant\u2019s physical and mental health. It culminated in the claimant attempting suicide in 2012.\n[6] To make the claimant\u2019s life even more complicated, the claimant discovered when he was a young man that he was gay. He didn\u2019t come out to his parents but maintained that he was bisexual.\n[7] In 2010, the claimant came to Canada as a student to study civil engineering. He returned to China on occasion between 2011 and 2014 but hid his true sexuality from his parents. In his last visit to China in 2014, the claimant \u201ccame out\u201d to his parents as gay. This resulted in the claimant being involuntarily confined to a psychiatric facility (although he was 22 years old at the time) and subjected to electroshock therapy.\n[8] After he had returned to his parents\u2019 home one night, the claimant was able to feign sleep when he surreptitiously did not take the sleeping pills his parents had given him. He escaped from his parents\u2019 house and stayed in a small hotel for a few days before catching his flight back to Canada.\n[9] At present, the claimant is remarried (he had previously married, but divorced). He and his husband travelled from [XXX], where they now reside, for the hearing. The claimant\u2019s husband was an observer at the hearing. I determined that it was not necessary for the claimant\u2019s husband to testify, as I accepted that the claimant was gay.\n[10] The claimant has contact with his parents through an internet service, but they do not discuss the claimant\u2019s sexuality.\n[11] The claimant applied for refugee protection in February 2016 after his studies were temporarily terminated. The claimant\u2019s student visa was valid until [XXX], 2016.\nDETERMINATION\n[12] I accept the certified true copy of the claimant\u2019s Chinese passport tendered in evidence.3 I find that the claimant is a citizen of China and that he is who he claims to be.\nANALYSIS\n[13] By alleging that he would face persecution in China on account of his sexual orientation, the claimant has established a link to a Convention ground (e.g., membership in a particular social group).\n[14] I have accepted this claim for the reasons set out below.\nInitial finding of facts\n[15] This hearing was a de novo hearing of a matter originally heard by a previous panel. The matter was sent back to the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) for redetermination by the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD).\n[16] I have read the reasons of both the previous panel and of the RAD (the hearing transcript was not available). I am of the opinion that I may safely accept the findings of fact made by the previous panel and the RAD without re-litigating them.\n[17] Accordingly, I accept that the claimant is a gay man and that he has psychological and emotional issues. I also accept that the claimant has a history of mental health problems (which is documented in the record), which arose in part from the mistreatment he endured from his parents during his childhood. To this end, I have read the claimant\u2019s medical reports, which form part of the record in this matter.4\nChairperson\u2019s Guideline 9\n[18] In considering this claim, I have been assisted in referencing the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9: Proceedings Before the IRB Involving Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression (SOGIE).5\nThe uniqueness of the claim\n[19] This claim has a unique complexity, because it involves the place and treatment of sexual minorities in China, the place and treatment of sexual minorities in the Chinese mental health system, the after-effects of China\u2019s one-child policy, and the way family ties bind individuals to their families in China in ways that might seem odd to someone looking at the situation through Western eyes.\nDeterminative issue\n[20] The nub of this matter boils down to whether the claimant would face a serious possibility of harm upon return to China because of the interplay of the issues noted above.\n[21] In essence, the claimant alleges that he has a tendency to suffer from depression when he is alone, as a result of the chronic mistreatment by his mother when he was a youngster. The claimant also alleges that China\u2019s one-child policy placed pressure upon him to live up to his parents\u2019 hopes and expectations.\n[22] The claimant further alleges that should he return to China, he would be unable to take his husband with him. As the claimant\u2019s husband has no status in China and the Chinese government does not recognize same-sex marriages, the claimant would be unable to sponsor him. This would result in the claimant, who has already attempted suicide and has suffered from suicidal ideations, needing to seek assistance from the mental health system.\n[23] Because the claimant is gay, the Chinese mental health system would very likely single him out for \u201ccorrective\u201d treatment in order to give him a \u201cnormal\u201d sexual orientation. This would likely involve electroshock therapy of the type that the claimant endured.\n[24] Furthermore, although the claimant is now 27 years old, well-educated, speaks fluent English (no interpreter was required at the hearing), and is considered an emancipated adult, the claimant maintains that in China, filial piety and the Confucian tradition would emotionally compel him to seek out his parents and subject himself to their will, even if he was aware that such a course of action would be profoundly against his own interests.\nCountry condition documents\n[25] According to Human Rights Watch, \u201cHomosexuality is neither a crime nor officially regarded as an illness in China.\u201d6 An article on conversion therapy in China by online publication, Sixth Tone, states that:7\nThe Chinese government decriminalized homosexuality in 1997. Three years later, in 2001, the country\u2019s psychiatric association declassified homosexuality as a mental disorder. However, activists say that there are still few legal protections for LGBT [lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender] people who are targeted for conversion therapy despite notable court cases questioning the practice.\n[26] The article further states that, \u201cClinics are cashing in on prejudices and misinformation that people harbor about the LGBT community.\u201d8\n[27] The SOGIE Guideline indicates that sexual minorities may be forced into various \u201ctreatments,\u201d including electroshock therapy. It notes that these treatments \u201cviolat[e] an individual\u2019s security of the person and [are] persecutory.\u201d9\n[28] It is accepted by this panel that in 2014, the claimant was forced by his parents to undergo electroshock therapy, which constitutes persecution as per the SOGIE Guideline.\n[29] That said, is there a serious possibility of the claimant being forced to undergo electroshock therapy or other such treatments, should he return to China?\n[30] The claimant asserts that this question should be answered in the affirmative for two reasons. Firstly, as someone who is prone to bouts of depression and suicidal ideation, he would be a stranger in a strange land without the support of his husband, his friends, or any of his support network. He would likely spiral into depression and would come into contact with the Chinese mental health system. At that point, he would run to a high risk of some of the cruel and persecutory treatments outlined in the SOGIE Guideline.\n[31] Secondly, the claimant says that if he were to return to China, he would be under the control of his parents. For Westerners, it is difficult for us to imagine how a well-educated and otherwise emancipated adult would come under the control of his parents. In his testimony, the claimant stated that his parents had given him life and that they had the right to take it away from him. He wept when he said that if he were to return to China, it would be emotionally impossible for him to not do what his parents had told him.\n[32] I find myself persuaded by these arguments. I find as a fact that if the claimant were to return to China, his emotional well-being would likely hit rock bottom, bringing him into contact with the Chinese mental health system. There would be, in my view, more than a mere possibility that the claimant would be subjected to persecutory medical treatments for a Convention reason. This, to my mind, makes him a Convention refugee.\n[33] If the claimant were to re-establish contact with his parents in China, this would likely fast-track him to the same type of persecutory treatments.\n[34] In the circumstances, it is not necessary to consider counsel\u2019s \u201ccompelling reasons\u201d submission with respect to section 108(4) of the IRPA.10\n[35] In reviewing this file, I must say that it is a pity that the previous RPD panel chose not to use its discretion and make a positive determination in favour of the claimant, instead of this matter having to be reheard and the claimant and his husband having to travel back to Toronto from [XXX].\nCONCLUSION\n[36] I accordingly find that the claimant is a Convention refugee. His claim is therefore accepted.\n(signed) William T.

Bafaro\nCounsel for the claimant(s): Nahid Rahini\nCountry: Iran\nRPD Number: TB9-00256\nAssociated RPD Numbers: TB9-00268\nATIP Number: A-2020-01124\nATIP Pages: 000053-000057\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: We are back on the record. During the break I had an opportunity to review, consider and weigh all of the evidence which is before me. I find that there is sufficient, credible and trustworthy evidence before me upon which to come to a decision in these refugee claims. I am going to accept these refugee claims.\n[2] MEMBER: Madame Interpreter could you do simultaneous translation please?\n[3] INTERPRETER; Yes I will.\n[4] MEMBER; Thank you very much.\n[5] The claimants [XXX] and [XXX] claim to be citizens of Iran and are claiming refugee protection pursuant to Sections 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[6] I have considered the chairperson\u2019s sexual orientation guidelines in the conduct of this hearing. I find that the claim I find that the claimants are Convention refugees for the following reasons;\n[7] I find that the claimants have established a serious possibility of persecution based upon the Convention ground of a particular social group that is the sexual orientation of [XXX] as a lesbian woman and [XXX] as a gay man.\n[8] The allegations that form the basis for these refugee claims are set in the claimant\u2019s basis of claim forms which are in evidence before me at Exhibits 2 and 3.\n[9] The central event which precipitated the flight of the claimants from Iran and their request for refugee protection in Canada was a gay, lesbian party which they attended in Iran before they left the country on [XXX] 2018.\n[10] Gay and Lesbian people were present at the party with other people as well their friends. The party was raided by the revolutionary guard when the claimants heard commotion, noise, screams. They were able to escape through the back door of the house where the party was being held. People were listening to music and people were drinking at this party. The claimant subsequently found out from the friends that people at this party were arrested, the male claimants partner was arrested at this party are some. The female claimant and her brother were able to escape through the back door and return to their parent\u2019s home. They learned from their friends subsequently that people at the party had been arrested and charged by the authorities with drinking alcohol, with homosexuality and consuming drugs. So that is a summary of the core elements of these refugee claims.\n[11] The Identities of the claimants as citizens and nationals of Iran have been established by the certified true copies of their Iranian passports which are in evidence before me at Exhibit 1.\n[12] The main issue that I had to decide is the credibility of the claimants as it relates to their sexual orientation. Overall I\u2019ve found that the claimants were credible witnesses on a balance of probabilities.\n[13] With regards to the core of their refugee claims that being members of the LGBT community on the basis of their sexual orientation. I therefore believe that what the claimants have alleged in support of their claim.\n[14] Both claimants testified here this morning they testified in a straightforward manner and I find that there are no major inconsistencies and their testimony or contradictions between their testimony and other evidence before me.\n[15] I find that their testimony with regards to their experiences as a lesbian woman and gay man were spontaneous and detailed and also I also find that the manner in which they expressed their experiences as a gay man and lesbian woman were clearly heartfelt.\n[16] Now um\u2026 although the claimants did not provide supporting documents to corroborate their sexual identity I don\u2019t draw any adverse credibility inferences on that basis. The reason being that in Iran which is a very strict Islamic regime and a fundamentalist regime um\u2026 members of the LGBT community cannot express their sexual orientation openly in public. They are only able to express their sexual identities in private. It is also against the law in Iran for men and women to engage in sexual relations with the same sex.\n[17] The female claimant I find did have a reasonable explanation as to why she did not provide any documentation from her partner who has fled the country who was also at the party and is now presently in Turkey. Well first of all there\u2019s a difficult, she\u2019s having difficulty contacting her because the last time she spoke to her which was several months ago this is, she spoke to [XXX] (ph). [XXX] had actually contacted her by using a public phone, the female claimant doesn\u2019t have a telephone number where she can reach the claimant. She also explained that because of [XXX] situation at the present time in Turkey which is rather unstable and because she finds herself in a poor condition that she didn\u2019t think of asking her partner for a letter to corroborate her relationship with her.\n[18] I find that is a reasonable explanation for why we don\u2019t have documentation to substantiate or corroborate the female claimant\u2019s sexual orientation.\n[19] She also had another explanation for why she doesn\u2019t have any documentation to substantiate her sexual identity. She said that when she was at this party she did have a purse and she had a phone and there were photographs on that phone of her partner, unfortunately all of those items were left behind at the party because , because of the raid which took place in which the revolutionary guard stormed the private residence and made arrests obviously the claimant, the female claimant wouldn\u2019t have been in a position to be able to retrieve her purse, her personal effects, her belongings, her phone likewise the same situation applies to her brother who also had his purse there and who, which was also left behind.\n[20] So the other thing I wanted to mention about the credibility of the male claimant and the female claimant is that in Canadian refugee law there\u2019s a presumption claimants are presumed to be telling the truth unless there\u2019s persuasive evidence to the contrary. I find that in this instance there was no persuasive evidence to the contrary.\n[21] The Federal court has also talked about whether or not there is a requirement in Canadian refugee law for external corroboration in order to find a claimant to be credible and there was a case that went to the Federal court and it\u2019s very recent, it\u2019s a decision of the Federal Court of Canada [XXX] from a Mr [XXX] and in paragraph 28 of that judgement he said and I quote There\u2019s no general requirement for corroboration and a panel errs if it makes an adverse credibility finding on the basis of the absence of corroborative evidence alone.\u201d If there are valid reasons to question a claimant\u2019s truthfulness the panel may also consider the claimants failure to provide corroborative evidence, that only where the claimant could not give a reasonable explanation for the absence of such evidence\u201d.\n[22] Now in the case before me I find that because the claimants were generally credible there is no requirement that they provide corroboration and on that basis I do not make any adverse credibility findings based on the failure of the claimants to provide documentary corroboration as it relates to their sexual orientation.\n[23] In terms of the well foundedness of their fear of persecution in Iran I find that the claimants, I find that the claimants subjective here has a objective basis, based on the objective country documentation before me.\n[24] The documentary evidence before me on country conditions indicates that in Iran sorry that Iran is a seriously dangerous place for a lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans or queer person. These documents can be found at Sections 1 to 6.10 of Exhibit 4, which is the national documentation package for Iran.\n[25] Country conditions indicate that Iran is a deeply homophobic society that has severe anti homosexual statues and that it suffers from serious levels of ongoing anti-homosexual violence and persecution. Same document indicates that the Iranian authorities do not provide adequate protection to LCBTQ persons suffering serious human rights abuses of whatever nature in Iran, because the Iranian government and police tend to share and support the deep seeded homophobia found in Iranian society as a whole and those documents indicate that rather than protect Iranian police and authorities persecute LGBTQ persons.\n[26] The test in assessing your risk of harm is forward looking. You testified credibly about your fears regarding returning to Iran as a gay man or homosexual man and a lesbian woman and the treatment you would receive.\n[27] Your testimony was consistent with country conditions in Iran as reported in the documentary evidence. Thus I find there is a objective basis to support your fears based upon your membership in a particular social group of that being members of the LGBTQ community in Iran.\n[28] Having considered all this evidence in your testimony which I believe is credible I find your fear of persecution is well founded and you face a serious possibility of persecution in Iran due to your sexual orientation.\n[29] Given that it\u2019s the Iranian government and authorities that you fear I find it would be objectively unreasonable for you to seek protection of the Iranian government in light of your particular circumstances. I also find that you face a serious possibility of persecution throughout Iran given that the documentary evidence shows that state authorities operate similarly throughout Iran, therefore I do not find that you have viable internal flight alternatives within Iran.\n[30] For all those reasons I can conclude that you are a Convention refugees and I accept your claims. This brings our hearing to a conclusion.\n[31] Thank you Madame Interpreter for your assistance.\n[32] Thank you everybody for your participation.\nREASONS CONCLUDED\n",

Le Tribunal a \u00e9galement accept\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sence d\u2019observatrices \u00e0 titre de soutien psychologique \u00e0 la demanderesse.\n[4] Tout au long de l\u2019audience et en rendant sa d\u00e9cision, le Tribunal a tenu compte des Directives du Pr\u00e9sident relatives aux demandeures d\u2019asile qui craignent la pers\u00e9cution en raison de leur sexe.\nALL\u00c9GATIONS\n[5] La demanderesse est all\u00e9e vivre \u00e0 [XXX] en [XXX] 2011. Elle gagnait sa vie en travaillant dans diff\u00e9rents clubs et discoth\u00e8ques comme serveuse, elle vendait des shooters d\u2019alcool. Elle travaillait toujours dans le m\u00eame domaine \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque o\u00f9 des cartels de drogues tentaient de saisir le contr\u00f4le de la vente de drogues et de services sexuels sur ce territoire. Les m\u00e9dias rapportaient des assassinats et des enl\u00e8vements de personnes qui tentaient de s\u2019opposer aux projets de ces cartels.\n[6] Madame, quant \u00e0 elle, travaillait pour un club dont les propri\u00e9taires \u00e9taient des Chr\u00e9tiens qui offraient des spectacles de qualit\u00e9. Ce genre de club \u00e9tait vraisemblablement plus difficile \u00e0 p\u00e9n\u00e9trer pour ces cartels de vente de drogues.\n[7] La demanderesse a connu un photographe qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 approch\u00e9 par un cartel pour vendre la drogue et des services de prostitution \u00e0 la client\u00e8le de ce club. Lorsque celui-ci a refus\u00e9 de coop\u00e9rer, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 enlev\u00e9, aucune ran\u00e7on n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 demand\u00e9e, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 tortur\u00e9 et ensuite rel\u00e2ch\u00e9.\n[8] Madame a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de cesser de travailler dans ce milieu. Elle s\u2019est retrouv\u00e9e sans emploi pendant quelques mois. Elle a par la suite joint une \u00e9quipe qui vendait des billets pour ces spectacles, de jour, aupr\u00e8s d\u2019une client\u00e8le qui restait dans un h\u00f4tel de luxe.\n[9] Le [XXX] 2017, elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 abord\u00e9e \u00e0 la fin de la journ\u00e9e sur la plage par des gens qui lui ont demand\u00e9 de coop\u00e9rer pour vendre de la drogue et des services de prostitution \u00e0 cette client\u00e8le. La demanderesse a exprim\u00e9 son refus, elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 frapp\u00e9e, menac\u00e9e et a subi des attouchements. \u00c0 l\u2019arriv\u00e9e de certains touristes sur la plage, les individus qui l\u2019avaient ainsi trait\u00e9e se sont enfuis.\n[10] D\u00e8s le lendemain, elle s\u2019est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e pour offrir sa d\u00e9mission. Elle a raison de croire que les agissements des membres de ce cartel \u00e9taient connus de la gestion puisque d\u00e8s son arriv\u00e9e, les gestionnaires avaient les documents n\u00e9cessaires pour la cong\u00e9dier.\n[11] Le [XXX] 2017, lorsqu\u2019elle retournait chez elle vers les [XXX], elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 intercept\u00e9e dans la rue devant sa r\u00e9sidence. Elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 enlev\u00e9e, un mouchoir couvert de produits chimiques a \u00e9t\u00e9 plac\u00e9 sur son visage, ce qui lui a fait perdre connaissance un certain temps. Lors de cet enl\u00e8vement, elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 violemment ross\u00e9e, elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 pass\u00e9e \u00e0 tabac, elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 viol\u00e9e et elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 marqu\u00e9e sur son corps avec des br\u00fblures de cigarette appos\u00e9es sur ses jambes avec une parfaite sym\u00e9trie. La demanderesse croit qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une fa\u00e7on de marquer et identifier les femmes qui sont sous l\u2019emprise de ce cartel.\n[12] Elle a ensuite \u00e9t\u00e9 abandonn\u00e9e. La demanderesse n\u2019a pas port\u00e9 plainte aupr\u00e8s des autorit\u00e9s en raison du fait qu\u2019il \u00e9tait bien connu que celles-ci \u00e9taient soit complices de ces cartels, ou en avaient peur et refusaient d\u2019agir. Ne voulant pas alerter des policiers complices et par le fait m\u00eame, s\u2019attirer des ennuis suppl\u00e9mentaires, elle n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019h\u00f4pital, elle s\u2019est soign\u00e9e elle-m\u00eame comme elle l\u2019a pu.\n[13] Elle a quitt\u00e9 la ville pour aller \u00e0 [XXX], d\u2019abord chez sa m\u00e8re et au fil des mois, par la suite, dans son propre appartement. Environ six mois plus tard, elle \u00e9tait pr\u00eate \u00e0 tenter de travailler pour y refaire sa vie. Elle a trouv\u00e9 des emplois dans le domaine immobilier, dans la restauration.\n[14] \u00c0 la mi-[XXX] 2018, elle a re\u00e7u un appel.

Apeur\u00e9e, la demanderesse a quitt\u00e9 son emploi, elle a quitt\u00e9 son appartement et elle est retourn\u00e9e chez sa m\u00e8re. Juste avant son d\u00e9part du Mexique, elle a pu observer des voitures devant la maison de sa m\u00e8re. Les occupants de celles-ci semblaient surveiller la maison.\n[15] Elle a quitt\u00e9 son pays le [XXX] 2018, elle est arriv\u00e9e au Canada le m\u00eame jour et a demand\u00e9 l\u2019asile le mois suivant. Depuis son arriv\u00e9e au Canada, la demanderesse a su qu\u2019en [XXX] 2018, des gens sont entr\u00e9s chez sa m\u00e8re, ils l\u2019ont ligot\u00e9e et frapp\u00e9e, ils l\u2019ont tenue captive pendant plusieurs heures. Ils ont fouill\u00e9 la maison et ont insist\u00e9 pour savoir o\u00f9 se trouve la demanderesse.\nANALYSE\nIdentit\u00e9\n[16] L\u2019identit\u00e9 de la demanderesse a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie par la preuve testimoniale ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019aide de la preuve documentaire d\u00e9pos\u00e9e au dossier. Celle-ci inclut des photocopies de passeport \u00e9mis par les autorit\u00e9s mexicaines, les originaux desquels ont \u00e9t\u00e9 saisis par les autorit\u00e9s d\u2019immigration canadiennes. Le Tribunal est satisfait de la preuve quant \u00e0 l\u2019identit\u00e9 de la demanderesse.\nCr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9\n[17] Le Tribunal se doit de mentionner que l\u2019\u00e9tat de d\u00e9tresse de la demanderesse est visible dans son visage et dans ses gestes. Malgr\u00e9 cela, elle a r\u00e9pondu aux questions de son conseil et du Tribunal de fa\u00e7on directe. Elle a offert des d\u00e9tails lorsque cela fut requis. Son t\u00e9moignage \u00e9tait souvent \u00e9motif.\n[18] Elle a \u00e9galement d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en preuve des documents pour corroborer les emplois qu\u2019elle a eus. Le Tribunal a \u00e9galement en preuve des photos des marques de br\u00fblures de cigarette sur ses jambes auxquelles elle a fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence auparavant. De plus, la demanderesse a \u00e9galement offert de nombreux d\u00e9tails qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 relat\u00e9s aux intervenantes dans le domaine psychologique dont les rapports sont en preuve. Enfin, la demanderesse a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 des lettres de diff\u00e9rents t\u00e9moins pour appuyer sa demande.\n[19] Son t\u00e9moignage \u00e9tait tout \u00e0 fait conforme au narratif d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en annexe, son formulaire Fondements de la demande d\u2019asile, et les faits relat\u00e9s dans les rapports psychologiques et psychosociaux ainsi que dans les lettres d\u2019appui.\n[20] Le Tribunal croit la demanderesse.\nApplication de l\u2019article 96 de la Loi sur l\u2019immigration et la protection des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s\n[21] Les motifs des agents de pers\u00e9cution sont multiples. D\u2019une part, leur but ultime est de faire de l\u2019argent. Ils ont cibl\u00e9 la demanderesse, la consid\u00e9rant comme \u00e9tant une femme attirante qui serait capable d\u2019aller chercher une client\u00e8le importante pour la vente de drogues et de services de prostitution.\n[22] Les agents de pers\u00e9cution sont possiblement motiv\u00e9s par un esprit de vengeance ou la volont\u00e9 de donner l\u2019exemple \u00e0 d\u2019autres qui auraient pour id\u00e9e de refuser de coop\u00e9rer avec eux, mais essentiellement, lorsqu\u2019une personne est viol\u00e9e, c\u2019est en raison du fait qu\u2019elle appartient au groupe social des femmes, qu\u2019elle est victime. Ainsi, le lien avec la Convention est \u00e9tabli.\n[23] Quant \u00e0 savoir s\u2019il existe une crainte bien fond\u00e9e prospective, le Tribunal note que bien que la demanderesse ait quitt\u00e9 son emploi et tent\u00e9 de refaire sa vie \u00e0 [XXX] qui, par voiture, se trouve \u00e0 24 heures de l\u00e0 o\u00f9 les probl\u00e8mes ont commenc\u00e9, ses pers\u00e9cuteurs ont fini par la retrouver environ six mois plus tard. Ils l\u2019ont menac\u00e9e, ils ont surveill\u00e9 la maison o\u00f9 elle r\u00e9sidait et ils ont fini par traiter la m\u00e8re de la demanderesse avec violence dans le but de retrouver la demanderesse.\n[24] Le Tribunal estime qu\u2019il est raisonnable de croire qu\u2019elle encourt plus qu\u2019une simple possibilit\u00e9 de pers\u00e9cution si elle devait retourner dans son pays aujourd\u2019hui. Ainsi, l\u2019article 96 trouve son application.\nProtection de l\u2019\u00c9tat\n[25] La demanderesse n\u2019a pas demand\u00e9 la protection des autorit\u00e9s mexicaines pour se prot\u00e9ger. N\u00e9anmoins, elle a \u00e9tabli par la preuve documentaire que les cartels qu\u2019elle craint ont su s\u2019imposer, malgr\u00e9 les mesures de protection de l\u2019appareil \u00e9tatique. Ils ont su faire r\u00e9gner un niveau de violence end\u00e9mique, soit en s\u2019assurant la corruption de certains policiers ou encore, en faisant r\u00e9gner la terreur au sein de celles-ci.\n[26] Le Tribunal dispose d\u2019une preuve claire et convaincante de l\u2019incapacit\u00e9 ou du manque de volont\u00e9 de ces autorit\u00e9s de prot\u00e9ger ses citoyens contre la violence exerc\u00e9e par ces cartels, tel que le refl\u00e8te le niveau \u00e9pouvantable de viols et de violence qui se produisent en toute impunit\u00e9.\nPossibilit\u00e9 de refuge int\u00e9rieur\n[27] Le Tribunal n\u2019a pas abord\u00e9 directement la question de la possibilit\u00e9 de refuge int\u00e9rieur dans les questions pos\u00e9es \u00e0 la demanderesse. N\u00e9anmoins, la preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le que la demanderesse a tent\u00e9 de refaire sa vie \u00e0 [XXX], \u00e0 plus de 24 heures de route, si on se d\u00e9place en voiture. La demanderesse a \u00e9t\u00e9 retrouv\u00e9e et menac\u00e9e \u00e0 cet endroit, peu apr\u00e8s avoir repris le travail.\n[28] Cela porte \u00e0 croire que ces cartels b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient de la complicit\u00e9 de gens dans l\u2019appareil \u00e9tatique qui ont acc\u00e8s aux banques de donn\u00e9es des travailleurs. Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, ils ont r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 a trouver et n\u2019ont pas h\u00e9sit\u00e9 \u00e0 la menacer et m\u00eame, \u00e0 faire violence \u00e0 sa m\u00e8re pour essayer de la retrouver.\n[29] Le Tribunal estime que la demanderesse a \u00e9tabli qu\u2019il n\u2019existe aucun endroit o\u00f9 elle pourrait vivre normalement, en toute s\u00e9curit\u00e9 au Mexique. Dans de telles circonstances, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019examiner le deuxi\u00e8me volet de la possibilit\u00e9 de refuge int\u00e9rieur.\nCONCLUSION\n[30] Apr\u00e8s examen de l\u2019ensemble de la preuve, le Tribunal conclut que Madame [XXX] a qualit\u00e9 de r\u00e9fugi\u00e9e au sens de la Convention et par cons\u00e9quent, accueille sa demande d\u2019asile.\n",

        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2019 RLLR 5\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: October 17, 2019\nPanel: Ethan McMonagle\nCountry: Haiti\nRPD Number: MB7-21566\nATIP Number: A-2020-01124\nATIP Pages: 000043-000045\n[1] These are the reasons in the decision in the claim for refugee protection made by [XXX], who claims to be a citizen of Haiti, and is claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. In rendering my reasons, I\u2019ve considered the Chairperson\u2019s guidelines on proceedings before the IRB involving sexual orientation and gender identity and expression.\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] You allege that you are a bisexual man from Haiti. You and your family left Haiti for the Bahamas in 1996 and remained there, until approximately 2010 when you were granted temporary protected status in the United States. Not having permanent status in the United States and fearing a return to Haiti, you claimed refugee protection in Canada at Lacolle, Qu\u00e9bec, on or about October 25th, 2017.\nDETERMINATION\n[3] I find that you are a \u201cConvention refugee\u201d as you have established a serious possibility of persecution on account of your membership in a particular social group of LGBT persons.\nANALYSIS\n[4] The determinative issue in this matter is credibility.\nIDENTITY\n[5] I find that your identity as a national of Haiti is established by your testimony and the supporting documentation filed, which includes your Haitian passport.\nCREDIBILITY\n[6] I find you to be a credible witness and I generally believe what you have alleged in support of your claim. You testified in a straightforward manner, and there were no relevant inconsistencies in your testimony, or contradictions between your testimony and the other evidence before me, which caused me concern or which were not adequately addressed. Your file is reasonably well\u00ad documented, including a supporting letter and an affidavit, and media excerpts and correspondence with an American lawyer opining on your status in the United States. On the basis of your supporting documentation and your credible testimony, I find, on a balance of probabilities, that you are bisexual as you allege to be.\nSTATUS IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\n[7] Regarding your status in the United States, you allege that you only had temporary protected status which was set to expire. Further, now, since you\u2019ve been away from the United States for approximately two years, you are not entitled to re-engage that status. I also note that in 2012, you made an application through your elderly father for permanent residence, but as of the date of this hearing, there is no evidence to suggest that you\u2019ve been granted any status. On the basis of your testimony, the documentary evidence, and Counsel\u2019s submissions and getting through some of that evidence, I am satisfied that you do not have any durable status in the United States.\nOBJECTIVE BASIS\n[8] With regard to Haiti, looking at the documentary evidence in the National Documentation Package, I note a few items. 2.1 notes that local attitudes remain hostile toward LGBT individuals. Some politicians and leaders of organizations actively oppose the social integration of LGBT persons in discussions of their rights. Amnesty International notes that the Haitian Senate supported bills which discriminated against LGBT people, and in fact, it approved a law making same-sex marriage and public support or advocacy for homosexuality illegal. Similarly, Human Rights Watch notes that in 2017, the Haitian Senate passed two anti-LGBT bills which were under consideration as of November 2018. One of which calls for a ban on gay marriage as well as any public support or advocacy for LGBT rights. Should the bill be\u2026 or should this ban become law, the parties and co\u00ad parties and accomplices of any same-sex marriage could be punished by three years in prison and a fine of approximately 8,000 U.S. dollars. On the basis of the documentary evidence and your testimony, and your particular situation, I find that you face a serious possibility of persecution in Haiti.\nSTATE PROTECTION AND INTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE\n[9] And, given the foregoing reference to country conditions in Haiti, and the fact that I find you face a serious possibility of persecution throughout that country, in your particular case, as the agent of persecution could be both State and non-State actors, I find that neither adequate State protection nor a viable internal flight alternative exists in Haiti for you.\nCONCLUSION\n[10] Based on the foregoing, I conclude that you are a \u201cConvention refugee\u201d, and I accept your claim. Welcome to Canada.\n",

The claimant submitted into evidence a letter from the father of the minor claimant consenting to the minor claimant being in Canada with the principal claimant.2\n[3] The hearing was adjourned for the receipt of certain documents, which the claimant\u2019s counsel submitted following the hearing.3\n[4] In its decision, the panel has taken into account Chairperson\u2019s Guidelines number 4 on Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution.4\nALLEGATIONS\n[5] The allegations are contained in the claimants\u2019 Basis of Claim (BOC) forms,5 and are summarized as follows:\n[6] The principal claimant is a citizen of Haiti. The minor claimant is a citizen of the United States.\n[7] The principal claimant alleges that her father, [XXX], is a [XXX], [XXX] and [XXX] activist in Haiti. In particular, he works for the [XXX]-based organization, [XXX], providing [XXX] in Haiti, in order to increase the public\u2019s engagement on [XXX] issues and improve conditions for people living in Haiti.\n[8] The principal claimant alleges that, as a result of her father\u2019s work, she and her siblings and her father were subjected to intimidation and violence by those opposed to his work.\n[9] In [XXX] 2010, two bandits broke into the principal claimant\u2019s home and beat and sexually assaulted her. The bandits told her that the attack was intended as a message to her father to stop doing his [XXX] work. She did not report the incident to police, and fled to the United States within days of the attack.\n[10] The principal claimant lived in the United States, where for a period of time she had temporary protected status. The minor claimant was born in the United States in 2015. His father remains in the United States. On [XXX], 2017, the claimants came to Canada and made their refugee claims.\n[11] The principal claimant has another child, born in the United States in 2011, who continues to live in the United States with his father and is not included in this claim.\nDETERMINATION\n[12] The panel has considered all of the evidence and finds that the principal claimant has established that she faces a serious possibility of persecution in Haiti on the basis of her membership in a particular social group, as a woman fearing gender-related violence in Haiti.\n[13] The panel finds that the minor claimant has not established that he faces a serious possibility of persecution in the United States or that, on a balance of probabilities, he faces a danger of torture or a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual punishment in the United States.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[14] The claimants\u2019 identities are established on a balance of probabilities by their respective passports, certified copies of which were filed in evidence.6\nUnited States-Born Minor Claimant\n[15] The principal claimant did not allege any particular fear for her United States-born son in the United States. She testified that she has no one to care for her son if he was to stay in the United States without her. While the panel acknowledges that family separation is not often a desirable situation, the panel also notes that family separation is not contemplated by either section 96 or subsection 97(1) of the IRPA.7\n[16] The panel finds the claimants have not established that the minor claimant faces a serious possibility of persecution in the United States on a Convention ground. The panel also finds that the claimants have not established, on a balance of probabilities, that the minor claimant faces a danger of torture or a risk to life, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, if he was to return to the United States. As such, he is not a Convention refugee under section 96 or a person in need of protection under subsection 97(1) of the IRPA.\n[17] Accordingly, the analysis below is in respect of the principal claimant only.\nNexus\n[18] For the principal claimant, the allegations establish a nexus to the Convention ground of membership in the particular social group of women fearing gender-related persecution. Thus, her claim has been analyzed pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA.\nCredibility\n[19] The panel finds the principal claimant to be credible as to the key allegations of her claim. Her testimony was detailed, spontaneous and straightforward. She testified credibly with respect to her father\u2019s [XXX] work in Haiti. Specifically, she explained that he is a vocal advocate for the improvement of the socio-economic and other living conditions of the people of Haiti, and is known to vocally criticize the government, no matter which party is in power, for its lack of attention to certain matters. She provided as an example her father\u2019s criticism of the government\u2019s response to the earthquake at the time she was living in Haiti. She also testified credibly about her father\u2019s continued [XXX] work in Haiti, which she believes would continue to put her at risk of being targeted.\n[20] The principal claimant testified credibly with respect to her own experiences in Haiti as a direct result of her father\u2019s work. In [XXX] 2010, after having helped her father with a [XXX] campaign, she was followed home from the market by unknown men. She also testified credibly with respect to the sexual assault she experienced in 2010, in which her aggressors explicitly instructed her to send a message to her father to cease his [XXX] work.\n[21] The principal claimant did not try to embellish or exaggerate her allegations during her testimony. She explained that she was not aware of many details about her father\u2019s work because he did not talk about his work; she was a child when she lived in Haiti, and she moved in with her father only when she was thirteen years of age. Until that time, she had been living with her grandmother. In addition, she explained that her father did not elaborate on the threats he himself received as a result of his work, because he did not want to alarm his children. Nor is the principal claimant aware of details about threats he is receiving in Haiti to this day as a [XXX] advocate. She explained that she harbours resentment toward him for the dangers she faced, and is not particularly close with him as a result.\n[22] In addition, the principal claimant testified that she does not know precisely who her alleged agents of persecution are, just that they are people who are opposed to her father\u2019s stance on [XXX] in Haiti. The panel finds her explanations in all of these matters to be reasonable, particularly considering her age when she left Haiti and the circumstances of the threats she faced, and finds that these matters do not detract from the principal claimant\u2019s credibility generally.\n[23] Moreover, there were no relevant contradictions, inconsistencies or omissions between the principal claimant\u2019s BOC, the adult claimants\u2019 testimonies at the hearing, and the documentary evidence on file that were not reasonably explained.\n[24] In support of her claim, the principal claimant submitted an online article about her father and his [XXX] work in Haiti, for the organization, [XXX].8 In addition, the claimant submitted a statement from her father as to the difficulties faced by the principal claimant in Haiti as a result of his stance on [XXX].9\nObjective Basis\n[25] The principal claimant\u2019s allegations in so far as her father\u2019s work as an activist in Haiti are supported by the objective documentary evidence concerning the dire security situation in Haiti and the prevalence of politically-motivated violence in Haiti.10 The objective documentary evidence also discusses the importance of vengeance as a motivator for violence in Haiti, including politically-motivated violence and violence against activists.11 Moreover, the evidence indicates that, \u201cin cases of political revenge, if those seeking it are serious, if they lose track of someone, they attack the family.\u201d12\n[26] The objective documentary evidence is corroborative of the risks and vulnerabilities facing women in Haiti, specifically those who are heads of households, absent a male protector. The principal claimant is a single mother, and would not have anyone to live with if she was to return to Haiti. Her father, who remains in Haiti, continues in his activism work. However, living with her father would not be a viable prospect as her connection to her father is the very reason for the violence she experienced in Haiti. As such, the panel finds that she does not, on a balance of probabilities, have a male protector in Haiti.\n[27] The documentary evidence indicates that violence against women, including sexual violence, is widespread, a chronic and systemic problem, and is part of a culture of discrimination.13 The documentary evidence also indicates that violence against women and girls has \u201csteadily increased\u201d since 2009.14 Women who head their own households without the presence of a male protector face particular obstacles as regards their security, and also face discrimination in employment and provision of housing.15\n[28] In consideration of the foregoing, the panel finds that the principal claimant has established, on a balance of probabilities, that her father was and continues to be a vocal [XXX] advocate in Haiti and that she experienced sexual violence in Haiti as a direct result of her father\u2019s work. As such, the panel finds that the behavior of the principal claimant is consistent with a subjective fear in Haiti, and that her fear is objectively well-founded.\nState Protection\n[29] The panel finds that the principal claimant has rebutted the presumption of state protection with clear and convincing evidence that the Haitian state would be unable or unwilling to provide her with adequate protection.\n[30] The principal claimant did not report her sexual assault to police in 2010. She was a teenager when it occurred, and she fled the country days later to join her mother who was living in the United States.\n[31] The objective documentary evidence refers to the ineffectiveness and corrupt nature of the police in Haiti, as well as the involvement of Haitian police in human rights violations.16 A Response to Information Request in evidence indicates that in its 2014 report on Haiti, Human Rights Watch stated that \u201cthe weak capacity of the Haitian National Police contributes to overall insecurity in the country.\u201d17 This research document also indicates that the police force is \u201cnot yet able to protect most of the citizens.\u201d18 The research also indicates that there is inadequate protection for targets of acts of revenge in Haiti.19 Moreover, the objective documentary evidence points to a lack of protection for fundamental civil rights in the country, due to the weakness of the legal system, such that it is nearly impossible to call on judiciary channels due to corruption and impunity at all levels of the public administration in Haiti.20\n[32] Women who are the victims of gender-based violence in Haiti, face particular challenges in obtaining state protection. The objective documentary evidence indicates that women are generally reluctant to seek help from the police and to report sexual abuse due to factors such as fear of discrimination, retaliation, stigmatization, the inability of the government to effectively respond to complaints or allegations, and fear of abuse or discriminatory treatment at the hands of police in Haiti.21 Despite the fact that legislation was introduced to enhance protection for women facing gender-based violence, the evidence indicates that the government \u201clacks the capacity to eradicate violence and discrimination against women [and] girls\u201d.22\n[33] Given the evidence, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that if she were to seek it, adequate protection would not be provided to the principal claimant in Haiti. Furthermore, the jurisprudence is clear that the claimant is not required to risk her life seeking inadequate protection merely to demonstrate its ineffectiveness.23\nInternal Flight Alternative (IFA)\n[34] The panel suggested Port de Paix and Cap Hai\u00eftien as potential internal flight alternatives, but finds that the principal claimant does not have a viable IFA in either location.\n[35] The panel concludes that the alleged agents of persecution have the means and motivation to find and harm the principal claimant anywhere in Haiti. The principal claimant provided a credible explanation for the motivation of the bandits to harm her, in connection with her father\u2019s work. Moreover, her father continues to live in Haiti and continues in his advocacy work. Furthermore, the panel has canvassed above the prevalence of politically-motivated violence in Haiti in the objective documentary evidence.\n[36] The claimant testified as to the particular risks to which she would be vulnerable anywhere in Haiti, as a woman, particularly a woman with two children and no male protector, as discussed above. The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the principal claimant would not have the effective protection of a male figure if she were to return to Haiti, which enhances her risk of persecution or harm in the IFA locations, on the basis of her gender.\n[37] In addition, the panel points out the absence of state protection anywhere in Haiti, also discussed above.\n[38] Accordingly, the panel finds that the principal claimant has demonstrated, on a balance of probabilities, that the agents of persecution have the means and the motivation to harm her should she return to Haiti and establish herself in the IFA locations. As such, the panel finds that the possibility of an IFA fails on the first prong.\nDECISION\n[39] After assessing all of the evidence, the panel concludes that if the principal claimant returned to Haiti she would face a serious possibility of persecution under section 96 of the IRPA, on the ground of her membership in the particular social group of women fearing gender-related violence in Haiti. Thus, the panel finds that the principal claimant, [XXX], is a Convention refugee. Accordingly, the panel accepts her claim.\n[40] The minor claimant, [XXX], has not established a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground under section 96 of the IRPA, or that, on a balance of probabilities, he would be personally subjected to a risk within the meaning of subsection 97(1) of the IRPA, in the United States. Accordingly, his claim is rejected.\n(signed) Nicole Ginsberg\n1 July 4, 2019Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27, as amended, sections 96, 97(1)(a) and 97(1)(b).\n2 Document 4 \u2013 Exhibit D-2: Birth Certificate of [XXX], attaching letter from [XXX].\n3 Document 6 \u2013 Letter from [XXX], attaching birth certificate of principal claimant.\n4 Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 4 of the Refugee Protection Division: Guideline issued by the Chairperson pursuant to Section 65(3) of the Immigration Act: Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution.

He is claiming refugee protection under section 961 and subsection 97(1)2 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (hereinafter IRPA).\nALLEGED FACTS\n[2] The claimant was born on [XXX], 1980, and is from [XXX]. His father has lived in the United States for several decades. On [XXX], 1993, one of the claimant\u2019s neighbours was killed by armed criminals. On [XXX], 1993, the claimant was caught up in an altercation between protesters and police officers during a pro-Lavalas protest. On that day, when he was 12 years old, the claimant boarded a boat to the United States and on [XXX], he arrived there. Once in the United States, his father only registered him for school. Later, the claimant obtained \u201cTemporary Protected Status\u201d (hereinafter: TPS).\n[3] In 2014 and 2016, the claimant went to Haiti. In [XXX] 2016, the claimant went to see property that his father had purchased several years earlier, but the claimant discovered that the person who had sold his father the land had resold it to a third party.\n[4] When the claimant went to see the property, he was seen by the person who had sold it to his father, and that person thought the claimant was there to take the land back.\n[5] After that, the seller, not wanting to give the land back, hired two individuals to kill the claimant. However, this attempted murder failed because a conflict broke out between the two individuals. Having been informed of this, the claimant, fearing for his safety, quickly returned to the United States, where he continued to live under TPS.\n[6] After Donald Trump became president of the United States, the claimant received a notice from the American government3 on [XXX], 2017, that his TPS would be extended for six months and that he would then have to return to Haiti.\n[7] Accordingly, fearing that he would be deported, the claimant left the United States on [XXX], 2017, to come to Canada. He arrived that same day and claimed Canada\u2019s protection.\n[8] These are, in essence, the facts alleged by the claimant in support of his refugee protection claim.\nDETERMINATION\n[9] The claimant is not a \u201cConvention refugee\u201d under section 96 of the IRPA, but he is a \u201cperson in need of protection\u201d under subsection 97(1) of the IRPA.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[10] The panel is satisfied as to the claimant\u2019s identity, which was established through the documentary evidence on the record, including a certified true copy of his passport, the original of which was seized by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada.4\nSection 96 of the IRPA\n[11] Firstly, the panel must determine whether the claimant\u2019s situation has a nexus to any of the five Convention grounds, since the claimant stated that he fears people he described as [translation] \u201ccriminals.\u201d\n[12] In this regard, the Federal Court in Ward5 indicates that victims of crime [translation] \u201cdo not meet the criteria for establishing the existence of a particular social group.\u201d\n[13] Consequently, the claimant\u2019s refugee protection claim is rejected under section 96 of the IRPA.\nParagraph 97(1)(a) of the IRPA\n[14] The panel finds that the claimant has not satisfactorily established that the agent of persecution is the state, since the claimant never alleged a fear of his country\u2019s authorities or the Haitian police, but rather of criminals.\n[15] Consequently, the panel must determine that the claimant\u2019s refugee protection claim is rejected under paragraph 97(1)(a) of the IRPA.\nParagraph 97(1)(b) of the IRPA\n[16] Now, would the claimant be subjected \u201cto a risk to their life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment\u201d?\nCredibility\n[17] With regard to the claimant\u2019s credibility, having heard his testimony and analyzed all the evidence on the record, the panel is prepared to give him the benefit of the doubt with respect to the truthfulness of the facts he alleges in support of his refugee protection claim.\n[18] He responded spontaneously and without exaggeration to the questions put to him by his counsel and the panel. The panel noted no contradiction, implausibility or omission of important facts that would undermine the claimant\u2019s overall credibility. This was despite the panel\u2019s certain reservations regarding the explanations provided by the claimant when he was questioned as to why he had not claimed protection in Canada upon his arrival. However, the panel does not find this fatal in the claimant\u2019s specific case given the overall credibility of his testimony.\n[19] With regard to the application of the definition of \u201cperson in need of protection,\u201d there is every reason to believe that the claimant has discharged his burden of proof. In fact, the panel finds that, in his particular case, the claimant is right to fear for his life if he were to return to Haiti.\n[20] Moreover, in making this determination, the panel considered not only the claimant\u2019s testimony and the evidence he filed in support of his refugee protection claim, but also the extensive documentary evidence from independent and reliable sources on the situation in Haiti.\n[21] In fact, the documentary evidence states:\nIn correspondence sent to the Research Directorate, an official from the National Human Rights Defense Network (R\u00e9seau national de d\u00e9fense des droits humains, RNDDH) [4] stated that acts of revenge are generally motivated by political rivalries, the settling of scores, or romantic relationships (RNDDH 8 June 2018). \u2026 According to the RNDDH, [translation] \u201cacts of revenge can be targeted or indirect. The idea is to send a message\u201d (RNDDH June 8 2018). Sources stated that those targeted by acts of revenge are either people who have done something wrong in the eyes of the assailant or those close to them (D\u00e9fenseurs Plus 7 June 2018; Assistant Professor I June 201 8).6 [Emphasis added]\n[22] The documentary evidence also states:\nOFPRA adds that [translation] \u201cunder these conditions, land ownership disputes are frequently being resolved with weapons, rather than being brought before a judge. An owner of a disputed property may turn to people who have weapons\u201d (France 15 Sept. 2017, 27).7\nState protection\n[23] The panel finds that the claimant, in his particular case, cannot expect to obtain the protection of the Haitian authorities. In fact, the extensive documentary evidence from independent and reliable sources states:\nHowever, the RNDDH states that [translation] \u201cthe police system is overwhelmed by the insecurity\u201d in the country (RNDDH 3 May 2019, para. 51). In the same vein, the Assistant Professor writes that the PNH \u201ccontinues to struggle to protect the population from both organized and informal criminals,\u201d and added that, since MINUSTAH\u2019s departure, the PNH has been unable to fully assume its responsibilities (Assistant Professor 20 May 2019). According to the RNDDH, police officers themselves are targeted by criminals, noting that 15 police officers were killed between January and April 2019 (RNDDH 3 May 2019, paras. 2-4). According to the Assistant Professor, police officers do not take initiative in crime prevention and \u201crarely\u201d conduct criminal investigations (Assistant Professor 20 May 2019). The same source adds that the police \u201cdo not feel they have the expertise to investigate crimes or interact with victims or criminals\u201d (Assistant Professor 20 May 2019). In the same vein, the RNDDH representative stated that [translation] \u201c[f]ew police operations are carried out. They are inconclusive. The individuals arrested are generally not involved in the crimes\u201d (RNDDH 17 May 2019). The RNDDH report adds that [translation] \u201cthe rare efforts [made by the PNH] to arrest armed criminals mean that, in the majority of cases, the criminals are unconcerned about the courts\u201d (RNDDH 3 May 2019, para. 51).8 [Emphasis added]\nInternal flight alternative\n[24] When questioned about an internal flight alternative (IFA) in J\u00e9r\u00e9mie, the claimant stated that it was not feasible, since nowhere in Haiti was safe, implying that he would be found by the person who had sold the land to his father.\n[25] That said, the panel considers that, in the claimant\u2019s particular case, an IFA is not feasible. Moreover, the documentary evidence states the following:\nThe Chancellor stated that the main way of tracking victims down was \u201cindividual networks\u201d (Chancellor 18 June 2018). According to The Assistant Professor, rumours are rife in Haiti and are an effective way of locating people because \u201cHaitians tend to be geographically tied to a small area and so anyone outside of their [usual] circle will be quickly recognized\u201d (Assistant Professor 1 June 201 8).9 [Emphasis added]\n[26] In addition, the same documentary evidence from reliable and trustworthy sources also states:\n\u2026 The same source indicated that she had experienced this reality when she was trying to find former participants in a study while doing field research, asking neighbours where the former participants were was generally enough to locate them (Assistant Professor 1 June 2018).10\n[27] After analyzing all the evidence on the record, the panel is not satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant would not be running a serious risk of persecution if he had to avail himself of an IFA in his country of origin. Moreover, the panel finds that the claimant\u2019s particular situation is such that it would be unreasonable for him to seek refuge in another part of the country.\nCONCLUSION\n[28] After analyzing the testimonial and documentary evidence, the panel determines that the claimant [XXX], is not a \u201cConvention refugee\u201d under section 96 of the IRPA, but is a \u201cperson in need of protection\u201d under subsection 97(1) of the IRPA.\n[29] Consequently, the panel allows his refugee protection claim.\n(signed) Jean-Guy Jam\nSeptember 10, 2019\n1 96.

        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2019 RLLR 2\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: December 23, 2019\nPanel: Marcelle Bourassa\nCounsel for the claimant(s): Nicholas Owodunni\nCountry: Nigeria\nRPD Number: TB9-01394\nAssociated RPD Numbers: TB9-01395\nATIP Number: A-2020-01124\nATIP Pages: 000014-000024\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] The claimant, [XXX] and her daughter, [XXX] (the \u201cminor claimant\u201d), claim to be a citizens of Nigeria, and are claiming refugee protection pursuant to s. 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).i\n[2] The claimant was appointed as the designated representative for the minor claimant.ii\n[3] Since the claimant\u2019s claim involved allegations regarding sexual orientation, the panel considered the Chairperson\u2019s Guidelines on Refugee Claimants involving sexual orientation and gender identity and expression (SOGIE). As the claimant\u2019s claim also related to her gender, the panel also considered the Chairperson\u2019s Guidelines on Women refugee claimants fearing gender\u00ad related persecution.\nALLEGATIONS\n[4] The allegations are set out in the claimant\u2019s Basis of Claim (BOC) form.iii In short, the claimant alleges a fear of persecution based on her sexual orientation from the police, her former husband, his extended family and his associates, her community in Ekiti State, Lagos State and in Abuja. She identifies as a bisexual woman. She alleges that her sexual orientation has been exposed to family members, her community, and the police by her former husband. She alleges that her former husband has also exposed her same sex partner.\n[5] The claimant also alleges a fear of persecution at the hands of her former husband who wants her to undergo a ritual cleaning. She further alleges a fear of persecution for the minor claimant from her former husband who wants to have their daughter circumcized. If returned to Nigeria, she fears she could be arrested and detained by the police or forced to undergo a ritual cleansing.\nDETERMINATION\n[6] Having considered the totality of the evidence, the panel finds that the US minor claimant, [XXX], is not a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 nor is she a person in need of protection under subsection 97(l) of the IRPA.iv Counsel indicated clearly at the beginning of the hearing that he was not leading any evidence with respect to the US minor claimant, a citizen of the United States (\u201cUS\u201d).v In respect to this claim, the panel does not have any persuasive evidence before it to suggest that the minor claimant would face a serious possibility of persecution in the US, or that she would face a danger of torture, a risk to her life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in the US were she to return there. Therefore, the panel rejects the claim of the US minor claimant. The remainder of this decision will refer to the claimant.\n[7] Having considered the totality of the evidence, the panel finds the claimant, [XXX] to be a Convention refugee as she has established a well-founded fear of persecution based on a Convention ground, namely her membership in a particular social group, being a bisexual woman.\nANALYSIS\nIDENTITY\n[8] The panel finds that the claimant\u2019s personal identity and as a citizen of Nigeria has been established on a balance of probabilities. This has been established through her testimony and the supporting documents on file that include her passport, a certified true copy of which was provided to the Board by CBSA.vi\nClaim based on her sexual orientation as a bisexual woman\nCREDIBILITY\n[9] Overall, the panel found the claimant was a credible witness and believes what she has alleged in support of her claim. She was overcome with emotion at times and had to pause in giving her testimony. She answered all questions asked with a sufficient level of detail. She also provided supporting documentation. There were no major contradictions or omissions that went to the core of the claim. There were few minor inconsistencies. For example, she did to include the name of her first spouse in Schedule A. She testified that she is divorced from her first husband, [XXX] since 2013 and she refers to him in her BOC narrative. This was also an [XXX] She explained that she included the name of her most recent spouse and didn\u2019t know that she had to write down everything. The panel finds her explanation to be reasonable.\n[10] The claimant provided spontaneous details about her same sex relationship with [XXX] including how they first became involved with one another in 1988 while attending secondary school as boarders in Rivers State and a particular incident when they were discovered together by her mother. They lost contact when the claimant moved away to live with her father in [XXX] in Ondo State. She described in spontaeous detail how they reconnected in [XXX] 2015, meeting by chance when she recognized [XXX] voice while shopping with her daughter at the [XXX]. The panel observed the claimant to \u2018light up\u2019 when talking about [XXX] and especially so about their chance encounter when they reconnected after so many years. The claimant testifed that she was going through a particularly bad time as her marriage to [XXX] was both emotionally and physically abusive. [XXX] marriage had not worked out as her husband had divorced her when she did not produce a child. She had come to live and work in Lagos. They resumed their relationship.\n[ 11] The claimant also provided spontaneous details about the evening in [XXX] 2015 when her husband came home unexpectedly and found the claimant and her partner [XXX] being intimate. Pauline escaped. The claimant testified that she tried to work things out with her husband but things only got worse. He told her he was not longer interested in her and became involved with other women. She left with her daughter to live with her sister and her family in [XXX] in [XXX] Ibom State. They returned to [XXX] in [XXX] 2016 and went to live with [XXX] She stated that her husband had divorced her and continued to contact her by phone as he insisted on their daughter undergoing circumcision as he did not want her to turn out to be promiscuous like the claimant. Her husband located them and they fled to [XXX] to stay with a cousin of [XXX]. She made plans to leave Nigeria. [XXX] did not accompany them as she could not obtain a US visa.\n[12] The claimant testified that her former husband subsequently located [XXX] at her home in [XXX] in search of the claimant and outed her to neighbours. She relocated to a friend\u2019s home but the claimant\u2019s former husband located her at her place of work. [XXX] was scarred and eventually left Nigeria and is in the Ukraine. They re-established contact late in 2018 and talk from time to time.\n[13] The claimant testified that her family informed her that her former husband went to her father\u2019s home in [XXX] and reportedly created a scene and outed here to her father and community. She was told that he said that he had gone to the police to report her.\n[14] The claimant testified that she joined the Montreal LGBTQ in 2018 while living in Montreal and participated in various activities including Montreal Pride 20I8. She made a good friend while living in Montreal who provided a letter of support. She relocated to Toronto in [XXX] 2018. She is a member of The [XXX] and completed the Newcomer Orientation and attends the Among Friends program. She is also a member of the [XXX] and attends church service regularly. She also volunteers at the [XXX]. She stated that she is interested in participating in these groups and that it is a place for her to socialize and make friends. She also attended Toronto Pride 2019.\n[15] Since being in Canada, the claimant stated that she has not been involved in a same sex relationship but would like to be as she is lonely. She tried one dating app but it didn\u2019t work out.\n[16] The claimant provided documentation in support of her allegations including:\n\u2022 A letter confirming the claimant\u2019s membership in the Montreal [XXX] for 2018-19;vii\n\u2022 The claimant\u2019s membership card for the Montreal [XXX] and a ticket stub for [XXX];viii\n\u2022 A Statement of Membership for the [XXX] and a record of attendance at the Newcomer Orientation Training.ix\n\u2022 Photos of the claimant attending activities at the [XXX] at Montreal Pride 2018, Toronto Pride 2019 and with her girlfriend;x\n\u2022 A psychological assessment from Dr. [XXX], that refers to her relationship with her same sex partner.xi\n\u2022 A letter of support from [XXX] confirming that she first met the claimant in Montreal at a gay pride club party in [XXX] 018, that they subsequently became friends and that she is aware that the claimant was caught by her husband while with her same sex partner in Nigeria and subsequently left the country;xii\n\u2022 An exchange of e-mails between the claimant and her father confirming that he is aware of her sexual orientation that she was caught with Pauline by her former husband, that she has brought shame to him and the entire family and that she should not think of returning to Nigeria as many people are aware of what happened;xiii\n\u2022 A letter of support from her sister [XXX] confirming that she is aware of the claimant\u2019s sexual orientation and expressing her acceptance and support for the claimant;xiv\n\u2022 An e-mail from [XXX] confirming that she left Nigeria and that the claimant\u2019s former husband located here at her home in Lagos and at work while searching for the claimant and outed her to neighbours,xv\n\u2022 A copy of the claimant\u2019s certificate of marriage to [XXX] and a certificate of divorce.xvi\n[17] The panel has considered the claimant\u2019s testimony that she applied for asylum in the US but left before a decision had been made. The claimant testified that they had been living at a Church in Indianapolis and had heard that ICE had picked up people at a church in Texas and deported them. She explained that she was very scarred and couldn\u2019t get in touch with her lawyer. Other persons at the church had left for Canada and she decided to do the same thing. She provided a copy of the documentation in her possession about her asylum application. The panel has considered the evidence before the panel including her reasons for leaving the US and finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant has no status in the US.\n[18] Considering the totality of the evidence before it, the panel finds that the claimant to be a credible witness and therefore believes what she has alleged in support of her claim as set out in her oral and written testimony. Specifically, the panel finds the claimant credible in regards to her bisexual orientation, that she was involved in a same-sex relationship with [XXX] and that, on a balance of probabilities, her sexual orientation has been exposed. Therefore, the panel finds that claimant has established on a balance of probabilities that she is a bisexual woman and has a subjective fear of persecution in Nigeria.\nOBJECTIVE BASIS\n[19] The panel finds based on a review of the documentary evidence including the national documentation packagexvii and counsel\u2019s disclosurexviii that the claimant would face more than a mere possibility of persecution should she return to Nigeria as a bisexual woman. The documentation evidence supports her allegations that LGBT persons in her circumstances face persecution from Nigerian authorities.\n[20] The panel has considered the objective documentary evidence that indicates that federal criminal law deems same-sex activity punishable by up to 14 years in prison.xix Also, the Same Marriage Prohibition Act (SSMPA) enacted in 2014 effectively renders illegal all forms of activity supporting or promoting LGBT rights.\n[21] Following the passage of the SSMPA, there were reports of increased threats and harassment against LGBT persons based on perceived sexual orientation or gender identity.xx\n[22] The social context in Nigeria is intolerant of sexual minoritiesxxi. LGBT persons are treated with disdain and disregard for their fundamental human rights and face being ostracized from their community, acts of violence, stigma and reproach.xxii LGBT persons in Nigeria do not openly identify as members of the LGBT community and they may be at risk of mob attacks and arbitrary arrest across Nigeria.\n[23] Another source states that there have been recorded instances of corrective rape against lesbian and bisexual women and women being forced into marriage because of their sexual orientation or gender identity and psychological violence such as being cut off from friends, family disowning their daughters and other subtleties of violence.xxiii\n[24] According to one source, people detained by authorities for same-sex activity have been forced to name others associated with them. Suspects arrested for homosexuality are put under considerable pressure to confess and sentences passed on confessions cannot be appealed.xxiv Chances of getting a fair trial once arrested or persecuted are considered non-existent.xxv\n[25] Human Rights Watch refers to reports of scores of persons being arrested, detained and prosecuted based on their real or perceived sexual orientation and gender identity in its January 2019 report.xxvi\n[26] According to another source, there is no government support for LGBT persons and the National Human Rights Commission does not actively pay attention to cases of human rights violations of LGBT people.xxvii\n[27] Considering all of the evidence including, the documentary evidence as well as the credible evidence of the claimant as to her sexual orientation, the panel finds that hers fear of persecution is objectively well-founded and that she would face more than a mere possibility of persecution should she return to Nigeria as a bisexual woman.\nSTATE PROTECTION\n[28] Based on the claimant\u2019s personal circumstances as well as the objective country documentation as referred to above, the panel finds on a balance of probabilities that the claimant has rebutted the presumption of state protection with clear and convincing evidence. State protection is not available to the claimant as same-sex activity is criminalized in Nigeria.\nINTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE\n[29] Based on the objective documentary evidence as set out above, the panel finds on balance of probabilities that there would be a serious possibility of persecution throughout Nigeria for the claimant as same-sex activity is criminalized in Nigeria and as such there is no viable IFA.\n[30] Given the panel\u2019s finding that this issue is determinative of the claim, it is not necessary to consider her claim on the basis on her alleged fear of persecution due to gender based violence.\nCONCLUSION\n[31] For the foregoing reasons, the panel finds that the claimant is a Convention refugee and accepts her claim.\n(signed) M.

The panel provided post-hearing disclosureiii and provided counsel with an opportunity to provide further written submissions by July 29, 2019.\nALLEGATIONS\n[5] The specifics of the claims are in the narrative of the male claimant\u2019s Basis of Claim form (BOC).iv In short, the male claimant fears persecution from then [XXX] and his gang. The male claimant alleges that [XXX] will always be after him as he dared to oppose him for the coveted position of Chairman.\n[6] The male claimant stated that he was elected to the position of [XXX] in [XXX] in Lagos State in 2012.v He alleges that he demonstrated his intention to be elected to the position of Chairman of the Unit in the 2016 elections and that his candidacy was opposed by [XXX] who also wanted the position. The claimant alleges that [XXX] is well connected politically.\n[7] The male claimant alleges that he received threatening phone calls from [XXX] and from other unknown callers. He further alleges that on [XXX], 2016, about one month before the elections, he was attacked by [XXX] and his gang on his way in to work. He managed to escape and fled to [XXX] in Ogun State.\n[8] The male claimant alleges that the shop where his wife sells [XXX] was ransacked by three members of [XXX] gang in order to force him out of hiding. They threatened to kill the male claimant. The female claimant testified that she and the woman who assisted her in her shop managed to escape.\n[9] The male claimant alleges that about three days after the attack on his wife\u2019s shop, he was attacked at the place where he was staying in [XXX]. He was injured in the attack but managed to escape and flee to [XXX] in Ogun State. His wife and children relocated to her mother\u2019s house in [XXX] in Ogun State.\n[10] The male claimant alleges that he moved around until he and the female claimant fled Nigeria on [XXX], 2017 and travelled to the United States, where their daughters joined them. The family travelled to Canada and arrived on [XXX], 2018.\n[11] Since their arrival in Canada, the female claimant has been diagnosed as HIV positive and alleges a well-founded fear of persecution if she were to return to Nigeria as a woman living with HIV.\nDETERMINATION\n[12] The panel determines that the male claimant has failed to establish, on a balance of probabilities, a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or a danger of torture in the proposed internal flight alternative (IFA) of Port Harcourt under section 97(1) of IRPA. However, the male claimant has established, on a balance of probabilities, that in the personal circumstances of the family including the two minor claimants, the proposed IFA of Port Harcourt would be objectively unreasonable or unduly harsh.\n[13] Additionally, the panel determines that the female claimant faces a serious possibility of persecution on the basis of her membership in a particular social group as a female living with HIV and that there is no IFA.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity Is established\n[14] The panel is satisfied that the personal identities and country of reference for all of the claimants have been established, on a balance of probabilities, by the male and female claimants\u2019 testimony, and by their Nigerian passports.vi\nIs there a viable IFA in Port Harcourt?\n[15] In order to determine whether a viable IFA exists, the panel must consider a two-prong test.vii The panel must be satisfied that, on a balance of probabilities, there is no serious possibility of persecution in the IFA and\/or no risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in the part of the country in which it finds an IFA exists. Furthermore, conditions in that proposed part of the country must be such that it would not be unreasonable, in all circumstances, including those particular to the claimants, for them to seek refuge there.\nJurisprudential Guide TB7-19851\n[16] The Chairperson has identified the Refugee Appeal Division (\u201cRAD\u201d) decision for TB7- 19851 as being a jurisprudential guide (the \u201cJG\u201d). This JG addresses internal flight alternatives in major cities in south and central Nigeria for claimants fleeing non-state actors.\n[17] The panel has considered the applicability of the JG that involved a woman fearing her family, with allegations of a forced marriage and female genital mutilation. The panel is not adopting the JG for its factual similarity but for its analysis of similar components to someone in Nigeria fearing non-state actors, being assessed on IFA. As the claimants had been residing in Lagos State, the panel proposed Port Harcourt as an IFA location.\nThere is no serious possibility of persecution or of s.97 harm in Port Harcourt\n[18] The panel is guided by the analysis in the JG at paragraphs 17 to 19. Most Nigerians fearing non-state actors can safely relocate to another large urban centre. Nigeria is a large country with a population of 203,452,505 covering an area of over 900,000 square kilometres.viii As noted in TB7-19851, there are several very large, multilingual, multiethnic cities in south and central Nigeria, including Port Harcourt (2.343 million), where persons fleeing non-state actors may be able to establish themselves depending on their own particular circumstances.ix\n[19] The male claimant has the burden of providing evidence that the agent of harm has the ability to locate him in the proposed IFA and the panel is not persuaded that he has met his onus.x\n[20] The male claimant alleges that the agent of harm, [XXX], is highly connected within the [XXX] which is a national organization. He alleges that [XXX] will always be after him as he dared to oppose him for the coveted position of Chairman. Once he returns to Nigeria he could easily be found within the union.\n[21] The panel is not persuaded based on a balance of probabilities and the evidence before it that the male claimant needs work as a [XXX] and thereby be located within the [XXX].\n[22] Furthermore, the panel is not persuaded, on a balance of probabilities. as to the continued interest in the claimant by the agent of harm, [XXX], if he were not involved in the [XXX]. When asked by the panel about the outcome of the 2016 election for the position of Chairman of the unit the male claimant explained that he did not trouble himself to find out. This is so even though he testified that he had been in touch with other Unit Chairmen of the [XXX] through his brother.\n[23] Therefore, the panel finds that the male claimant has not established a serious possibility of persecution or, on a balance of probabilities, a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or a danger of torture in the proposed IFA of Port Harcourt.\nThe proposed IFA is not reasonable\n[24] In considering this IFA, the panel is mindful that the Federal Court of Appeal has set a very high threshold for the unreasonableness prong of the IFA test. Indeed, \u201cit requires nothing less than the existence of conditions which would jeopardize the life and safety of a claimant.\u201dxi The Federal Court of Appeal has also been clear that the personal circumstances of a claimant must be central to the reasonableness analysis.xii The question to be answered on the second prong of the test is whether expecting a claimant to relocate to the proposed IFA location would be \u201cunduly harsh.\u201dxiii The panel is also guided by the analysis of the RAD in the above noted jurisprudential guide.\n[25] The claimants are a married couple with two children. In addition, the female claimant has been diagnosed as HIV positive since her arrival in Canada. She submitted a medical reportxiv from Dr. [XXX] in [XXX] that confirms her HIV positive diagnosis.\nTransportation, Travel and Language\n[26] The panel must consider the male claimant and his family\u2019s ability to travel safely and stay in the IFA without facing undue hardship. As per the JG, the panel notes that Nigerians have the right to reside in any part of the country and the documentary evidence shows that all main centers are linked by road; in addition, many of the large urban centers boast international airports, which mitigate in favour of viability of the proposed IFA in terms of transit and travel for a given claimant without facing undue hardship. The panel notes that Port Harcourt has an airport.xv The panel finds that travel to Port Harcourt does not render Port Harcourt to be an unreasonable IFA.\n[27] English is the official language in Nigeria, and a large percentage of the population speaks Hausa, Yoruba, Igbo (IBO), and Fulani in the major centres, in addition to over 500 indigenous languages. Fluency in one or more of these languages will mitigate against a finding of unreasonableness due to a language barrier in an IFA where a claimant speaks English or the regional languages of Hausa, Yoruba, Igbo (Ibo) and, or Fulani, as appropriate.\n[28] The male and female claimants provided their testimony through a Yoruba interpreter. The male claimant stated that he understands English and also speaks a little English. The panel notes that both claimants speak Yoruba and that Yoruba is widely spoken across Southern Nigeria including specifically in Port Harcourt.\n[29] The panel finds that language does not render Port Harcourt to be an unreasonable IFA.\nReligion and indigeneship\n[30] The male and female claimant identify as Muslim and Yoruba.\n[31] The panel finds for the same reason as in the JGxvi, the factors of religion and indigeneship would not rise to the level necessary to make the proposed IFA unduly harsh or unreasonable.\nEducation and Employment\n[32] The male claimant stated that he has only worked as a [XXX] except when he worked briefly as a [XXX] person a long time ago. He does not believe that he could find work [XXX] for a company. He added that people prefer to buy new [XXX] as opposed to [XXX] their old ones. It would not be reasonable to expect him to find other work with a high school education.\n[33] The documentary evidence indicates that there is a high rate of unemployment in Nigeria generally, and that obtaining employment can be difficult. The documentary evidence further indicates that the total years of education completed on average for Nigerian men is 9 years, whereas for women it is 8 years.\n[34] The male claimant has 10 years of completed education which is just above the average for Nigerian men. While the male claimant\u2019s work experience has been mostly as a [XXX], he has done other work, namely as a [XXX] person. He need not work as a [XXX]. He also has some experience at the management level in running the Unit. The panel finds the male claimant would not have be in a worse situation as compared to the average Nigerian man in finding employment had it not been for his wife\u2019s HIV diagnosis.\n[35] The female claimant only has six years of completed education which is below the average for Nigerian woman. The claimant operated a shop while living in Nigeria where she sold [XXX] such as [XXX] and [XXX]. The panel finds that the female claimant\u2019s personal circumstances as a woman living with HIV do not weigh in favour of her being able to find employment as compared to the average Nigerian woman or operate a business selling [XXX].\n[36] The female claimant testified as to the high degree of social stigmatization for persons diagnosed with HIV. So great is her concern, that the only person in her family who knows about her HIV status is her husband.\n[37] The documentary evidence demonstrates that persons living with HIV and AIDS, and women in particular, face pervasive social stigma and discrimination. According to the US Department of State Report,xvii persons with HIV\/AIDS, often lost their jobs.\n[38] Other objective documentary evidencexviii also notes that persons living with HIV and their family members (emphasis added) experience stigma and discrimination on a daily basis as a result of their HIV status, by work place colleagues and at the community level. There are also reported cases of social exclusion and discrimination at the community level by mostly women living with HIV and by workers at the work place and reported cases of social and work place unlawful termination, rejection and exclusion.\n[39] Based on the foregoing, the panel finds that neither the male or female claimants are likely to find employment in Port Harcourt and that conditions in the IFA would rise to the level necessary to make the proposed IPA unduly harsh or unreasonable.\nAccommodation\n[40] The documentary evidence indicates that rent can be steep in location such as Port Harcourt where the cost of living is high. Given the above-noted documentary evidence that demonstrates that persons living with HIV and their family members experience stigma and discrimination on a daily basis as a result of their HIV status, the panel finds that the male claimant and his family are not likely to be able to secure accommodation in Port Harcourt. The panel finds that conditions in the IFA rise to the level to make Port Harcourt objectively unreasonable or unduly harsh.\nAvailability of medical and mental health care and education\n[41] The female claimant submitted a medical reportxix from her doctor that indicates she is currently maintained on [XXX], 1 tablet daily and [XXX] and is stable. Her HIV viral load is undetectable.\u2019\n[42] The female claimant stated that she has days when she feels fine and other days when she does not. She is well treated by her doctor and nurse in Canada and has access to anti-retroviral medication. She testified that she can lead a normal life in Canada even though she is HIV positive.\n[43] In addition to her above concerns about stigmatization and discrimination of persons living with HIV, she is concerned about accessing medical services and what will happen if she stops taking her anti-retroviral medication.\n[44] The documentary evidencexx indicates that anti-retroviral treatment is provided free of charge to eligible patients. However, there are recurring drug shortages of anti-retrovirals and that facilities that administer anti-retrovirals to patients experience stock-outs.\n[45] It is also noted that just 33 per cent of all people living with HIV were receiving anti\u00ad retroviral treatment in 2017. It was also noted that weaknesses in the health system exist and create a barrier to people accessing or staying on treatment.xxi\n[46] The objective documentary evidencexxii also notes that persons living with HIV and their family members (emphasis added) experience stigma and discrimination on a daily basis as a result of their HIV status by caregivers at health centres.\n[47] Based on the foregoing, the panel finds that conditions in the IFA would rise to the level necessary to make the proposed IFA unduly harsh or unreasonable.\n[48] In consideration of all of the above circumstances, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the male claimant has shown that in the personal circumstances of the family, including the two minor claimants, the proposed IFA of Port Harcourt would be objectively unreasonable or unduly harsh.\nThere is a serious possibility of persecution for the female claimant because of her HIV positive diagnosis\n[49] The panel also finds that female claimant\u2019s personal circumstances and vulnerabilities as a woman living with HIV when viewed in light of the objective documentary evidence as referred to above are such that she could be subject to discrimination that could amount to persecution cumulatively should she return to Nigeria. The documentary evidence as referred to above notes that discrimination against persons living with HIV pervades all aspects of life, including healthcare and employment that cumulatively could lead to an insecure life for the female claimant and rise past the level of discrimination to persecution.\n[50] Therefore, the panel finds that there is more than a mere possibility that the female claimant could face a well-founded fear of persecution based on her membership in a particular social group as a woman living with HIV.\n[51] Furthermore, the panel finds that state protection would not reasonably be forthcoming in her case on a balance of probabilities. The documentary evidence indicates that Nigeria is taking some steps to protect persons living with HIV and AIDS. For example, the United States Department of State Report, at item 2.1 in the NDP,xxiii reports that authorities and NGOs sought to reduce the stigma and change perceptions through public education campaigns.\n[52] A national anti-discrimination law came into place in 2014.xxiv However, this has not yet translated down to the community level. As noted by one source, most Nigerians living with HIV still nurture the fear of the unknown, and therefore hardly report incidents of discrimination and violence against them.xxv The few that report have their incident cases first filed at the community level through their support group to the police station, and most times through the National Human Rights Commission (\u201cNHRC\u201d). Most of those cases filed at the first level of the NHRC do not see the light of day because of fear of publicity and breach of confidentiality.xxvi\n[53] Most of the people living with HIV\/AIDS whose rights were violated do not recognize their fundamental human rights or know where to report the cases and\/or document such cases, while the few who are knowledgeable about their rights could not get justice due to the high level of stigma and ignorance at the judiciary and legal system of Nigeria.xxvii\n[54] Based on the female claimant\u2019s personal circumstances and vulnerabilities as a woman living with HIV, as well as the documentary evidence, the panel finds on balance of probabilities that the female claimant has rebutted the presumption of state protection. Adequate state protection would not reasonably be forthcoming to the female claimant.\n[55] Furthermore, the panel finds that there is no IFA for the female claimant based on her personal circumstances and vulnerabilities as a woman living with HIV, given that there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout Nigeria.\nCONCLUSION\n[56] The panel finds that the male claimant has failed to establish, on a balance of probabilities, a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or a danger of torture in the proposed IFA of Port Harcourt under section 97(1) of IRPA. However, the male claimant has discharged the burden to show, on a balance of probabilities, that in their personal circumstances, the proposed IFA of Port Harcourt would be objectively unreasonable or unduly harsh for all of the claimants as a family. Additionally, the panel finds that the female claimant faces a serious possibility of persecution throughout Nigeria on the basis of her membership in a particular social group as a female living with HIV and that there is no IFA\n[57] The panel accordingly accepts each claim.\n(signed) M.
