Neill\nCountry: Iran\nRPD Number: TB8-29619\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2020-00859\nATIP Pages: 003619-003623\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] These are the reasons for the decision in the claim of Mr. XXXX XXXX who claims to be a citizen of Iran and is seeking refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).i\nDETERMINATION\n[2] The panel finds that the claimant is a Convention refugee under section 96 of IRPA for the following reasons.\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] To summarize the allegations in the Basis of Claim (BOC)ii dated November 7, 2018, the claimant fears harm at the hands of the Iranian authorities as a convert from Islam to Christianity. With relatives in Canada, the claimant made two previous trips before seeking refugee protection during his third family visit. In Iran, the claimant had been studying the Bible in secret with a friend until the friend left for the United Kingdom to flee religious persecution a few years ago. Shortly after arriving in Canada in XXXX 2018, the claimant embraced the freedom to explore Christianity and began attending church. Despite attending various church services and Bible classes, in both Farsi and English, for several months, the claimant felt that should be \u201csearching and learning more\u201d before being fully ready to answer the call of Jesus Christ and be baptized.\n[4] The claimant fears persecution in Iran on the basis of religion as a convert from Islam to Christianity. He also alleges that he would not be able to practise his religion safely and openly, fearing arrest by state officials, if he were to return to Iran.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[5] The claimant\u2019s identity as a national of Iran has been established by his testimony, and by a valid Islamic Republic of Iran passport that was seized by IRCC (formerly CIC).iii\nCredibility\n[6] The panel found the claimant to be a credible witness overall. When confronted with the panel\u2019s concerns regarding his reavailment from Canada to Iran in 2015 and 2016, the claimant responded that he had not realized the seriousness of the risk he might face in Iran. It was only when his Christian friend fled to the U.K after arrest and interrogation by the Iranian authorities that the claimant knew he would have to stop his religious activities. The panel accepts this explanation for the claimant\u2019s reavailment to Iran as satisfactory.\n[7] The claimant was questioned on his religious practice in Iran and in Canada, including his initial motivation and gradual acceptance of Christianity as his own faith; his testimony was consistent with the Basis of Claim allegations, refugee intake forms, and corroborated by the personal documentsiv produced as part of the claim.\n[8] In support of his religious identity and church involvement in Canada, the claimant submitted three letters: from his friend now residing in the U.K.; from his Farsi-speaking pastor; and from Pastor XXXX XXXX of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, confirming the claimant\u2019s church membership, Bible study, and fellowship participation.\n[9] On XXXX XXXX, 2020, counsel submitted post-hearing documents in the form of a baptism certificate, dated XXXX XXXX, 2020, from the pastor of The Living Room Church, the disclosure and acceptance by the RPD had been significantly delayed until XXXX 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 business shutdown.v\n[10] Considering the totality of the evidence, the panel finds that there is credible and trustworthy evidence before it that the claimant has established, on a balance of probabilities, his profile as a practising Christian.\n[11] As religion forms a basis for refugee claims, as per section 96 of IRPA, the test is whether there is a serious possibility of persecution should the claimant return to Iran. The panel finds, based on the evidence before it, that he has met that test.\nState protection\n[12] The panel has before it the National Documentation Package (NDP) for Iran,vi which contains a substantial amount of objective documentary evidence on religious persecution in that country.\n[13] The U.K. Home Office report, in particular, indicates that\nChristians who have converted from Islam are considered apostates \u2013 a criminal offence in Iran. Sharia law does not allow for conversion from Islam to another religion, and it is not possible for a person to change their religious affiliation on personal documentation. There are reports of some Christian converts (and sometimes their family members) facing physical attacks, harassment, threats, surveillance, arrest, detention, as well as torture and ill-treatment in detention.vii\n[14] Christians attending house churches in Iran may also be arrested for \u201cbeing a threat to national security \u2026 This goes both for low profile cases, and if you are a house church leader.\u201dviii The panel has before it a report on several \u201cChristian converts from Islam who have been imprisoned in XXXX, Iran on account of their faith\u201d and who are currently serving sentences, or facing charges, for \u201c\u2018action against national security\u2019 and \u2018propaganda against the order of the system\u2019.\u201dix\n[15] The panel finds that the objective documentary evidence cited above on the persecution of Christians\u2014and especially converts to Protestant forms of Christianity, as is the case with the claimant\u2019s established membership in a Protestant church in Canada\u2014supports the claimant\u2019s allegations, and that he has rebutted the presumption of state protection as a Christian convert should he return to Iran.\n[16] The panel also finds that there is no viable internal flight alternative available to the claimant anywhere in Iran, as he would be prevented from practising his religion safely and openly by agents of the state throughout the country.\nCONCLUSION\n[17] Based on the above findings, the panel determines that the claimant has established that there is a serious possibility of persecution if he were to return to Iran.\n[18] The panel therefore concludes that the claimant is a Convention refugee under section 96 of IRPA and accepts the claim.\n(signed) M.

Bower\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Vera Povaliaeva\nCountry: Georgia\nRPD Number: VB8-02778\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2020-00859\nATIP Pages: 000562-000572\nREASONS FOR DECISION\nINTRODUCTION\n[1] These are the reasons for the decision in the claim of a citizen of Georgia who is claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (the IRPA).1\nDETERMINATION\n[2] I find that the claimant is a person in need of protection.\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] The claimant is from Martkopi, a town in Georgia about half an hour\u2019s drive from the capital city of Tbilisi.\n[4] In May 2007 the claimant was convicted of possessing small amounts of two narcotic drugs and was sentenced to seven and a half years in prison. He appealed the sentence, and reached a plea agreement with the prosecutor. His sentence was reduced to two years\u2019 imprisonment and five years\u2019 probation. The claimant alleges that one of the drugs, heroin, was planted on him to increase his sentence.\n[5] As part of the plea agreement for a reduced sentence, the claimant was required to provide a statement to the authorities that he had purchased drugs from a specific named individual. The claimant did not recognize the name and had never purchased drugs from him. The claimant\u2019s lawyer recommended that the claimant provide the statement, and the claimant did so.\n[6] When the claimant was imprisoned his relationship with his wife ended. He entered into a common-law relationship with another woman after he was released from prison.\n[7] In 2013 the claimant needed his ex-wife\u2019s signature as part of his application for a Canadian work visa. His ex-wife\u2019s brother, the claimant\u2019s prior brother-in-law, demanded that the claimant sign a dept receipt stating that the claimant owed the brother-in-law US$10,000 before the ex-wife would sign as required. The claimant signed the debt receipt, and his ex\u00ad wife signed for the work visa application.\n[8] The claimant received a Canadian work visa in 2013 and travelled to Canada. He has remained in Canada since except for two brief trips to Georgia to visit his wife and their son, who was born very shortly after the claimant first came to Canada. He extended his work visa multiple times. After he was unable to obtain an extension in 2018, he sought refugee protection.\n[9] Since seeking protection in 2018, the claimant has learned that a strange man has been looking for him, demanding to know from the claimant\u2019s brother and common-law partner where to find the claimant. This man blames the claimant for destroying his life, apparently by naming this man as a drug dealer, resulting in over a decade in prison. This strange man has assaulted the claimant\u2019s brother in Martkopi, and has threatened and harassed the claimant\u2019s common-law partner and young son in Tbilisi.\n[10] The claimant alleges that he faces harm from Georgian police because of his history of drug use. He alleges that he will be imprisoned for using drugs, even though he now no longer uses drugs. He alleges that his ex-brother-in-law will harm him because the claimant left his ex-wife and because the ex-brother-in-law wants the claimant to pay the amount promised by the debt receipt. He alleges that he faces a risk to his life from the stranger who blames the claimant for his lengthy imprisonment.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[11] I find that the claimant is a national of Georgia. He has provided a copy of his Georgian passport with the Canadian work visa he used to enter Canada.2 He has also provided a certificate from the Ministry of Justice of Georgia stating that he is a citizen of Georgia who received amnesty for his conviction.3\nExclusion \u2013 1F(b)\n[12] I find that the claimant is not excluded from protection by Article 1F(b) of the Convention.\n[13] Under section 98 of the IRPA and Article 1F(b) of the Convention, a person is excluded from protection if there are serious reasons for considering that they have committed a serious non-political crime outside the country of refuge prior to his admission to that country as a refugee. I find, based on the evidence before me, that there are not serious reasons for considering that the claimant committed a serious crime outside Canada before seeking protection in Canada.\n[14] If a maximum sentence of ten years or more could have been imposed had the crime been committed in Canada, there is a presumption that the crime is serious.4 Factors to consider when determining if a crime is serious include the elements of the crime, the mode of prosecution, the prescribed penalty, and the aggravating and mitigating circumstances underlying the crime.5\n[15] I find that there are serious reasons to consider that the claimant has possessed prescribed drugs in Georgia for personal use. He has acknowledged that he used drugs in the past. I find that there are not serious reasons to consider that the claimant trafficked in drugs; there is no evidence before me to suggest that the claimant has been involved in trafficking.\n[16] I find in the circumstances of this claim that possession of drugs for personal use is not a serious crime. The maximum sentence in Canada for possession for personal use (as opposed to possession for the purpose of trafficking) is seven years\u2019 imprisonment.6 It is not presumed serious. As noted specifically in the context of the severe punishments imposed for personal use of drugs in Georgia, criminalizing drug use has few if any benefits for either public safety or for the health of those addicted to drugs.7 Canadian courts are recognizing that drug addiction is a health issue rather than a moral choice deserving of condemnation, and possession of personal use of even \u201chard\u201d drugs may result in a conditional discharge (which does not leave a criminal record should the person sentenced complete the conditions).8 There is nothing aggravating about the circumstances of the claimant\u2019s possession. Although the claimant was initially sentenced to more than seven years in prison in Georgia, Georgia\u2019s criminal laws regarding drugs are particularly harsh, and have become somewhat more liberal since the claimant\u2019s conviction.9\nCredibility\n[17] I find that the claimant was a credible witness.\n[18] The claimant testified in a spontaneous and responsive manner. There were no significant inconsistencies in the evidence before me.\n[19] The claimant provided several corroborating documents. He has provided a notarized letter from his Georgian lawyer regarding the claimant\u2019s drug conviction.10 He has provided a second notarized statement from his Georgian lawyer about his statement about the stranger.11 In these letters the lawyer states that it is common for police to plant drugs on suspects, that the claimant did not want to plead guilty to the charges he faced, and that the lawyer recommended that the claimant plead guilty in order to receive the minimum punishment of seven and a half years in prison instead of nine and a half years in prison. The lawyer goes on to state that the prosecutor\u2019s office forced the claimant to state that the claimant purchased drugs from someone the claimant did not actually know, in exchange for a significantly reduced sentence. He has provided a copy of the verdict of the Chamber of Appeals of Criminal Cases of Tbilisi Court of Appeals reducing his sentence on the motion of the prosecutor.12\n[20] The claimant has provided notarized letters from his brother13 that a stranger has threatened the claimant and attacked the brother after demanding information about the claimant. He has provided a notarized letter from a witness who heard one encounter and saw the claimant\u2019s brother immediately after the brother was beaten by the stranger.14 He has provided a notarized letter from a friend who saw the claimant\u2019s brother\u2019s injuries immediately after another assault.15 He has provided copies of medical report about the brother\u2019s injuries from this assault.16 He has provided copies of the police complaints made by the brother about the assaults, which note that each case was closed \u201cdue to inadequate evidence and lack of witnesses in the case.\u201d17\n[21] The claimant has provided a notarized letter from his common-law partner that she was threatened on two occasions by a stranger who accused the claimant, her partner, of ruining the stranger\u2019s life.18 He has provided a notarized letter from a witness to one of those threatening incidents.19 He has provided a notarized letter from a different witness to the other threatening incident.20 He has provided a copy of the police complaint made by his common\u00ad law partner about the threatening, which notes that the case was closed \u201cdue to inadequate evidence and lack of witnesses in the case.\u201d21\nRisk of harm\n[22] Considering the evidence before me in this claim, I find that the claimant has established on a balance of probabilities that he faces a risk to his life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if he were to return to Georgia.\n[23] The evidence shows that a stranger blames the claimant for the stranger\u2019s lengthy imprisonment and intends to harm the claimant as revenge. The stranger has attacked and injured the claimant\u2019s brother in Martkopi, the small town where the claimant used to live. In one encounter another man helped the stranger to assault the claimant\u2019s brother. The stranger has threatened the claimant to the claimant\u2019s common-law partner in Tbilisi, the capital and largest city in Georgia. The stranger approached the claimant\u2019s son in a manner that made the claimant\u2019s partner fear that the stranger might abduct or harm the son. The stranger has repeated that he blames the claimant for ruining his life and intends to enact his revenge on the claimant when he finds the claimant.\n[24] The claimant\u2019s common-law partner and son moved to another neighbourhood within Tbilisi recently to avoid further harassment from the stranger. The partner stays in the house unless she has to go out, and the son only goes to school. The partner has been told by her prior neighbours that the stranger continues to appear around her previous house searching for her and threatening the claimant\u2019s life.22\n[25] (I note that several of the translations of witnesses\u2019 letters refer to a \u201cforeign man.\u201d At the hearing the claimant and the interpreter clarified that \u2018foreign\u2019 meant \u2018strange\u2019 or \u2018unknown,\u2019 rather than someone from another community or country.)\n[26] The claimant does not know much about this stranger. He does not know the person\u2019s name, background, or available resources. He does not know how the stranger found his family, either his brother in Martkopi or his partner and son in Tbilisi. He suggests that the stranger may have been able to get this information from the criminal underground through connections from prison, but this is speculation.\n[27] As the claimant has never seen this man, and the claimant\u2019s brother and common-law partner did not see the man who encountered the other, the claimant cannot be certain that it was the same man. However, I find the possibility that two men have recently begun to hunt the claimant making the same threats with the same justification to be implausible. It is more likely that it is the same man who first attacked the claimant\u2019s brother and then threatened the claimant\u2019s common-law partner.\n[28] Based on the evidence, I find the following. The stranger blames the claimant for his lengthy period of imprisonment that ruined his life. The stranger has found the claimant\u2019s brother in Martkopi and assaulted him with a knife. The stranger has found the claimant\u2019s family in Tbilisi and threatened them. The stranger has used physical violence against those close to the claimant, and has threatened to kill the claimant. The stranger has not faced any consequences for his actions.\n[29] Despite all that is unknown about the stranger, the evidence establishes that the stranger is motivated to find and harm the claimant, and has located those connected to the claimant in two different cities, including the largest city in the country. The stranger is willing to use a weapon and inflict violence of those connected to the claimant. There is nothing in the evidence that suggests that the stranger will not continue to pursue the claimant or will not carry out his threats against the claimant.\n[30] Based on the evidence before me in this claim, I find on a balance of probabilities that this man is able to and intends to seriously hurt or kill the claimant should the claimant return to Georgia. I therefore find that the claimant faces a risk to his life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in Georgia.\nState protection\n[31] I find, considering the evidence before me in this claim, that the claimant would not receive adequate state protection in Georgia.\n[32] The police response to emergency calls is best in Tbilisi, the capital, but it can take over an hour for the police to respond to a call even there. Police officers have inconsistent levels of training and lack resources. Work still remains to improve the effectiveness of post-incident investigations by police.23 At times civilian authorities have not maintained control over security forces, and police forces have abused their powers to commit human rights abuses, particularly for political purposes.24 Failure to investigate into these abuses has further decreased public confidence in the police and prosecutors.25\n[33]] The claimant\u2019s brother and common-law partner have both reported their encounters with the stranger to the police. The police did not investigate successfully. The claimant\u2019s mother reported to the police an incident when the claimant\u2019s ex-brother-in-law threatened her; that report was also closed \u201cdue to inadequate evidence and lack of witnesses in the case.\u201d26\n[34] The claimant\u2019s family members have not received adequate assistance from the police. They have continued to face violence from the stranger and the claimant\u2019s ex-brother-in-law. This is consistent with the documentary evidence that reports Georgian police lack training and resources and do not have the confidence of the public.\nInternal flight alternative\n[35] I find, considering all of the evidence before me, that the claimant does not have a viable internal flight alternative. I find that the claimant faces a risk to his life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment throughout Georgia.\n[36] The stranger has located the claimant\u2019s family members in his home town of Martkopi and in the capital city of Tbilisi. He has demonstrated an ability to locate those connected to the claimant in two locations, including the most populated city in the country.\n[37] Georgia is a relatively small country with a population under four million persons. Tbilisi, the capital, has just over one million persons. More than four in ten Georgians live outside urban areas.27 If the claimant relocated, he would likely be obvious as a newcomer to the area.\n[38] The Georgian government maintains a civil registry that includes the name, residence, and national ID number of each citizen, and a police officer may be able to access this registry to determine any person\u2019s address.28 A person buying a SIM card in Georgia must register using a form of identification, either a passport, national ID card, or driver\u2019s licence.29 Police have abused surveillance systems with impunity, although primarily for political purposes, and \u201cthere are no effective mechanisms for preventing corruption in state-owned enterprises and independent regulatory bodies.\u201d30 The combination of national registration with addresses and official corruption provides a mechanism for someone with sufficient connections or wealth to discover a target\u2019s location.\n[39] Considering all of the evidence, I find that the stranger has demonstrated the motivation and ability to pursue the claimant, and may have access to a national database listing the claimant\u2019s address in Georgia. I therefore find that the claimant does not have a viable internal flight alternative.\nCONCLUSION\n[40] Based on the analysis above, I conclude that the claimant a person in need of protection pursuant to section 97(1) of the IRPA. Accordingly, I accept the claim.\n(signed) N. BOWER\nAugust 27, 2020\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n2 Exhibit 1.\n3 Exhibit 10.\n4 Febles v.

The claimants are a family from Egypt who are claiming refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (the \u201cAct\u201c).1\n[2] I heard these claims jointly pursuant to Rule 55 of the Refugee Protection Division Rules. At the hearing the principal claimant who is the mother of the minor claimants acted as the designated representative for them, pursuant to subsection 167(2) of the Act and Rule 20 of the Refugee Protection Division Rules. She was provided with an opportunity to testify about any risk that the minor claimants face. The associate claimant, who is the spouse of the principal claimant and the father of the minor claimants, was also provided with the opportunity to testify about the events in question.\n[3] In hearing and assessing these claims, I have considered and applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline on Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution2, which offers guidance in recognizing women as members of a particular social group and also with respect to other gender specific issues present in this claim.\nALLEGATIONS\n[4] The claimants fear that their daughter, the minor claimant XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, will be forced to undergo female genital mutilation (FGM) if she returns to Egypt. The claimants allege that the associate claimant\u2019s brother has forcibly tried to abduct the minor claimant to undergo FGM. They are worried for the safety of their children if they return and as well are worried that their brother will take action against them because they have intervened and undermined his power.\n[5] The claimants believe that they will be killed and\/or arrested if they return to Egypt.\nDETERMINATION\n[6] I find that the principal, associate, and minor claimants XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXandXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX have a well\u00adfounded fear of persecution on the basis of membership in a particular social group and are therefore Convention refugees under section 96 of the Act.\n[7] I find that the minor claimant XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is neither a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the Act, nor a person in need of protection pursuant to subsection 97(1).\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[8] I find that the identities of the claimants as nationals of Egypt have been established by their testimony and the supporting documentation filed, including their passports.3\n[9] I find that the identity of the minor claimant XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX as a national of the United States of America has been established by the testimony of the principal claimant and the supporting documentation filed, including her passport.4\nCredibility\n[10] When a claimant swears to the truth of their allegations, this creates a presumption that those allegations are true, unless there is reason to doubt their truthfulness. In this case, I have found no reason to doubt the claimants\u2019 truthfulness. Both the principal and associate claimants testified in a straightforward and convincing manner, answered all of the questions that were posed to them in a detailed way, and were able to speak about the threats that they faced due to their opposition to FGM.\n[11] In addition, the claimants have disclosed the following documents which corroborate their allegations:\nA police report filed on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2019 by the principal claimant which indicates that her brother-in-law threatened to take her daughter by force at her school, so that he could perform a circumcision operation.A letter of support written by the principal claimant\u2019s neighbour which indicates that on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2019 the principal claimant was crying and screaming because she was afraid of her brother-in-law. The letter indicates that the principal claimant\u2019s brother-in-law threatened her, indicating that she needed to withdraw her complaint or the police officer accompanying him would arrest her. The neighbour further indicates that the police officer showed the neighbours his identity card and indicated that this was a family matter and none of them needed to interfere.A letter of support written by the principal claimant\u2019s friend which indicates that the principal claimant asked to live with her on a temporary basis because she was afraid of her brother-in-law. The letter confirms that an individual began threatening the principal claimant at her home and told the principal claimant to give her daughter to her brother in law.A letter of support written by an individual who called the principal claimant to advise her that her brother in law was trying to take her daughter from school on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2019.5[12] I find that the claimants are credible witnesses and I believe what they have alleged in support of their claims.\nCountries of Reference \u2013 the Minor Claimant XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX\nIn order for a claim for refugee protection to be successful, the Act requires that a claimant establish a claim against each of their countries of nationality. In this case, the minor claimant XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX was born in the United States and has American citizenship. During the hearing, the claimants conceded that they would not be pursuing a claim against the United States. Accordingly, I conclude that the minor claimant is neither a Convention refugee nor person in need of protection. As such, the remainder of my reasons relate only to the principal claimant, associate claimant and the minor claimants XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXandXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXWell-Founded Fear of Persecution and Risk of Harm\nNexus\n[13] The principal claimant alleges that she and her daughter, the minor claimant XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, are at risk due to threats a relative has made with respect to forced FGM. I find that the persecution the principal claimant and minor claimant XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX fears has a nexus to the Convention ground of a particular social group, namely women. I further find that the associate claimant and the minor claimant XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX have a nexus to the ground of membership in a particular social group, being a member of the principal claimant\u2019s family.\nGender Based Persecution\n[14] The claimants are Egyptian citizens who had been living in Saudi Arabia, where the associate claimant had a temporary work permit. The principal claimant and her children moved back to Egypt in 2018 as they knew that the associate claimant\u2019s work permit would be expiring shortly and they wanted to get the children settled into a new routine and school.\n[15] Both the principal and associate claimants testified that they knew the associate claimant\u2019s elder brother wanted to circumcise their daughters and that this was something that was viewed as important within the associate claimant\u2019s family. However, the principal claimant testified that she did not take this threat seriously when they moved back to Egypt as she believed that she would be able to say no and to stop it. However, she indicated that she moved to Cairo, rather than Alexandria where her brother-in-law lived, to avoid him.\n[16] The principal claimant testified that in XXXX 2019, shortly after she and the minor claimants moved back to Egypt, the associate claimant\u2019s elder brother tried to take her daughter out of school so that he could circumcise her. The principal claimant explained that the school allowed her brother-in-law to see her daughter because they had the same last name. However, she received a telephone call from a family friend who witnessed her daughter crying when her uncle tried to take her from her school.\n[17] When the principal claimant arrived at her daughter\u2019s school, her brother-in-law threatened her, telling her that he would end her life if she did not permit him to circumcise her daughter. He then told the minor claimant that he would come back for her later.\n[18] Following this incident, the principal claimant filed a police report and began accompanying her children to school everyday. She testified that she would wait at the school while her children were in classes and then walk them home. She was scared that her brother-in\u00ad law would return for the children. She was worried that he could try to use her son as a pawn to try to get access to her daughter.\n[19] In XXXX 2019, the principal claimant\u2019s brother-in-law came to her home with a close friend, who is a police officer. The brother-in-law again asked for the minor claimant so that he could take her to be circumcised. The principal claimant asked him to leave and the situation escalated. He told her that he would \u201cbury her\u201d, that the police report she had filed had been withdrawn, and that the police officer accompanying him would imprison her if she went to the police again. Neighbours began to crowd around, and the police officer told everyone they should leave because this was a \u201cfamily problem.\u201d\n[20] The principal claimant no longer believed that she and her children were safe. On XXXX XXXX XXXX 2019 she decided to move with her children to Sharkia Governorate, where she lived with a friend. She felt that she would be safe there because her name would not be on a lease. She also did not register her children in school so that they could not be traced by her brother-in-law. The principal claimant testified that she did not even take her children to get immunized because she did not want a record of them living in the new area.\n[21] Approximately three weeks after they moved to Sharkia Governorate, the principal claimant noticed a strange man waiting outside of her friend\u2019s house. Her friend\u2019s children told her that he had asked about her children by name. When she went outside to speak with him, he showed her that he had a knife and said \u201cwhen are you going to finish this?\u201d He told her she should give her girls to her brother-in-law or he would kill her. He also told the claimant\u2019s friend that she should distance herself from the principal claimant or she would also be harmed.\n[22] The principal claimant and her friend went to the police station to file a report but they refused to investigate the incident.\n[23] The principal claimant\u2019s friend asked her to leave her house and the claimant took her children to go live with her father in Dakahlia. The principal claimant testified, however, that her father was not very supportive and believed that she should agree to have her daughters circumcised because her brother-in-law was the head of the family. Three days later, her brother\u00ad in-law arrived at her father\u2019s house. The principal claimant believes that her father called him.\n[24] When her brother-in-law arrived at her father\u2019s house, the principal claimant pretended to agree to have her daughters circumcised. However, she was able to leave for Canada before the procedure could be completed.\n[25] The principal claimant testified that she is terrified that if she returns to Egypt her brother-in-law will force her daughters to undergo FGM and will kill her for disobeying him and for challenging his authority. She explained that her brother-in-law continues to call her father because he is looking for her and her family. The associate claimant also testified that he has received phone calls from his brother, asking when they will return to Egypt, as he believes they are currently in Saudi Arabia.\n[26] The country condition documents for Egypt corroborate the facts alleged by the claimant and the objective basis for the claim. The prevalence of FGM in Egypt remains high, at 87.2% of all women aged 15-49. Data suggests that Egypt has the greatest number of women and girls who have experienced FGM of any country in the world. There is a markedly higher prevalence of FGM amongst girls and women living in upper Egypt, where the associate claimant\u2019s family is from. FGM in Egypt is performed any time between birth and the age of 17, with most girls undergoing the practice at or before puberty. FGM is practised for several reasons in Egypt, but the most commonly cited are tradition, religion, and its association with marriage. Over half of men and women believe that FGM should be continued. Studies have shown that even physicians believe that FGM is required by religious precepts and have defended the practice.6\n[27] I find that the prevalence of FGM in Egypt, the broad social support for the practice, as well as the actions taken by the principal claimant\u2019s brother-in-law in order to force his niece to undergo FGM, the threats he has made against the family, and the profiles of the claimants as individuals who do not subscribe to the widely-practiced gender-based customs and traditions puts the claimants at significant risk in Egypt. In particular, I find that the minor claimant XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is at risk of being forced to undergo FGM, while her family members, including the principal claimant, the associate claimant, and the minor claimant XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, are at risk because they are her family members and have made it clear that they will not subscribe to gender-based customs and beliefs surrounding FGM that are prevalent in Egypt, and, as such, have been threatened by the associate claimant\u2019s brother. I find that the claimants have established a well-founded fear of persecution if they were to return to Egypt.\nState Protection\n[28] The next element in my analysis is whether there is adequate state protection for the claimants in Egypt. While there is a presumption of state protection, this presumption can be rebutted with clear and convincing evidence that protection would not be forthcoming to the claimant.7\n[29] In this case, the principal claimant testified that she approached the authorities on a number of occasions to obtain assistance with respect to her brother-in-law and never received any meaningful assistance. The first time she approached the police, after the brother-in-law tried to take her daughter out of school, the police were cooperative but only issued a report and did not take any steps to investigate the brother-in-law or assist the principal claimant. The second time the principal claimant approached the police, after she was threatened at her friend\u2019s house in Sharkia Governorate, she testified that the police laughed at her and refused to take any actions. I note also that the principal claimant\u2019s brother-in-law brought a member of the police force with him when he came to the principal claimant\u2019s home in Cairo to threaten her, and that this member of the police force told neighbours who tried to intervene that the issue was a \u201cfamily problem.\u201d\n[30] As stated above, Egypt has the greatest number of women and girls who have undergone FGM of any country in the world. The Egyptian government has taken steps to reduce FGM in the country, including by ratifying many of the international conventions and treaties related to FGM. Moreover, in June 2008 the Egyptian government passed legislation outlawing FGM in Egypt. In September 2016 further amendments were passed making FGM a felony and increasing the penalties associate with performing the practice.\n[31] However, country condition documents indicate that despite these advances, legislation in Egypt addressing FGM remains insufficient and inadequately enforced. Between 2007 and 2013, several girls died undergoing FGM in the country. Moreover, the rates at which FGM are practiced remain high, and a recent study found that there had been little change in FGM rates between 2008 and 2015. A report authored by the organization 28 Too Many, has also found that conviction rates and sentences passed under Egypt\u2019s anti-FGM legislation are also discouraging. The first conviction for conducting FGM was against a doctor in June 2013. After eighteen months, during which the doctor continued to practice medicine, he came to a financial arrangement with the victim\u2019s family and only served three months of his sentence. Moreover, despite increased penalties following amendments in September 2016, sentences have remained low. In January 2017, following the death of 17-year-old girl who underwent FGM, the victim\u2019s mother, doctor, and anaesthetist were only given one year suspended prison sentences and fines.8 It is clear from the country documents that while FGM is illegal in Egypt, enforcement of those laws is extremely limited, with prosecutions being very rare, sentences being extraordinarily lenient and state protection being almost non-existent.\n[32] In view of this evidence, I find that state protection for FGM is inadequate. While the authorities have made efforts to address FGM, these efforts have not been effective on the operational level. The objective country information evidence demonstrates that state protection is rarely available from authorities in Egypt, and this has also been the experience of the claimants. I therefore find that the presumption of state protection has been rebutted in the case of the claimants.\nInternal Flight Alternative (IFA)\n[33] The final issue is whether the claimants have a viable Internal Flight Alternative (IFA) in Egypt. In order to determine whether an IFA exists, I must assess whether there is any location in Egypt in which the claimants would not face a serious possibility of persecution and whether it would be reasonable to expect them to move there.9 I find that the claimants do not have a viable IFA because I am satisfied that the principal claimant\u2019s brother-in-law would have the motivation and the means to pursue them throughout Egypt.\n[34] The principal claimant\u2019s brother-in-law has demonstrated that he has the motivation to pursue the claimants throughout Egypt. Although he lives in Alexandria, he tracked down and pursued the claimants in Cairo, Sharkia Governorate, and Dakahlia. Moreover, he has continued to try to locate the claimants through their family members following their departure for Canada. The associate claimant has testified, and I accept, that the brother-in-law will be motivated to locate them due to the importance of performing FGM for his family and the fact that he is viewed as the head of the family and responsible for ensuring that everyone follows this cultural code.\n[35] I also find on the balance of probabilities that the principal claimant\u2019s brother-in-law would have the means to pursue the claimants throughout Egypt. The principal claimant testified that she believes her brother-in-law could track them down if her children were to register in school. Indeed, this is how her brother-in-law located them in Cairo. The associate claimant testified that his brother is powerful and has meaningful connections, including contacts in the police force, and that he could use these connections to find them. I note as well that the brother\u00ad in-law has demonstrated in the past that he has the means to locate the claimants throughout Egypt, having tracked them to multiple destinations.\n[36] Given the brother-in-law\u2019s connections, his ongoing interest in the claimants, and his demonstrated motivation and ability to locate the claimants in the past, I find on a balance of probabilities that there is no viable IFA for the claimants.\nCONCLUSION\n[37] For these reasons, I find that the principal, associate, and minor claimants XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXandXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX are Convention refugees and I accept their claims.\n[38] I find that the minor claimant XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is neither a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the Act, nor a person in need of protection pursuant to subsection 97(1), and I reject her claim.\n(signed) Megan Kammerer\nMarch 31, 2020\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n2 Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (IRB) Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 4: Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution, Ottawa, Canada, March 1993, updated November 1996.\n3 Exhibit 1.\n4 Exhibit 1.\n5 Exhibit 5.\n6 Exhibit 3, National Documentation Package, (NDP), Egypt, September 30, 2019, Item 5.7.\n7 Canada (Attorney General) v.

He alleges that when he returned to Egypt he was arrested and assaulted by members of the police force, who told him that he had to pay them XXXX XXXX XXXX Egyptian pounds or they would fabricate a file on him which demonstrates that he belongs to the Muslim Brotherhood.\n[3] The claimant is worried that he will be killed if he returns to Egypt.\nDETERMINATION\n[4] I find that the claimant is a protected person pursuant to section 97(1) of the Act.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[5] I find that the identity of the claimant as a national of Egypt has been established by his testimony and the supporting documentation filed, including his passport.2\nCredibility\n[6] When a claimant swears to the truth of his allegations, this creates a presumption that those allegations are true, unless there is reason to doubt their truthfulness. In this case, I have found no reason to doubt the claimant\u2019s truthfulness with respect to the allegations he has made about being detained and beaten by the police when they attempted to extort him. His testimony on this point was straightforward and consistent with his Basis of Claim form and narrative. I accept these allegations as recounted by the claimant during his testimony as true.\n[7] I do note that the claimant has provided several documents to corroborate his allegations, including short affidavits written by his mother, his brother, and an individual who says he witnessed the claimant being taken by the Egyptian police to an unknown destination.3 I note that these witness statements are very short, vague, and undated. I therefore attach very little weight to them. The claimant has also provided a police report which indicates only that on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2019 his brother reported their mother\u2019s personal supply card had been lost but does not otherwise corroborate his allegation that his mother was beaten and robbed by state authorities who were searching for him.4 Again, I attach little weight to this police report. Despite the low probative value of these corroborating documents, I do not find that they detract from the credibility of the claimant with respect to the allegations he has made about the police beating and trying to extort him.\n[8] I do have some doubts about the veracity of the claimant\u2019s allegations with respect to his political opinion, which was raised as an issue by his counsel who asked him a series of leading questions about his political involvement and whether he supports the current regime in Egypt. These allegations contradict many of the statements made in the claimant\u2019s narrative, in which he stated that he is \u201cnot a member of the Muslims Brotherhood or any other groups,\u201d that he has \u201cnothing to do with politics,\u201d that he \u201cpersonally was neither with nor against president Morsi, and never belonged to any political groups,\u201d and that he is a \u201cpeaceful person who has never been a member of any political group, and never had any political views.\u201d Although I do acknowledge that the claimant wrote in his narrative that he has \u201calways been against injustice, oppression, and poverty\u201d and that he participated in demonstrations against the regime of Husni Mubarak in 2010, I find that his statements about his political opinion during the hearing directly contradicted many of the statements made in his narrative and that his allegations with respect to being vulnerable to persecution due to his political opinion are not credible.\nNexus\n[9] I find that the claimant\u2019s fear of state authorities in Egypt is not tied to a Convention ground. Rather, the claimant fears state authorities who tried to extort him due to the perception that he is wealthy and lived abroad. As such, I do not find that there is a nexus between the claimant\u2019s allegations and any of the refugee Convention grounds and I have assessed this claim under section 97(1) of the Act only.\n[10] Although counsel argued on behalf of the claimant that there is a nexus to political opinion, the claimant clearly stated in the narrative attached to his Basis of Claim form that he \u201chas never been a member of any political group\u201d and has \u201cnever had any political views.\u201d He also stated that when he was arrested by the police, they told him \u201cwe know that you have nothing to do with any political parties, and that you are not a member of the group of Muslim Brotherhood, and that you don\u2019t belong to the Party of Light and justice, like your cousin.\u201d I thus find that there is insufficient evidence to establish a nexus to political opinion in this case.\nRisk of Harm\n[11] To establish his status as a person in need of protection in Egypt, the claimant must show that he would be subjected personally on a balance of probabilities to a risk to life, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or a danger of torture, if he returned to Egypt. The claimant has submitted that he is being targeted by state authorities who are trying to extort him.\n[12] The claimant testified that he moved back to Egypt from Saudi Arabia in XXXX 2018. In approximately XXXX 2018, the claimant visited his cousin, who had been accused of being a member of opposition political parties and who had recently been released after having been detained by state authorities for a year and a half. The claimant was on his way home when he was stopped by police officers who grabbed him and asked him why he had been visiting his cousin. They asked to see his identification and noted that he had managed a restaurant in Saudi Arabia. One of the individuals took a picture of his identification card. The altercation lasted for approximately two hours, following which the claimant was released and told not to visit his cousin again.\n[13] In approximately XXXX 2018, the claimant testified that he was sitting at home when he was apprehended by individuals in a police patrol car and taken to The Greater Mahalah\u2019s third police station. He testified that this police station is heavily guarded and has a reputation for being where prisoners are tortured. The claimant testified that he was blindfolded, handcuffed, and made to take off his clothes. He was beaten, insulted, and had cold water thrown over him. At one point, both his feet were tied together and he was hung from the ceiling. Throughout this ordeal, the claimant heard his captors saying \u201cthis guy is recommended, this is the guy of Saudi Arabia.\u201d\n[14] When the claimant was told to put his clothes back on, he was told that because he possessed an iPhone he would be expected to pay. He was transferred to a different room and recognized one of the individuals who had taken a photograph of his identification card in XXXX. He was told: \u201cwe know that you have nothing to do with any political parties, and that you are not a member of the group of Muslim Brotherhood, and that you don\u2019t belong to the Party of Light and justice, like your cousin\u201d but that if he did not pay XXXX XXXX XXXX Egyptian pounds to the police then they would manufacture a full file about him which indicates that he belongs to the Muslim Brotherhood and he would be punished accordingly. The authorities told the claimant that because he has been living in Saudi Arabia for five years they know he has money.\n[15] The claimant negotiated with his captors and agreed to pay them XXXX XXXX XXXX Egyptian pounds. He agreed to provide them with the first XXXX XXXX XXXX Egyptian pounds the following morning and indicated that he would be able to make another payment in XXXX 2019.\n[16] The following morning, the claimant transferred the first XXXX XXXX XXXX Egyptian pounds as agreed. He finalized plans to travel to Canada and departed from Egypt on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018 prior to the payment of the second installment.\n[17] The claimant testified that in XXXX 2019, after the second instalment was due, individuals identifying themselves as government officials went to his mother\u2019s home to ask about his whereabouts. They searched her house, stole her identification documents and valuables, and hit her on the head. The claimant explained that his brother took their mother to the police station to report the incident and was told that if he proceeded further with the claim they would \u201ceradicate\u201d him from \u201cthe face of the earth.\u201d\n[18] The claimant testified that following this incident he has minimized contact with his mother, so as not to endanger her. He worries that phone calls are being monitored. He has asked his mother indirectly if any individuals are still looking for him and believes that they are.\n[19] The objective evidence is consistent with the claimant\u2019s allegations and indicates that incidents of arbitrary arrest and detention are \u201cfrequent.\u201d In 2018, local activists and rights groups have stated that \u201chundreds\u201d of arrests did not comply with due process laws. A report issued on December 10, 2018 by the Arabic Network for Human Right Information indicates that the police have gone so far as to refuse to release defendants that the court has ordered must be released. There is also evidence that civilians may be beaten and\/or tortured while in detention, as well as reports of suspects being killed in unclear circumstances following their arrest. In 2018, for example, press reports indicated that Abdel Halim Mohamed El-Nahas died following a five-hour interrogation in Tora Prison. In June of that same year, authorities killed 10 persons and arrested two in raids conducted across the country, alleging that those who were killed or arrested were involved in an opposition movement.5 The Egyptian Coordination for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) has identified 30 people who died from torture while being held in police stations and other Interior Ministry detention sites between August 2013 and December 2015. In 2016, the ECRF reported that its lawyers received 830 torture complaints and that a further 14 people had died from torture in custody.6\n[20] Based on the totality of the evidence before me, including the claimant\u2019s testimony and the objective evidence, I find on a balance of probabilities that the claimant would face a forward-facing risk to his life from state authorities in Egypt. The principal claimant was detained and beaten on two occasions by state authorities who were seeking to extort him. He has now left the country with an outstanding debt to these officers. These state authorities continued to target the claimant\u2019s mother after he left the country.\n[21] The next question for me to consider under a section 97 claim is whether, in the context of the allegations, the claimant has provided sufficient evidence of his specific circumstances to establish that his risk is distinct from that of the general population.\n[22] Pursuant to section 7(1)(b)(ii) of the Act, claimants are not entitled to protection under the Act if the risk they face to their lives of cruel or unusual treatment or punishment, in Egypt, is a risk that is generally faced by others in or from Egypt. The claimant must establish that he would face a risk different from those risks faced by the general population there.\n[23] Consideration of a claim under section 97(1)(b) requires an individualized inquiry on the evidence, in the context of a present or perspective risk for the claimant, to determine if the risk personally faced by the claimant is also faced by others, generally, in Egypt. In this case, the claimant has been targeted, threatened, and subjected to violence by state authorities. This escalated from an encounter on the street, to the claimant\u2019s arrest, and finally to physical assault. This is a specific and personalized risk. I find that these circumstances change the nature of the claimant\u2019s risk to a non-generalized risk that is particular to this particular claimant. In my view, the claimant has established the objective basis of his claims, and has also established that the risk he faces is one that he personally faces and that is not faced generally by the population of Egypt.\nState Protection\n[24] Given that the state is the agent of harm in this case, I find that the state would not be willing or able to provide protection to the claimant. I find that the state agents who targeted the claimant are not merely rogue officers. The objective evidence indicates that Egyptian state authorities engage in widespread arbitrary arrests, enforced disappearances, and torture against perceived dissidents and that the way they treated the claimant is part of a larger pattern of abuse perpetrated against civilians.7\n[25] I find that the presumption of state protection has been rebutted.\nInternal Flight Alternative (IFA)\n[26] The test for a viable Internal Flight Alternative is two pronged. The Board must be satisfied that there is no serious possibility of the claimants being persecuted, or on a balance of probabilities subjected personally to a section 97(1) risk of harm in the IFA location, and conditions there must be such that it would not be objectively unreasonable in all the circumstances, including those particular to the claimants, for them to seek refuge there.\n[27] In this case, I find that the state authorities who have demonstrated an interest in the claimant would likely be able to find the claimant anywhere in the country. The evidence in this case indicates that state authorities continue to be motivated to locate the claimant, as they tracked him down, arrested, and beat him while he was in Egypt, and continue to attempt to search for him at his mother\u2019s house now that he has left the country.\n[28] I find that state authorities were initially motivated to look for the claimant due to the perception that he has financial resources because he spent a significant amount of time out of the country, and that he became a target once he was drawn to their attention following his visit to his cousin\u2019s house. I further find that following the claimant\u2019s disappearance from Egypt this motivation would have increased due to the perception that he did not abide by the \u201cdeal\u201d he made with authorities when he was detained.\n[29] State authorities would certainly have the means to locate the claimant throughout the country, as the government maintains effective control across Egypt.\n[30] As such, I find on a balance of probabilities that it is more likely than not that the claimant would face a risk to his life throughout the country. In my view, there is no viable IFA available to the claimant.\nCONCLUSION\n[31] For the foregoing reasons, I find that the claimant is a person in need of protection in Egypt under section 97 of the Act and accept his claim.\n(signed) Megan Kammerer\nMarch 20, 2020\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n2 Exhibit 1.\n3 Exhibit 4.\n4 Exhibit 5.\n5 Exhibit 3, National Documentation Package (NDP), Egypt, September 30, 2019, Item 2.1.\n6 Exhibit 3, NDP, Item 10.1.\n7 Exhibit 3, NDP, Item 10.1.\n\n",

I\u2019ve weighed your evidence. I\u2019m going to give you an oral decision. You\u2019re gonna get a transcript of these reasons at the address. There may be some small errors, I don\u2019t see them before they get sent out.\n[2] Okay, I\u2019ll tell you at the outset cause the reasons will take a few minutes to piece together that I\u2019m accepting the claims today. So, I\u2019m saying yes to all three of you.\n[3] CLAIMANT: Thank you.\n[4] MEMBER: You\u2019re welcome.\n[5] And these are my reasons for decision. Apologies if I mispronounce your names. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXand XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX the claimants, seek refugee protection under Sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[6] INTERPRETER: Excuse me, Your Honor. Should I translate simultaneous.\n[7] MEMBER: If you can, that would be great.\n[8] INTERPRETER: Yes, yes I can.\n[9] MEMBER: Thank you. So, then she\u2019ll join you in the back and explain as we\u2019re going along. Okay.\n[10] The claimants allegations are summarized in their Basis of Claim forms. In summary, they\u2019re alleged to be an Egyptian father, mother and adult son also with Sudanese citizenship seeking protection from persecution on the basis of their Christian Evangelical faith in both countries.\n[11] I find that you are Convention refugees for the following reasons.\n[12] First, on the issue of identity. I find that you\u2019ve established your personal identities and citizenships. I find you\u2019ve also established your religious identities as Christians. I was presented with copies of Egyptian and Sudanese passports for all three of you, as well as original birth certificates, marriage certificate and church documents. I find on a balance of probabilities this establishes your identities.\n[13] There is a Nexus of religion under Section 96 in this case. Ma\u2019am, you\u2019ve also raised a, an added gender element based on your fear of living as a woman and a Christian in these countries, which I\u2019ve also considered.\n[14] I find you\u2019ve adequately established on a balance of probabilities your risk of harm returning or risk of persecution returning to both Egypt and Sudan. I found the testimonies to be credible today. You testified as to your backgrounds in these countries, your religious identities, your particular experiences. And why you left when you did.\n[15] I did have some questions about failure to claim in, on several opportunities, as well as why you delayed leaving over so many years. I found the explanations reasonable in the circumstances. While you Sir, did testify as to why you didn\u2019t take advantage of claiming in Europe and while there still is an element there of failure to claim, the explanation was reasonable in the entirety of the circumstances. It\u2019s outweighed by and your explanation is bolstered by the objective evidence. And that in and of itself is insufficient to outweigh everything that you\u2019ve told me.\n[16] I\u2019ve also considered your explanations as to the escalating nature of the harm. And why you were willing to remain in these countries for the time that you did. You also testified as to why you fear having a forward\u00ad looking harm. And while there have been political changes in these countries, the best evidence that I have as to the current situation is the country conditions in the NDP, the country conditions provided by counsel and your own testimony as to the situation in both of these countries.\n[17] And based on that evidence and with nothing else compelling or credible before me to say that the circumstances have changed sufficiently, that is the evidence that I am relying on. And I find that evidence objectively justifiable and credible.\n[18] So, having considered all the evidence including your testimonies, I find that you\u2019ve established a serious possibility of harm returning to either country on the basis of your Christian faith.\n[19] On the issues of internal flight alternative and state protection, I find that these do not apply in the circumstances as it is the State that you fear in both cases. As well, while there\u2019s a societal element but also the State in both countries, it would be unreasonable for you to approach the State for protection.\n[20] I also note that given some of the continued impunity against Christians in these countries, that that further points to the un-, inability or unwillingness of the State to protect Christians. Or in any event, insufficiently to protect your open practice in these countries.\n[21] On the issue of internal flight alternative, I don\u2019t have an alternative to point to where you would not face a serious possibility of harm. You testified as to why you feel you would not be able to relocate within these countries. And I find sufficient evidence from what I have before me that the risk would continue throughout both of these countries. As such, the IFA test fails on the first prong. And I find no internal flight alternative for you. For all these reasons, I find that you would face a serious possibility of harm in both of your countries of reference.\n[22] For this reason, I find all three of you to be Convention refugees under the IRPA. And I therefore accept your claims.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n",

You started to be involved in the community while you were studying. Then after graduation, you became involved politically. In 2006, you participated in a demonstration against the government and you were arrested and detained for several weeks.\n[4] Most recently, you participated in the peaceful demonstrations in Tahir Square until the fall of Mubarak in February 2011.\n[5] In XXXX 2012, you joined the Freedom and Justice Party and you participated in several activities for the party, such as educating citizens about their political rights and supporting candidates in the elections.\n[6] In XXXX 2013, you participated in the demonstration at Rabaa Al-Adawiya Square to denounce and reject the military coup that pushed out of power the President Morsi in 2013.\n[7] In XXXX 2016, you were arrested and accused by the authorities of belonging to the Freedom and Justice Party and being part of the Muslim Brotherhood. In detention, you were beaten, insulted and physically as well as psychologically assaulted.\n[8] While you were being questioned, you were force to give your home address. Sorne officers went to your home while your wife and children were there. They destroyed contents of your apartment and took documents and money.\n[9] You were detained for a month. The authorities threatened to detain you again if you publish anything against President El-Sisi. They also asked you to report on a weekly basis to the police station.\n[10] In XXXX 2018, you went to Germany. You thought you would be safe to travel back and forth from Egypt to Germany. However, when you came back to Egypt, you were arrested at the airport because your name had appeared on a \u201cwanted\u201d list. The officers confiscated your mobile phone and your laptop. They were able consequently to access your Facebook account and were able to track your search history. You were physically and psychologically abused and threatened.\n[11] After a week, they released you without charges and confiscated your passport. You were able to get your passport back with the help of a relative who intervened for you.\n[12] You tried to leave the country afterwards, but you were told at the airport that you did not have the authorization to leave the country. You were detained again in XXXX 2019 without charged against you. A National Security Officer threatened to kill you, if you wrote anything negative about Egypt.\n[13] You had obtained a Canadian visa in XXXX 2018. You decided to leave Egypt in 2019 and this time, a relative of yours was able to facilitate your departure from Egypt by bribing the authorities. You arrived in Montreal on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2019 and you filed a refugee claim with the Canadian authorities shortly afterwards. You say that you continue in Canada to publish political posts against the government on social media.\nDETERMINATION\n[14] I find that you are \u201cConvention refugee\u201d as you have established a serious possibility of persecution should you return to Egypt based on the grounds in section 96 of the Act.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[15] I find that your identity as a national of Egypt is established by the documents provided, namely your passport.\nNexus\n[16] I find that you have established a nexus to section 96 by reason of political opinion.\nCredibility\n[17] Based on the documents in the file, I have noted no serious credibility issues. In particular, the evidence establishes the allegations as set out above: Document 7, the copy of your certificate of graduation and transcript from the XXXXofXXXX XXXXofXXXX XXXX University confirm your professional credentials; Documents 8 to 10 confirm your political participation, i.e. a copy of your membership card from the Freedom and Justice Party; printouts of your Facebook and pictures of you in demonstrations in Canada confirm that you are still active politically; Documents 11 to 15 support your allegations related to your multiple detentions in Egypt, i.e. a copy of your Egyptian criminal records, the certificate extracted from Record of Misdemeanors, the investigation record from Ain Shams Police Station, a letter from you legal counsel and a letter from the friend confirming the problems you had at the airport over the years. After reviewing the documents, I have no reasons to doubt their authenticity.\nObjective Basis of Future Risk\n[18] Based on the credibility of your allegations, and the documentary evidence set out below, I find that you have established a future risk that you will be subjected to the following harm: detention, torture, death.\n[19] The fact that you face this risk is corroborated by the following documents: National Documentation Package f-r Egypt \u2013 September 30, 2019 Version: The Muslim Brotherhood and its Freedom and Justice Party were banned in 2014 (tabs 1.4 and 1.5) and the Freedom and Justice Party is still banned in Egypt (tab 2.1); The authorities arrest people for alleged Muslim Brotherhood ties on a regular basis (tab 1.5); arrests, detention, disappearance, torture, execution of individuals affiliated or accused of being affiliated to the Muslim Brotherhood: tabs 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.7, 2.8.\nNature of the Harm\n[20] This harm clearly amounts to persecution.\nState Protection\n[21] I find that there is clear and convincing evidence before me that the state is unable or unwilling to provide you with adequate protection. Judges are the primary tools in the repression of political opponents (tab 1.6); also, most defendants were sentenced after mass trials that violate fundamental due process rights, and some courts relied on confessions extracted under torture (tab 1.6).\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[22] I have considered whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for you. On the evidence before me, I find that there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout Egypt. In light of the evidence quoted above regarding the Justice and Freedom Party, and the problems you have had with the authorities over the years, I do not believe that you will be able to establish yourself safely in Egypt.\nCONCLUSION\n[23] Based on the analysis above, I conclude that you are \u201cConvention refugee\u201d. Accordingly, I accept your claim.\n(signed) JULIE MORIN\nJune 17, 2020\n\n",

Their submitted passports prove their identity and that they are citizens of Egypt.\n[2] I have appointed XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX as designated representative for the minor children XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXandXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.\n[3] In rendering my reasons, I have considered and applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guidelines on Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution.\nALLEGATIONS\n[4] The principal claimant\u2019s father was arrested for seven months for being a member of the Muslim Brotherhood (MB) in Egypt in the 1980\u2019s and was subsequently threatened with arrest for his political opposition in Egypt. He moved the family to Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) in 1991.\n[5] The principal claimant married and had children in KSA with an Egyptian husband who has temporary status in KSA. She returned to Egypt in 2012 for a one-month visit. She supported President Morsi who was later removed from power in a military coup in 2013. She continued to support the Muslim Brotherhood and oppose the government in Egypt.\n[6] After the military coup in Egypt in 2013, the government violently repressed political opposition.\n[7] In 2017, the Egyptian authorities came to her family\u2019s home looking for her for security reasons. She feared returning to Egypt.\n[8] In 2018, her uncle was arrested in Egypt by security forces on a charge of membership in the MB. Friends of the family were arrested on similar charges.\n[9] KSA is an ally of the current Egyptian government and threatened MB supporters in KSA.\n[10] The principal claimant feared that she and her children would be removed from KSA to Egypt. She obtained US visas to travel to the US then Canada to make a refugee claim.\nDETERMINATION\n[11] The claimants are Convention refugees. They established a serious possibility of persecution on grounds of imputed political opinion or for membership in a particular social group (members of the family of the principal claimant).\nANALYSIS\nCredibility\n[12] Credibility concerns were not determinative.\n[13] The claimants submitted probative evidence in support of their claims.\n[14] The claimants submitted probative evidence in support of the main elements of their claims, for example, of the principal claimant\u2019s political activities on social media (P-4) and her father\u2019s arbitrary arrest in 1981 in relation to the MB and that the court granted him damages in 1992 (P-3).\n[15] The National Documentation Package (NDP) for Egypt, dated September 30, 2019, shows the repression of the former ruling party, the Freedom and Justice Party and the Muslim Brotherhood, which is now an outlawed organisation in Egypt, and that there has been severe repression of persons associated with the Muslim Brotherhood or a similar political opposition to the government, such as protesters and critics of the government (NDP, Tab 4.5).\n[16] Critics of the Egyptian government face severe treatment under recent and renewed state of emergency or counterterrorism laws (NDP, Tabs 2.1 and 2.6).\n[17] Since the military coup in 2013, university students and staff have faced government suspension, dismissal and sometimes violent treatment due to the perceived or real affiliation with the Muslim Brotherhood or the former government under Morsi (NDP, Tabs 2.5 and 2.6).\n[18] The Egyptian authorities have been involved in hundreds of extra-judicial killings, and have detained or imprisoned an estimated 60,000 persons in the period of 2013 to 2016 (NDP, Tab 4.8, page 27) and that some of those victims have been males as young as 14 (NDP, Tab 4.5). Family members of persons targeted by the government have also been arrested (NDP, Tab 2.8, pages 9-10). The NDP shows that children as young as 5 and 7 had been arrested by Egyptian authorities (NDP, tab 2.1) but that reference was regarding the mother arrested and it has not been shown that the children had actually been arrested and not simply taken into custody with the mother since there was not a caregiver at the time with whom the children could have been left.\n[19] While the objective evidence shows that it is unlikely that the child claimants would be arrested upon return to Egypt, given that family members of political opponents face harassment and discrimination in Egypt, the children may face discrimination amounting to persecution due to their family relation to the principal claimant.\n[20] The military courts are currently used in Egypt and are expanding in use where defendants have fewer rights than in civilian courts \u2013 these military courts are being used against people who are protesting against the post-coup government in Egypt (NDP, Tab 1.5, pages 29- 30).\nState protection and Internal flight alternative (IFA)\n[21] There is clear and convincing evidence before me that the state is unable or unwilling to provide the claimants with adequate protection, for the reasons stated above.\n[22] On the evidence before me, I find that there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout Egypt for the claimants in their circumstances.\nCONCLUSION\n[23] The claimants are Convention refugees.\n[24] I accept their claims.\n(signed) JEFFREY BRIAN GULLICKSON\nMarch 23, 2020\n\n",

You were a businessman in Egypt and you provided support to the Muslim Brotherhood movement in your region during the 2011 revolution. You also participated actively in the electoral campaign in support of the Muslim Brotherhood candidates.\n[4] You officially joined the Freedom and Justice Party in May 2011 and you worked closely with the secretary general of the Rami District for the Freedom and Justice Party.\n[5] In 2015, you joined the Association of Journalists against Corruption. The association created a website as a mean of denouncing those engaged in corruption. You said that you did not write articles because you are not a journalist, but you organized secret seminars, meetings and you printed some publications.\n[6] You say that your problems started in 2019, as the regime was monitoring the actions of the association. On XXXX XXXX XXXX 2019, you shared a video on Facebook that was posted by a friend of yours who is a well-known opponent living in Greece. He is a member of the \u201c6 of April movement\u201d.\n[7] On XXXX XXXX XXXX 2019, you were arrested inside your company and taken into detention for five days. During that time, you were insulted and interrogated about your activities. You were also threatened of torture and sexual assault if arrested again.\n[8] After your release, you continued your activities as you wanted to confront the articles of the Constitution passed in March 2019 which increased the presidential powers.\n[9] After you published a comment on Facebook on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2020, criticizing the military, on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2020, security forces raided your apartment during the night, scaring your family. You were taken for interrogation and were tortured. Then, the security forces proposed to you to cooperate with them in exchange for your release. You accepted as you feared for your life. You were released on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2020.\n[10] You left Egypt on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2019, and you came directly to Canada as you had a valid Canadian visa. You did not want to cooperate with the Egyptian security forces by informing them about your friends\u2019 meetings and plans. You came to Canada and asked the Canadian authorities for protection.\nDETERMINATION\n[11] I find that you are a \u201cConvention refugee\u201d as you have established a serious possibility of persecution should you return to Egypt based on the grounds in Section 96.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[12] I find that your identity as a national of Egypt is established by the copy of your passport.\nCredibility\n[13] Based on the documents in the file, I have noted no serious credibility issues. In particular, the evidence establishes the allegations as set out above: C1 is your membership card to the Freedom and Justice Party and C5 is a certificate of appreciation from the party, the evidence confirms your membership and activities within the Freedom and Justice Party. Exhibit C2 is the Association of Journalists against Corruption membership card and confirms that you joined this association; C3 and C4 are messages from Facebook confirming that you were active in the social media opposing the Egyptian government; C7 is a legal document confirming that you had been detained on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2019; After reviewing the documents, I have no reasons to doubt their authenticity.\nObjective basis of future risk\n[14] Based on the credibility of your allegations, and the documentary evidence set out below, I find that you have established a future risk that you will be subjected to the following harm: arrest, detention, torture and death.\n[15] The fact that you face this risk is corroborated by the following documents. Tabs 1.4 and 1.5 corroborate the fact that the Muslim Brotherhood (MB) and its Freedom and Justice Party were banned in 20141. Tab 1.5 corroborates that the authorities arrest people for alleged MB ties on a regular basis2. The arrests, detention, disappearance, torture, execution of Muslim Brotherhood members by the authorities are corroborated by tabs 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.7, 2.8. Tab 1.4 corroborates that those with family links to members face a risk of arrest and prosecution and all persons with Muslim Brotherhood links are likely to be subjected to surveillance and monitoring of their activities3.\nNature of the harm\n[16] This harm clearly amounts to persecution.\nState protection\n[17] I find that there is clear and convincing evidence before me that the state is unable or unwilling to provide you with adequate protection. Judges are the primary tools in the repression of political opponents4; also, most defendants were sentenced after mass trials that violate fundamental due process rights, and some courts relied on confessions extracted under torture5.\nInternal flight alternative\n[18] I have considered whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for you. On the evidence before me, I find that there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout Egypt. In light of the evidence quoted above regarding the Justice and Freedom Party, and also taking into your specific situations, I do not believe that you will be able to establish yourself safely in Egypt.\nCONCLUSION\n[19] Based on the analysis above, I conclude that you are a \u201cConvention refugee\u201d.

They fear persecution at the hands of Muslim extremists as a result of their religious identity as Coptic Christians and have thus filed claims for refugee protection.\nDETERMINATION\n[5] I find that the claimants are Convention refugees as they have established a serious possibility of persecution should they return to Egypt based on the grounds in section 96.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[6] I find that their respective identities as nationals of Egypt are established by the documents provided: their passports,i and birth certificates.ii\n[7] They have also established their identity as Coptic Christians by providing birth certificates, baptism certificates, national identity cards, marriage certificate and supporting letters from the Coptic Orthodox Churches in Egypt and Canada.iii\nNexus\n[8] I find that the claimants have established a nexus to section 96 by reason of religion.\nCredibility\n[9] Based on the documents in the file, there no serious credibility issues. In particular, the evidence establishes the allegations as set out above, namely that the claimants are of the Coptic Christian faith. After reviewing the documents, I have no reasons to doubt their authenticity.\nObjective basis of future risk\n[l0] The claimants\u2019 subjective fear of persecution is objectively well founded. Information in the National Documentation Package (NDP) confirms that abuse of Coptic Christians was increasing even before the fall of the Mubarak regime. Christian properties, including homes, businesses, and churches, have been destroyed and Christians have been the primary targets of violent sectarian attacks. Christians have been arrested and detained; they have also faced harassment, rape, mental and physical abuse and pressure to convert to Islam; police officers have been involved in the persecution of Christians. The state has not adequately protected Christians, and has failed to prosecute perpetrators.iv\nState protection\n[11] I find that adequate state protection would not be reasonably forthcoming in this particular case. The objective evidence indicates that the Egyptian authorities not only fail to protect Coptic Christians, but they themselves engage in violence against them, and perpetrators of attacks against Christians commit abuses in a climate of impunity.v I find that based on the claimants\u2019 evidence when considered in conjunction with the objective evidence, is a clear and convincing rebuttal of the presumption of state protection.\nInternal flight alternative\n[12] I have considered whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for the claimants. On the evidence before me, I find that there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout Egypt.\nThe evidence does not suggest that the religiously-motivated violence is restricted to a particular area of Egypt, or that individuals in the claimant\u2019s situation could find safety elsewhere.vi As such, I find that there is no viable internal flight alternative in Egypt for this claim.\nCONCLUSION\n[13] Having considered the evidence, I find there is a serious possibility that the claimants would be persecuted upon return to Egypt because of their Coptic Christian identities. I conclude that the claimants are Convention refugees. Accordingly, I accept their claims.\n(signed) R.

Willard\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Sherif Ashamalla\nCountry: Egypt\nRPD Number: TB9-22509\nAssociated RPD Number(s): TB9-22529, TB9-22563, TB9-22564, TB9-22565\nATIP Number: A-2020-00518\nATIP Pages: 001001-001012\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] This is a decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) in the claim for refugee protection put forth by Mr. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (the principal claimant), Ms. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (the female claimant), XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (the minor claimants) under sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).1 The panel has carefully and mindfully considered the claims in their entirety. The principal claimant was appointed as the Designated Representative for the minor claimants.\nDETERMINATION\n[2] This is a split decision. The panel finds that the claimants who are citizens of Egypt only (that is, all of the claimants except for XXXX) are persons in need of protection as specified under section 97(1) of the IRPA. The panel finds that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX as a citizen of the U.S., is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection. The reasons are as follows.\n[3] In reaching its determination, the panel has taken into consideration the level of education and sophistication of the principal claimant and female claimant, including the stresses in the hearing room. The panel has further taken into consideration Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 4: Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender Related Persecution.2\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] The details of the claimants\u2019 allegations are found in the Basis of Claim (BOC) form narrative.3 In summary, the principal claimant indicates that his family was living in Kuwait for several years. He alleges that because his family was perceived to have lots of money, a neighbour named XXXX XXXX XXXX demanded money from him. Due to the pressure, he agreed to give him some money because of his association with thugs.\n[4] In June of 2019, when the principal claimant refused to lend more money to him, Mr. XXXX became very aggressive, verbally insulted and assaulted the claimant. The principal claimant was threatened and the contents of his apartment were destroyed. He sought assistance from the police and moved but the police took no action. Days later, his son XXXX was kidnapped for ransom by Mr. XXXX who called demanding money for his release or else he would be killed. The principal claimant rushed to the police and filed a report. Once he did, a thug associated with Mr. XXXX called to tell the principal claimant that reporting to the police was a mistake and fruitless. The claimant inferred that this was likely because they had connections to the Muslim Brotherhood. The police took no action so the claimant and his father\u00ad in-law and friends raised money to pay the ransom. They paid the money to the kidnappers. The claimant\u2019s son continues to suffer psychologically from the experience.\n[5] The claimants did not know where else to go because his own family do not agree with his decision not to perform FGM (Female Genital Mutilation) on his daughter. He also adds in his amended narrative that his spouse is fearful of living in Egypt because she will be forced to wear the hijab which she does not wish to do and that she will be subjected to sexual harassment and abuse on the streets. The claimants stayed at a hotel and then flew to Kuwait. Upon arrival there, he was informed that his employer would be terminating his work contract. As a result, he no longer had legal status in Kuwait. The claimant made arrangements and he and his family travelled to the U.S. on XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. They did not file claims there due to information they received. Rather, they chose to enter Canada on XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.\n[6] Since their arrival, the principal claimant\u2019s father-in-law has been pursued and threatened for money despite his father-in-law\u2019s relocation to Mansoura. His father-in-law moved to Cairo in XXXX of 2019 and kept a low-profile there until he was able to leave Egypt and move to Kuwait. The claimants seek protection in Canada.\nANALYSIS\nPersonal identity\n[7] The claimants state that they are citizens of Egypt. They provided their Egyptian passports at the time when they filed their claims. Copies are found in Exhibit 1. The panel notes that a U.S. passport was presented for XXXX XXXX XXXX. The claimants indicate that he is a citizen of the U.S. The panel accepts, on a balance of probabilities, their alleged names, dates of birth and citizenships.\nCredibility\n[8] The panel found the claimants to be generally credible with respect to the allegations related to the principal claimant. Their testimony was spontaneous, fluid, internally consistent and consistent with the documentary evidence they filed. They provided a number of documents to corroborate their allegations, all of which are found in Exhibit 5. These include: police reports, medical reports, attestations, a photograph and proof of receipt of their documents. Accordingly, the panel determines that their allegations are credible, on a balance of probabilities.\nNexus\n[9] The principal claimant states that he fears a neighbour named XXXX XXXX XXXX who is associated with thugs and the Muslim Brotherhood. He fears this individual because he refused to continue to lend him money which he states then led to his son\u2019s kidnapping for ransom. Upon being informed that this individual has connections with the police, the principal claimant believes that he is well-connected through the Muslim Brotherhood. The panel determines that this falls within the ambit of section 97 of IRPA.\n[10] The principal claimant states that he feared relocating to his own family\u2019s location because they would want him to perform FGM on his daughter. The panel finds that this fear falls within the ambit of section 96 of the IRPA.\n[11] In his amended BOC narrative,4 the principal claimant states that his spouse only covers her hair with a hijab when she is in Egypt because of her family\u2019s strict expectations and customs and also because she would be subjected to sexual harassment or abuse on the street if she did not wear a hijab. The panel finds that this also falls within the ambit of section 96 of the IRPA.\nSubjective Fear \u2013 Failure to Claim in the U.S.\n[12] The claimants arrived in the U.S. with valid U.S. visas on XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. They remained in the U.S. for 4 days before arriving in Canada on XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. They indicate that they had heard that the U.S. did not look upon Muslims favourably and separated children from their parents.\n[13] The panel notes that the claimants (apart from XXXX who is a U.S. citizen) were in possession of valid visas during their 4 days in the U.S. The panel notes they relied on information they heard to determine that filing their claims in Canada was preferable. The panel finds that they did not remain in the U.S. for a lengthy period, were in possession of valid visas at the time, and intended to come to Canada. Accordingly, the panel determines that their actions are insufficient to impugn their subjective fear.\nClaim based on FGM (Daughter)\n[14] The principal claimant indicates that he cannot relocate to live with his own family in their village because his own family would forcefully impose FGM on his daughter.\nDocumentary evidence and Assessment of FGM in Egypt\n[15] The claimants submitted evidence on FGM in Egypt.5 Similar to an excerpt in the claimant\u2019s own disclosure,6 the NDP refers to FGM being illegal in Egypt, that actual criminal convictions have been ordered for some practitioners of FGM in Egypt, to a prison sentence and fines ordered, the law has increased prison sentences, a fatwa has been issued declaring FGM un-Islamic, and the practice of FGM is in decline in Egypt, although it is reported that a majority of women still have traditional FGM done in Egypt.7 This evidence does not support the allegation that the minor claimant, in the particular circumstances of the claimants where both parents do not want FGM performed, would be forced to undergo FGM in Egypt, if they did not want it.\n[16] In reaching this determination, the panel has been mindful of the principal claimant\u2019s beliefs that his extended family (aunts and uncles) would impose it. He refers to an incident in 1999 (a year after his father passed away), more than 20 years ago, when his paternal and maternal uncles took his sisters and forced FGM on them. He indicated that both of his parents have now passed away, but he believes his uncles and aunts would insist upon it for his daughter. The panel notes that this incident in 1999 after his father died was considered in light of all of the evidence, the panel finds that the circumstances have vastly changed since that time given the change in the law in 2008 and its implementation. Accordingly, the panel does not find the fear of FGM to be a credible or well-founded one.\nClaim Based on Gender in Egypt (Female Claimant and Daughter)\n[17] The female claimant, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, states in the amended BOC at Exhibit 7 that she is fearful for herself and her daughter, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, because of verbal assaults, harassment and mistreatment that she received and fears her daughter would receive in Egypt. The documents in the National Documentation Package for Egypt (NDP)8 mention discrimination, harassment and violence against women in Egypt.\n[18] Regarding violence or attacks against women outside of domestic or family violence, in the amended narrative found in Exhibit 7, the principal claimant added reference to his spouse not wishing to wear the hijab in Egypt and fearing sexual harassment on the street if she chooses not to wear one in Egypt.9 The panel notes that wearing a hijab is not mandatory by operation of law in Egypt. The harassment the female claimant states she has been exposed to in Egypt occurred when she wore a hijab. She stated that she feels forced to wear one because of harassment. She stated she does not wish for her daughter to wear a hijab either.\n[19] According to the United Kingdom Home Officer report in the NDP:10\n8.1.1 The 2017 DFAT report observed that:\n\u2018Sexual harassment is a frequent occurrence for women across the socioeconomic spectrum. A 2013 UN Women study found 99.3 per cent of Egyptian women had experienced sexual harassment, while 91.5 percent reported experiencing unwanted physical contact. Sexual harassment was found to be particularly prevalent during mass street celebrations such as religious feasts, or political demonstrations. The study found that most sexually assaulted women would not report the crime to the police or tell their families.\u201945\n8.1.2 The USSD reported sexual harassment as a serious problem and that \u2018Media and NGOs reported sexual harassment by police was also a problem, and the potential for further harassment further discouraged women from filing complaints\u2019.46\n[20] According to another NDP source:\n[\u2026 ]a study conducted by the Egyptian Center for Women\u2019s Rights that \u201cshowed that a woman\u2019s dress had no effect on whether she was molested; in fact, the majority of victims were veiled.11\n[21] The same source further states:\nAccording to a poll conducted by the Thomson Reuters Foundation, in which 336 gender experts in 21 Arab League states as well as Syria were surveyed, Egypt is \u201cthe worst country in the Arab world to be a woman\u201d (Thomson Reuters Foundation 12 Nov. 2013). The report states that sexual harassment contributed to this ranking (ibid.).\nThe same source quotes a representative from HarassMap as saying that women \u201cregularly \u2018have to fight with the police to actually make the report, in the street, and at the police station\u2019\u201d (ibid.).\n[22] A New York Times article submitted by the claimants via their counsel states:12\nA 2017 survey by two groups that promote gender equality, Promundo and UN Women, found that sexual harassment is rampant on Egyptian streets, particularly in urban areas. More than 60 percent of Egyptian men reported in the survey that they had sexually harassed a woman or girl on the street, and more than three-quarters of male respondents cited a woman\u2019 s \u201cprovocative\u201d dress as a legitimate reason for harassment. And in a 2013 study by UN Women, 99.3 percent of Egyptian women and girls in a survey said they had been the victims of some kind of sexual harassment, from unwanted advances to rape. Ms. Orman [a human rights lawyer in Cairo] said the proliferation of security cameras in Cairo may have helped discourage some sexual assaults in the city, but the problem remains common at festivals and other large public gatherings. She said the civil and legal authorities across Egyptian society still need to take the issue more seriously.\n[23] The panel notes that the female claimant\u2019s personal circumstances are highly relevant in the panel\u2019s assessment as to what she has experienced or would experience upon return to Egypt as well as her daughter. The female claimant testified to being mistreated in public, even while wearing a hijab. She testified that there is a culture or tradition of viewing women without a hijab as \u201csluts\u201d. She stated that while there is no law requiring her to wear a hijab, she wears one because she believes it would be worse for her if she did not. She testified to \u201calways\u201d receiving verbal assaults. When asked to clarify, she referred to women wearing a tight hijab refusing to talk to her. When asked about approaching the police, she stated that if she did, they would tell her that she is the cause of the harassment. She stated that there is no protection nor safe place to reside.\n[24] The panel finds the female claimant\u2019s statements to be credible and trustworthy and consistent with the objective documentary evidence. However, the panel finds that verbal accosting by women wearing tight hijabs does not amount to persecution, even on a cumulative basis. The female claimant neither testified to being the subject of sexual harassment in the past, nor did she refer to having experienced it in the past in her BOC narrative amendment at Exhibit 7. Given the documentary evidence cited above which states that the absence or presence of a hijab is not determinative in how a woman is treated, the panel finds that while she may feel she cannot wear a hijab, she has not established that she has been persecuted nor would be on this basis in Egypt. Accordingly, the panel finds that she has not established that she or her daughter would be persecuted on this particular basis in Egypt.\nClaim based on Section 97 Fear- Well-Foundedness, State Protection and IFA\nWell-Foundedness and State Protection\n[25] The principal claimant testified credibly regarding the threats, kidnapping and maltreatment he and his family experienced at the hands of their neighbour who has police connections and who he believes may have Muslim Brotherhood connections. He explained that this individual and his associates have marked him and his spouse\u2019s family as having money because of the time they have spent in Kuwait. He explained that his son was kidnapped for ransom and continues to suffer psychologically as a result. He explained that his father-in-law relocated to Mansoura City, a distance away from Belkas City and was found there by the agent of persecution. Furthermore, he explained that the agent of persecution was informed by an insider at the police station when the claimant filed a police report in Belkas. The agent of persecution persisted in seeking the family and then his father-in-law and the claimant believes it is due to their anger because the claimant reported them to the police.\n[26] The principal claimant testified that he approached the police on more than one occasion and they did not assist him. Rather, they informed the persecutor that the claimant had filed a report. Taking into consideration the objective evidence on rampant corruption in Egypt,13 combined with the claimant\u2019s own efforts to seek state protection, the panel finds that the claimant has rebutted the presumption of state protection in his particular circumstances.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[27] The test for assessing an IFA is two-pronged and is set out in the Federal Court of Appeal decision in Rasaratnam:14\nThe Board must be satisfied on a balance of probabilities that there is no serious possibility of the claimant being persecuted in the part of the country to which it finds an IFA exists and\/or the claimant would not be personally subject to a risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture in the IFA.Moreover, the conditions in the part of the country considered to be an IFA must be such that it would not be unreasonable in all the circumstances, including those particular to the claim, for him to seek refuge there.15[28] Both prongs must be satisfied to find that a claimant has an IFA. Once the issue of IFA has been raised and the potential IFAs have been identified, the burden of proof rests with a claimant to show that they do not have an IFA. The finding of an IFA must be based on an analysis of the region proposed, taking account of a claimant\u2019s personal circumstances. An IFA must be realistic and attainable. The claimant cannot be expected to encounter great physical danger or undergo undue hardship in travelling there and staying there.\n[29] The Australian Government confirms that the Egyptian constitution guarantees freedom of movement, residence and emigration and there is no legal impediment to internal movement.16 The UK Home Office Country Information and Guidance report for Egypt states that where the person fears non-state agents internal relocation is likely to be reasonable but \u201cwill depend on the nature and origin of the threat, as well as the person\u2019s circumstances and profile.17\n[30] The panel proposed the cities of Cairo, Port Said and Alexandria as potential IFAs. Taking into consideration the particular circumstances of the claimants at hand, the panel determines that they have met the burden of demonstrating that there is no viable internal flight alternative for them in Egypt. In the case at hand, the agent of persecution was both motivated and able to successfully locate the claimant, abduct his son and locate his father-in-law and continue threatening him beyond Belkas City. The agent of persecution was also able to learn that the claimants had filed police reports.\n[31] Based on the actions of the agent of persecution and their determination to seek out the claimant and his family in retribution for approaching the police, being able to reach and locate members of the family in different regions, the panel determines that the claimants have, in their particular circumstances, demonstrated that they cannot relocate to other parts of Egypt safely. Therefore, the panel finds that a viable IFA is not present for them in Egypt.\nClaim of U.S. Minor\n[31] The claimants indicated that they have no section 96 or section 97(1) claim against the U.S. on behalf of the minor child, XXXX XXXX XXXX. Accordingly, the panel determines that as he is a citizen of the United States, he is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\nCONCLUSION\n[32] Having considered all of the evidence, the panel determines that there is not a serious possibility that the claimants would be persecuted in Egypt as per section 96 of the IRPA.\n[33] The panel does find, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimants XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, would be personally subjected to a danger of torture or face a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in their country as per section 97. Their claims are accepted.\n[34] The panel further finds that XXXX XXXX XXXX, a citizen of the U.S., is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection. His claim is rejected.\n(signed) D.

Coulthard\nCountry: Egypt\nRPD Number: TB9-15833\nAssociated RPD Number(s): TB9-15834, TB9-15835\nATIP Number: A-2020-00518\nATIP Pages: 000957-000960\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: I have considered your testimony and the other evidence in the case and I\u2019m ready to render my decision orally. These are the reasons for the decision in the claims of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, a 33-year-old woman and her two children, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX who claim to be citizens of Egypt and are claiming refugee protection pursuant to Sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. I have appointed XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX as designated representative for the minor children, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.\nAllegations\n[2] You alleged that you fear persecution by the Egyptian authorities because your Nubian ethnicity and your active membership with the Nubian community. You allege that the Nubian community believes that the current regime in Egypt has taken Nubian lands contrary to what was promised to them in the 2014 Constitution. In 2008, you moved from Egypt to Kuwait and you became an active member of the Nubian organization in Kuwait. In 2012, you became a member of the Nubian General Union in Egypt that tried to find solutions to the Nubian problems. On June 12th, 2018, while you were visiting your family in Aswan, Egypt, you attended a meeting to discuss a new law that authorized the Egyptian government to take land from Nubians in upper Egypt.\n[3] Police officers entered the home where you gathered and tooked-, took you to the police station and the other 4 members. The police interrogated you and after about 4 hours of detention, when the police was going to transfer you somewhere else, you were able to escape from their custody. After hiding for 5 days in different family members\u2019 homes, you went to Cairo and finally returned to Kuwait on XXXX XXXX, 2018. Your employment and temporary residency visa in Kuwait terminated in December 2018. Because you were afraid of going back to Egypt, you flew to the United States and crossed the border into Canada, making a port of entry asylum claim in XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018. You fear Egyptian authorities should you return to Egypt and that\u2019s because of your activities on behalf of the Nubian community. You alleged that your two children are not being persecuted but you fear for their education and because the government may potentially use them to pro-, apprehend you.\nDetermination\n[4] I found that you are a Convention refugee as you have established a serious possibility of persecution on account of your membership to a particular social group as a Nubian.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[5] I find that your identity as a national of Egypt is established by your testimony and the supporting documentation filed, including the copy of your passports at Exhibit 1. You stated that you do not have any permanent status in Kuwait as you only had a temporary working visa that ended when your employment was terminated. You also confirmed that you have no permanent resident or citizenship status in any other country other than Egypt.\nCredibility\n[6] The determinative issue in this case are credibility and state protection. In making this assessment, I have considered all the evidence including your oral testimony and the documentary evidence entered (inaudible). I find you to be credible-, I find you to be a credible witness and therefore believe what you allege in support of your claim. You testified in a straightforward manner and there were no relevant inconsistencies in your testimony or contradictions within your testimony and the other evidence before me which have not been sa-, satisfactorily explained. You testified with clear and convincing evidence about your claim. You were spontaneous with details about your background and knowledge of Nubian nationality. You also provided details of the discrimination that Nubians have been suffering in Egypt. You also testified that one person that was arrested with you on XXXX-, on June 12th is still in detention. You provided corroborating doctum-, documentation to support the core aspects of the claim.\n[7] A letter from Al-, Alaqi Association in Kuwait acknowledging your membergy-, membership. Alagi is A\u00ad-L-A-Q-I. Your Nubian membership card from the General Nubian Union, marriage certificate and authorization from your husband to travel with your children to Canada, a notice against you issued by the Egyptian authorities to appear to a hearing to be held on August 15, 2018 in Aswan, Egypt that states you are a fugitive. After reviewing the documents, I have no reasons to doubt their authenticity. They corroborate that you are an active member of the Nubian Association, you have been arrested by the police and the Egyptian authorities are persecuting you. Further, I accept you are a Nubian person persecuted by the Egyptian authorities, therefore, I find on a balance of probabilities you have established that you are a member of the Nubian community and you have a subjective fear of persecution if you return to Egypt.\nObjective Basis and State Protection\n[8] The objective documentary evidence describing the current treatment of Nubians in Egypt recognizes that Nubians face discrimination and some harassment. They were displaced from their homeland in the 1960\u2019s and that they may face further forced displacement due to a new government decrease concerning land ownership. The documentation also indicates that the Egyptian government had been making changes to advance the situation of minorities including Nubians but that the government had not yet followed through on certain promises affecting the Nubian minority and that they continue to be blocked from living in certain areas of their traditional territory.\n[9] Nubian activist had been arrested and detained as a result of their activism to protect the people\u2019s rights, therefore I find your allegations are corroborated by the objective evidence and more specifically, the National Documentation Package which states at Tab 2.1 that Nubians from upper Egypt face discrimination and persecution by security forces, especially, active members who participate in protests. In November 2017, six Nubians members were charged with gathering illegally, protesting without a permit and attacking security forces after being detained by police on their way to protest the new presidential decree concerning land ownership. When I take all that into consideration, you have demonstrated elements that are sufficient for me to consider you a Convention refugee because of the persecution you would face for belonging to the minority Nubian community and your political opinions that the State would perceive you have. So considering all that, you have demonstrated a well-founded fear of persecution based on your race or ethnicity and your perceived political opinions.\nState Protection\n[10] I find that it would be objectively unreasonable for you to seek the protection of the State in light of your particular circumstances as well the evidence cited above, especially considering that the State is the agent of persecution in your case, therefore , there\u2019s no state protection available to you.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[11] I have considered whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for you. On the evidence before me, I find that there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout Egypt as the Egyptian government is the agent of persecution.\nCONCLUSION\n[12] Based on the analysis above, I conclude that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is a Convention refugee. Accordingly I accept your claim. The two minors. You allege that your two children are not being persecuted but you fear for their education and because the government may potentially use them to apre-, apprehend ye-, yourself. You also explained that no one in Egypt was going to take care of them. I find that on a balance of probabilities, there\u2019s insufficient evidence that the children face a serious possibility of persecution in Egypt if they were there, therefore, based on the analysis above, I conclude that the two minors, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX are not Convention refugees under Section 96 of the IRPA or persons in need of protection within the meaning of Section 97(1)(a) or (b) of the IRPA. Accordingly I reject their claims.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n",

And I note that XXXX was the designated representative for both minors.\n[3] With respect to your allegations, they are documented in the Basis of Claim form, Item 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3. And I\u2019m not going to repeat them in this oral judgement.\n[4] Just bare-, very briefly, I just want to mention that you fear return to your country because of the domestic abuse that you had suffered at the hands of your former husband. And because of your fear of your uncle, XXXX XXXX XXXX and specifically, his profile and strong beliefs in extreme Islamic views.\n[5] With respect to your identity, I accept your personal identity as a national of Egypt as well as your children based on certified true copies of your passports.\nCredibility\n[6] I found you to be a credible witness who testified in a straightforward and spontaneous manner. You, you were asked many questions with respect to your former relationship with your spouse. Sorne of the incidents that had happened in Egypt at the hands of your uncle and your former husband. And with respect to evidence that you provided, including the police report from your father. And the letter of support for your sister. There were no inconsistencies or contradictions.\n[7] Sorne of the evidence that you provided today are not included in your Basis of Claim form. And you were asked about that and you had explained that you had only received knowledge of those incidents after you had made your refugee claim. I\u2019m not drawing any negative inferences with respect to your omission about the continuing interest from your uncle after your departure to Canada. My understanding from your oral testimony and your written testimony is, is that although you feared both these men in Egypt, it seems that your, that your biggest fear was born out of the threats that you received towards yourself and both your children from your maternal uncle XXXX XXXX XXXX.\n[8] I, I, I, the objective evidence supports that there are persons that have extreme views in Egypt. Based on your detailed narrative and your oral testimony today, I am, I have no reason to doubt the veracity of your testimony. And I accept that you were a victim, you and your children were both victims of a threat at the hands of your uncle in Egypt. You provided numerous supportive documents in support of your claim that were also consistent. And that includes a report from the Scarborough Hospital that repeats or provides similar information with respect to the harm that you suffered at the hands of your uncle. And it also refers to the abuse that you, the physical and verbal abuse you suffered at the hands of your former husband. This is found in Exhibit 6.\n[9] With respect to the well-foundedness, the objective basis in Egypt it is well documented that domestic violence including spousal viol-, violence and violence at the hands of family members in Egypt is widespread. This information is also included in the disclosures provided by your counsel that talked about the prevalence of violence against women.\n[10] Documents show that 30% of Egyptian married women suffer from spousal violence. This is consistent also with the USDOS report found in Item 2.1. It\u2019 s also indicated, this information is echoed in Item 5.5 which is an RI Report in Egypt that talks about the spousal violence in Egypt. I note that according to the Freedom House there\u2019s very few mechanisms that are in place to protect women and offer adequate support. And there\u2019s some restrictions or conditions that require you to bring witnesses or have proof even just for you to have a medical or to, to, to, to go to the police station in Egypt. Which is largely ineffective in terms of the implementation of actually offering protection to women that are similarly situated to you.\n[11] I\u2019m not going to get into all of the objective evidence but I, I am, I am satisfied that in your personal circumstances, given the profile of specifically your uncle, alone that you would be, that there would be no state protection that would be forthcoming to you. I also do not feel that there would be, you would be safe anywhere else in Egypt given the profile of your uncle. And his motivation to pursue you even after you left Egypt. Based on items found in Exhibit A-, Exhibit 8.\n[12] So, for all those reasons, I, I am accepting you as a refugee claim. And I find that you ar-, you and your children are, merit to be Convention refugees in Canada. Okay. And I\u2019m accepting your claim.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n",

I have considered your testimony and the other evidence in the case, and I am ready to render my decision orally.\n[2] These are the reasons for the decision in the claim of XXXX XXXX XXXX, who claims to be a citizen of Egypt and is claiming refugee protection pursuant to Sections 96 and 97 (1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[3] In rendering my reasons, I have considered and applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guidelines on Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender Related Persecution.\nALLEGATIONS\n[4] You allege that you fear persecution by the Egyptian government because your political opinion, and if you return to Egypt you will be detained by Egyptian authorities upon your arrival.\n[5] You allege that you graduated from XXXX XXXX in Alexandria in 1996. On March 15, 2018 you expressed your political position against the presidential campaign supporting el-Sisi for the elections held in March 2018 before the Egyptian Bar Association.\n[6] The afternoon of the same day security forces raided your home and arrested you without a warrant in the presence of our children. You were detained for 15 days where you were beaten and tortured.\n[7] You allege that on August 8, 2018 you were talking in the Egyptian Bar Association about the importance of organizing a demonstration.\n[8] The next day, the security forces raided your home and arrested you for a second time. During your arrest, you were beaten, sexually assaulted, humiliated, and insulted.\n[9] You were released on August 20, 2018 after you were forced to sign an undertaking not to participate in any political activities, and to report to the security office every week.\n[10] You reported three times. And after consulting a lawyer who advised you to flee the country, you paid an officer in the airport to be able to leave Egypt.\nDETERMINATION\n[11] I find that you are a Convention Refugee as you have established a serious possibility of persecution on account of your political opinion.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[12] I found that your identity as a national of Egypt is established by your testimony and the supporting documentation filed, including your passport.\nCREDIBILITY\n[13] The determinative issue in this case are credibility and State protection. In making this assessment I have considered all the evidence including, the oral testimony, and the documentary evidence entered as Exhibits. I find you to be a credible witness and therefore believe what you alleged in support of your claim.\n[14] You testified in a straightforward manner, and there were no relevant inconsistencies in your testimony, or contradictions between your testimony and the other evidence before me which have not been satisfactorily explained.\n[15] In particular, the evidence establishes the allegations as set out above. You testified with clear and convincing evidence about your claim. You were spontaneous with details about your background and persecution.\n[16] You also provided details of the arrest, torture, sexual assault, harassment, and threatening incidents that you and your family experienced in Egypt. These were details that you would expect of someone who had lived the experiences described.\n[17] You provided reasonable explanations and clarifications for minor inconsistencies. when I ask you, you did not appear at all evasive in your testimony.\n[18] You provided corroborating documentation to support the core aspects of the claim; a support letter from your husband, three letters from people who knew about your political opinion and participation in demonstrations, a support letter from a lawyer who witness your position before the Egyptian Bar Association, three Notice of Summon issued by the officer of the police station of Alraml A-L-R-A-M-L, the second for you to be present before the Public Prosecutor on the following days: October 14, 2018, December 3, 2018, and March 16, 2019, two psychological medical reports from your children who stayed in Egypt and were present at the time of your arrest.\n[19] Based upon your testimony and documentary evidence filed in support of your claim, I am satisfied of your persona) and political background, your education, and your work history.\n[20] Therefore, I accept what you have alleged in relation to your claim and find on a balance of probabilities that you faced threats by the authorities due to your political opinion.\n[21] Therefore, I find on a balance of probabilities you have a credible subjective fear of persecution in Egypt, and you have established your core allegations of being persecuted for your political opinion.\n[22] Therefore, I find on a balance of probabilities you have established that you have a subjective fear of persecution if you return to Egypt.\nOBJECTIVE BASIS\n[23] I find that adequate State protection would not be reasonable forthcoming in this case. The evidence in the NDP for Egypt supports your allegations.\n[24] Item 2.3 states that since President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi secured a second term in a largely unfree and unfair presidential election in March 2018, his security forces have escalated a campaign of intimidation, violence, and arrest against political opponents, civil society activists, and many other who have simply voiced mild criticism of the government, invoking terrorism and the country\u2019s state of emergency law to silence peaceful activists.\n[25] The NDP Item 10.1 reports that there are problems in the implementation of basic human and civil rights, in particular related to frequent impunity in the behaviour of law enforcement and unjustified or excessive violence.\n[26] The NDP evidence at Item 9.7 states that Torture appears to occur particularly frequently following arbitrary arrests and is often carried out to obtain a confession or to punish and threaten political dissenters.\n[27] Torture occurs in police stations, prisons, State security facilities, and Central Security Forces facilities. Torture is perpetrated by police officers, military officers, National Security officers and prison guards.\n[28] based on the country conditions evidence your claim is objectively well-founded. Based on the credibility of your allegations and the documentary evidence that [inaudible] I find that you have established that there is more than a mere possibility that you may face persecution if you were to return to Egypt today.\nSTATE PROTECTION\n[29] Therefore, based on the review of the documentary evidence I find that you have rebutted the presumption of State protection with clear and convincing evidence.\n[30] And adequate State protection would not be available to you were to seek it in Egypt, as the evidence before me is that it would be objectively unreasonable for you to seek the protection of the state in light of your particular circumstances, as the Egyptian authorities are the agent of persecution.\nINTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE\n[31] I have considered whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for you. On the evidence before me, that the Egyptian government is the agent of persecution, I find that there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout Egypt. So, there is no internal flight alternative for you.\nCONCLUSION\n[32] Based on the analysis above I conclude that you are a Convention Refugee. Accordingly, I accept your claim.\n[33] So, I wish you all the best.\n[34] CLAIMANT: Thank you.\n[35] MEMBER: Welcome to Canada. And I hope you can get together with your family soon.\n[36] Thank you, Counsel.\n[37] Thank you, Madam Interpreter.\n[38] COUNSEL: Okay \u2026\n[39] MEMBER: So, we are on the record \u2026\n[40] PERSON UNKNOWN: Yes.\n[41] MEMBER: and one of the\u2026 what was the name?

To summarize, he indicates that he and his spouse are both citizens of Egypt, that they were born there, and that they hold citizenship and permanent \u2026 permanent residence in no other country.\n[11] They indicate that they have lived for a number of years in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Specifically, the male claimant indicates that they \u2026 that he lived in Saudi Arabia from 2007 to 2010. He indicates that he was in the United Arab Emirates from XXXX 2010 to XXXX 2016, and then again in Saudi Arabia from XXXX 2016 to XXXX 2018.

His \u2026 two of his other children, one was born in Saudi Arabia, and the other in the United Arab Emirates. So, specifically, XXXX was born in Saudi Arabia and XXXX was Born in the United Arab Emirates.\n[15] The claimants indicate that they fear returning to Egypt and that their lives would be at risk there due to their anti-government political activities. Accordingly, they seek protection here in Canada.\n[16] The Determination:\n[17] After assessing all of the evidence before me, sir and Madam, I determine that you have established your evidence, on a balance of probabilities.\n[18] I find that you have established to the panel\u2019s satisfaction your personal identities, your anti\u00adgovernment political identity and activities. You\u2019ve also established the credibility of your allegations. You\u2019ve given me reasonable explanations with respect to the issues of failure to claim in the United States and re-availment.\n[19] Moreover, I find that you have established the well-foundedness of your fear and that State protection and an internal flight alternative do not exist for you.\n[20] I further find that you have established the countries of reference as Egypt only for yourselves and also, in particular, for XXXX and XXXX who were born in the UAE and Saudi Arabia.\n[21] I\u2019m going to turn to my analysis now.\n[22] First, in relation to your personal identities, I note that you did provide the passports, the Egyptian passports for all of your family members. I note that for XXXX you provided the US passport and I will turn to that in her decision.\n[23] Based on these documents, I find that you have established your personal identities, on a balance of probabilities, as required by Section 106 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act and also Rule 11 of the Refugee Protection Division rules. Therefore, I am satisfied with respect to your personal identities, on a balance of probabilities.\n[24] First, in relation to countries of reference, I would like to make a comment on Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates at this time.\n[25] So, first I do want to acknowledge that I did assess those two countries in terms of the length of your residency in both of those countries. I note that the index of National Documentation Package for Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, the versions are March 2019, are before the panel at Exhibits 10 and 11.\n[26] So, first in relation to \u2026 excuse me \u2026 the United Arab Emirates, I\u2019m looking at Item 3.1 from that National Documentation Package and it\u2019s indexed as ARE 103173.E. It indicates very clearly that the United Arab Emirates does not have a system to grant permanent residency rights such as a \u201cgreen card\u201d in the United States.\n[27] It indicates that an article published by Reuters in the Cairo-based Mist News corroborate that UAE does not have a permanent residency status for foreigners.\nIt states;\nAccording to the UAE Visa Officer, foreigners can reside in the UAE either on a work permit or residency permit. A work permit is granted to an applicant who has an employment contract with an employer, the residency permit allows dependents of such a worker to reside in the UAE. The Visa Officer stated that these permits are usually valid for two to three years depending on the type of job and are renewable provided the worker continues to be employed. Rights of residency are lost if a person is away from the UAE for more than six months, although he or she can reapply. The Visa Officer stated that birth in the United Arab Emirates does not entitle a child to permanent residency. If the child\u2019s father is a UAE citizen then the child would also become a UAE citizen. If the child\u2019s father is a foreigner, the child would require a UAE \u2026 a residency permit.\n[28] Based on this objective documentary evidence, sir and Madam, I find that it is clearly established that you and the children, who were not born in the UAE, would not be entitled to any residency rights.\n[29] I further find that your child XXXX who was born in the UAE is not entitled to citizenship rights, and the UAE is not a country of reference to him based on birth there. Given that you no longer have a work contract there, you have no rights to residency there. I see no perspective status for him in the future in that country.\n[30] Also, further in regard to the UAE and also Saudi Arabia, I note that Item 3.5 from NDP for Saudi Arabia which is also indexed as Item 3.2 in the UAE NDP, this is Item Number ZZZ 104924.E dated August 13th of 2014, it speaks to the situation in Saudi Arabia and the employment visa system there which is very similar in nature and effect as that in the United Arab Emirates.\n[31] I note that Item 3.1 SAU 105183.7 which is dated May 19th of 2015, speaks to those born in Saudi Arabia who are the children of noncitizens of Saudi Arabia. It goes on to describe the rights to education, that there are no rights to education after the age of 18; that the rights are not the same as those of a citizen. Non citizens are not allowed entry into the country after the lapse of the re-entry period visa.\n[32] There is reference to children being permitted to return on a visa, however, it does state that an officer can deny the re-entry for children born in Saudi \u2026 born in Saudi who are born to non-citizens of that country. It further states that there is no codified rule of law in the country with respect to visa issuance on re-entry and that it depends on the parent\u2019s political activities abroad.\n[33] Accordingly, I find that there is no clear right to residence nor citizenship rights for XXXX in Saudi Arabia and therefore for both of those children who were born in Saudi Arabia and UAE respectively, I find that the country of reference is Egypt only.\n[34] In terms of the anti-government political identity, sir, for yourself and your spouse and the credibility of your allegations, I saw no material inconsistencies or contradictions in your evidence. You were able to describe, sir, in your oral evidence today that as a political science student from university who has lived outside of Egypt for a number of years and then returned back in XXXX 2018, that you were taken aback by the situation in your country and that you felt compelled to speak out because you worried as a father about the future for your children in Egypt if \u2026 if you had to live there on an ongoing basis.\n[35] I note, sir, that your statements are consistent with the documentary evidence that you\u2019ve put forward, specifically, in Exhibit 12 the tweets that you spoke about and provided here today, and also they are consistent with the documents that you provided in Exhibit 5 from relatives back home and correspondence with him regarding the situation there.\n[36] I find, sir, that you have established, and, Madam, you that you\u2019ve established your anti\u00ad government political activities, that you have been active on social media, on Facebook and Twitter. had the opportunity to look at the Facebook account that you have, sir, and I find that the evidence corroborates your statements. I find that you\u2019ve established your evidence, on a balance, in this regard and in a credible fashion.\n[37] In terms of your re-availment back to Egypt on several occasions, I note that you testified very clearly today that you became afraid to live in Egypt in September of 2018, while you were in the United States.\n[38] I have no reason to doubt this testimony, sir, therefore I accepted as true, on a balance, and find therefore that your past returns to Egypt are not indicative of a lack of subject fear, as you did not feel at risk at that time. There was no imminent danger that you were facing. Therefore, I find your actions in that respect to be credible and that they do not detract from your subject fear.\n[39] With respect to your failure to claim in United States, I asked you questions about this today, sir, and you explained that you spent a month in the United States between XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX of 2018, and that you have listened to news reports about the US government\u2019s interactions with the Egyptian government, and your perception of the situation is that the relationship between the Trump administration and the Egyptian authorities is a positive one, and that you don\u2019t feel comfortable with it.\n[40] You also described today, sir, in your statements that you felt that there was an anti-Muslim sentiment in the United States. You described incidents of mistreatment of the Muslim population, and you stated that you felt that the current political feeling is such that you would not be accepted in the United States and that you would be deported, and you were afraid for this, and as a result you started to explore means by which you could enter into Canada, and went online and found a way to come in, and you made your claim upon entry.\n[41] I asked you very \u2026 very clearly to describe for me or to state for me whether or not you decided that it was better to take the risk of crossing into Canada illegally or filing a claim in the United States, and you stated that, from your perspective, you believed that taking the chance and coming to Canada was a better one.\n[42] I find that there\u2019s insufficient reason for me to doubt the sincerity of your statements, sir. I take that you were approaching the situation from your own understanding and your own perception of the situation.\n[43] I note as well that you do have extended family in Canada, and that you were determined to come and reside with them in Windsor.\n[44] You \u2026 one does take a serious risk in entering illegally because that too can lead to results that are negative ones. However, I don\u2019t find that there is sufficient reason for me to find, from your actions with your understanding, your perception, that your actions were indicative of a lack of subjective fear.\n[45] I don\u2019t find that they are indicative of a lack of subject fear. I find, rather, that with your understanding in your personal circumstances that you acted in a reasonable fashion.\n[46] In \u2026 with regards to the well-foundedness of your fear, I note, sir, that in the documentary evidence before me at Item at Exhibit 3, the index of National Documentation Package for Egypt, the version is September 30th of 2019, that there are a number of items. For example, Item 2.1 the US Department of State report for Egypt 2018, Item 4.2 the Civic Freedom Monitor for Egypt which is dated 17th of July 2019. Also, Item 4.5 which is indexed as EGY 105804.E June 12th of 2017 which speaks to the treatment of members of the Muslim Brotherhood, including suspected members of the Muslim Brotherhood.\n[47] All of these documents, sir, speak to a crackdown on freedom of expression. There\u2019s also a crackdown by the government on those who are perceived to be supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood. In particular, for example, at Item 2.1 there are a number of human rights issues that are highlighted. One of which is restriction on political participation and freedom of expression, including on the Internet.\n[48] Under the section on freedom of expression it states that;\nCitizens express their views on a wide range of political and social topics. Nonetheless, the government investigated and prosecuted critics for alleged incitement of violence, insults to religion, insults to public figures and institutions such as the judiciary and the military, or violation of public morals. Individuals also faced societal and official harassment for speech views as sympathetic to the Muslim Brotherhood, such as using a hand gesture showing four fingers, a reference to the 2013 security operation to disburse the sit-in at Rabaa al-Adawiya Square.\nThe law provides for a broad definition of terrorism to include any act harming national unity or social peace. The president stated that lying is a form of terrorism. Human rights observers expressed concern that authorities could use the ambiguous definition to stifle nonviolent speech and nonviolent opposition activity.\n[49] On May 11th, authorities arrested XXXX XXXX on charges of abusing a means of communication and publishing a video containing false news after she uploaded a video to her personal Facebook account in which she described her experiences with sexual harassment in the country.\n[50] It also then goes to talk about press and media freedom.\n[51] I find, after reviewing the objective documentary evidence in addition to some of the articles that have been put forward by counsel such as in Exhibit 6, the article from the Washington Post entitled Egypt Jails American Traveller saying she criticized the government on Facebook which is dated August 8th.\n[52] The \u2026 there is a great deal of documentation before me which corroborates your fears and provides an objective well-foundedness to the fear that you are experiencing. I therefore find, on a balance, that you have established the well-foundedness of your fear.\n[53] With respect to State protection and an internal flight alternative, given that it is the authorities themselves you fear who would be the agents of persecution and given the documentary evidence that I\u2019ve just cited, I find that you have rebutted the presumption of State protection and demonstrated that operationally adequate State protection would not be forthcoming to you in your circumstances, as it is the State themselves who are the persecutors.\n[54] In terms of an internal flight alternative, as it is again the State themselves who are the agents of persecution, there would no \u2026 there would not be a reasonable alternative location for you to live in safely as the same risk would be present for you throughout the country. Therefore, I find that the availability of a viable internal flight alternative is not present and would fail on the first prong of the test.\n[55] In conclusion I determine that the five of you XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXand XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXare all Convention refugees. I determine that for the adult claimants. For you it is your anti-government political opinion and for those minor claimants their membership in a particular social group.\n[56] You have met the requirements of Section 96 of the IRPA. I therefore accept your claims.\n[57] Now, in relation to the final claimant XXXX XXXX XXXX, the file number for her is TBS- 25488, I note that from the documentary evidence in Exhibit 1 the copy of her passport that is before me that she is a US citizen. Therefore, her personal identity is established, on a balance of probabilities, based on her passport.\n[58] At the outset of the hearing, sir, I did ask your counsel whether there were any allegations being put forward with respect to the United States or any submissions that he had to offer. He clearly stated that there are not. When I asked you, sir, you did point to your fear that if you were in the United States with your minor daughter XXXX, that you could potentially be separated as you had heard had occurred with migrants who were coming from Mexico.\n[59] I \u2026 I note that this is a fear that you carry, sir, but for her independently I find that you have not put forward any allegations of risk that would meet the requirements of either Section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act or Section 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[60] I find that the United States is a country that has a State protection mechanism that is functioning. It is a democratic country, and overall, sir, I find that there are no grounds for the granting of refugee protection under either Section 96 or 97(1).\n[61] Accordingly, I find that for her as a citizen of the United States that she has not made out a claim on either of those grounds. Accordingly, I therefore do refuse her petition for refugee status and find that she is not a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection, and those are my reasons for her.\n[62] Thank you both. Thank you, counsel, and, Mr. Interpreter.\n[63] COUNSEL: Thank you, Madam.\n[64] MEMBER: Thank you. We\u2019re concluded.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n",

Ruthven\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Amro Hayek\nCountry: Egypt\nRPD Number: TB8-18214\nAssociated RPD Number(s): TB8-18276, TB8-18298, TB8-18299, TB8-18300\nATIP Number: A-2020-00518\nATIP Pages: 000638-000648\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] These reasons and decision are in regards to the claims for protection made by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (principal claimant), XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (elder female claimant), XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (younger female claimant), XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (elder minor claimant), and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (younger minor claimant).\n[2] Each is claiming protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.1 The panel heard the claims jointly, pursuant to Refugee Protection Division Rule 55.2\n[3] The principal claimant was the designated representative for the two minor claimants.\nALLEGATIONS\n[4] All five claimant are against Egypt. The principal claimant\u2019s full allegations are set out in his Basis of Claim Form and its related narrative,3 including its addendum.4 The two adult female claimants and the two minor claimants each rely on the narrative of the principal claimant.\n[5] The nephew of the principal claimant, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX was arrested by the security forces of Egypt on December 14, 2015. On September 6, 2016, the principal claimant\u2019s nephew was subsequently convicted of an affiliation with a terrorist organization, and was sentenced to five years imprisonment.\n[6] On May 15, 2017, the principal claimant and his sister, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, visited prisoner XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in Assiut province. The principal claimant and his sister travelled on a lengthy train trip from Cairo to Assiut province. The principal claimant was waiting in the visitor\u2019s hall of the prison, when a security officer directed him and other selected men to an interrogation room. These segregated men complied with requests to answer enhanced security questions, but the principal claimant began to challenge the nature of the questions, in the context of the men being simply visitors to the prison.\n[7] The other male visitors were dismissed from the segregated room, but the principal claimant was asked by the security officer about his associations with ISIS (full name variations include Islamic State of Iraq and ash-Sham,5 and Islamic State in Iraq and Syria).6 The principal claimant was also asked about his personal knowledge of opposition leaders, as well as the reasons that he recently visited Turkey. After these additional questions were answered, the security officer threatened the claimant by telling him that they would not leave him alone.\n[8] On July 18, 2017, the principal claimant was arrested by security forces, outside his workplace. He was isolated in a dark room for five days, and he was physically assaulted and psychologically traumatized. During this detention, the principal claimant was accused of being a member of banned political organizations. Eight days after his release from his first period of detention, the principal claimant was told that he was terminated from his employment, but that his employer would allow him to finish some company projects from home.\n[9] The principal claimant was detained by security forces on a second occasion, between January 23, 2018 and January 26, 2018. The interrogation topics centred around the places that the principal claimant attended in the week prior to his arrest. The principal claimant was arrested for a third time on May 13, 2018. He was interrogated for three days, before being released a far distance away, two hours from his residence by car.\n[10] The claimants departed Egypt on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018, and entered Canada on the same date. After his departure, the principal claimant was told by an acquaintance that he was wanted for arrest again, related to national security surrounding the annual anniversary celebrations of the June 30th Revolution.\n[11] The claimants made their claims for protection the following month. An arrest warrant was subsequently issued for the principal claimant on September 26, 2018.\nDETERMINATION\n[12] The panel finds that the principal claimant is a Convention refugee, pursuant to section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, based on his imputed anti-government political opinion.\n[13] In addition, the panel finds that the elder female claimant, the younger female claimant, and both minor claimants are each Convention refugees, pursuant to section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, based on their membership in a particular social group, namely as family members of the principal claimant (who faces a serious possibility of persecution in Egypt).\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[14] The panel finds that all five claimants have established their identity as nationals of Egypt, based on a balance of probabilities. All five claimants presented their valid Arab Republic of Egypt passports.7 The panel finds no reason to doubt the authenticity of any of these five documents.\nCredibility\n[15] The panel finds that all three adult claimants testified in a straightforward and consistent manner, without the use of embellishments or contradictions.\n[16] The panel finds that the principal claimant was able to coherently describe in his testimony the events that took place on May 15, 2017, at the prison in Assiut province. In regards to a forward-looking assessment of risk for the principal claimant, the panel considered the combination of this May 15, 2017 prison visit (to see a family member convicted of terrorism association eight months prior), in conjunction with the overt engagement of the principal claimant with the authorities on the same date, all in the presence of unrelated prison visitors.\n[17] The panel also finds that the principal claimant was able to clearly articulate his physical and psychological treatment during the three subsequent detentions by security forces in Egypt, between the period of July 18, 2017 and May 16, 2018. These details added to the probative value of the principal claimant\u2019s testimony.\nSubjective Fear Considerations\n[18] The panel considered the time period that elapsed between the release of the principal claimant on January 26, 2018 (after his second arrest) and XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018 (the departure date of the claimants from Egypt). The panel elicited testimony from the principal claimant regarding this period of four months, which immediately followed his second period of detention. The principal claimant testified that his second arrest was one of many arrests in the country at the time, and that he did not tell his family about his problems when he relocated to the residence of his mother-in-law for Ramadan observance.\n[19] In consideration of the totality of the circumstances facing the principal claimant, the panel accepts the explanations provided within his testimony regarding the time he spent in Egypt before his departure from his country of citizenship. As such, the panel does not draw a negative credibility inference related to the actions of the principal claimant during this period of time.\nCorroborating Documents\n[20] In support of all five claims, the claimants presented the National Security officer\u2019s December 14, 2015 summary,8 the September 6, 2016 criminal court documents (related to the conviction of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX),9 and the September 26, 2018 Cairn Security Directorate arrest warrant for the principal claimant.10 In addition to these documents sourced to the authorities of Egypt, the claimants also presented a December 6, 2019 letter of support which was signed by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.11\n[21] Based on the above considerations, that panel finds that the evidence sourced to the authorities of Egypt pointed to the security apparatus having interest in the principal claimant, and by extension the two female claimants and the two minor claimants, based on their close family association with the principal claimant (his wife, his adult daughter, and his minor sons).\n[22] The objective country condition evidence supports that the security forces of Egypt would be interested in the family members of the principal claimant, as their treatment of the principal claimant himself (during his three detentions) indicate that the security forces perceive the principal claimant to be active in at least one of the banned political organizations in Egypt, or a government critic, or both.\nObjective Basis of the Claims\n[23] The overall objective evidence supports the respective claims for Convention refugee protection which were put forth by the principal claimant, the elder female claimant, the younger female claimant, and the two minor claimants, based on the imputed anti-government political opinion of the principal claimant.\nTreatment of Those Who Are Perceived to be Political Opposition\n[24] Amnesty International reports that there is a pattern of abuse by state agents in Egypt that became particularly evident since March 2015. The abuse includes arbitrary arrests, arbitrary detention, and enforced disappearances. The victims were mostly males, ranging in age from fourteen-year-old boys to adult men in their fifties, and included students, academics and other activists, peaceful critics and protesters, and family members of government critics.12\n[25] The panel considered this country condition evidence in the context of the principal claimant being a perceived government critic, especially due to the events in Assiut province on May 15, 2017.\n[26] The passing of the Protest Law in November 2013 has severely restricted the ability of citizens to protest peacefully against the state. The Protest Law was introduced amid a tense political environment characterised by recurrent protests.13 Serious political opposition is virtually nonexistent, as both liberal and Islamist activists face criminal prosecution and imprisonment.14\n[27] There were reports of physical assaults on members of political opposition movements.15 The government of Egypt makes it nearly impossible for the opposition to gain power through elections. In practice, there are no political parties that offer meaningful opposition to the ruling party. Arrests, harsh prison terms, death sentences, extrajudicial violence, and various forms of pressure targeting activists, parties, and political movements that criticize the government were common.16\n[28] The panel notes that peaceful demonstrators and bystanders may be subject to questioning, detention, arrest, and conviction for participating in or being in proximity to unauthorized demonstrations in the two largest cities of Egypt, Cairo and Alexandria.17\n[29] The panel finds that, on a balance of probabilities, the actions of the principal claimant in Egypt have drawn the attention of the authorities. Since the country condition evidence also establishes that family members of those perceived to be anti-government are also targeted in Egypt, the panel finds that the principal claimant, the elder female claimant, the younger female claimant, and the two minor claimants have each established a well-founded fear of returning to Egypt.\nState Protection\n[30] All five claimants fear the authorities and security apparatus of Egypt.\nRisk of Harm from the Authorities\n[31] The National Security Agency continued to operate with near-absolute impunity. Security forces in Egypt have escalated a campaign of intimidation, violence, and arrests against political opponents, civil society activists, and many others who have simply voiced mild criticism of the government.18\n[32] Protesters have been subjected to various kinds of state-sponsored violence in Egypt, including long provisional detention.19\n[33] The Interior Ministry\u2019s regular police and its National Security Agency have used widespread arbitrary arrests, enforced disappearances, and torture against perceived dissidents. Former detainees in Egypt indicated that their arrests typically took place with a dawn raid on their home, or a targeted arrest from the street near a place they were known to frequent, such as their home, university, or place of work. In none of the documented cases did police or National Security officers show suspects a warrant, or tell them why they were being arrested. In some cases, they arrested family members at the same time. Three former detainees told Human Rights Watch that security officers threatened to torture their family members if they did not confess.20\n[34] Based on this evidence of arbitrary arrest of family members, as well as multiple threats made towards family members of detainees, the panel finds it unreasonable to expect any of the three adult claimants or the two minor claimants to seek redress or protection from the police or from any other authorities in Egypt. The panel finds that adequate state protection would not be forthcoming for any of the five claimants, in their respective particular set of circumstances.\n[35] For clarification, the panel finds that the authorities would on a balance of probabilities, be the primary agents of persecution for the principal claimant, and by extension the two female claimants, and the two minor claimants. The panel finds that the documentary evidence is both clear and convincing, and that it rebuts the presumption of adequate state protection for all five claimants in Egypt.\nInternal Flight Alternatives\n[36] The state, and its National Security Agency, have national reach.\n[37] As a result of the above-referenced country condition documentation from the National Documentation Package, the panel finds that a viable internal flight alternative does not exist for the five claimants in any place in Egypt, as the state and its National Security Agency are their agents of persecution.\n[38] The panel finds that the five claimants each have a well-founded fear of persecution throughout Egypt, and that there is no viable internal flight alternative for any of them.\nCONCLUSION\n[39] The panel finds that there is a serious possibility that the principal claimant, the two female claimants, and the two minor claimants each face persecution in Egypt. The panel concludes that they are each Convention refugees, pursuant to section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[40] The panel therefore accepts all five claims.\n(signed) C.

Hart\nCountry: Egypt\nRPD Number: TB8-02758\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2020-00518\nATIP Pages: 000384-000390\nREASONS FOR DECISION\nINTRODUCTION\n[1] These are the reasons for the decision in the claim of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (AKA XXXX XXXX), who claims to be a citizen of Egypt, and is claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).1\n[2] The Minister\u2019s representative from Canada Border Service Agency (the Minister) intervened by way of documents only for the purpose of credibility and program integrity. I carefully considered the Minister\u2019s written submissions in rendering my decision. I must clarify one point however, in her submissions, the Minister claimed that \u201c[t]he claimant declared that the entire content of the Basis of Claim (BOC) and attached documents were interpreted to him and that the information he provided was complete true and correct.\u201d2 and in fact he did not make such a declaration. The claimant is fluent in English and in his BOC declared that he is able to read English, and that he fully understood the entire content of the form and all attached documents. The BOC was never interpreted to him.\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] The claimant\u2019s allegations are described in detail in his BOC.3 They can be summarized as follows.\n[4] In June 2010, when Mubarak was still the president of Egypt, Khaled Said was brutally killed in police custody sparking outrage in the country and prompting the \u201cWe are all Khaled Said\u201d movement. At this point the claimant joined Kefaya (the Egyptian Movement for Change). Kefaya began speaking out against corruption of the police and the passing of the presidency to the son of Mubarak.\n[5] Kefaya and others called for a peaceful protest on January 25, 2011. By the end of the day thousands of people had joined the protest, and for the next eighteen days the protesters demanded that Mubarak leave. On January 28, 2011, classified as \u201cBlack Friday\u201d by the media, the police moved in on the protesters and many protesters were killed as the police were using rubber bullets and normal bullets to quell the crowds. The claimant\u2019s friend was killed and another friend lost both eyes from rubber bullets. The claimant was hurt from the pushing and pulling of the protesters. Mubarak stood aside as president and the army took control of the country.\n[6] In 2012, a democratic election was held and Morsi for whom the claimant voted, came to power as president.\n[7] From September 2012 until May 2016, the claimant did gXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX He returned to Egypt in XXXX 2016 to commence work. While he was in Canada, Morsi was deposed and Abdel Fattah El Sisi came to power with the backing and support of the military. He brutally repressed any dissent against him, jailing thousands of people he saw as opponents.\n[8] On returning to Egypt the claimant met with Kefaya friends and they discussed the disappearance of their friends.\n[9] On January 25, 2017, the claimant was arrested at a celebration on Kasr Al Nile Bridge where there was a celebration of the sixth anniversary of the 2011 revolution. He was detained for forty-two days during which he was interrogated and tortured. He was accused of being involved in illegal activities and told never to get involved in these things again. He was accused of being Sufi and told that it would be held against him. He was never charged.\n[10] On June 21, 2017, the claimant was once again arrested. He was taken to the Heliopolis Psychiatric hospital where he was confined for fifty days. He was drugged and subjected to electric waves to his brain. On his release he was told that he was better and therefore could leave.\n[11] He applied for a Temporary Resident Visa for Canada in August 2017, arrived in Canada on XXXX XXXX XXXX2017, and made his refugee claim in February, 2018.\nDETERMINATION\n[12] I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee as he has established a serious possibility of persecution should he return to Egypt based on the grounds in section 96 of the IRPA.4\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[13] I find that the claimant\u2019s identity as a national of Egypt is established by the documents provided including his National Identity Card and a certified true copy of his Egyptian passport.5\nNexus\n[14] I find that he has established a nexus to section 96 of the IRPA by reason of political opinion, real and perceived.6\nCredibility\n[15] I find the claimant to be a credible witness and therefore, I believe what he has alleged in support of his claim. He testified in a straightforward manner and, there were no relevant inconsistencies in his testimony, or contradictions between his testimony and the other evidence before me which have not been satisfactorily explained. The claimant submitted a letter from his mother that corroborates his detention in prison for forty-two days and his detention in the Heliopolis Psychiatric hospital for fifty days, as well as a letter from his friend in Egypt confirming the claimant\u2019s active membership in Kefaya.7 I have no reason to discount these documents.\n[16] The claimant also submitted country condition documents similar to reports found in the National Documentation Package (NDP) for Egypt.8\n[17] The Minister expressed concern that the claimant at his refugee intake interview, declared that he had never been refused a visa to Canada or any other country, whereas the Biometrics from the United States (U.S.) reported that the claimant actually applied for two non-immigrant visas for the U.S. and was refused in 2013 and 2014. At the hearing the claimant explained that he had completely forgotten about the applications, and that at the time he was a student at XXXX XXXX and wanted to visit the U.S., but was refused visas because of his lack of finances. In my view, this is a reasonable explanation for his failure to declare the visa applications. In any event, I do not find that this impugns the claimant\u2019s overall credibility.\n[18] The Minister indicates that the claimant had been in Canada for a lengthy period and was aware of the chaos that was occurring in his country, but yet chose to go back to Egypt in XXXX 2016. The Minister contends that he re-availed himself to his country knowing that his friends had been in danger and he too could be part of the arrests. According to the claimant he left Canada when he did, because his job placement had ended and his visa was about to expire. He added that up to that point intime, he had never been harassed by the Egyptian authorities due to his anti\u00adregime sentiments so he had no subjective fear of returning to Egypt to start work. I find this explanation reasonable. In my view the claimant did not, under these circumstance, re-avail.\n[19] The Minister points out that the claimant applied for and received a Temporary Resident Visa for Canada in August 2017, and that he only came to Canada in XXXX 2017, and subsequently made a refugee claim in Canada in February 2018. \u201cThe Minister contends that his delay in leaving Egypt and a delay in making his refugee claim in Canada show that there are many questions to his credibility and veracity of his claim.\u201d9 The claimant explained that his delay in leaving Egypt was directly related to his need to raise fonds for his flight to Canada and to support himself in Canada. He did this by selling his inheritance, a piece of land given to him by his father. This, he explained, took time and was the primary factor for his delay in leaving Egypt. As for his delay in Canada in making his refugee claim, I would note that the claimant came to Canada on a valid Temporary Resident visa, and given the visa, there was little risk that the claimant would have been removed to Egypt, by the Canadian authorities at any point prior to making his claim in February 2018. Given these circumstances, I do not draw a negative inference from the delay in making his claim\nObjective basis of future risk\n[20] In consideration of the entirety of the evidence including the claimant\u2019s personal profile and his particular situation, I accept that the claimant will be perceived as a political opponent upon return to Egypt. As such, and based on the documentary evidence set out below, I find that the claimant has established a future risk that he will be subjected to arbitrary arrest and detention, beating, torture, and enforced disappearance at the hands of the government or its agents if he were to return to Egypt.\n[21] The fact that he faces this risk is corroborated by the NDP for Egypt (version September 30, 2019). According to this objective evidence, the Egyptian authorities are known for their repression of freedom of expression and association, notably repression of those who are considered political opponents. There are numerous reports regarding political opponents that indicate the members of the Egyptian military have committed acts which amount to human rights violations including arbitrary arrest and detention, torture, enforced disappearances, and extrajudicial killing.10\nNature of the harm\n[22] This harm, in my view, clearly amounts to persecution.\nState protection\n[23] As the agent of persecution is the Egyptian governmental authorities, I find it would be objectively unreasonable for the claimant to seek protection from the Egyptian government in light of the claimant\u2019s particular circumstances.\nInternal flight alternative\n[24] I have considered whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for the claimant. On the evidence before me, I find that there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout Egypt given the objective evidence that the Egyptian authorities operate similarly throughout the country. Therefore, viable internal flight alternatives are not available to this claimant.\nCONCLUSION\n[25] Based on the analysis above, I conclude that the claimant is a Convention refugee. Accordingly, I accept his claim.\n(signed) KEITH BRENNENSTUHL\nJanuary 23, 2020\n1 The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c.27, as amended, sections 96 and 97(1).\n2 Exhibit 5, Notice of Intent to Intervene.\n3 Exhibit 2, Basis of Claim (BOC) form.\n4 IRPA, supra, footnote 1, section 96.\n5 Exhibit 4, Claimant disclosure documents, pp. 1-4; Exhibit 1, Package of information from the referring CBSA\/CIC.\n6 IRPA, supra, footnote 1, section 96.\n7 Exhibit 4, Claimant disclosure documents.\n8 Exhibit 3, National Documentation Package (NDP) for Egypt (September 30, 2019).\n9 Exhibit 5, Notice of Intent to Intervene.\n10 Exhibit 3, NDP for Egypt (September 30, 2019), items 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.6.\n\n",

The minor claimants all relied on the Basis of Claim (BOC) narrative of the principal claimant. The principal claimant was appointed as the Designated Representative for his two children, according to subsection 167(2) of the IRPA.\nMINISTER\u2019S INTERVENTION\n[3] In a letter dated April 9, 2018 the Minister notes pursuant to paragraph 170(e) of the IRPA, and according to section 29 of the RPD Rules, the Minister informed the Refugee Protection Division that he wishes to intervene in this claim by making observations and submitting evidence.3\n[4] In his evidence he states that the principal claimant submitted a Canada Visitor\u2019s Visa (CVV) application that was received on June 28, 2017. This application was approved and a multiple entry visa was issued on July 16, 2017. His spouse and the three children\u2019s application were received on August 14, 2017 and they were approved for multiple entry visitor\u2019s visa issued on October 19, 2017. The claimants entered Canada On XXXX XXXX, 2017.4\n[5] Minister also submitted documents (Exhibits M-3 to M-5) regarding finger print analysis, biometric information, confirmation that the principal claimant was finger printed on March 21, 2017 in Dar Es Salaam, and a United States (US) multiple entry visa issued on March 22, 2017. The Minister\u2019s information provided similar information for the female claimant. Exhibit M-4 has the biometric information for the female claimant, XXXX XXXX, confirmation that she was finger printed on June 20, 2017 in Dar Es Salaam, and issued a multiple entry visa on June 21, 2017, and in Exhibit M-5 there is the finger print comparison for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX which was done on July 31, 2017.\nMinister\u2019s Submissions\n[6] The Minister submits the principal claimant was in possession of a US visa in March 2017, but made no effort to enter the US and initiate a claim for refugee protection, despite the fact that he has shown a past willingness to separate from his family temporarily in order to flee persecution. His wife submitted her US visa application in June 2017 and his daughter submitted the US visa application in July 2017. The principal claimant\u2019s Canadian visitor\u2019s visa (CVV) was issued ahead of the rest of the family.\n[7] The Minister submits that the claimants appear to have selected Canada specifically and have not behaved in a manner that those fearing persecution would. They have also shown a lack of urgency in initiating a claim for protection since they initially fled from Egypt, and the principal claimant has shown a lack of urgency in using the US and Canada visa\u2019s that were at his disposal.\n[8] For these reasons the Minister concludes that the claimants are not Convention refugees or persons in need of protection.\nCounsel\u2019s reply to Minister\u2019s submission\n[9] Counsel submits that as per the claimant\u2019s testimony, the claimant had applied for a US visa for business purposes. At the time of the application for this visa, he had no problem in Tanzania. His wife later decided to join him, and celebrate their wedding anniversary in the US. The children\u2019s visa was rejected and she had planned to leave the children with the grandparents. However, while in Tanzania, they heard that the female claimant\u2019s brother and the claimant\u2019s friend had been arrested. In addition, the children had problems in Egypt from the perpetrator and they stopped going to school. The family joined the principal claimant in Tanzania as it was not safe for them to live in Egypt. When the children\u2019s visa to the US was rejected, and the claimant\u2019s continued stay in Tanzania became difficult, they decided to leave Tanzania for a safe haven. However, since the children were minors at that time, they had to find a place where all of them could go. Their visa\u2019s to Canada was approved and so they travelled to Canada.\n[10] Although the claimant had a CVV earlier, the female claimant received hers in October 2017. The principal claimant had to wind down his business, conclude some urgent legal matters regarding his taxes and business, and departed from Tanzania in December.\n[11] Counsel submits that delay should not undermine subjective fear. She concludes that the claimants had valid reason for not seeking asylum in the US and a valid reason for not leaving earlier than XXXX 2017.\nPanel\u2019s response to Minister\u2019s intervention\n[12] The Minister submits that the claimants are not Convention refugees because the claimants appear to have selected Canada specifically and have not behaved in a manner that those fearing persecution would. In addition, they have also shown a lack of urgency in initiating a claim for protection since they initially fled Egypt and the principal claimant has shown lack of urgency in using the US and Canadian visa\u2019s that were at his disposal.\n[13] I questioned the claimant at length in regards to this matter. The principal claimant testified that he had applied for the US visa for business purposes only because at the time of his application he had no problem in Tanzania. Later, when his wife joined him in Tanzania she decided to join him on his trip to the US so they could celebrate their wedding anniversary together. The children\u2019s US visa applications were rejected. She had planned to send the children to Egypt for a short stay with her parents. They had also planned to visit Canada, and hence the application for a CVV.\n[14] During this time the principal claimant tried to get citizenship in Tanzania as he had established a successful business there. This application was rejected. The visit by the President of Egypt to Tanzania and the proposal for a treaty regarding the extradition of people who were opposed to the Egyptian government, was another problem for the claimants. The principal claimant testified that he would be unable to return to Egypt, and would also be unable to stay in Tanzania.\n[15] The family did not have a US visa for the children and they were too young to be left behind with relatives that were also potential targets. At the time the principal claimant travelled to Tanzania, the female claimant and children had stayed behind in Egypt. However, they were targeted and the female claimant resigned from her job and the children stayed back at home from school.\n[16] The peace and quite they enjoyed in Tanzania came to an end due to a political situation after the Egyptian President\u2019s visit. The reason for the Minister\u2019s intervention is that the claimant did not avail the US visa to leave Tanzania and delayed in leaving Tanzania for Canada.\n[17] Delay has been recognized by the Federal Court as an important factor in assessing a claimant\u2019s credibility and their subjective fear. It is reasonable to assume that persons with a well-founded fear of persecution will attempt to leave the country of persecution and seek refuge without unreasonable delay. The delay in this matter is not substantial. The principal claimant could not leave without his family. They were all potential targets. Even if the principal claimant had left earlier, the rest of his family could not stay in Tanzania for reasons explained above, and would not be able to return to Egypt. The family had their Canadian visa in October 2017.\n[18] The delay in leaving the country does not undermine the principal claimant\u2019s credibility and the allegation that he faces serious harm in Egypt if he and his family were to return.\n[19] I accept the credible testimony of the claimant for delay in leaving Tanzania, 2 months after his family got the visa, and for not travelling to the US to make a claim to be reasonable. This aspect of the claim will not impact on my decision regarding their fear of harm in Egypt.\nALLEGATIONS\n[20] In his Basis of Claim (BOC) Form,5 the principal claimant states that on March 22, 2014, when the army seized power and detained the elected President Mohammed Morsi, the claimant was arrested because of his affiliation with the Freedom and Justice Party. They raided his house, confiscated his cell phone, passport and other important documents. He was detained on October 6, in a detention centre for four days. After further investigation by the public prosecutor he was sentenced to nine months of incarceration from March 22, 2014 to December 14, 2014.\n[21] On his release from prison, the claimant went to live in another part of town. Although he continued to be fearful of the government, he started his business. The claimant did this because he wanted to live in his own country and be close to his parents. He avoided any encounter with the security forces and when his friend was arrested, and his old house was stormed and raided, he left Egypt on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2016. In his BOC he states that, \u201cthey keep chasing me to arrest me.\u201d6\n[22] The principal claimant went to Uganda and stayed there until XXXX XXXX XXXX 2016, after which he went to Tanzania and stayed there until XXXX XXXX, 2016. He then travelled from the transit city, Addis Ababa, and went to Nigeria where he lived until XXXX XXXX XXXX 2016. As life was very hard there, he returned to Tanzania on XXXX XXXX, 2016 and stayed there with his family until XXXX XXXX XXXX 2017. During his stay in Tanzania, he had established a business and travelled extensively to conduct his business.\n[23] While he was in Tanzania, his wife was followed to her school where she taught by strangers and the children became potential targets. It has to be noted that the female claimant was also active in the Freedom Justice Party which is the political wing of the Muslim Brotherhood party.\n[24] The principal claimant testified that he left Tanzania for several reasons such as he was unable to get passports for his children. The officials at the Egyptian Embassy refused to renew their passports and told them to go back to Egypt to do it. In addition, the President of Egypt had proposed an extradition treaty with Tanzania, which would allow Tanzania to return individuals to their country of origin, in this case Egypt, who have opposed the regime. The Egyptian parliament was also allowed to revoke the citizenship of those opposing the government and living abroad.\n[25] The female claimant had moved to a different residence when a security agent came to her school and tried to get the address of her home.\n[26] The principal claimant participated in political activities from his under graduate university days. He supported the Muslim Brotherhood and was also head of the cultural committee in the student union. He helped organise the demonstrations and had been arrested twice in 1995. In April 2011, the principal claimant and his wife joined the Freedom and Justice party and participated actively in the elections. When President Morsi was arrested, a year after being elected, the principal claimant joined the protest. He was arrested at his home and was imprisoned. Later on, December 14, 2014 he was found not guilty and released.\nDETERMINATION\n[27] I find the principal claimant to be a Convention refugee, and fears persecution by reason of political opinion and his wife, the female claimant, and the children to be Convention refugees by reason of their membership in a particular social group-family.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[28] The principal claimant\u2019s identity and his family\u2019s identities as nationals of Egypt is established by their testimony and the supporting documentation filed, which include certified true copies of their seized Egyptian passports.7\nCredibility\n[29] The claimants both testified and rendered a very credible testimony. There were no relevant inconsistencies in their testimony, or contradictions between their testimony and the other evidence before the panel. They testified in a very straightforward manner and gave direct, spontaneous answers. The principal claimant provided lots of details that gave credence and life to his story. At the same time, he never tried to embellish it. He was able to detail and corroborate through his oral testimonies the written story in his BOC. Considering all of the above, I believe what he has alleged in support of his claim.\n[30] In addition to their oral testimonies, they have also provided numerous exhibits; his employment, the verdict at the 6th October Court, photographs regarding the raid at the female claimant\u2019s apartment, and pictures of the protest.8\nOBJECTIVE BASIS\n[31] Claimant\u2019s allegations are also corroborated by the objective evidence. This document states that there is a widespread political repression in Egypt for opponents of the regime, and even more so for the Muslim Brotherhood and the members of its affiliated party: The Freedom and Justice Party. Indeed, according to tab 2.1 of the National Documentation Package (NDP), the Muslim Brotherhood, including the Freedom and Justice Party, are organizations deemed illegal. Furthermore, the Muslim Brotherhood is legally designated as a terrorist group by the Egyptian State.9\n[32] According to tab 4.5 of the NDP, since Morsi\u2019s destitution, Muslim Brotherhood members have been prosecuted on a large scale during collective trials, yielding hundreds of death sentences and approximately 40,000 people have been detained on political grounds. Most of them because of real or perceived affiliation with the Muslim Brotherhood. There are also violent assaults as well as forced disappearances, towards Muslim Brotherhood members.10\n[33] In the NDP it states:\n[t]he Guardian reports that on 23 September 2013, Egyptian authorities banned the Muslim Brotherhood and \u201ca court ordered the freezing of all assets and also banned its spin-off groups.\u201d Similarly, according to a document posted on the website of Egypt\u2019s State Information Service, \u201ca Cairn court for urgent matters banned all the activities of the Muslim Brotherhood and its affiliated bodies\u201d and \u201cordered freezing all the assets and funds of the group.\u201d A December 2013 Associated Press (AP) article reported that Egypt\u2019s government declared the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist group, thereby \u201ccriminalising all its activities, its financing and even membership to the group.\u201d Media sources further report that the Freedom and Justice Party, the Brotherhood\u2019s political wing, was dissolved by a court on 9 August 2014.11\n[34] The same document refers to the treatment of the Muslim Brotherhood Leaders.\nTreatment of Muslim Brotherhood Leaders\nFreedom House\u2019s Freedom in the World 2017 report states that \u201c[l]arge numbers of Muslim Brotherhood members and supporters, including nearly all of the organization\u2019s senior leadership and [Mohammed] Morsi himself, were arrested following the coup, and arrests continued through 2016.\u201d12\n[35] The document on Treatment of Muslim Brotherhood\u2019s Members and Suspected Members states there were mass trials and arrests. I quote the document here:\n3.1 Mass trials\nAl Jazeera reports that since the overthrow of Morsi, \u201chundreds of [Muslim Brotherhood] members and supporters have been put on trial and given harsh sentences in multiple cases. Rights advocates have repeatedly criticised the mass prosecutions, saying they lack guarantees for a fair trial.\u201d Middle East Eye, an \u201conline news organisation\u201d focused on the Middle East similarly indicates that \u201c[s]ince the army deposed Morsi \u2026 hundreds of [Morsi\u2019s] supporters have been sentenced to death.\u201d13\n3.3 Arrests\nA February 2017 Reuters article states that \u201c[h]uman rights groups estimate [that] about 40,000 people have been detained for political reasons\u201d since Morsi was deposed. Freedom House\u2019s Freedom in the World report for 2017 similarly indicates that civil society organizations \u201cestimate that as many as [40,000] people were being detained for political reasons as of 2016, most of them for real or suspected links to the Muslim Brotherhood.\u201d14\n[36] I am of the view that the findings of fact, as noted above, certainly indicate that the claimant, should he return to Egypt, would face a very real danger of persecution on account of his perceived support for the Muslim Brotherhood.\n[37] Moreover, the allegations made by the claimant are not inconsistent with the National Documentation Package. The U.S. Department of State Country Reports indicate that in Egypt:\n[h]uman rights issues included unlawful or arbitrary killings by the government or its agents and terrorist groups; forced disappearances; torture; arbitrary detention; harsh and life-threatening prison conditions; arbitrary arrest and detention; \u2026 [t]he government inconsistently punished or prosecuted officials who committed abuses\u2026 15\n[38] The Country Reports further points out that, \u201c[l]ocal rights organizations reported hundreds of incidents of torture throughout the year, including deaths resulting from torture.16\n[39] Considering all of the above, I believe that the claimant has been involved in protests in Egypt against the authorities. This has profiled him as an opponent of the Egyptian regime, and as a result, the claimant had undergone interrogation and threats regarding his political involvement. The claimant has been involved in political activities during his undergraduate days and this continued even after he completed his education. As such, he would be seen as a political opponent of the regime should he return to Egypt. And, considering the evidence above, his whole family, would face a serious possibility of persecution on those grounds.\nState protection\n[40] Considering the evidence mentioned above, and that the State is the agent of persecution in this case, there is clear and convincing evidence before me that the State is unable or unwilling to provide the claimant\u2019s with adequate protection.\nInternal flight alternative (IFA)\n[41] On the evidence before me and mentioned above, I find that there is a serious possibility of persecution for the claimants throughout Egypt. As such, there is viable interna! flight alternative.\nCONCLUSION\n[42] For the reasons cited above, I conclude that should the claimant return to Egypt, he would face more than a mere possibility of harm for a Convention reason. He is accordingly found to be a Convention refugee and his claim is accepted. I also conclude, based on the above analysis, that the female claimant and their three children are Convention refugees on the basis of their membership in a particular social group \u2013 family.\n(signed) VEDA RANGAN\nMarch 2, 2020\n1 The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C.2001, c.27, as amended, sections 96 and 97(1).\n2 Refugee Protection Division (RPD) Rules, SOR\/2012-256, Rule 55.\n3 Exhibit 5, Notice of Intent to Intervene.\n4 Ibid.\n5 Exhibit 2, Basis of Claim (BOC) Form.\n6 Ibid.\n7 Exhibit 1 and 9.\n8 Exhibit 9, Personal Documentation.\n9 Exhibit 3, National Documentation Package (NDP) for Egypt (September 30, 2019) item 2.1 at p. 31.\n10 Ibid., item 4.5 at pp. 12-13.\n11 Ibid., at p. 2.\n12 Ibid.\n13 Ibid., at p. 7.\n14 Ibid., at p. 12.\n15 Ibid., item 2.1, Executive Summary.\n16 Ibid., at p. 6.\n\n",

        "unofficial_text":"2020 RLLR 172\n\nCitation: 2020 RLLR 172\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: January 9, 2020\nPanel: Lesley Stalker\nCounsel for the Claimant(s):\nCountry: Pakistan\nRPD Number: VB9-03502\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2022-00978\nATIP Pages: 000168-000172\n\u2014 DECISION\n[1] PRESIDING MEMBER: This is a Bench decision of the Immigration and Refugee Board in the refugee claim of XXXX XXXX XXXX, file number VB9-03502. XXXX XXXX XXXX is a citizen of Pakistan who is claiming refugee protection pursuant ss. 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[2] In rendering my decision, I have considered the Chairperson\u2019s guideline on proceedings before the Immigration and Refugee Board involving sexual orientation and gender identity and expression, more commonly known as the SOGI guidelines.\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] You detailed your allegations in your basis of claim form. You fear persecution in Pakistan at the hands of your father, civil society and state authorities given your sexual orientation as a bi-sexual man and your atheist beliefs.\nDETERMINATION\n[4] I find that you are Convention refugee as you have established as a serious possibility of persecution in Pakistan on account of your membership in a particular social group, namely bi-sexual men.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[5] I find that your identity as a national of Pakistan has been established by your testimony and by your passport, a certified true copy of which is on file.\nCredibility\n[6] I find you to be a credible witness and, therefore, believe what you alleged in support of your claim. You testified in a straightforward manner and were spontaneous and you did not appear to exaggerate or embellish your claim.\n[7] When asked why you identify as a bi-sexual man, you explained that you are attracted to both men and women. You explained that this creates some isolation even within the LGBTQ community as you are neither fully accepted by the heterosexual community nor by the gay community. You said that when you sought support at Winnipeg\u2019s Rainbow Resource Centre they questioned whether you might be confused about your sexuality.\n[8] You spoke movingly about your struggles to accept who you are and to love yourself. You are trying to overcome some of the early values that you learned about human sexuality and to come to terms with your family\u2019s rejection of you.\n[9] You filed a number of documents which corroborate your allegations, these documents which are found in Exhibit 4 include letters from friends and acquaintances who confirm that you had spoken to them about your struggles with your sexuality.\n[10] Some of these letters indicate that you identified yourself as bi-sexual as early as 2016 or 2017. Some comment about the prevalence of homophobic remarks or jokes in their circle of friends which they believe affected your ability to disclose your sexuality more openly. On writer describes walking in on you in a compromising situation.\n[11] You filed a letter from the University of XXXX Student Counselling Centre which states that you spoke about your sexuality during a session in 2015 and about your fear for your safety if you return to Pakistan.\n[12] A recent letter from the XXXX XXXX Clinic indicates that you received an initial consultation with the clinic relating to XXXX XXXX XXXXand XXXX XXXX. Amongst the issues discussed was your fear that your father would disown you because of your atheism and your bi-sexuality. The clinic says that they referred you to a XXXX health centre for lower cost XXXX.\n[13] When asked why you call yourself an atheist, you testify that you do not believe in God and that you believe that religion was created as a tool to help greedy people attain political power.\n[14] Based on your testimony and the corroborative evidence before me, I find that you are a bi-sexual man and that you are an atheist.\nNexus\n[15] I find that the persecution you fear in Pakistan has a connection to two Convention grounds. First, your fear is based on your membership in a particular social group, namely bi-sexual men. Secondly, you have a fear of harm because of your atheist views which has a nexus to the Convention ground of religion.\n[16] As such, I have analyzed your claim under s. 96 of the Act.\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution\n[17] I find that you have established a well-founded fear of persecution by reason of your sexual orientation for the following reasons:\n[18] You testified that your father is a fundamentalist Muslim. Your father is your only surviving close relative as your mother passed away when you were 10. Your relationship with your father has long been difficult due to your clashing views on religion and sexuality. You asked when \u2014 you said that when you asked your father if it was wrong for the prophet to marry a 13-year-old girl, he became abusive and threatened to kill himself and your stepmother because of your blasphemist views. Your father arranged for an Imam to tutor you in Islamic studies. The Imam would beat you with sticks and other objects. You testified that your father also beat you with a cricket bat when you were 14 because you received a \u201cXXXX\u201d in religious studies.\n[19] You became aware that you were attracted to men when you were a teenager. You remember experiencing feelings of remorse, shame and denial after a relatively innocuous encounter and you tried to pray the incident away.\n[20] When you came to Canada, you were allowed to be more open about your sexuality. You described your burgeoning awareness, and this was in your basis of claim form, that you were an atheist. Until you came to Canada, your experience of religion was an abusive manipulative tool. You learned that in Canada you could publicly say that you did not believe in God without repercussion.\n[21] When a Pakistani friend of yours came to Canada to study he informed your father that you were defying Islamic values. Your father told you that you had been brainwashed and accused you of being a cafer (phonetic) and on one occasion he gathered a group of neighbours and uncles who called you and collectively advised you to tum back to religion.\n[22] You say that your father has cut off your funding and has disowned you. You have been receiving hate messages from people in Pakistan by Facebook and text message. You have blocked the senders but the messages that you filed in evidence illustrate the level of hatred that you face in Pakistan.\n[23] The country condition documents on Pakistan provide an objective basis to your claim. The documents demonstrate that same-sex relationships are illegal and societal discrimination is severe and widespread.\n[24] The UK Home Office Report on sexual orientation and gender identity, which is found at Tab 1.13 states that:\nSection 377 of the Pakistan Penal Code does not explicitly refer to same-sex sexual activity but provides that \u201ccarnal intercourse against the order of nature\u201d, is punishable by a fine or imprisonment for a period of two years to life\n[25] An IRB response to information report on violence against sexual minorities, found at Tab 6.5 of the NDP, points to alarming rates of violence against members of the LGBTQ community. The violence is perpetrated by family members as well as members of civil society. Homosexuality is seen as a threat to the family stability and to its reputation as well as a threat to religious integrity.\n[26] UK Home Office report also highlights the extent of violence against members of the LGBTQ community and its activists. Groups \u2014 fundamentalist groups such as the Pakistani Taliban engage in threats, assaults, murders and beheadings of members of the LGBTQ community.\n[27] US Department of State report on Pakistan found at Tab 2.1 of the NDP states that:\nConsensual same-sex conduct is a criminal offence. The penalty is a fine from 2 years to life imprisonment. Lesbian, gay, bi-sexual male, transgender and intersect persons rarely reveal their sexual orientation or gender identity.\n[28] The DOS, D-O-S, report states that:\nViolence and discrimination continues against LGBTI persons and police generally refuse to take action.\n[29] Based on the objective evidence before me including the fact that same-sex relations are criminalized in Pakistan\u2019s penal code, I find that you could not live openly as a bi-sexual man and have same-sex relationships without encountering legal sanctions or discrimination that is persecutory in nature. I find that you have established an objectively well-founded fear of persecution by reason of your sexual identity.\nState Protection\n[30] I find that adequate state protection would not be reasonably forthcoming in this particular case given that same-sex sexual acts are prohibited in Pakistan it would be unreasonable to expect a person identifying as bi-sexual to seek protection from the authorities. As such, I find that you have rebutted the presumption of state protection.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[31] I have considered whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for you. The UK Home Office report at Tab 1.13 of the NDP states as follows:\nGiven that homophobic attitudes are prevalent throughout the country and state protection is generally not available, there is unlikely to be any place in Pakistan to which an LGBTI person could reasonably relocate without making fundamental changes to their behaviour.\n[32] Based on the totality of the evidence before me, I find that there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout Pakistan as the IFA fails on the first prong of the IFA test. I find that there is no viable internal flight alternative for you in Pakistan.\n[33] Given my finding with respect to your fear of persecution because of your sexuality, I have not considered whether you might also face a risk of persecution as an atheist.\nCONCLUSION\n[34] Based on the analysis above, I conclude that you are a Convention refugee and I accept your claim.\n\u2014 DECISION CONCLUDED\n\n",

Although his identity documentation reflects his birth as a female, his preferred pronouns will be used in this decision\nALLEGATIONS\n[4] The specifics of the claim are set out in the narrative of the Basis of Claim form.3\n[5] The claimant alleges that he is a transgender man who has been in a seven-year relationship with a woman named XXXX XXXX who still lives in Iran.\n[6] Although he is a transgender man, the claimant alleges he is perceived to be female in Iran. As such, his relationship with XXXX is perceived as a lesbian relationship and the claimant is therefore perceived by Iranian society and the state as a lesbian.\n[7] The claimant alleges that he faces a forward-looking risk of harm because he is perceived to be a lesbian.\nDECISION\n[8] I find that the claimant is a refugee, pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA, as there exists a serious possibility of persecution, should he return to Iran, on account of his membership in a particular social group, specifically as a transgender man who would be perceived as a lesbian in Iran.\nIdentity\n[9] I find that the claimant\u2019s identity as a national of Iran is established by the documents provided, namely his passport.4\nCredibility\n[10] Based on the documents in the file, I have noted no serious credibility issues. In particular, the evidence establishes the allegations as set out above on a balance of probabilities: that the claimant is a transgender man who would be perceived to a lesbian in Iran.\n[11] After reviewing the documents, I have no reason to doubt their authenticity.\n[12] Specific documentary evidence provided in Exhibit 4 \u2013 namely a) a letter of support from the claimant\u2019 s partner, b) letters of support from other members of the LGBT community in Iran, c) correspondence between the claimant and his partner, and d) photographs of the claimant and his partner5 \u2013 establish, on a balance of probabilities, the credibility of the claimant\u2019s risk profile. I find that these documents \u2013 to which I assign full weight \u2013 with the evidence adduced from the basis of claim narrative, is sufficient to establish on a balance of probabilities that the claimant is a transgender man who would be perceived as a lesbian in Iran.\nNature of the harm\n[13] I have examined this claim under section 96 of the IRPA, as I conclude that the risk the claimant faces constitutes persecution based on at least one of the grounds prescribed in the Refugee Convention, specifically his membership in a particular social group, specifically as a transgender man who would be perceived as a lesbian in Iran.\nObjective basis\n[14] Given that there are no serious credibility issues with respect to the claimant\u2019s central allegations, coupled with the documentary evidence set out below, I find that the claimant has established a prospective risk of being subjected to the following harm were he to return to Iran: that he would be subject to detention, imprisonment, or other judicial action for charges related to his perceived sexual orientation.\n[15] The allegation of risk is corroborated by the following document in the National Documentation Package (NDP).6\n[16] I have found that, on a balance of probabilities, the claimant would be perceived as a lesbian if he returned to Iran. As such, the objective basis of Iranian law regarding lesbian sexuality is essential to consider. Article 238 to 240 of the Iranian Penal Code are cited in NDP 6.2:\nArticle 238. Musaheqeh: Musaheqeh is defined as where a female person puts her sex organ on the sex organ of another person of the same sex.Article 239. The hadd punishment for musaheqeh shall be one hundred lashes.Article 240. Regarding the hadd punishment for musaheqeh, there is no difference between the active or passive parties or between Muslims and non-Muslims, or between a person that meets the conditions for ihsan and a person who does not, and also whether or not [the offender] has resorted to coercion.7[17] On this basis, I find that there is a serious possibility that the claimant would charged under these provisions of the Iranian Penal Code, if he were to return to Iran, continue his long\u00ad term relationship with XXXX, and live his life fully without recourse to repression or secrecy. Because these legal prescriptions constitute prosecution of the claimant\u2019s exercise of his natural rights and punish that exercise with corporal punishment, I find that they constitute persecution. As such, I find there is a serious possibility of persecution should the claimant be returned to Iran. Moreover, I therefore find that the claimant has established on a balance of probabilities a subjective fear of persecution in Iran due to their membership in a particular social group, namely as a transgender man who would be perceived as a lesbian in Iran.\nState Protection\n[18] Whereas the agent of persecution is the state, I find that adequate state protection would not be reasonably forthcoming in this particular case.\nInternal flight alternative\n[19] I have considered whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for the claimant. On the evidence before me and given that the agent of persecution is the state, and the state has effective control over the entire country, I find that there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout Iran.\nCONCLUSION\n[20] In light of the preceding, I conclude that the claimant is a Convention refugee, pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA. Accordingly, I accept this claim.\n(signed) Bjorn Einarson\nOctober 23, 2020\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n2 Instructions governing the streaming of less complex claims at the Refugee Protection Division, Dated January 29, 2019.\n3 Exhibit 2.\n4 Exhibit 1.\n5 Exhibit 4.\n6 Exhibit 3\n7 Exhibit 3, National Documentation Package, Iran, 31 March 2020, tab 6.2: Iran.

        "unofficial_text":"2020 RLLR 170\n\nCitation: 2020 RLLR 170\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: October 29, 2020\nPanel: Carol-Ann Gibbs\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): (no information)\nCountry: Iran\nRPD Number: TB9-30697\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2022-00978\nATIP Pages: 000131-000135\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] These are the reasons for the decision in the claim of XXXX XXXX (the claimant) who is a citizen of Iran and is seeking refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).1\n[2] Paragraph 170(f) of IRPA2 provides that the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) may allow a claim for refugee protection without a hearing, unless the Minister has notified the RPD of the Minister\u2019s intention to intervene within the time limit set out in the Refugee Protection Division Rules.3 Further, subsection 162(2) of IRPA4 directs each Division to deal with all proceedings before it as informally and quickly as the circumstances and the considerations of fairness and natural justice permit.\n[3] Having carefully considered the evidence in this case, the panel finds that it meets the criteria for file-review determination. This case has therefore been decided without a hearing, according to the Instructions governing the streaming of less complex claims at the Refugee Protection Division.5\nALLEGATIONS\n[4] Regarding the allegations, these are noted in the claimant\u2019s basis of claim form (BOC).6 The following is a summary. The claimant is a young man. He was born female but identifies as a male. He has suffered persecution in Iran due to his gender identity and cannot live openly in Iranian society. He fears harassment and harm from the people in his community in Iran and he knows that Iranian authorities will not provide adequate protection. The claimant came to Canada in XXXX 2019 and made a claim for protection in November 2019.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[5] Regarding identity, the claimant\u2019s identity as a citizen of Iran is established by his Iranian passport.7 The claimant\u2019s identity as transgender is established by his statements and photographs of himself as a child and teenager.8\nCredibility\n[6] Regarding credibility, the panel finds the claimant to be credible based on a review of the documents on file which are consistent.\n[7] The claimant\u2019s fear of returning to Iran due to his transgender identity is supported in the documentary evidence.\n\u201cThere is a strong societal taboo against homosexuality. International LGBTI (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex) NGOs report that many young gay men face harassment and abuse from family members, religious figures, school leaders, and community leaders. Authorities have reportedly expelled individuals from university for alleged same-sex relations. While official rhetoric against homosexual individuals and practices has reduced since the Ayatollah Khomeini era, high level officials (including Ayatollah Khamenei), have continued to issue derogatory statements about homosexuality. LGBTI individuals are unlikely to obtain protection from state officials, and may face harassment, abuse or arrest should they come to the attention of security forces. As noted in Military Objectors, men whose homosexuality or transgenderism has been established (through an intrusive medical examination) are exempted from military service and given the designation \u2018mentally ill\u2019 on their military cards, which can lead to later difficulties when seeking employment. Both gay men and lesbians face considerable societal pressure to enter into a heterosexual marriage and produce children. The government censors all materials related to LGBTI issues, including blocking websites or content within sites that discusses such issues. NGOs are unable to work openly on LGBTI issues\u2026 Iran has recognised transgender individuals since 1987, when Ayatollah Khomeini issued a fatwa declaring transsexuality to be in conformity with Islam. Authorities regard transsexuality as a disorder for which medical solutions are available, and permits hormone treatment and sexual reassignment surgery (SRS). The government provides financial assistance to undergo these treatments, and requires health insurers to cover the cost of SRS. Following a referral from a psychologist or psychiatrist, the Department of Forensic Psychiatry determines whether a person qualifies for such treatment. Only after SRS has been completed and their legal documents (including identity card, birth certificate and passport) adjusted is a person legally allowed to dress according to the opposite sex and to move into the spaces reserved for this sex. Authorities do not generally permit crossdressing because men or women dressing as the opposite sex reportedly represents a disruption to the social order. However, once an individual is diagnosed as suffering from gender dysphoria and agrees to undergo SRS, local authorities may issue them a permit to allow them to appear in public dressed as the opposite sex prior to the actual surgery. Post-surgery, transgender persons are advised to maintain discretion about their past due to stigma associated with being transgender.\u201d9 In this case, the claimant has not chosen to undergo reassignment surgery.\nThe U.S. Department of State for 2019 reports as a significant human rights problem, \u201charsh governmental restrictions on the rights of women and minorities; crimes involving violence or threats of violence targeting lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex (LGBTI) persons; criminalization of LGBTI status or conduct.\u201d10\n[8] It is reported in the NDP that people perceived as transgender by broader society are likely to experience violence and abuse by both state and non-state actors. Transgendered individuals are often arrested for not wearing the mandatory hijab. Targeting and harassment by the police can occur even when trans individuals have secured an official letter from the government certifying their gender identity disorder diagnosis.\n[9] A transgender person\u2019s behaviour and way of life is often criminalized within Iran despite legal recognition of trans individuals\u2019 gender identity. Members of the trans community in Iran are targeted by the state on the basis of alleged engagement in vaguely defined acts prohibited under the state\u2019s interpretation of Sharia law. For example, pursuant to Article 638 of the Iranian penal code, which criminalizes haram, which are acts generally considered sinful or prohibited by Sharia law, authorities can arbitrarily harass, arrest, detain and prosecute anyone perceived to have committed sinful acts in public. Individuals convicted under this article can spend between 10 days and two months in prison or be subjected to 74 lashes.\nState Protection\n[10] The panel finds that the claimant has rebutted the presumption of state protection given that the documentary evidence that the state does not provide adequate protection and, in some cases, the state is reported to harass and abuse members of the LGBTQ community in Iran.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[11] The panel finds that there is no viable internal flight alternative for the claimant. In this case the claimant fears both state and non-state actors. There does not appear to be anywhere in Iran where the claimant could live without this fear.\nCONCLUSION\n[12] Having considered all of the evidence, the panel finds the claimant is a Convention refugee and accepts the claim.\n(signed) Carol-Ann Gibbs\nOctober 29, 2020\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27, as amended.\n2 Ibid., section l 70(f).\n3 Refugee Protection Division Rules (SOR\/2012-256).\n4 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27, as amended, section 162(2).\n5 Instructions governing the streaming of less complex claims at the Refugee Protection Division, effective January 29, 2019.\n6 Exhibit 2\n7 Exhibit 1\n8 Exhibit 4\n9 Exhibit 3, item 1.8\n10 Exhibit 3, item 2.1\n\n",

These are the reasons in the claim for refugee protection made by XXXX XXXX also known as XXXX(ph) XXXX. This is for File TB9-19255. XXXX(ph) I will refer to you as the claimant when I provide these reasons.\n[2] So the claimant made his claim for refugee protection pursuant to Sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection act. I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee under Section 96 of this act.\n[3] The claimant\u2019s detailed allegations can be found in Exhibit 2, in his Basis of Claim Form. In summary the claimant alleges that he is a Palestinian and that his gender identity and expression exposes him to persecution in Jordan both from family members as well as Jordanian society. He also alleges that he is unable to live safely and openly as a transgendered man in Jordan.\n[4] He was assigned female gender at birth and alleges intolerance, rejection, discrimination and harassment in Jordan on account of his gender identity.\n[5] INTERPRETER: Sorry can you repeat this sentence?\n[6] MEMBER: Sure, so he alleges intolerance, rejection, discrimination and harassment in Jordan on account of his gender identity, including from the father of his girlfriend XXXX XXXX(ph)\n[7] INTERPRETER: Sorry I forgot her name?\n[8] MEMBER: Oh, XXXX XXXX(ph) who physically assaulted the claimant and threatened him after discovering his relationship with his daughter.\n[9] With respect to the claimant\u2019s identity, I find that his oral testimony and documentary evidence establishes that he is a stateless Palestinian. I was provided with a certified true copy of his travel document issued by the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, the original of which was seized by C.B.S.A. I will also not that this travel document does not contain a national identification number and does not confer Jordanian citizenship.\n[10] I was also provided with a copy of the claimant\u2019 s birth certificate indicating that although he was born in Saudi Arabia, he is a Palestinian national. I therefore find on a balance of probabilities that the claimant has provided sufficient documentation to establish his personal identity as a stateless Palestinian.\n[11] As a stateless Palestinian I must assess whether the claimant faces a serious possibility of persecution or a risk of harm in any country of former habitual residence and whether he is able to return to any other countries of former habitual residence.\n[12] COUNSEL: (inaudible)\n[13] MEMBER: Sure.\n[14] COUNSEL: I just wanted to ask XXXX(ph) do you need an interpreter at this time to translate? If you do that\u2019s fine I\u2019m just asking if you understand the English.\n[15] MEMBER: XXXX(ph) how about\u2026.\n[16] CLAIMANT: I do understand but there are some words only.\n[17] MEMBER: Okay so would you like the interpreter to continue to interpret these reasons? It\u2019s fine if you do.\n[18] CLAIMANT: I think I understand everything.\n[19] MEMBER: Okay, so\u2026.\n[20] COUNSEL: XXXX(ph) go outside it\u2019s fine, we\u2019ll put you on speaker you can call me.\n[21] CLAIMANT: I will mute myself, okay?\n[22] COUNSEL: Then you can\u2019t hear anything? (inaudible)\n[23] CLAIMANT: My stuff I can hear everything, now the sound is only like\u2026\n[24] COUNSEL: Sometimes?\n[25] MEMBER: Okay, so are we proceeding with the interpreter?\n[26] COUNSEL: I think if you speak slowly the claimant will understand.\n[27] CLAIMANT: Yes, definitely slowly yes.\n[28] MEMBER: Okay, I\u2019ll speak slowly and madam interpreter if you just remain on standby in case we need you.\n[29] INTERPRETER: Sure. Should I mute myself?\n[30] MEMBER: Yes.\n[31] INTERPRETER: Yes? Okay.\n[32] MEMBER: Okay, so as a stateless Palestinian I must assess whether the claimant faces a serious possibility of persecution or a risk of harm in any of, in any country of former habitual residence and whether he is able to return to any other countries of former habitual residence.\n[33] So the claimant moved to Jordan when he was approximately two years old and resided there continuously until he left for Canada in XXXX of 2019. As I said previously he holds a Jordanian travel document, a copy of which can be found in Exhibit 1 and he has a right of return to Jordan. For these reasons I find that Jordan is a country of former habitual residence for the claimant.\n[34] With respect to the West Bank, the claimant testified that he travelled there approximately three or four times in total and stayed there for no more than a month each time and that he travelled there for the purpose of vacation or visiting family. I do not find that this establishes a significant period of de facto residence such that it would be considered a country of former habitual residence.\n[35] Finally, with respect to Saudi Arabia, although the claimant was born there and lived there for approximately two years as a child, he only held temporary status there and does not have a right of return to Saudi Arabia.\n[36] I find that the claimant has established a well founded fear of persecution in Jordan on the basis of his membership in a particular social group as a transgendered male and that he is unable to return to any other country of former habitual residence.\n[37] With respect to credibility, the burden rests on the claimant to establish his allegations on a balance of probabilities. In this claim the determinative issue is whether the claimant has proven his identity as a transgendered man and in this respect I find that his testimony was credible.\n[38] The claimant provided straight forward and consistent testimony regarding the treatment that he faced in Jordan. He described in detail incidents that lead him to flee Jordan, including physical abuse from his parents growing up when he would refuse to wear traditionally female clothing and abuse, in his Basis of Claim Form he notes abuse from his father whenever someone would refer to him as a man.\n[39] He also testified credibly with respect to the harassment and intolerance that he faced from Jordanian society as well as his relationship with XXXX XXXX(ph) which when discovered by XXXX(ph) family members, resulted in a physical assault and threats by XXXX(ph) father. I found the claimant\u2019s testimony to be sufficiently detailed and credible.\n[40] The core aspects of the claimant\u2019 s testimony are corroborated with personal documentation which can be found in Exhibit 7 through 9.\n[41] The documentary evidence includes a letter of support from XXXX (ph) as well as numerous text messages between XXXX (ph) and the claimant and photographs of them together. It also includes photographs of XXXX (ph) injuries that were inflicted by her father, following the discovery of her and the claimant\u2019s relationship in XXXX of 2018. As well as medical reports from the claimant\u2019s family doctor in Toronto and in Jordan, detailing the claimant\u2019s transition and the hormone treatment that he has taken to that effect since XXXX of 2019.\n[42] I find these documents reliable and probative in establishing, in assisting to establish the claimant\u2019s allegations. I therefore accept the allegations and find on a balance of probabilities that the claimant is a transgendered male and faces a serious possibility of persecution in Jordan on that basis.\n[43] With respect to the objective basis for this claim, I have considered a number of different documents in the national documentation package, specifically Items 2.1, 6.1 and 7.3. I have also considered the country conditions disclosure that was provided in Exhibit 7.\n[44] So Item 2.1 of the NDP is the Department of State Report for the United States for the year of 2019. That report states that societal discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons was prevalent as were honour killings.\n[45] It also states that authorities in Jordan can arrest LGBTI individuals for allegedly violating public order or public decency which are crimes under the penal code and it notes that transgender individuals were especially vulnerable to acts of violence and sexual assault in Jordan.\n[46] This as I said this is also corroborated by the documents contained in the claimant\u2019s country conditions package which I believe I misspoke I think it\u2019s Exhibit 6 not Exhibit 7. Item 2.1 also notes that activists reported that discrimination against LGBT people occurred in housing, employment, education and access to public services.\n[47] Some LGBT individuals reported reluctance to engage the legal system due to fear that their sexual orientation or gender identity would provoke hostile reactions from the police, disadvantaged them in court or be used to shame them or their families.\n[48] I\u2019ve also considered Item 6.1 which repeats much of what I noted in Item 2.1. It further indicates that discrimination is quite prevalent and that there are no anti discrimination laws that specifically protect LGBT individuals in Jordan.\n[49] It also notes that Jordanian society is deeply conservative and describes why political reform has not been happening as legal reforms affecting LGBT people would be politically costly and (inaudible) defend LGBT rights would cause parliamentarians to lose their audience and supporters.\n[50] There\u2019s another Item in the NDP, Item 7.3 which states that conservative, cultural and religious norms restrict Jordanian LGBTI persons from being open. It also notes that authorities may use laws forbidding adultery or breaches of modesty to be used against LGBTI travellers.\n[51] So in light of the evidence that I\u2019ve just cited I find that the claimant would face a serious possibility of persecution in Jordan due to his gender identity and I also find that adequate state protection would not be available to the claimant as this attitude is generally consistent throughout the country.\n[52] With respect to an IFA, I find that there is no viable internal flight alternative for the claimant as Jordanian society is one of the agents of persecution and there is no evidence that any area of Jordan is particularly better than any other area of Jordan for transgendered individuals.\n[53] So I have therefore determined that the claimant has a well founded fear of persecution on the basis of his membership in a particular social group and I accept his claim.\n[54] I want to thank you for your testimony today XXXX(ph) I wish you all the best.\n[55] CLAIMANT: Thank you very much.\n[56] COUNSEL: Thank you so much it was a real pleasure appearing in front of you, thank you.\n[57] MEMBER: Thank you. Thank you madam interpreter as well for your assistance.\n[58] INTERPRETER: Thank you, thank you very much.\n[59] MEMBER: And for connecting and reconnecting when we had issues. Alright so I hope everyone has a great day take care. I believe a transcript of this decision will be sent to you in the mail both counsel and XXXX (ph) so you\u2019ll have a copy of that. Okay, so counsel I\u2019m sure counsel can make you aware of next steps.\n[60] COUNSEL: Thank you.\n[61] MEMBER: Alright take care. Bye bye.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n",

XXXX XXXX, who claims to be a citizen of Saudi Arabia, and is claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (the Act).\n[2] This claim has been decided without a hearing, according to the Immigration and Refugee Board\u2019s Chairperson\u2019s Instructions Governing the Streaming of Less Complex Claims at the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) and paragraph 170(f) of the Act.\n[3] Also, while analyzing and rendering this decision, the Panel applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9: Proceedings Before the IRB Involving Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression.\nDECISION\n[4] The Panel finds that the claimant is a refugee, pursuant to section 96 of the Act, as there exists a serious possibility of persecution, should he return to Saudi Arabia, on account of his membership in a particular social group, specifically based on his sexual orientation and gender identity as a transgender man.\nALLEGATIONS\n[5] The claimant\u2019s allegations are found in his Basis of claim form (BOC), which was submitted on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2020. In summary, the claimant alleges the following.\n[6] Born as a female, the claimant self-identifies as male.\n[7] The claimant is a citizen of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA).\n[8] Since a very young age, the claimant acted like a boy and preferred playing with boys, rather than girls. When he was six years old, the claimant did not like his own hair and tried to cut it on his own. When he started school, the claimant was aware that he was different from the other girls and that a girl\u2019s school was not his place.\n[9] At the age of nine, the claimant was forced to wear the hijab and to cover his body. He was also prohibited from his family to play or even to associate with boys.\n[10] Between the age of ten and sixteen, the claimant\u2019s life became very difficult and confusing and he went into XXXX.\n[11] At the age of seventeen, the claimant cut his hair. When his family discovered what he had done, his parents isolated him in his room for one year and his brother tried to kill him.\n[12] It is only in his 20s that the claimant accepted his sexual orientation. He had his first relationship with a woman while studying at university. His heart was broken when his girlfriend\u2019s family forced her to marry a man she barely knew.\n[13] The claimant then began to believe that he was wrong and that his family was right. The claimant then lost himself in religion in an attempt to end his sadness. Meanwhile, the claimant\u2019s father tried to get the claimant married. When the claimant refused, he was punished by his father and his brother. The claimant was then once more isolated, hospitalized, and forced to take estrogen, by his family in order for him to be \u201ccured\u201d.\n[14] The claimant later became a XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX and became well known in the Arab world.\n[15] The claimant also consulted a XXXX who told him that he had transgender issues and that he should research \u201cLGBTQ\u201d to help himself to come to terms with his sexual identity, which he did.\n[16] The claimant then abandoned Islam because it condoned the punishment of LGBTQ persons. In 2019, the claimant\u2019s brother attacked him for questioning Islam and threatened to kill him. The claimant\u2019s father then confined the claimant to his room for three months. It is during these three months that the claimant came to the conclusion that he had no other choice than to leave the country.\n[17] The claimant lied in order to gain permission from his family to leave the country. His father gave him permission to join his niece who was studying in the United States. At the same time, the claimant secretly applied for a Canadian visa which was issued on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2019.\n[18] The claimant left the KSA on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2019, and came directly to Canada. He finally submitted his asylum claim on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2020.\n[19] The claimant cannot return to the KSA where he fears to be targeted, persecuted and killed because of his gender identity and sexual orientation as a transgender man.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[20] The Panel finds that the identity of the claimant as a national of Saudi Arabia is established by the documents provided: namely his passport and birth certificate.1\nCredibility\n[21] Based on the documents in the file, the Panel has noted no serious credibility issues. In particular, the evidence establishes the allegations of the claimant as a transgender man as set out above. In fact, the passport and birth certificate of the claimant mention the claimant\u2019s gender to be \u201cfemale\u201d. The claimant also submitted his temporary driver\u2019s licence which shows the claimant\u2019s name and his sex as being \u201cM\/H\u201d which stands for \u201cman\/homme\u201d.\n[22] The claimant further submitted a letter from the Transgender Health Clinic where it is mentioned that the claimant, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, is undergoing hormone replacement therapy since XXXX XXXX XXXX 2020, to affirm his gender as a man.\n[23] The claimant also submitted a letter from the XXXX XXXX XXXX in Ottawa, where the letter was sent to the claimant under his name XXXX XXXX. The claimant also submitted another letter from XXXX XXXX and pictures of letters he received at his attention under the name of XXXXXXXX.\n[24] After reviewing the documents, the Panel has no reason to doubt their authenticity. In the light of this documentary evidence, the Panel finds that the claimant was able to establish, on the balance of probabilities, that he is a transgender man.\nObjective basis\n[25] According to the documents found in the National documentation package on the KSA \u2013 March 21, 2020, version (CND), LGBT rights are not recognized in the KSA and both male and female same-sex sexual activities are illegal. Also, the KSA operates an uncodified criminal code based on Sharia law. Under this framework, sex outside marriage is also illegal, same-sex marriage is not permitted, and same-sex intimacy is criminalized. In the KSA, homosexuality and being transgender is widely seen as immoral and indecent activities. The law also punishes acts of homosexuality and cross-dressing with severe punishment such as torture, prison up to a lifetime, and capital punishment. Members of the LGBTQ community have also been ostracized and, in some cases, been exposed by their own family members.\n[26] This situation faced by homosexuals and transgender persons in the KSA is corroborated by news articles and reports submitted by the claimants and also by the documents in the National Documentation Package under tabs 2.1, 2.4, 2.9, 6.1, 6.2 and 6.3.\n[27] Given that there are no serious credibility issues with respect to the allegations of the claimant, coupled with the documentary evidence cited previously, the Panel finds that the claimant has established a prospective risk of being subjected to the following harm(s): arrest, detention, torture, and being killed.\nNature of the harm\n[28] The Panel has examined this claim under section 96 of the Act, as it concludes that the risks the claimant faces constitute persecution based on at least one of the grounds prescribed in the Refugee Convention, specifically his membership in a particular social group, specifically based on his sexual orientation and gender identity as a transgender man.\nState Protection\n[29] The Panel finds that there is clear and convincing evidence that the state is unable or unwilling to provide the claimant with adequate protection. Since homosexuality and being a transgender person is criminalized in the KSA, the Panel finds that it would be clearly unreasonable for the claimant to ask for protection from the KSA authorities. Thus, the Panel concludes that the claimant has rebutted the presumption of state protection.\nInternal flight alternative\n[30] Finally, the Panel has examined whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for the claimant. Based on the evidence on file as previously cited, I find that the claimant faces a serious possibility of persecution throughout the KSA.\nConclusion\n[31] In light of the preceding, the Panel concludes that the claimant is a Convention refugee, pursuant to section 96 of the Act and accepts this claim.\n(signed) Francis Chaput\nDecember 3, 2020\n1 Package of information from the referring Canada Border Services Agency \/ Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada.\n\n",

From then onwards, you make the decision to hide your true gender identity while planning your departure from Saudi Arabia.\n[7] It is in this context that you decide to pursue your university studies in the United States (USA). You reach the USA on XXXX XXXX 2018.\n[8] In that country, while you do make your gender identity public, you do remain cautious as you fear that you might be denounced to Saudi Embassy officials or come across someone who knows you. You also become the target of harassment as well as rape and death threats at the hands of a group of Arab men who attend the same classes as you in university. As this situation becomes increasingly difficult, it not only prevents you from completing your last semester, but causes you to become suicidal and leads you to seek refuge somewhere else.\n[9] It is in this context that you decide to come to Canada to seek asylum. You are presently pursuing the hormone treatment you started in the USA and are considering converting to the Christian faith.\nDETERMINATION\n[10] I find that you are a Convention refugee as you have established a serious possibility of persecution should you return to Saudi Arabia based on the grounds in section 96.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[11] I find that your identity as a national of Saudi Arabia is established by the documents provided, namely your passport.\nNexus\n[12] I find that you have established a nexus to section 96 by reason of your membership in a particular social group, namely Saudi transgendered individuals.\nCredibility\n[13] Based on the documents in the file, I have noted no serious credibility issues.\n[14] In particular, the evidence establishes the allegations as set out above. Exhibits E-3 to E- 6 corroborate your allegations with respect to the treatment you faced at the hands of your cousin in Saudi Arabia, and the transition process you have initiated through, inter alia, hormonal therapy. Exhibits E-1 and E-2 corroborate your allegations with respect to your status in the USA. After reviewing the documents, I have no reasons to doubt neither their authenticity, nor the truthfulness of their content.\n[15] With respect to your failure to claim asylum in the USA, I find the explanations you have provided to justify your actions to be reasonable, in light of your specific circumstances. Therefore, I find that your actions neither display a lack of subjective fear, nor do they undermine your general credibility.\nObjective basis of future risk\n[16] Based on the credibility of your allegations, and the documentary evidence set out below, I find that as a transgendered individual, you have established a future risk that you will be subjected to the following harm should you return to Saudi Arabia: official and societal discrimination, harassment, physical violence, possibly of a sexual nature, arbitrary arrest and detention.\n[17] The fact that you face this risk is corroborated by the documents found at tabs 2.1, 6.1 and 6.3 of the National Documentation Package for Saudi Arabia, in its March 29, 2019 Version.\nNature of the harm\n[18] This harm clearly amounts to persecution.\nState protection\n[19] Considering that according to the above-cited documentary sources, authorities do not make a distinction between transgendered and intersexed individuals and homosexuals; considering the documented treatment reserved to homosexuals by police authorities, I find that there is clear and convincing evidence before me that the state is unable or unwilling to provide you with adequate protection.\nInternal flight alternative\n[20] I have considered whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for you. On the evidence before me, I find that there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout Saudi Arabia.\nCONCLUSION\n[21] Based on the analysis above, I conclude that you are a Convention refugee. Accordingly, I accept your claim.\n(signed) Fran\u00e7ois Ramsay\nFebruary 21, 2020\n\n",

Most recently, she was detained in XXXX 2016, ahead of a press conference organized by a trans rights organization she helped found in Monterrey.\n[4] The claimant was also kidnapped and severely beaten by the police in Puebla in XXXX 2018.\n[5] The claimant fears further mistreatment from the police were she to return to Mexico.\n[6] She also fears retaliation from her former procurer for having publicly denounced her practice of charging a fee to assist trans women in changing their legal names and legal gender in Mexico City. She also fears retaliation from her for having denounced her mistreatment to the police.\n[7] The claimant left Mexico on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018 and arrived in Montreal the next day. She filed for refugee protection on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2019.\nDECISION\n[8] The Tribunal finds that the claimant is a \u201cConvention Refugee\u201d pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA.\nANALYSIS\n[9] In the present case, the Tribunal considered the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9: Proceedings Before the IRB Involving Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression (SOGIE Guidelines).\nIdentity\n[10] The claimant\u2019s personal identity and her national identity as a citizen of Mexico are established, on a balance of probabilities, by a copy of her passport filed as evidence.\nCredibility\n[11] The Tribunal finds the claimant credible on the material aspects of her claim; namely that she is a trans woman from Mexico.\n[12] The claimant answered all questions put to her fully, spontaneously and without evasion.\n[13] The claimant was able to explain with great details the difference, stigma, shame, and harm she felt growing up as a transgender woman.\n[14] The claimant also explained how she began taking hormones at a young age, and later started taking testosterone blockers. She provided details about how she procured these medications. A medical report filed as evidence also showed that she had breast implants.1\n[15] The claimant explained at large the types of situations she frequently faced in Mexico as a transgender woman. Some of the specific examples she gave could even be largely corroborated by the objective documentary evidence. As an example, the objective documentary evidence states that \u201c[t]ransgender women [are] frequently accused of being involved in sex work, even when they [are] simply running errands like going to buy milk.\u201d2 This is in line with the claimant\u2019s testimony that she was once arrested and detained by the police while simply going to buy bread and milk at a depanneur.\n[16] In addition to her testimony, the Tribunal carefully reviewed and considered documents filed by the claimant in support of her allegations. The Tribunal asked the claimant to explain what the process of changing her legal gender entailed. After having heard the claimant on the matter, the Tribunal asked the claimant how the process was reflected in the documentary evidence she provided. The claimant first pointed to her national elector\u2019s card,3 which was issued prior to the name and gender change. This card, issued in 2013, showed her former male name and showed her gender as male. She then pointed to the birth certificate which was issued following her legal name and gender change, issued in 2015.4 This document showed her new female name and showed her gender as female.\n[17] Other evidence also allowed the Tribunal to understand the claimant\u2019s activism in the trans sphere. Not only did the claimant seek justice for herself, she also sought to help members of her community by lobbying governments.\nIncompatible Behaviour \u2013 Travel ta Spain and Return to Mexico\n[18] According to her IMM-5669 form, the claimant travelled to Spain in 2017 to study XXXX XXXX. While in Spain, the claimant did not file for refugee protection and subsequently returned to Mexico.\n[19] The Tribunal asked the claimant why she had not filed for refugee protection in Spain. The claimant testified that she did not feel that things were so bad in Mexico at that time. She also testified that she had started her work as an activist and returned to Mexico to help her friends with their activism project.\n[20] The Tribunal notes that the claimant\u2019s travel to Spain happened prior to the last set of events that lead the claimant to leave Mexico for Canada. The Tribunal is also mindful that, according to the Chairperson\u2019s Guidelines 9, it may be plausible that a trans woman like the claimant would engage \u201cin activity that might put [her] at risk in [her] country of reference.\u201d5 Considering the above and the claimant\u2019s profile as an activist, the Tribunal makes no implausibility findings in relation to her failure to file for refugee protection in Spain and in relation to her return to Mexico.\nDelay in Claiming Refugee Protection in Canada\n[21] The claimant spent just shy of six months in Canada prior to filing for refugee protection.\n[22] At the hearing, the claimant testified that she had been asked by the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) whether she wanted to claim asylum in Canada on arrival in Montreal and that she had answered no to that question.\n[23] Considering the claimant\u2019s personal situation as a trans woman who has been through a lot of violence, the Tribunal does not make any negative inference related to her delay in claiming. The Tribunal subscribes to the observations made by the claimant\u2019s counsel according to which the claimant may not have been necessarily familiar with the workings of refugee claims in Canada and that it is quite possible that she may have had a psychological difficulty in taking action.\nNexus\n[24] For the claim to succeed under section 96 of the IRPA, the persecution must be linked to a Convention ground, in other words, there must be a nexus.\n[25] The Tribunal finds that the claimant has established a nexus to the Convention, as the harm feared is on account of her membership in a particular social group (trans women).\n[26] For the reasons set out under the State Protection and Internal Flight Alternative sections below, the Tribunal also finds that, on a balance of probabilities, the claimant has a serious possibility of facing serious harm should she return to Mexico. The objective documentary evidence tendered into evidence by the board supports this finding.\nState Protection\n[27] Canada\u2019s responsibility to provide international protection to the claimant only becomes engaged when national or state protection is unavailable to the claimant. The claimant has the burden of rebutting the presumption of state protection. The Tribunal must now determine whether the claimant has presented clear and convincing evidence to rebut the presumption of state protection.\n[28] According to the objective documentary evidence, transgender women often do not report hate crimes or police abuse because the authorities rarely investigate these crimes.6 Crimes committed towards trans women are frequently minimized and mischaracterized by authorities.7\n[29] The objective documentary evidence also reports that police officers subject transgender women to arrest, extortion, physical abuse, arbitrary detention, torture, and other human rights violations that are often unpunished.8\n[30] While the Mexican government has enacted laws aimed at protecting sexual minorities, such laws only provide explicit protections based on sexual orientation and not based on gender identity.9 The fact that the claimant was able to have her name and gender changed on her birth certificate does show that the government is making steps in the right direction, however, legal recognition does not necessarily translate into adequate protection. According to the objective documentary evidence, \u201cfederal antidiscrimination laws do not protect transgender communities from persecution because the Mexican government is unable to enforce them, especially because the police themselves are often the perpetrators of violence against transgender people.\u201d10 Moreover, it is far from clear whether the enactment of antidiscrimination laws \u201chas actually led to an improvement in the treatment of LGBT people generally or transgender women in particular.\u201d11\n[31] Having considered the claimant\u2019s testimony and the objective documentary evidence regarding the availability of state protection for trans women in Mexico, the Tribunal is of the view that evidence of Mexico\u2019 s inability to protect trans women is clear and convincing. The Tribunal therefore finds that, on a balance of probabilities, the state protection afforded to trans women in Mexico is inadequate and that the claimant has rebutted the presumption that state protection is available in her country.\nInternal Flight Alternative (IFA)\n[32] According to the objective documentary evidence, Mexico has the second-highest index of crimes motivated by transphobia in Latin America after Brazil.12 Geographically, transphobic murders occur throughout the country including in areas with more progressive laws such as Mexico City.13\n[33] Nothing in the evidence suggests that the claimant could be safe outside of her home area. The claimant testified that she moved across the country on several occasions, yet always ended up being badly treated by the police everywhere she went.\n[34] The Tribunal finds that there is, on a balance of probabilities, a serious probability of the claimant being persecuted throughout Mexico. There are no internal flight alternatives available to the claimant.\nCONCLUSION\n[35] Having considered all the evidence, the Tribunal determines that there\u2019s a serious possibility that the claimant would be persecuted in her country.\n[36] The Tribunal concludes that the claimant is a Convention refugee.\n[37] The claim of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is accepted.\n(signed) Fran\u00e7ois Savoie\nOctober 26, 2020\n1 Document 4 \u2013 Exhibit D-6.\n2 Document 3 \u2013 National Documentation Package (NDP), Mexico, 30 September 2020, tab 6.3: Report on Human Rights Conditions of Transgender Women in Mexico.

Ali of the parties present, the claimant, the interpreter, counsel, and myself confirmed that we were alone in our respective location and that we could see and hear the parties clearly.\nAllegations\n[4] The claimant detailed her allegations in her basis of claim form which can be summarized as follows. The claimant alleges fear of persecution at the hands of state authorities in Mexico on account of her membership in a particular social group as a transgender woman.\nDecision\n[5] I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to Section 96 of the IRPA as she has established facing a serious possibility of persecution on account of her gender identity as a transgender woman if she returns to Mexico.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[6] I find that the claimant\u2019s identity as a national of Mexico has been established by her testimony and the supporting documents provided. Notably a certified copy of her passport at Exhibit 1.\nCredibility\n[7] I find the claimant to be a credible witness and therefore believe what she alleged in support of her claim. She testified in a straightforward manner and there were no relevant inconsistencies in her testimony or contradictions between her testimony and the other evidence before me. She did not embellish or exaggerate her claim and was forthcoming when answering my questions even if it did not benefit her claim. She admitted for example that she had not been victim of persecution herself as a transgender woman so she could only speak to what she had learned on the media about the treatment of other transgender women in Mexico. Moreover, I find that the series of photographs she submitted along with support letters and a medical report from her doctor in Canada to corroborate her allegations.\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution\n[8] The claimant testified that she did not feel as a boy for as long as she can remember. At the age of XXXX she was sent away to Tampico, Tamaulipas to go to school. She believes that her parents sent her three hours away from home because they did not agree of her feminine ways and different behavior. To this day her family still refuses to acknowledge her gender, her mother continues to refer to her as him or he and uses her name as at birth XXXX. The claimant has suffered significant hardship throughout her life, including bullying, intimidation, sexual abuse as a child and discrimination in the workplace as an adult. She began her journey to transition at the end of 2018, she was working at the time as an XXXXat XXXX, external to XXXX in Monterrey, Nuevo Le\u00f3n. When her boss received her doctor\u2019s note explaining her leave of absence, he spread the news around the company about her gender transition. The claimant suffered severe repercussions, including bullying and intimidation by co-workers and her boss for transitioning to become her real self. Although the claimant started to use the pronouns, she\/her only three months ago after starting hormonal treatments in Canada, she has always felt as a woman. The claimant fears to be humiliated, discriminated against, assaulted, or even killed if she return to Mexico as a transgender woman.\n[9] According to the objective evidence that counsel submitted at Exhibit 4, Mexico is said to be the deadliest country in the world after Brazil for transgender persons. Perpetrators of violence, torture, and murder of transgender persons in Mexico benefit from great impunity as most murders go unsolved and are unpunished. As corroborated in the Human Rights Watch report Item 2.3 of the NDP and the SOGIE compilation Item 6.1, the agents of persecution include state authorities and the judiciary system that uses vague legislations to incriminate transgender persons. Transgender women in particular are painted as-, by politicians and policymakers as paedophiles or as a danger to public order. In sum, the objective evidence overwhelmingly points to systemic persecution against transgender persons in Mexico, particularly transgender women which manifests itself in ail spears of society and is perpetrated with impunity by civilians, state authorities, political figures who incentivize hate against transgender persons and members of the judiciary system who manipulate the law to incriminate them. For these reasons I find that the claimant has established an objectively well-founded fear of persecution if she returns to Mexico.\nState Protection\n[10] I find that it would be objectively unreasonable for the claimant to seek the protection of the State in this particular case. There is ample objective evidence painting to state authorities, politicians, and policymakers as well as judges and members of the judiciary system as being part of the agent of persecution who persecute, incriminate, torture, and kill transgender persons in Mexico. As such I find that there is clear and convincing evidence that the State is part of the agents of persecution along with civilians who benefit from great impunity. It would not be reasonably forthcoming for the claimant to seek state protection where the State is the agent of persecution. For this reason, I find that the presumption of adequate state protection has been rebutted.\nInternal Flight Alternative or IFA\n[11] I have examined whether a viable IFA exists for the claimant. As mentioned above, I find that the State is part of the agents of persecution in this case. The State has effective control throughout the country and there have been accounts of judges using their legislation to incriminate transgender persons as indicated at Item 6.1 of the NDP. As the IFA test fails on the first prong of the test, I find that there is no viable IFA available to the claimant. Consequently, I find that the claimant faces a serious possibility of persecution throughout Mexico.\nCONCLUSION\n[12] In light of the proceeding, I conclude that the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to Section 96 of the IRPA; accordingly, I accept her claim.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n",

Written reasons will be sent to you and your Counsel and the written version will be a transcript of what I am saying now.\n[3] I have considered and applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9, proceedings before the IRB involving sexual orientation, gender identity and expression. I find that you are a Convention refugee as you have a well-founded fear of persecution in South Korea.\n[4] I will summarize your allegations as follows. You fear persecution in South Korea based on your sexual orientation and your gender identity as a bi-sexual transmasculine person. Your assigned gender at birth was female. You are non-binary and you express yourself as masculine. You are attracted to both males and females.\n[5] You disclosed your sexual orientation to your mother at age XXXXorXXXX XXXX. She attempted to kill you and herself first with a kitchen knife and later by jumping off a building you lived in. Both of your parents have rejected you by reason of your sexual orientation and gender identity. You spent a great deal of time outside of South Korea while you were growing up. You studied in Thailand and the United States. You completed your university studies in Chicago. You travelled to and remained in South Korea during your breaks from school.\n[6] Beginning in 2012 you started hormone replacement therapy and you have been taking testosterone injections since. You physical appearance changed over time and became more masculine as the hormone replacement therapy progressed. You have had romantic and sexual relationships with males and females. You have been in a common-law relationship with a person who identifies herself as pansexual named XXXX (phonetic) for seven years. You lived together in the United States. She is a citizen of Bhutan.\n[7] You face discrimination in employment in South Korea because you are transgender. You physical appearance does not match your assigned gender on your identity document which states that you are female. You encountered sexual harassment and discrimination at work. You also encountered ridicule from medical staff when you sought health care in South Korea.\n[8] You fear that you will continue to endure such a significant level of discrimination that you will not be able to secure employment, access to health care services and to be able to live openly as a transmasculine bi-sexual in South Korea with a basic level of dignity. You lived for a number of years in the United States on a student visa. When your student visa expired you came to Canada on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2019 and made a refugee claim in XXXX 2019.\n[9] I find that you have established your identity as a citizen of Korea through copies of two of your passports in Exhibit 1. I find that you have provided a significant amount of evidence to establish your gender identity and sexual orientation as a transmasculine bi-sexual. Your passport indicates that your assigned gender if female. A West Coast medical imagining has provided a copy of your pelvic ultrasound in Exhibit 4 at page 1. This corroborates your assigned gender and the documented West Coast medical imagining further corroborates that you are on testosterone therapy.\n[10] You provided numerous letters from many different people you have known through different stages of your transition corroborating your gender identity and your sexual orientation, in Exhibit 4. Many of the authors of these letters identify themselves as sexual minorities. You have corroborated your relationship with XXXX (phonetic) through her letter and her sister\u2019s letter as well as a lease showing that you lived together in Chicago. These documents are in Exhibit 4.\n[11] You provided evidence of your connections with transgender friends in Vancouver and other places. As well as your involvement in the LGBTQ community in Vancouver you have been involved in Rainbow Refugee in Vancouver and the I Belong group an LGBTQ group that is part of a mosaic, a local organization that supports immigrants. You have also been involved in the local organization called Pride and Art society which organizes the queer arts festival and other events. I find that you have established that you are transmasculine bi-sexual.\n[12] I find that the fear you face sorry \u2014 I find that your fear of societal discrimination and harassment is corroborated by the country condition documents. Documents in your disclosure in Exhibits 4 and 5 as well as documents in the National Documentation Package demonstrate that transgender persons face a serious level of discrimination in employment, access to health care and various facets of life in South Korea.\n[13] One of the significant hurdle faced by a transgender persons is Korea is the difficulty in legally changing your assigned gender on your national identity documents. The Response to Information Request on the treatment of transgender people, NDP Item 6.2 as well as the Kaleidoscope report NDP Item 6.2 talk about this. While it is possible to change one\u2019s gender legally the requirements have been described by the report of the Kaleidoscope Human Rights Foundation NDP Item 6.1, as being incredibly complex discriminatory and restrictive.\n[14] In 2006 Supreme Court decision gave transgender persons in South Korea the right to be recognized according to their preferred gender. However the Supreme Court drafted a number of restrictive guidelines on when legal change of gender can occur. A transgender person could be recognized according to their preferred gender if the following conditions exist. The person is an unmarried Korean citizen over 19 years of age with no minor children; has suffered from continued gender diaspora and has the sense of belongingness to the opposite due to being transsexual; after having undergone psychiatric treatment or hormone therapy still wish to receive surgical treatment and alter his or her physical appearance including external genitalia through sexual reassignment surgery; has become sterile as a result of sexual reassignment surgery with zero or extremely remote possibility that they will return to their former gender; does not show indications that he or she filed the application for the purpose of committing a crime or abating the law; and has parental consent. The Response to Information Request also states that sources say that recognition of gender reassignment is only possible after gender reassignment surgeries and sterilization.\n[15] You have indicated that you do not wish to have surgery due to the invasive nature of the procedure and the many risks associated with the procedure. Another impediment you face in having your gender legally reassigned is that you would not be able to secure parental consent. Neither of your parents would be supportive of your petition for gender reassignment. You have no contact with your father at all. You have contact with your mother but she does not accept your sexual orientation or gender identity. You would not likely be able to change your gender assigned legally in South Korea. The test outlined by the court is highly onerous as it requires you to undergo medical procedures against you will including sexual reassignment surgery. I find that this requirement is in itself persecutory.\n[16] Individuals who cannot obtain a legal change of gender are by extension unable to change their gender on their identity documents. In South Korea all persons are issued a national identity card which is essential for securing employment, shelter and various governmental services. Each persons\u2019 national identity number reveals their date of birth and their gender. The identity number is an all purpose lifetime number. It prevents transgender person who do wish to \u2014 it prevents persons who do not wish to reveal their gender identity from using legal documents in most areas of society including the labour market, medical institutions and financial institutions.\n[17] I find that you will face a significant level of stigmas in South Korea as you have in the past if you are identified as a female on your identity documents but you present as a male. You have documented the discrimination you face in securing and maintaining employment in South Korea in your Basis of Claim form and the sources in the country condition documents corroborate that the transgender person experience discrimination related to employment in the similar manner that you have.\n[18] According to the Kaleidoscope Foundation report, the LGBTI community continues to suffer significant degree of stigma, abuse, harassment and discrimination. Marriage of same sex couples remains illegal. The same report states that transgender persons experience physical harassment and assault including rape.\n[19] I find that your fear of persecution has a nexus to a Convention ground of membership in a particular social group as a transmasculine bi-sexual. I find that the level of discrimination you would face in employment, accessing health care and other services as well as the threat of harassment and violence is sufficiently serious to be persecution. You cannot live openly as a transmasculine bi-sexual in Korea without facing a serious possibility of persecution.\n[20] I find that the presumption of state protection has been rebutted by clear and convincing evidence. There is very little legal recognition and protection of the rights of sexual minorities in general in Korea.\n[21] According to the US Department of State report, NDP Item 2.1, no law specify punishment for persons found to discriminate against lesbians, gay, bi-sexual, transgender or intersex persons or provide remedies to victims of discrimination or violence based on sexual orientation. I note also that the military criminal act criminalizes consensual sex between men in the military with up to two years of imprisonment.\n[22] According to the Kaleidoscope Foundation document there is an absence of any anti- discrimination laws to protect LGBTI persons resulting in a failure to protect against widespread discrimination in a range of areas such as employment and health care. The government has failed to provide access and acceptable processes for individuals to legally choose their gender without discrimination or violation of their human rights. The government does not recognize same sex relationships. There is also lack of protection for same sex couples with respect to domestic violence and a lack of equal protection for sexual minorities with respect to sexual assault.\n[23] I find that state protection is not available to you in South Korea.\n[24] I also find that there is no viable internal flight alternative for you in South Korea. There is no objective evidence that a particular part of South Korea would be more safe for you as a transmasculine bi-sexual. I find that you would face a serious possibility of persecution throughout the country.\n[25] For the foregoing reasons I find that you are a Convention refugee and I therefore accept your claim.\n\u2014 PROCEEDINGS CONCLUDED\n\n",

A written form of these reasons will be sent to you and your counsel. It will be a transcript of what I am saying now. The written reasons may be edited for generally readability and references to the applicable case law and the documentary evidence may also be included.\n[2] These are the reason for the decision in the claim of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX who claims to be a citizen of Colombia and is claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, IRPA.\n[3] In rendering my decision I have considered the Chairperson\u2019s Guidelines on Proceedings Before the IRB Involving Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression, SOGIE, and also the Gender Guidelines.\nAllegations\n[4] You allege that you are a transgender female, where you were born with male sex organs but you identify since 2014 as a woman and you face persecution in Colombia for this reason.\n[5] In 2014, you along with other trans women in Bogota were pressured to smuggle items into prisons and you were beaten when you refused.\n[6] You moved to Tulua and you experienced discrimination there. You were fired from your job in XXXX 2014 when you went to work dressed as a woman.\n[7] In XXXX 2015 you were insulted, beaten and injured in Bogota when you were dressed as a woman and you often experienced verbal abuse.\n[8] You believe there is little effort by the government to protect trans people from discrimination and persecution. You fear persecution if you return to Colombia.\nDetermination\n[9] I find that you are a Convention refugee as you have established that you face a serious possibility of persecution for reason of your being a transgender woman.\nAnalysis\nIdentity\n[10] I find that your identity as a national of Colombia is established by your testimony and the supporting documentation filed, including certified copies of your passport and identity card in Exhibit 1.\n[11] You testified that you prefer to be known as XXXX although you have no identity documents in that name.\nCredibility\n[12] I find you to be a credible witness and therefore believe what you alleged in support of your claim. You testified in a straightforward manner and there were no relevant inconsistencies in your testimony or contradictions between your testimony and the other evidence before me.\n[13] When a claimant swears to the truth of certain allegations, this creates a presumption that those allegations are true unless there be reason to doubt their truthfulness and the reference there is to Maldonado.\n[14] I find that you have established on a balance of probabilities that you are a transgender woman.\nObjective basis of future risk\n[15] Based on your credible allegations in testimony and the documentary evidence set out below, as well as the country condition evidence, I find that you have established that you face a serious possibility of persecution by reason of your being transgender if you were to return to Colombia by both state and non-state actors.\n[16] You testified that you have always been attracted to women and you started feeling like a woman yourself in 2013 or 2014. You felt like and lived as a woman from 2014 until you left to come to Canada in 2018, except that the last six months you lived as a man in Colombia in order to be able to work and make money. You saved the money to come to Canada.\n[17] You explained that you prefer to live as a woman and you plan to make a physical transition from male to female, although you have not started that physical transition yet.\n[18] You\u2019ve explained that it was complicated to live as a trans woman in Colombia. You lived for about a year with a group of seven other trans woman in Bogota who operated a XXXX XXXX but they also smuggled items into the prisons and they pressured you to do the same. You refused to do that and they beat you up.\n[19] You got a job in your profession of XXXX XXXX in XXXX 2014 and in XXXX 2014 you began going to work dressed as a woman. You testified that your boss began to treat you strangely and make new demands that he would not normally require. You were fired from the job within a month of starting to dress as a woman. You believe that you were fired from this job because you\u2019re transgender and you attempted to live as a woman openly.\n[20] You moved to Tulua in XXXXorXXXX XXXX 2015 but you were not able to find work in your civil engineering profession. You moved back to Bogota in XXXXor XXXX 2016.\n[21] You also testified that you have experienced verbal aggression, name-calling and you\u2019ve been physically assaulted and injured in Colombia all because you are living as a trans woman.\n[22] You think the safest place to be able to live in Colombia is Bogota but you don\u2019t believe you can live safely even there because of the fear of aggression, assault and not being able to work as a woman.\n[23] You testified that Colombia has a closed culture in terms of opinion and sexual orientation.\n[24] Your fears relating to the risks you face if you live openly as a transgender woman in Colombia are corroborated by documents in the NDP, that\u2019s the National Documentation Package for Colombia, the March 29th, 2019 version.\n[25] I\u2019ve considered the documentary evidence on the treatment of sexual minorities in Colombia. The legal framework for the protection of rights of sexual minorities is relatively progressive; however, in practice SOGIE individuals face significant discrimination in many facets of life and violence from society at large.\n[26] The legal protections that exist for sexual minorities are outlined in a Response to Information Request, or RIR, on the treatment of sexual minorities, which is NDP item 6.3.\n[27] NDP item 2.1 from the US Department of State says in part:\n\u201cTransgender individuals cited barriers to public services when health care providers or police officers refused to accept their government-issued identification. Some transgender individuals stated it was difficult to change the gender designation on national identity documents \u2014\nINTERPRETER: Sorry, can you repeat again after what you said about health service providers?\nPRESIDING MEMBER: Or police officers.\nINTERPRETER: Pardon me. Thank: you.\nPRESIDING MEMBER: Okay.\n\u201cSome transgender individuals stated it was difficult to change the gender designation on national identity documents and that transgender individuals whose identity cards listed them as male were still required to show proof they had performed mandatory military service or obtained the necessary waivers from that service.\u201d\n[28] NGOs or non-governmental organizations claimed discrimination and violence in prisons against persons due to their sexual orientation and gender identity remained a problem.\n[29] Despite government measures to increase the rights and protections of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex, or LGBTI persons, there were reports of societal abuse and discrimination as well as sexual assault. NGOs claimed transgender individuals, particularly transgender men, were often sexually assaulted in so-called corrective rape.\n[30] The constitutional court pronounced in 2016 that transgender persons faced discrimination and social rejection within the LGBTI community and recommended measures to increase respect for transgender identities in the classrooms. That report also says that NGOs reported several cases of threats against LGBTI human rights defenders as well as a high level of impunity for crimes against LGBTI persons. Such organizations partially attributed impunity levels to the failure of the Attorney General\u2019s Office to distinguish and effectively pursue crimes against LGBTI persons.\n[31] NDP item 1.7, the UNHCR Eligibility Guidelines also refers to some serious levels of discrimination against SOGIE individuals:\n\u201cIndividuals of diverse sexual orientations and\/or gender identities, SOGIE, are victims of discrimination. Social movements demanding the recognition of the rights of gay men and lesbians have progressively made important though insufficient progress, including the recognition of the inheritance rights of same-sex couples, same-sex marriage and adoption by couples of the same sex.\nParadoxically, simultaneously with the advancement in terms of recognition of the rights of these individuals, violent incidents seem to have increased. Persons of diverse sexual orientations and\/or gender identities have reportedly been exposed to torture in detention and to police violence. Furthermore, authorities often do not initiate investigations into cases of homicide and sexual violence against persons of diverse sexual orientations and\/or gender identities.\nA SOGIE rights organization in Colombia, Colombia Diversa, has recorded and verified 550 cases of homicide related to sexual orientation and\/or gender identity in the period 2009 to 2014, including among the victims at least 86 transgender women and at least 18 SOGIE rights defenders.\u201d\n[32] That report also says that particularly with respect to armed groups:\n\u201cNGOs have said that armed groups have imposed on persons of diverse SOGIE widely accepted gender roles by threatening to use violence as a punishment for not conforming. Some NGOs have also reported that the punishments perpetrated by guerilla groups, members of paramilitary groups including inter alia threats, assassinations, forced disappearances, grave physical and psychological harm and, above all, forced displacement of lesbian, gay and transgender persons.\u201d\n[33] The Colombia LGBTI Report at NDP item 6.4 states at page nine that:\n\u201cViolence against LGBTI Colombians is pernicious and widespread. While there is no official government data that captures it, activists and individual accounts suggest a reality in which violence against LGBTI people permeates every sector of society: schools and universities, public places and city streets, families and communities.\u201d\nNexus and nature of the harm\n[34] I find that your fear of persecution has a nexus to the Convention ground as a member of a particular social group as a transgender person.\n[35] The harm that you fear is serious. The documentary evidence as well as your testimony indicates that violence against SOGIE persons in particular and transgender people is quite widespread and conducted with impunity.\n[36] As well, the level of discrimination by society at large is severe, particularly with respect to people who are transgender.\n[37] I find based on all of the evidence before me that you face a serious possibility of persecution for reason of being a transgender woman if you return to Colombia.\nState protection\n[38] I have also considered whether state protection is available to you in Colombia. I find that adequate state protection would not be reasonably forthcoming in this particular case. You testified that you did not seek help from the police after the assaults and aggression that you experienced because you\u2019ve been told that many trans women are mistreated by the police. You have not been mistreated by the police yourself but you know of other trans women who have been mistreated.\n[39] I find that the documentary evidence on the treatment of sexual minorities indicates that crimes against SOGIE people is done with impunity. The US Department of State Report, item 2.1 in the NDP says that:\n\u201cAs of September 18th, the Attorney General\u2019s office was investigating at least two alleged homicides of LGBTI individuals. Investigations into crimes committed by the security forces did not appear in the Attorney General\u2019s office system. NGO Colombia Diversa reported six cases involving eight victims of police abuse of persons due to their sexual orientation or gender identity with the majority of complaints coming from transgender individuals.\u201d\n[40] So, there is evidence that the authorities themselves are responsible for the abuse of persons for their sexual orientation or gender identity.\n[41] The UNHCR Guidelines at item 1.7 in the NDP states that state authorities, especially the police, are reported to participate in violent acts against persons of diverse sexual orientation and gender identity. This document also notes at page 51:\nState authorities, especially the police, are reported to participate in violent acts against persons of diverse sexual orientations and\/or gender identities. In its report for the Committee Against Torture, Colombia Diversa recorded 212 incidents of police violence in the period 2008 to 2014. Moreover, police reportedly often failed to acknowledge the existence of prejudice as the primary cause of violent incidents against person of diverse sexual orientations and\/or gender identities. In some cases such incidents are reportedly classified as personal violence having been caused by the behaivour of the victim. Individuals of diverse SOGIE are not included among the profiles identified by the government as specifically at risk of violence or harm and therefore are not eligible for special protection.\u201d\n[42] I find that the level of protection provided by the state in Colombia falls far short of being adequate given the impunity with which crimes against SOGIE individuals are treated and as well as recurring reports of police being involved in the abuse of these groups.\nInternal flight alternative\n[43] I have considered whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for you. On the evidence before me, I find that there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout Colombia. I find that as a Colombian national who is transgender there is nowhere you could reasonably live safely in Colombia. The discrimination against someone like you would be severe and you face a serious possibility of persecution throughout the country.\nConclusion\n[44] Based on the analysis above, I conclude that you are a Convention refugee. Accordingly, I accept your claim.\n[45] Thank you for attending today and I wish you good luck.\n\u2014PROCEEDINGS CONCLUDED\n\n",

I\u2019ve considered your testimony and the other evidence in your case and I\u2019m ready to render a decision orally. You claim to be a citizen of Kenya. You are claiming refugee protection pursuant to s. 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nDetermination\n[2] For the reasons that follow, I find that you are a Convention refugee on the grounds of membership in a particular social group as a bisexual man.\nGuidelines\n[3] In deciding this claim, I have considered and applied the chairperson\u2019s sexual orientation and gender identity expression guidelines.\nAllegations\n[4] Your allegations are found in your Basis of Claim form at Exhibit 2. To summarize, you allege that you face persecution at the hands of the state due to your sexual orientation.\nIdentity\n[5] I find that your identity has been established on a balance of probabilities by your testimony and the certified copy of your Kenyan passport at Exhibit 1.\nNexus\n[6] I find that there is a clear nexus between your fear and the Convention ground of membership in a particular social group as a bisexual man. I find that the test under s. 96, whether there was serious possibility of persecution should you return to Kenya, is met.\nCredibility\n[7] I find that you were a credible witness and I, therefore, accept your testimony and the statements you\u2019ve made in your Basis of Claim. Your testimony was straightforward, very detailed, spontaneous, and mostly consistent with your Basis of Claim. I accept your explanation for the inconsistency in your testimony about the co-workers who saw you with another man in a party and outed you at work. I accept that you may have confused who said what at your two different workplaces. I accept that when asked about work, you focused on your later workplace and the co-worker who outed you there, as that was a more significant experience for you as you lost that job.\n[8] You were able to provide detailed and credible testimony about your relationship with your current same\u00ad sex partner, XXXX (ph), without any attempt to embellish. You were able to provide details about him and his life. You were able to provide details about your life as a bisexual man in Kenya, including the LGBTQ networks there and the negative experiences you had when you were outed at work.\n[9] I also accept your explanation for the delay in leaving Kenya, that you\u2019ve had a career there and you wanted to make it work. I accept your explanation for your delay in claiming, that you were originally planning to ask for permanent resident status on a spousal sponsorship before that relationship broke down and how you learned about refugee protection from your friend, XXXX (ph), just before you claimed. I note that you made a claim soon after learning of this option and within two months of separating from your former spouse.\n[10] You testified credibly about your fear should you return to Kenya, that you would be detained or harassed by police or even killed. I, therefore, find it credible that you face a serious possibility of persecution from the Kenyan State. You\u2019ve also provided several documents in support of your claim, including several detailed letters of support from your friends, former same-sex partner, XXXX (ph), and family members in Kenya, and a letter from your current partner.\n[11] Since you have provided credible testimony as well as the corroborating documentation, I find that you have established on a balance of probability that you are bisexual. Accordingly, I find that you have established a subjective fear of persecution on a balance of probabilities.\nObjective Basis\n[12] I find that your fear of persecution has an objective basis. Items 2.3 and 6.1 of the National Documentation Package for Kenya state that sexual acts between people of the same sex are illegal and may be punished with imprisonment of up to 14 years under the laws of Kenya. The penal code criminalizes carnal knowledge against the order of nature, which was interpreted to prohibit consensual same-sex sexual activity and specifies a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment if convicted. Item 2.1 further stipulates that a separate statute specifically criminalizes sex between men and specifies a maximum penalty of 21 years imprisonment if convicted.\n[13] The Freedom House report at Item 2.3 states that members of the LGBT community continue to face discrimination, abuse and violent attacks. The UN Committee of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights at Item 2.4 of the National Documentation Package has noted that lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex persons are stigmatized and socially excluded, as well as discriminated in gaining access to social services, particularly healthcare services.\n[14] Since I have found you have \u2014 you to have a subjective fear and an objective basis for that fear, I find that you have established that you have a well-founded fear of persecution.\nState Protection\n[15] I find that you have established that there\u2019s inadequate state protection available to you in Kenya as same-sex sexual acts are considered criminal and that the state authorities are the agents of persecution. I therefore find that you have provided clear and convincing evidence that the Kenyan state is unwilling and unable to provide adequate state protection.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[16] I have also considered whether there is a viable internal flight alternative available to you. I find that you face a serious possibility of persecution throughout the country given that same-sex relations are illegal.\n[17] Based on the totality of the evidence, I find that you have established a well-founded fear of persecution in Kenya because of your membership in a particular social group being a bisexual man. Accordingly, I find you are a Convention refugee.\n[18] Your claim is accepted. Thank you.\nCLAIMANT: Thank you so much.\nCOUNSEL: Thank you.\nMEMBER: All right, so that concludes our hearing for today and I will go off the record.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013\n\n",

The claims were heard jointly in accordance with Rule 55. The principal claimant was appointed designated representative for the minor claimants.\n[3] You claim to be citizens of Nigeria save your daughter XXXX, the minor claimant, who is claiming to be a citizen of the U.S. You\u2019re claiming refugee protection pursuant to Section 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[4] I find that all the claimants but the minor XXXX XXXX who is the U.S. citizen, are Convention refugees, as you have established that you face a serious possibility of persecution based on a Convention ground. For the principal claimant it is religion and for the associated minor claimants it is a particular social group as family members. With respect to your United States born daughter XXXX, however, there were no allegations raised with respect to persecution in the United States. I find that she is not a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection. The reasons are as follows.\n[5] The allegations of your claim can be found in the principal claimant\u2019s original and updated basis of claim forms in Exhibit 2 and 8. In summary, you, the principal claimant, allege persecution on the grounds of religion who as a Christian is unwilling to adhere to the traditionalist approaches of Ogboni Tubalasai (phonetic) cult which your family on your father\u2019s side has practiced for many generations. You as the eldest son were first persuaded and then threatened and attacked alongside your family members to take up the chieftaincy title and continue the family tradition. The associated minor claimants, save the youngest U.S. born one, fear your family and the Ogboni cult as well, as they were threatened and attacked along with you as your family members. Your daughter who has a U.S. citizenship will be safe in the United States as no allegations were raised against it.\n[6] I find that your identities as nationals of Nigeria and for the minor claimant XXXX as a citizen of the U.S. have been established on a balance of probabilities through your testimony and through the supporting documents found in Exhibit 1. I find no reason to doubt the authenticity of those documents.\n[7] In terms of your general credibility, the principal and associate claimant you both testified today, I have found you to be credible witnesses. There were no relevant inconsistencies in your testimony or contradictions between your testimony and the other evidence before me. I also find that there were no embellishments made within your testimony. All the minor inconsistencies were explained either by you or in the submissions by your counsel. Therefore, I accept what you have alleged in support of your claim, including the following.\n[8] The principal claimant you were born to a family of an Ogboni chief. The traditionalist religion was a part of your father\u2019s family for generations. Your mother and your siblings were not supporting the secretive traditionalist cult and you all were practicing Christianity. At his death bed back in 2013 your father confided in you and warned you against joining the Ogboni Tubalasai cult. You, the principal claimant, disobeyed the other Ogboni members and buried your father at your family\u2019s burial plot which made the Ogboni very angry. In addition, during the meeting following your father\u2019s death where you and your siblings were summoned you were given instructions on joining the cult to continue your father\u2019s work as a chief. You declined, and although you were threatened you were given a year to consider, prepare, and respond positively.\n[9] At the one year anniversary of your after\u2019s death you and your family returned to the village and (inaudible) the eiders of the Ogboni cult. You did not seeing their demands were still up but they met you with hostility and at night attacked you and your family at your father\u2019s house. They wanted to force you to swear the oath but you were saved by your friends. You left the village right away, travelled back to Lagos, and the following day went to report the attack to the police, who did not provide any protection as it was called a family issue. In addition, you had to seek medical attention for one of your children as he was injured during the attack.\n[10] During 2014-2017 the position was to be filled. You were threatened regularly as the position of the XXXX XXXX was to be filled only by you, the principal claimant. The Ogboni members were looking for you for all these years. They called you regularly. They threatened you regularly. They were able to locate you in XXXX 2017 as they came to your residence in Lagos and tried to persuade you to take up the chieftaincy. Because you refused you feared that you could be attacked again.\n[11] You took your family to your mother\u2019s house in Ogun State but you couldn\u2019t stay there long. For the safety of your wife and children you moved them to your wife\u2019s sister\u2019s house in Lagos where they stayed until you were ready to leave Nigeria. You left Nigeria in XXXX 2018 with your family and you stayed in the U.S. until XXXX XXXX2019, came to Canada in XXXX 2019 to claim asylum here.\n[12] In support of your claim you provided documents in Exhibits 6 through 11, including affidavits from your friends, mother, sister, your wife\u2019s sister, a letter from Ogboni chief which dates back to 2013, death certificates of your father and your elder brother, and other documents. I was notable to give some of these documents full weight as there were some issues on the face of the document, in particular the affidavits from your mother and your sister, which did not coincide with the information in the NDP, in particular Item 9.2. In his submissions your counsel spoke on the issues with the documents that I had. The counsel turned my attention to the cultural differences between Canada and Nigeria. In addition, he presented new evidence that apparently is not yet present in the NDP about the Nigerian Bar Association. In particular, he gave the decision of the Supreme Court of Nigeria from 2015 which says that not having the MBA does not necessarily invalidate the document.\n[13] Having considered all the facts and submissions of your counsel, I was able to give full weight to all the documents before me, as they corroborate your written and oral testimony. I find on a balance of probabilities that you are credible witnesses. I am therefore satisfied that you have established your subjective fear.\n[14] The overall objective evidence supports your claims for Convention refugee protection. The national documentation package for Nigeria November 30th 2020 found in Exhibit 3 and the country conditions evidence submitted by your counsel in particular in Exhibits 6, 7, and 8, the NDP characterizes the Ogboni cult as a secret society or secret cult or even a criminal organization. It operates predominately in the Yoruba communities in the southwest according to the NDP Item 1.3. Although it is considered to be in decline the organization still has the capacity to locate former members anywhere in the country. According to the NDP membership though is generally voluntarily but not always especially for individuals with a close history of or personal knowledge about the cult. This is Item 1.13. Revealing information on Ogboni rituals can put individuals\u2019 life at risk in the same item.\n[15] The principal claimant\u2019s experiences with the cult are consistent with this evidence. Although, principal claimant, you were nota member of the cult, I find that you were closely connected to the cult through your late father and that you knew enough about their rituals and they were seeking to make you a XXXX XXXX of the cult and you refused to become a chief and that put your life at risk.\n[16] In addition to this information in the NDP, you also submitted some articles to the RPD in Exhibit 6 about incidents involving the Ogboni cult in Lagos State in particular where Ogboni threatened and killed those who refused the ritual. In his submissions your counsel also pointed out to the same Exhibit 6 and turned my attention that there is evidence that Ogboni operates not only inside but outside Nigeria and they have presence all over Africa.\n[17] Overall the objective country condition evidence supports the conclusion that you the principal and the associate claimant and your children, save your daughter the U.S. citizen, have an objective basis for your claim.\n[18] In order to establish that you are Convention refugees you must also prove that you do not have state protection and you cannot be adequately protected by the Nigerian police if you return to Nigeria. Based on both your evidence and on the evidence in the NDP I find that you will not have adequate state protection in Nigeria.\n[19] Principal claimant, you stated in your narrative and in your testimony that you tried to turn to police for protection but you did not receive any. The police did not want to interfere into what they believed was a family matter. The NDP addresses this issue of police protection for people who refuse to participate in ritual practices, in particular Item 10.8. It states that although protection ought to be available according to the constitution of Nigeria and legislation these laws are not always implemented in practice and that people who refuse ritual practices cannot necessarily rely on police to protect them. Officers are often part of the committee practicing the traditions and sympathetic to those communities and bribes may be required to secure some level of protection.\n[20] Taking all of this evidence into account I find there is clear and convincing evidence before me that you the claimants would not have adequate state protection against your agents of persecution in Nigeria.\n[21] With regards to possible viable internal flight alternative in Nigeria, there is evidence, which I already quoted, in the NDP that if the Ogboni cult desires to and is able to locate people it targets them anywhere in Nigeria. Given the attacks and the threats that you the principal claimant have already faced in Nigeria I find that you and your family are a target of this cult.\n[22] You testified that anywhere you and your family relocate in Nigeria you will have to restart your business to provide financially for your family. For that purpose you will need to advertise, you will need social media, telephone. Given that Ogboni presence is evident in Nigeria they will be able to locate you through media, through advertising, on a balance of probabilities. I also find it is more likely than not that the Ogboni have access to mobile phones, to the internet, and they can use these tools to find people throughout the country.\n[23] Ali of these evidence and argument, including the NDP evidence about the cult, the articles submitted in Exhibit 6, the argument about the advertising, use of social media to locate people, and the NDP evidence about the prevalence of use of mobile phone in Nigeria as also submitted in Exhibit 6, leads me to conclude that you, the claimants, do not have an IFA in Nigeria and you face a serious possibility of persecution anywhere you go in Nigeria.\n[24] So having considered all of the evidence, I find there is a serious possibility that you, the principal and associate claimant, and your children, the minor claimants, would face persecution in Nigeria pursuant to Section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act so I find you to be Convention refugees. Your claims are therefore accepted.\n[25] As to your daughter XXXX XXXX the U.S. citizen and the minor claimant, her claim is denied for Section 96 and 97.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n",

The Claimant\u2019s allegations are set out in her Basis of Claim form.\n[2] In summary she is alleged to be a male born, Hong Kong transgendered woman who seeks protection in Canada on the basis of her transgender identity. The claim also touched on elements of political opposition within Hong Kong which was on file which I did not address in my hearing and does not form a part of these reasons.\n[3] At the outset I noted the application of the SOGI guidelines to this claim. I also took steps to ensure that the Claimant\u2019s transgender identity was respected to the best of my abilities.\n[4] I find, Ma\u2019am, that you are a \u201cConvention Refugee\u201d and my [inaudible]. First on the issue [inaudible] on a balance of probabilities from the documents on file your persona) identity both in terms of your birth identity, your transition as well as your citizenship I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that you maintain the status you do within Hong Kong.\n[5] You do not appear to have any permanent or citizenship status elsewhere including the United Kingdom. I find on this evidence that you have established your identity, your citizenship as well as your transition which was well documented on the file.\n[6] I find there to be a nexus of particular social group under Section 96.\n[7] I found you to be credible in your testimony as well as in the documentation. You testified in a straightforward manner. There were no relative inconsistencies or contradictions in your testimony.\n[8] As outlined at the beginning of the hearing my main issue in this case was the issue of discrimination and harassment stigma etc. rising to the level of persecution. There is documentary evidence as to the challenges faced by sexual and gender minorities in Hong Kong as well as the allegations outlined in your claim. My main concern \u2014 not concern.\n[9] My main legal issue to resolve and factual issue was, does the treatment in Hong Kong amount to persecution or is it harassment in society, discrimination in society. I find in your circumstances, particular circumstances that I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that, yes, it does and that you would face a serious possibility of persecution in a forward-looking capacity returning to Hong Kong.\n[10] You outlined some of your fears of returning to Hong Kong and you testified as to your fears. I find cumulatively the challenges you would face in Hong Kong would amount cumulatively to persecution. They are likely to be repetitive. If you were to return, they could potentially escalate so it\u2019s not simply one issue that you would face as a transgendered woman. It is the whole of what you have told me.\n[11] In particular I have found particularly compelling the issue of your marriage where you are married and your marriage would be at risk returning to Hong Kong on the basis of your transition which I find adds to that analysis I found compelling.\n[12] Your testimony as to denial of health; the potential denial of health care in Hong Kong which is not a Section 97 denial of shortcomings. It would be denial of health care applied in a persecutory manner based on your identity as a trans woman. It would also add to that persecutory element. Added to that you\u2019ve testified as to your fear of potential physical harm or mistreatment both from authorities and from society as a whole.\n[13] I find all of these factors taken together rise to the level of possible persecution. Rise to the level of categorizing your claim as persecution and on a balance of probabilities rise to the level of you facing a serious possibility of harm returning to Hong Kong based on your identity as a transgendered woman.\n[14] This is backed up by the extensive documentation you provided, both persona) and country docs as well as some of the evidence in the Hong Kong and in NDP.\n[15] Now on the issue of state protection, I find there would be inadequate state protection for you in Hong Kong as it is in part the authorities that you fear in that country. I also note that the country is in a state of flux at the moment given its situation of protests and its relationship with China which while not potentially directly relevant certainly adds to the analysis of the adequate state protection in that country at the moment.\n[16] Similarly, the issue of internal flight alternative I can point to a situation in Hong Kong, both geographically and in terms of the control of Hong Kong where you could relocate withing Hong Kong to seek safety within Hong Kong and therefore I find that you would not have a viable internal flight alternative there.\n[17] So, for all the above reasons, I find you to have a well-founded fear of persecution under Section 96. For these reasons I find you to be a \u201cConvention Refugee\u201d under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act I therefore accept your claim.\n[18] Congratulations and I wish you the very best of luck. Alright. Thank you all for your participation today. If there is nothing else, I wish you all a good afternoon. Stay safe and we are adjourned.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n",

The claimants are both citizens of India and are living together in Canada as a same-sex common law couple.\n[2] The claimants testified in a straightforward manner, without any contradictions or inconsistencies when their testimony is compared to the written narratives contained in their Basis of Claim (BOC) forms. There were also no implausibilities.\n[3] Most significant, however, was the demeanour of the claimants at this hearing. Both claimants exhibited their love for each other in a physical manner that was quite evidently spontaneous and genuine. Their displays of emotion during the hearing occurred at points in the evidence where it was reasonable to expect same and again these displays were transparently honest.\n[4] Such being the case, I have no hesitation in accepting the claimants\u2019 evidence as being most credible and trustworthy. They have provided, in their BOC narratives, quite a litany of difficulties that they experienced in India due to their sexual orientation, and I accept same as being the truth.\n[5] It is also worth noting that the claimants were able to submit various documents corroborating various aspects of their claim.1\n[6] The question before me, then, is whether or not, as a gay couple, the claimants face a serious possibility of persecution if returned to India.\nObjective Basis\n[7] The documentary evidence that is before me indicates the following:\nHuman rights issues included reports of arbitrary killings; forced disappearance; torture; rape in police custody; arbitrary arrest and detention \u2026 Violence and discrimination based on religious affiliation, sexual orientation, gender identity, and caste or tribe, including indigenous persons, also occurred.2\nLesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex (LGBTI) persons faced physical attacks, rape, and blackmail. LGBTI groups reported they faced widespread societal discrimination and violence \u2026 Some police committed crimes against LGBTI persons and used the threat of arrest to coerce victims not to report the incidents.3\nSame-sex orientation is seen socially, and within the close familial context, as being unacceptable in India. Circumstances for same-sex oriented males are improving, but progress is slow.4\n[8] The above documentary evidence would appear to indicate that a same-sex couple such as the claimants would indeed face more than a mere possibility of persecution if returned to India.\n[9] In September 2018, the Supreme Court of India struck down a provision that criminalized gay sex. Does this mean that now the claimants would not face a serious possibility of persecution if returned to India? The documentary evidence indicates the following:\nLGBT groups in cities across the country have been celebrating the ruling as the \u201cbeginning of a new era\u201d. But the reality for members of the LGBT community in rural India is different. They believe it will take a long time to change regressive attitudes towards them.5\nLGBT activists say that despite the Supreme Court decriminalising homosexuality in 2018, members of the community still face discrimination. Speaking to the New Indian Express, C Moulee, founder of Queer Chennai Chronicles, said, Every queer person faces harassment. Section 377 may have been struck down, but it remains a judgment. It has not changed people\u2019s mentality or out everyday lives.6\nStill, however historic the ruling of the court, considered a liberal counterweight to the conservative politics sweeping India, gay people here know that their landscape remains treacherous. Changing a law is one thing \u2013 changing deeply held mind-sets another \u2026 Many Indians are extremely socially conservative, going to great lengths to arrange marriages with the right families, of the right castes. Loved ones who try to rebel are often ostracized. Countless gays have been shunned by their parents and persecuted by society.7\nOn Thursday, conservative Christians, Muslims and Hindus, who often find themselves at odds with one another, blasted the ruling as shameful and vowed to fight it. \u201cWe are giving credibility and legitimacy to mentally sick people,\u201d said Swami Chakrapani, president of All India Hindu Mahasabha, a conservative group.8\nOn September 6, the Supreme Court decriminalized same-sex relations in a unanimous verdict. Activists welcomed the verdict but stated it was too early to determine how the verdict would translate into social acceptance, including safe and equal opportunities at workspaces and educational institutions.9\nIn September 2018, the Supreme Court ruled that the use of Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code to ban homosexual intercourse was unconstitutional. However, discrimination continues against LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender) individuals, including violence and harassment in some cases.10\nThe Indian press agency Press Trust of India (PTI) reported in April 2019 that the Supreme Court dismissed a review plea seeking various civil rights for the LGBTQ community: The plea had sought civil rights of the [LGBTQ] community as part of the basic human rights and said that these rights were not addressed in the apex court\u2019s judgement on Section 377 of the [penal code] which had criminalised consensual gay sex. It had sought recognition of their rights to same-sex marriages, adoption, surrogacy, IVF [in vitro fertilization] and directions so that the community can serve openly in the army, navy and air force. (PTI 16 Apr. 2019)11\nSince the decriminalization [of same-sex sexual relations], there has been a surge of pro\u00ad LGBT events and campaigns across India\u2026 Despite \u2026 small steps, there\u2019s \u201cstill a need for acceptance\u201d \u2026 \u201cMany people still have the mentality that homosexuality is wrong,\u201d\n\u2026. The change in law does mean \u201cmany lesbian and gay people are starting to disclose their sexuality to their parents \u2026 [b]ut there\u2019s a double standard. Some people will accept having LGBT friends but they won\u2019t accept their relatives who come out.12\n\u2026 activists stated that it was \u201ctoo early [after decriminalization of same-sex sexual relations] to determine how the verdict would translate into social acceptance, including safe and equal opportunities at workspaces and educational institutions\u201d (US 13 Mar.\n2019, 48). Similarly, Human Rights Watch states that \u201c[t]he decriminalization of same-sex conduct will not immediately result in full equality for LGBT people in India \u2026 13\nILGA\u2019s 2019 report indicates that there is no protection for sexual minorities in India, either in the constitution, in terms of broad protection, in employment, against hate crimes, or against incitement\u202614\nThe attitude and behavior of the police is one of the biggest barriers to queer persons\u2019 access to the justice system in India. Several people spoke to the ICJ about the violence, abuse and harassment they suffered at the hands of the police. Furthermore, in several cases, the police have refused to file complaints submitted by queer persons owing to bias or stereotypes\u2026 [q]ueer people\u2019s trust in the police is further eroded by the frequency of their negative interactions with police, for instance, when attempting to register complaints regarding violence and other crimes against them at the hands of private individuals. The police\u2019s refusal to file such complaints has a seriously detrimental impact on queer persons\u2019 access to justice and redress.15\n[10] The foregoing evidence makes it clear that, while the striking down of Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code is clearly a step in the right direction, much remains to be done. The ruling does not, of and by itself, change the attitude of large segments of the Indian population. Regressive attitudes, shunning, violence, and harassment persist notwithstanding this Supreme Court ruling.\n[11] I therefore find that it is premature to find that the repeal of Section 377 constitutes a durable change in conditions in India such that a same-sex couple such as the claimant would not face more than a mere possibility of persecution. It is simply too early to make that determination. I am guided by the following jurisprudence:\n[25] I have concluded that the Board erred in law by not applying the proper test for a consideration of changing country conditions. I have also concluded that the Board, in finding that the changes in circumstances were of an enduring nature, made a finding which it could not possibly have made based on the evidence before it. In other words, this finding was made without consideration of the material before it.\n[26] In so concluding, I have adopted as the proper test of changing country conditions the one proposed by James Hathaway in The Law of Refugee Status, Butterworths, Toronto, 1991, at pages 200-203. Hathaway writes as follows:\nFirst, the change must be of substantial political significance, in the sense that the power structure under which persecution was deemed a real possibility no longer exists. The collapse of the persecutory regime, coupled with the holding of genuinely free and democratic elections, the assumption of power by a government committed to human rights, and a guarantee of fair treatment for enemies of the predecessor regime by way of amnesty or otherwise, is the appropriate indicator of a meaningful change of circumstances. It would, in contrast, be premature to consider cessation simply because relative calm has been restored in a country still governed by an oppressive political structure. Similarly, the mere fact that a democratic and safe local or regional government has been established is insufficient insofar as the national government still poses a risk to the refugee.\nSecondly, there must be reason to believe that the substantial political change is truly effective. Because, as noted in a dissenting opinion in Ruiz Angel Jesus Gonzales, \u201c\u2026there is often a long distance between the pledging and the doing\u2026\u201d, it ought not to be assumed that formal change will necessarily be immediately effective:\n\u2026 there were free elections [in Uruguay] on March 1, 1985 that put an end to 12 years of military government. According to [the U.S. Country Reports], the reestablishment of democracy is complete. I may be permitted to express doubts that in a period of one or two years it would be possible to recover completely from the abuses of a military dictatorship. Good intentions may have existed, of course, but I refuse to believe that there were no chance mishaps.\nThe formal political shift must be implemented in fact, and result in a genuine ability and willingness to protect the refugee. Cessation is not warranted where, for example, de facto executive authority remains in the hands of the former oppressors:\nThe facts that there were \u201cabove board\u201d elections in Peru in 1980-81, which sent members of various parties and factions to the parliament, does not prove that the applicant does not have a well-founded fear of returning to his country, which is still, as far as executive authority is concerned, a military dictatorship which tolerates no opposition. It is just another case of old wine in new bottles.\nNor can it be said that there has truly been a fundamental change of circumstances where the police or military establishments have yet fully to comply with the dictates of democracy and respect for human rights:\nIt was argued that the applicant need no longer be afraid of returning to his homeland as there has been a change in the government since he left. The applicant, however, adduced evidence to show that although the government has changed, members of the Peruvian police and armed forces are still violating human rights and as yet do not appear to be under control by the new government.\nIn other words, the refugee\u2019s right to protection ought not to be compromised simply because progress is being made toward real respect for human rights, even where international scrutiny of that transition is possible. Two mid-1989 judgments of the Immigration and Refugee Board, relating to Poland and Sri Lanka respectively, demonstrate an appropriate concern to see evidence of the real impact of a formal transition of power:\n\u2026Solidarity calculates that the Communist Party directly or indirectly controls about 900,000 appointments\u2026the nomenklatura casts its own shadow. In other words, changing the government does not [necessarily] change much. The panel is of the view that the claimant\u2019s fear that the changes in Poland are still too uncertain is supported by the documentary evidence.\nAlthough it is alleged that the scale of military confrontation between the Indian Peacekeeping Force and the Tigers has diminished in recent months, there is still an intense rivalry between the Tamil militant groups for the control of the territory and the population. We agree with the points made by counsel, that the normalization process has not yet achieved political stability and peace for Sri Lanka.\nThird, the change of circumstances must be shown to be durable. Cessation is not a decision to be taken lightly on the basis of transitory shifts in the political landscape, but should rather be reserved for situations in which there is reason to believe that the positive conversion of the power structure is likely to last. This condition is in keeping with the forward-looking nature of the refugee definition, and avoids the disruption of protection in circumstances where safety may be only a momentary aberration.16 [emphasis added]\n[12] In view of all of the foregoing, I find that there is a failure of state protection in India for a same-sex couple such as the claimants,17 that they do face a serious possibility of persecution if returned to India, and that there is not viable internal flight alternative available to them.\nSubjective Fear\n[13] It is almost foolhardy in a refugee case, where there is no general issue as to credibility, to make the assertion that the claimants had no subjective element in their fear.18\nCONCLUSION\n[14] In consideration of the foregoing, I find that XXXX XXXX XXXXand XXXX XXXX XXXX are Convention refugees and their claims are accepted.\n(signed) Jack Davis\n1 Exhibits 5, 6, 7; and Exhibit 8, pp. 1 to 34.\n2 Exhibit 3, National Documentation Package: India, 31 May 2019, item 2.1, \u201cCountry Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2018\u201d, United States Department of State, 13 March 2019, Executive Summary.\n3 Ibid., section 6.\n4 Ibid., item 6.6, \u201cIndia: Sexual Orientation and Gender Expression\u201d, United Kingdom Home Office, October 2018, paragraph 2.4.14.\n5 Exhibit 4, \u201cWhat it Means to be Gay in Rural India\u201d, BBC, 6 September 2018, p. 8.\n6 Ibid., \u201cNot My Fault I Was Born Gay: 19-Year-Old Commits Suicide Over Homophobia\u201d, India Today, 9 July 2019, p. 15.\n7 Exhibit 4, \u201cIndia Gay Sex Ban is Struck Down. \u2018Indefensible\u2019, Court Says\u201d, The New York Times, 6 September 2018, p. 18.\n8 Ibid., p. 19.\n9 Exhibit 3, National Documentation Package: India, 31 May 2019, item 2.1, \u201cCountry Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2018\u201d, United States Department of State, 13 March 2019, section 6.\n10 Ibid., item 2.6, \u201cFreedom in the World 2019\u201d, Freedom House, 2019, section F4\n11 Ibid., item 6.1, Response to Information Request IND106287, 9 May 2019, section 1.1.\n12 Ibid., section 2.1.\n13 Exhibit 3, section 2.1.\n14 Ibid., section 3.1.\n15 Ibid., section 3.2.\n16 Mahmoud v.

The claimant is claiming refugee protection pursuant to Sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. I\u2019ve considered the testimony and the other evidence in this case and I am ready to render a decision orally.\n[2] I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee as defined under Section 96 of the Act and I accept the claim. The allegations are set out in the Basis of Claim form. In summary the claimant was targeted by the AGC, the Black Eagles, and the Revolutionary Forces of the People, as a result of his work for XXXX XXXX, an organization focused upon promoting the rights of LGBT persons in Columbia.\n[3] The Nexus is political opinion as expressed through his work as a XXXX XXXX XXXX for the LGBT community and membership in a particular social group, as a gay man XXXX as XXXX XXXX.\n[4] The claimant on a balance of probabilities has established his identity through testimony and submission of his Columbian passport and other identity documents.\n[5] Based upon the claimants\u2019 credible testimony and as substantiated by the documents submitted into evidence, I accept the following facts. The claimant was employed by the XXXX XXXX XXXX from 2010 to 2018. During his time with the organization, the claimant was responsible among other duties for the investigation of human rights abuses against LGBT persons and the collection and publication of related data. In XXXX 2017, the organization published and publicly presented a report which highlighted abuses of LGBT persons in education, employment, society, and by public officials. Shortly after publication of the report the claimant began to receive threats of harm by phone and text from various para-military groups.\n[6] Death threats were also received at the XXXX XXXX offices. The written threats included reference to social cleansing of clients\u2019 of XXXX XXXX but also those who worked for and supported them. The organization was unable to provide any protection to its employees or its clients\u2019 and took the position that such threats had always been a known possibility. The claimant reported the threats received at the offices of XXXX XXXX and the threats he personally received by phone and by text to both the ombudsman\u2019s office and the prosecutor\u2019s office seeking protection. Reports were taken but no protection was ordered. The claimant went into hiding at a friends home and disconnected his cell phone. However, his family continued to receive threatening calls at the claimant\u2019s home number. The claimant fled Columbia in XXXX of 2018.\n[7] The objective country documents are consistent with the claimant\u2019 s evidence. At Tab 1.7 the NDP speaks to the high-risk profiles of social leaders and human rights defenders. At Tab 2.9 of the NDP, the documents indicate a constant level of violence against social leaders and the human rights activists, perpetrated by the Bacrim. Based upon the claimant\u2019s personal circumstances and the objective evidence I find that the claimant has established on a balance of probabilities a well-founded fear of persecution.\n[8] With regard to state protection the claimant reported the threats to government authorities but was not granted protection. The claimant\u2019s evidence is consistent with the objective country reports at Tab 7.3, which indicate that the claimant does not fit the profile of those eligible for protection. At Tab 7.23 the NDP indicates that protection measures for victims are very limited and the measures in place do not yet meet the needs on the ground. Further, at Tab 2.6 the reports indicate that the political culture views human rights defenders as obstacles rather than guarantees for the rule of law in a democratic system with correspondingly high levels of impunity in Columbia, related to aggressions against human rights defenders. Reporting an impunity rate close to 90% in cases of a tax, a tax against defenders.\n[9] Based on the claimant\u2019s personal circumstances and the objective country documentations, I find that the claimant has rebutted the presumption of state protection with clear and convincing evidence. Adequate state protection is not available to the claimant.\n[10] With respect to internal flight alternative, on a balance of probabilities I find that there is no viable internal flight alternative that would be safe for the claimant. The claimant was responsible for investigation of cases of abuse against LGBT persons and for assisting those same people when they proceeded with legal action against the perpetrators of the abuse. Those accused of the abuse include both police and criminal groups. The publication of data regarding this persecution on a balance of probabilities, led to the threats against the claimant and would remain a motivating factor for the armed groups to seek out the claimant.\n[11] The principal claimant has been declared a military objective. The country conditions indicate at Tab 7.2 that the, sorry, at 7.21 the country conditions indicate that when a person is declared a military objective it means that their life, physical integrity, and freedom are endangered, and that this threat also extends to their family. Essentially being declared a military objective is being issued a threat to be killed.\n[12] The claimant has been targeted due to his XXXX XXXX work and the country conditions are consistent with the claimants\u2019 evidence that XXXX activists are at risk throughout the country. At Tab 2.2 the report indicate that XXXX XXXX defenders continue to be one of the main victims of the ongoing armed conflict. At Tab 2.9 the reports indicate that there are historically high levels of impunity in Columbia related to aggressions against XXXX XXXX defenders and this has been one of the structural causes for the repetition of these serious crimes, and again the reports indicate an impunity rate of 90% in cases of attacks against defenders.\n[13] Lastly, the claimant identifies as a gay man XXXX with XXXX XXXX. The objective country reports indicate instances of police violence against LGBT persons, societal abuse and discrimination, and further that criminal groups target homosexual and transgender individuals. Well the claimant has not been open\nabout his sexuality in Columbia, he would face further risk were his personal circumstances to come to light in Columbia.\n[14] Considering the claimant\u2019s XXXX XXXX work, his profile as a gay man XXXX with XXXX XXXX XXXX and the objective country conditions, I find that there is no viable internal flight alternative that would be safe as the claimant faces a risk of persecution in all parts of the country.\n[15] Based on the totality of the evidence, I find the claimant to be a Convention refugee and I accept the claim.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n",

I\u2019ve considered your testimony and the other evidence in the case and I\u2019m ready to render my decision orally.\n[2] I find that you are a Convention refugee on the grounds of your membership in a particular social group as civil society activist, specially a member of Sexual Minority\u2019s Uganda SMUG, pursuant to s. 96 of the IRPA. The details of your claim are set out in your Basis of Claim form and are supplemented by your testimony at today\u2019s hearing.\n[3] In summary, you fear persecution in Uganda at the hands of the Ugandan government, state authorities and broader community due to your work as a XXXX XXXX XXXX for SMUG. You also allege that there is no state protection or internal flight alternative available to you in Uganda.\n[4] Your country of reference and personal identity as a citizen of Uganda has been established on a balance of probabilities by your testimony and the following supporting document filed in Exhibit 1, namely a certified true copy of your Ugandan passport that was submitted to the Minister.\n[5] I find that there\u2019s a nexus between what you fear in Uganda and one of the five grounds enumerated in s. 96 of the IRPA, that is your membership in a particular social group, civil society activist, specifically an activist for Sexual Minorities in Uganda. Therefore, your claim is assessed under s. 96 of the IRPA and there is no need to conduct as. 97(1) analysis.\n[6] In terms of your general credibility, I found you to be a credible witness with regard to the material issues in your claim. There were no significant inconsistencies or omissions between your BOC, testimony and the other evidence before me.\n[7] Okay. You testified today that you were raised in a religious protestant environment and as a teenager, you heard your church leader speaking negatively about members of the gay community. You did not agree with their perspectives and stated that, \u201cWe are all human beings no matter our different beliefs\u201d. When you were old enough, you left you childhood church and joined a church that was a place of worship and did not speak negatively about the LGBT, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender community.\n[8] At your church, you met a man named WK who you befriended. After some time, WK revealed his sexual orientation to you as a gay man and told you about his involvement in a gay rights organization called SMUG. You joined SMUG as a straight ally and participated in discussions about how you could assist the LGBT community in Uganda.\n[9] I asked you to tell me about that in greater detail. You testified that creating a safe network for the LGBT community was one strategy you helped SMUG work on. You explained that because being gay is illegal in Uganda, gay people need to be able to talk to trusted people who can help connect them with other trusted members of their network. You helped assist with this strategy.\n[10] You also testified about you and SMUG members focused on trying to change societal perceptions of the gay community by encouraging participation of gay members in local communities, gaining the trust of people and civic organizations and then slowly their diverse SOGIE to individuals who have grown to accept them as human beings.\n[11] You testified credibly and with knowledge about SMUG\u2019s activities and your involvement in them. You also submitted a supported document from a safety and protection officer at SMUG in support of your claim. This letter contains SMUG\u2019s contact information and logo in its letterhead. It describes your involvement in SMUG and the persecution you faced because of that involvement. I find this letter to be credible.\n[12] You testified that members of SMUG have been targeted for their advocacy in the past, including a XXXX for the organization named XXXX XXXX (ph) who was murdered in 2011. You also mentioned receiving threats because of your involvement in SMUG. After attending a meeting at the XXXX Hotel, you started receiving threatening phone calls and text messages warning you to stop your association with the LGBT community. You were also approached near your home by a man, who identified himself as XXXX XXXX XXXX, claiming to be a father of a colleague of yours from SMUG. When you asked your SMUG colleagues if any of them knew XXXX XXXX XXXX, they said they did not. XXXX XXXX XXXX threatened to kill you \u201cfor spoiling his son\u201d and promoting homosexuality. These details are confirmed by the SMUG letter that I mentioned earlier that can be found in Exhibit 6 of the consolidated list of documents.\n[13] I, therefore, find on a balance of probabilities that you are involved as a straight ally in a gay rights organization in Uganda, called Sexual Minorities Uganda, and that you were threatened because of this affiliation. I also find on a balance of probabilities that you fear persecution because of your involvement with SMUG.\n[14] While I have credibility concerns about other parts of your evidence, those concerns did not outweigh the allegations that were proven on a balance of probabilities. Given that you have credibly made out key allegations and established a subjective fear of persecution, the other concerns that I had are not determinative. I, therefore, find on a balance of probabilities that you have a subjective fear of persecution in Uganda because of your civil society activism, particularly your membership in SMUG.\n[15] As a result, and it\u2019s mentioned previously, this claim is being assessed under s. 96 of the IRPA and I find that you have established a nexus to a Convention ground, namely your membership in a particular social group, civil society activist for Sexual Minorities in Uganda.\n[16] In addition, to your credible testimony and the other evidence before me today, the objective evidence in this case supports your claim. Same sex acts are criminalized in Uganda. Section 145 of Ugandan Penal Code Act criminalizes, \u201cCarnal knowledge against the order of nature\u201d, the sentence is life imprisonment. NDP Item 6.1 explains that this section of the penal code is often used to prosecute men for same sex activities and also criminalizes activities in support of sexual minority rights.\n[17] NDP Item 2.9 reinforces that advocating on behalf of the LGBT community in Uganda is considered, \u201cPromoting or committing a hate crime \u2014 or, pardon me, a crime\u201d. Gay rights activists face a myriad of threats, physical, verbal, digital and are under constant surveillance. Instances of documented threats and violence against gay rights activists include NDP Item 2.9 in Bunamwaya July of 2018, a staff member of a human rights organization for transgender people was attacked outside of his office. In December of 2010, as you\u2019ve mentioned, David Keto, a gay rights activist who was outed as a gay man in a Kampala (ph) tabloid was murdered.\n[18] NDP Item 6.1 provides examples of SMUG activities being unlawfully detained and tortured by Ugandan state authorities because of their work. This is the organization that you worked for. The NDP states, \u201cIn July of 2008, an activist with the organization Sexual Minorities Uganda alleged that police tortured and humiliated him during an illegal detention.\u201d In 2009, SMUG reported further police harassment of its members. Two activists, FW and BM were arrested on April 5th, 2019 and charged with, \u201cHomosexual conduct\u201d on April 17th of that year. The men were remanded to Maluke (ph) prison, where they were detained for several weeks until released on bail.\n[19] NDP Item 2.9 discusses the effect of this targeting on gay rights advocates in Uganda. The NDP states that with offices broken into and people assaulted, this causes an environment of fear and uneasiness that can affect human rights defenders\u2019 mental health, provide them anxiety, depression, feelings of isolation and post-traumatic stress disorder. NDP Item 4.4 states that the human rights awareness and promotion forum, a group that promote minority rights in Uganda, suffered its second break-in on February 9th of 2018. Overall, 30 non-governmental organizations have had their offices broken into since 2012. NDP 4.6 details other types of government attacks on gay rights activists. For example, on April of 2014, the LGBT community in Uganda was reportedly targeted by Zeuz (ph) Malware, a spyware often used to steal banking information through techniques including keystroke logging and form grabbing. Human rights defenders routinely report theft of servers and other computer material and hacking of websites.\n[20] In summary, the National Documentation Package cites numerous acts and threats of physical and cyber violence against gay rights activists in Uganda. I, therefore, find on a balance of probabilities that your subjective fear of persecution on account of your political activism with SMUG in Uganda has an objective basis and is well-founded. I am satisfied that you face a serious possibility of persecution if you were to return to Uganda.\n[21] While states are presumed to be capable of protecting their nationals, it is open to a claimant to rebut the presumption of protection with clear and convincing evidence. In this case, one of the agents of persecution is the state because of board facing persecution that you would face in Uganda is at the hands of state authorities, given that your conduct is considered to be promoting a crime. Under personal circumstances as well as the objective country documentation, I find on a balance of probabilities that you have rebutted the presumption of state protection with clear and convincing evidence, and that there is no state protection available to you.\n[22] Given that the state is the agent of persecution and there is no objective evidence that shows the state does not have control over the entire country of Uganda, I find on a balance of probabilities that you would face a serious possibility of persecution throughout Uganda, and therefore, a viable internal flight alternative does not exist for you.\n[23] Having considered your testimony, the documentary evidence presented and the objective evidence before me, I find that there is a serious possibility persecution in Uganda at the hands of the Uganda government and its security forces, as well as the broader Ugandan community if you return there. For the aforementioned reasons, I conclude that you are a Convention refugee pursuant to s. 96 of the IRPA and I accept your claim.\n[24] So, XXXX XXXX XXXX, that concludes my decision and that concludes today\u2019s hearing. Thank you for your participation in your hearing today, and thank you to Counsel for your assistance, and I wish you all the best. Stay healthy.\nCLAIMANT: Thank you so much, Madam Member.\nCOUNSEL: Thank you.\nMEMBER: My pleasure, be well.\nCOUNSEL: Thanks.\nMEMBER: Bye, bye.\nCOUNSEL: Bye, bye.\nCLAIMANT: Bye.\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n\n",

I\u2019m going to render my decision orally right now. When you do get the transcript of these reasons they will not be edited for spelling, syntax, and grammar, but I want to reassure you that I have considered and taken into my findings all the applicable case law, the documentary evidence, and all the other references that were before me.\n[2] The claimants XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and minor claimant XXXX XXXX XXXX, you claim \u2026 the principal claimant claims to be a citizen of Nigeria and the minor claimant is a citizen of the United States, and they are both claiming refugee protection pursuant to Sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[3] I have appointed you as the designated representative to the minor claimant XXXX XXXX XXXX, and your claims have been joined under Rule 50 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act regulations.\n[4] This is going to be a split decision. In deciding your claims I have considered the guidelines on women refugee claimants fearing gender related persecution and this is my determination.\n[5] I am first going to deal with the minor claimant. After considering all the evidence before me I find that the minor claimant, although she has \u2026 she has established that she is a US citizen, I find that she\u2019s neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection. No evidence was put forward on behalf of the minor claimant with regards to persecution in United States.\n[6] I do find that identity of the minor claimant has been established based on the principal claimant\u2019s testimony. The minor claimant has a US passport, as well as a birth certificate. She also has a Nigerian passport based on her parent\u2019s citizenship. However, I do find that since she\u2019s also a citizen of United States and no claim was advanced with regard to the claimant against the US, I \u2026 that \u2026 that would suggest that as a citizen of the US she would not be able to obtain State protection in the US.\n[7] I do find that her claim has failed, that she\u2019s neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection, and therefore her claim is denied. However, this is my second determination.\n[8] I find that the principal claimant is a Convention refugee based on her membership in a particular social group. I do find that there\u2019s an intersection between two grounds. One is a membership in a particular social group as a family member of \u2026 of a child who is XXXX, and I also find that there is an intersection of the principal claimant\u2019s immutable being as \u2026 as a woman and therefore I find that there is a gender aspect. She is a mother and a woman who\u2019s deemed to be responsible, either as a XXXX, which is based on her gender, for her child having \u2026 having been XXXX with XXXX.\n[9] As far as the analysis of this case is concerned, as I stated previously, as far as identity\u2019s concerned I find that the principal claimant has established that she is a citizen of Nigeria based on her testimony and her passport, and the minor claimant is a citizen of Nigeria as well as United States.\n[10] Credibility is an issue in every claim. I found that the claimant was \u2026 the principal claimant was credible witness with regards to what she has alleged in support of her claim with regards to her daughter.\n[11] And I want to just go a little bit with regards to the allegations of this claim. The allegations were set out in three Basis of Claim Forms about the fear of the claimant on being persecuted by her in-laws because of her mother-in-law dying in 2016, in XXXX 2016. However, I have taken into consideration that her fear materialized at that point for being perceived as a XXXX, responsible for the death of her mother-in-law, but however, that was almost four and a half years ago. A lot has happened since then.\n[12] And I\u2019ve looked at the documentary evidence provided and I find that this is basically a sur place claim in that the claimant\u2019s daughter, although assessed in the United States in 2017 with developmental delay, was not diagnosed with XXXXandXXXX XXXX until 2019, when the claimants were in Canada.\n[13] I\u2019ve looked at \u2026 I have found the claimant\u2019s oral testimony with regards to how she would be treated if she is to return presently to Nigeria to be credible, as well as the objective documentary evidence concerning the perception of the persecutors for a woman, a mother of an XXXX child. The minor claimant is only XXXX years old and she would be returning to Nigeria with her mother, although she\u2019s American citizen.\n[14] I have looked at the past behaviour of the claimant\u2019s in-laws as agents of persecution with regards to what they believed, what they call ju-ju or cultural milieu of a woman blamed for misfortunes falling on a family, and I do find that, on a balance of probability, she would be persecuted based on the recent diagnosis of XXXX for the minor claimant in Canada.\n[15] As I stated, as far as credibility is concerned, I find that the fear for the claimant basically materialized once she was in Canada with regards to the diagnosis of XXXX for her child.\n[16] The claimant fears her in-laws, society, community, and the discrimination that she fears in \u2026 my finding will cumulate to persecution. Taking into account the objective documentary evidence of those who are \u2026 who have XXXX or parents of XXXX children are treated in Nigeria.\n[17] I have vast amount of documentary evidence. The fear is forward-looking and therefore I do find that there\u2019s a reasonable chance of persecution of the principal claimant as a mother of an XXXX child if she\u2019s to return to Nigeria presently.\n[18] I just wanted to put into the record some of the objective documentary evidence that was provided to me in Exhibit Number 8, for example, with regards to exorcisms as a common treatment for those who have XXXX. Mothers are blamed for their children\u2019s XXXX in Nigeria.\n[19] Persons with XXXX and disabilities are perceived as possessed and evil. And although minor claimant is an American citizen and not at risk if her mother is deemed to be the person who\u2019s responsible for XXXX XXXX the principal claimant also would be at risk.\n[20] XXXX is deemed, as I stated, seems to be connected to witchcraft and diabolic activities. There\u2019s a \u2026 there is a fear of social stigma also for the principal claimant and her daughter. The extended family whose in Nigeria also would be part of the agents of persecution.\n[21] As stated in the documentary evidence, in Nigeria there is a lot of mysticism around disabilities and people who don\u2019t often know what to attribute to the disability of a child and the Nigerian culture.\n[22] I \u2026 I have some documentary evidence with regards to the Yoruba culture. Blames diseases and disabilities, like XXXX XXXX often to mothers and on witchcraft and spirits and hereditary causes or just bad parenting, as stated in the basis of \u2026 objective documentary evidence.\n[23] There\u2019s also a lack of community and family support and social support, and as I stated, shame and stigma with regards to those who are deemed to be parents of XXXX children.\n[24] I do have documentary evidence that those who are deemed to be possessed are sometimes killed, tied up, and generally mistreated very badly in Nigeria.\n[25] As far as State protection is concerned, there\u2019s ample documentary evidence with regards to the police corruption in Nigeria.\n[26] Recently in the news there has been reports of protest against SARS which is a special Nigerian police force department. There\u2019s also ample documentary evidence with regards to lack of protection for those who are fleeing anything to do with family problems.\n[27] Furthermore, the claimant\u2019s in-laws are well-known politicians. They are well connected with the police, and there are \u2026 therefore I find that there\u2019s inadequate State protection available to the claimants, specifically in this particular case to the principal claimant for someone who\u2019s deemed to be a XXXX or responsible for her daughter\u2019s XXXX.\n[28] As far as internal flight alternative is concerned, I\u2019ve taken into consideration the two-prong test given tome by the Federal Court of Appeal. I have also taken into account the gender guidelines. I find that the first prong that the reach and means and the influence of the extended in-law\u2019s family is very wide.\n[29] They do have the motivation. They seem to be steeped in cultural background of belief of mysticism.\n[30] And I do find that the documentary evidence provided with regards to the agent of persecution, there were some media reports with regards to the principal claimant\u2019s in-laws being very influential and holding high office in Nigeria. And as I stated, the State protection is extremely inadequate presently in \u2026 in Nigeria.\n[31] There\u2019s also the issue of whether it\u2019s reasonable during pandemic for the claimants to go and live in a different place, the second prong of the IFA. I\u2019ve taken into consideration again particular circumstances of the principal claimant of being a mother of an XXXX child. There is a lack of programs for the minor claimant.\n[32] Again, I do note it is a fictional, legal fictional programs for the minor claimants. Again, I do note it is a fictional, legal fictional premises that we have the minor claimant would not be going back with her mother. She\u2019s XXXX years old. Obviously, she would not be going back to the United States. She would going with her mother.\n[33] And an XXXX child with absolutely no programs available to her in Port Harcourt, as well as the principal claimant who has been getting XXXXand XXXX assistance in Canada. I do not find that there would be any \u2026 anything like that available to her in Port Harcourt. She would living as a single mother since her husband would continue to live in Lagos, so that her in-laws would not be able to find her.\n[34] There\u2019s stigma. There\u2019s a lack of opportunities for employment for single mothers, and presently since the fear is forward-looking, I find that there\u2019s no viable or reasonable internal flight alternative available to the principal claimant.\n[35] Therefore, based on the foregoing analysis, I find that the principal claimant is a Convention refugee and I reject the minor claimant\u2019s claim with regards to United States. Thank you.\nCOUNSEL: Thank you so much, Madam Member. Well, appreciated. Thank you.\nMEMBER: Thank you.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n",

The purpose of the Guideline is to promote greater understanding.\nINTERPRETER: That is actually way to fast.\nMEMBER: Oh yes, sorry, sorry and it\u2019s ok if-, XXXX you understand there has- I have to read in about you know five minutes of-, she understands ok. I just want to let you know, so I am accepting you.\nINTERPRETER: Thank you.\n[3] In deciding this claim the Panel considered Guideline 9. The purpose of the Chairperson\u2019 s Guideline 9 is to promote greater understanding of cases involving sexual orientation and gender identity and expression, and the harm individuals may face due to their non-conformity with socially accepted SOGIE norms. This Guideline addresses the particular challenges individuals with diverse SOGIE may face in presenting their cases before the Board and the Panel was mindful of these issues in coming to a decision in this claim. The Panel has also considered the psychiatrist and related reports provided by the claimant in Exhibit 4.\nALLEGATIONS\n[4] The claimants allegations are contained in her Basis of Claim form. The claimant alleges a fear of persecution at the hands of Hungarian government and authorities because of her sexual orientation and gender identity as a transgender woman.\nDETERMINATION\n[5] The Panel finds that the claimant has established a serious possibility of persecution because of her membership in a particular social group, arising from her sexual orientation and as a gender woman-, a transgender woman and is therefore a Convention refugee pursuant to Section 96 of IRPA.\nIDENTITY\n[6] The claimant\u2019s identity as a national of Hungary is established by her testimony and the certified true copy of her Hungarian passport in Exhibit 1.\nCREDIBILITY\n[7] Overall, the Panel finds that the claimant was a credible witness on what is core to her claim, her sexual orientation and gender identity. The Panel believes what the claimant alleged in support her claim. The claimant testified in straightforward manner and there were no relevant inconsistencies in her testimony, the oral or written testimony, or contradictions. Her testimony about her experiences as a transgender was spontaneous in detail. The Panel finds on a balance of pro-, probabilities the following, one first, at an early age she identified as a female and preferred female clothing. In her teenage years she was attracted to males and endured bullying and homophobic slurs from her classmates. Second, about 2000 around age XXXX, she created a profile on a couple of dated websites, carefully identifying herself as-\nINTERPRETER: Your still too fast, I\u2019m sorry.\nMEMBER: Oh yes, sorry.\nINTERPRETER: In Hungarian you know we have a lot of words like that, sorry I would like to ask you to (inaudible).\nMEMBER: Ok, yeah, yeah absolutely.\nCOUNSEL: Would you be able to summarize instead, like I think usually \u2026\nINTERPRETER: Summarize? Sure.\nCOUNSEL: Because we\u2019ll have the written version of this-, the, of the written \u2026\nMEMBER: Yeah, you can get the transcript.\nINTERPRETER: So, I\u2019ll just try to do my best.\nMEMBER: Ok yeah that\u2019s-, yeah. So, speaking to the transcription we\u2019ll resume now and some of it is just background, ok.\nSo, about the year 2000 at age XXXX, she created a profile on a couple of dating websites carefully identifying herself as female. She gradually communicated with and met with other individuals identifying as cross dressers. Three, there is widespread hostility in Hungary towards sexual minorities and this has made it difficult and dangerous for members of the LGBTIQ+ community to have same-sex relationships. Four, due to the homophobic and transphobic attitudes common in Hungarian society the claimant kept her sexuality and gender identity a secret as much as possible.\n[8] The claimant described multiple inc-, incidents of homophobic and transphobic violence ranging from verbal abuse, threats, and harassment to severe physical attacks which the Panel finds credible. When the claimant moved to XXXX, UK for work and then returned, the Panel finds that her failure to perhaps have claimed refugee protection in UK does not detract from subjective fear or credibility with respect to her claim against Hungary. Back in her hometown of XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, she described a beating into unconsciousness by an old high school tormentor and several more beatings after that. The claimant testified that these, that the Hungary police officers were homophobic and might even make the situation of trying to stay in the closet more hostile for her, so there was no point filing reports with the police. The Panel finds this reasonable based on the objective country evidence described below. The claimant decided to move to Toronto, Canada, she arrived in XXXX 2014. She did not claim refugee protection until 2017 because she still did not feel comfortable disclosing her sexual orientation and gender identity. But at the end of2016 at a restaurant in Toronto, she noticed a cross dressing man working openly and safely as a server, so she finally connected with the LGBTQ community and 519 Community Centre and was referred to a lawyer.\n[9] The claim is well documented with evidence of the claimants allegations including her social media posts. The Panel does not draw a negative inference from the claimants delay in claiming in Canada. The Panel is satisfied on balance of probabilities that the claimant is a transgender woman attracted to men and that she has a subjective fear of persecution because of her sexual orientation and gender identity if she returns to Hungary.\n[10] So just a few things on the objective basis, the Panel finds that the claimant subjective fear of persecution has an objective basis based on the documentary evidence and is therefore well-founded. The documentary evidence on country conditions indicates that Hungary is a seriously dangerous place for a lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans or queer persons despite improvements on a legislative front after around 2012. According to the H\u00e1tt\u00e9r Support Society for LGBTQI persons in Hungary, the protection that is offered to LGBTQI persons remains only on paper and laws prohibiting hate crimes against such persons are seldom enforced.\n[11] The US State Department of 2018 indicates that, despite legal protections right wing extremists continue to abuse the LGBT community. Law enforcement and other authorities often disregard the hate element of these crimes when no protocol or regular training on this subject existed. I\u2019ve noted in particular the Response to Information Request HUN 106337 dated July 30th 2019 and titled Treatment of Sexual and Gender Minorities, including legislations, state protection and support services. This document indicates that Hungarian authorities do not provide adequate protection to LGBT persons suffering serious human rights abuses of whatever nature in Hungary because of the Hungar-, because the Hungarian government and police tend to share and support the deep-seated homophobia found in Hungarian society as a whole. And these documents indicate that rather than protect Hungary-, rather than protect, Hungarian police and authorities persecute LGBT persons, and there\u2019s a lot more there.\n[12] In the particular circumstances of this case therefore, the Panel finds that it would be objectively unreasonable for the claimant to seek protection of the Hungarian State. The Panel finds on a balance of probabilities that the claimant has rebutted the presumption of state protection with clear and convincing evidence. The Panel also finds that the objective evidence establishes the authorities operate similarly throughout Hungary as the same homophobic, transphobic attitudes are evidenced-, evident throughout. And the claimant faces a serious possibility of persecution throughout Hungary because of her sexual orientation and gender identity. Therefore, a viable internal flight alternatives are not available to the claimant.\n[13] Based on the forgoing analysis, the Panel concludes that the claimant is a Convention refugee and her claim is accepted.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n",

XXXX) XXXX XXXX (the claimant), who is a citizen of Mexico, is seeking refugee protection, pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).1\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] The claimant\u2019s allegations are set out fully in her amended Basis of Claim Form (BOC).2 The claimant fears persecution from her family and society generally as a result of her sexual orientation and gender identity. The claimant alleges that she has been verbally, emotionally, and sexually abused by members of her family, and others, during her adolescence and adulthood, in both Mexico and United States (US). The claimant also alleges that she suffered discrimination and violence due to her sexual orientation and gender identity. She further fears harm at the hands of her older brother, who is a violent criminal.\nDETERMINATION\n[3] The panel finds that the claimant would face a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground upon return to Mexico.\nISSUES\nNexus\n[4] The claimant alleges that the persecution she faces is due to her membership in a particular social group in Mexico, namely transgender women. The panel accepts that gender identity is a particular social group and has, therefore, assessed this claim against section 96 of the IRPA.\nIdentity\n[5] The claimant\u2019s identity as a citizen of Mexico is established, on a balance of probabilities, as per her passport.3\nCredibility\n[6] In considering credibility, the panel is aware of the difficulties that may be faced by the claimant in establishing a claim, namely, the setting of the hearing room, and the stress inherent in responding to questions. The panel has also considered the contents of the medical report.\n[7] Most importantly the panel has considered and applied Guideline 9: Proceedings Before the IRB Involving Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression (SOGIE Guidelines),4 and in this regard it has carefully examined the claimant\u2019s oral testimony in line with the factors to be considered when applying this guideline. The panel examined the challenges faced by this particular claimant.\n[8] Although the claimant was not deemed to be a vulnerable person in the absence of medical evidence, the panel made accommodations. Counsel questioned the claimant, and the panel stressed to the claimant that whatever breaks were required, would be granted. In fact, this did occur when the claimant\u2019s demeanour was such that two breaks were immediately suggested by the panel.\n[9] The panel considered the factors of mistrust or fear of repercussion by state and non-state actors. More importantly, the panel accepts that the claimant was reluctant to discuss her change in gender identity and therefore, this late information, is not called into question as per the panel\u2019s analysis below.\n[10] The panel was also cognizant of the claimant\u2019s XXXX health issues, adding to the marginalization factor. The claimant\u2019s history of social isolation, mistreatment, and lack of social support and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX were considered in terms of the manner in which the claimant testified. The Clinical XXXX Health Assessment submitted was considered; in particular the XXXXof XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and the significant impact on the claimant\u2019s experience of emotional and physical violence as a result of her gender identity.5\n[11] Since submitting her initial BOC, the claimant has provided new documentation in which she indicates that she has begun identifying openly as a woman.6 She asked that the panel consider her name to be XXXX, and refer to her by the pronouns she and her. The details of why her initial BOC did not reflect this information are described in detail, but in essence, the claimant has had difficulty in expressing her true feelings to counsel until she met with her current counsel in preparation for her hearing. The panel has provided more specific detail in this regard, relating to the SOGIE Guidelines.\n[12] The claimant testified that she could not come forward in terms of her gender identity in the US, as she was undocumented and had no support. Even in Canada, according to the claimant, she had trust issues. As enunciated above, the panel accepted the fact that initially the claimant did not disclose her gender identity until the late disclosure with new counsel. She testified that she has considered herself a woman for the past twelve years and has changed her name on Facebook to XXXX.7\n[13] She further testified as to why she had re-availed, and as stated above, the panel accepts this as not being determinative of the claim, as there were serious family issues at this time.\n[14] She further testified with respect to her reluctance to divulge her female identity with most individuals. More importantly, she explained why she had not taken any steps to express her female identity in the US, due to her lack of documentation and her lack of family support at the time; her father now knows. She elaborated on this that even in Canada, there are trust issues, along with lack of support.\n[15] Although delay and re-availment were identified at the hearing along with other issues, in keeping with the SOGIE Guidelines, the panel does not find that these issues detract from the claimant\u2019s credibility. In totality, the panel was satisfied that the claimant\u2019s testimony was credible and that she has identified as a female for 12 years. The panel accepts that the claimant is a transgender woman and that she has a subjective fear of persecution in Mexico.\n[16] Moreover, her testimony was corroborated by copious amounts of corroborative evidence, including the late disclosures, anticipating a resumption. These late disclosures included:\nA letter from her friend, SS.A copy of her Facebook page in which her name is indicated as XXXX XXXX, not XXXX.A certificate from a XXXX Health Counsellor.8The claimant\u2019s BOC has been amended to reflect her gender identity. This evidence was preceded by letters from former partners, photographs, a letter from 519, BOC amendments, a letter corroborating her relationship with XXXX in the U.S, a legal opinion to apply for asylum in the U.S., photographs, and a clinical report indicating that the claimant suffers from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.9A letter from the Toronto Western Family Health Team dated XXXX XXXX XXXX 2020, indicating a referral to the Gender Identity Clinic.10[17] The panel acknowledges that much of the above disclosures were submitted on the day of the hearing, in fact, during lunch prior to the afternoon hearing. However, the panel had the opportunity to analyze the claimant\u2019s testimony, in conjunction with further study of this new evidence, coupled with the objective evidence before rendering its decision.\n[18] The panel received a motion for recusal subsequent to the hearing,11 which was refused. The panel notes that there was some confusion caused by the late disclosure, and by the panel having received materials at the last minute. However, as noted above, the panel has had the opportunity to consider all the disclosure carefully after the hearing in accordance with the SOGIE Guidelines. For these reasons, the panel finds that a reasonable, fully-informed person, thinking the matter through, would conclude that it is more likely than not that the decision\u00ad maker in this case would act fairly in the circumstances.\nObjective basis\n[19] Transgender women in Mexico still face pervasive persecution based on their identity gender identity and expression. It notes the following:\nIndeed, violence against LGBT people has actually increased, with transgender women bearing the brunt of this escalation. Changes in the laws have made the LGBT communities more visible to the public and more vulnerable to homophobic and transphobic violence. Increased visibility has actually increased public misperceptions and false stereotypes about the gay and transgender communities. This has produced fears about these communities, such as that being gay or transgender is \u201ccontagious\u201d or that all transgender individuals are HIV positive. These fears have in turn led to hate crimes and murders of LGBT people, particularly women.\n[\u2026]\nTransgender women continue to face beatings, rape, police harassment, torture and murder in Mexico.12\n[20] It is reasonable to conclude from a review of the country conditions that while there has been some improvement in terms of attitudes towards LGBTQ issues, there is still a long way to go, particularly for persons with the claimant\u2019s profile.\n[21] While unprecedented political and legal gains have been made in Mexico, the social environment in most of Mexico remains repressive, and often dangerous. Machista ideals of manly appearance and behavior contribute to extreme prejudices against sexual minorities, and often to violence against them.\n[22] Moreover, as the claimant testified, she is fearful of the police. This is also supported in the documentary evidence. In this regard, the panel has considered the personal circumstances of this claimant which includes her age and health status, along with her history which is well\u00ad documented. The panel further accepts that in the particular circumstances of this claimant, it may be unreasonable for her to approach the state for protection, keeping in mind that the state protection must be adequate at the operational level.\n[23] Furthermore, issues such as employment, secure housing, access to medical treatment as well as treatment related to the transition process must be considered, along with mental health issues and equal access to social services:\nVulnerable communities, including transgender women, are often victims of drug cartel and gang violence. Transgender women fall victim to cartel kidnappings, extortions, and human trafficking. One transgender woman described how cartel members forced her into sex work in Merida. Another transgender woman was targeted for rape and robbery while traveling by bus. In another case, a transgender woman named Joahana in Cancun was tortured to death by drug traffickers who carved a letter \u201cZ\u201d for the Zeta cartel into her body. If a cartel targets a transgender woman, it is nearly impossible to escape the cartel\u2019s power. An immigration attorney in the U.S. described in an interview how his transgender female client unknowingly dated a cartel member. After doing so, she could not escape persecution from the cartel.13\n[24] A recent Response to Information Request further notes that:\nAmnesty International (AI) indicates that enforced disappearances, including those committed by state and non-state actors, are \u201cwidespread\u201d \u2026\n[\u2026]\nThe U.S. Country Reports 2016 indicates that the investigation, prosecution and sentencing for disappearance-related crimes \u201cremained rare\u201d\u2026 AI characterizes the investigation of disappearances as \u201cflawed and unduly delayed,\u201d with authorities failing to immediately search for victims\u2026 14 [footnotes omitted]\n[25] The documentation indicates that antidiscrimination laws do not prohibit discrimination on the basis of gender identity. The lack of protection leaves transgender women especially vulnerable to employment discrimination. Transgender women, in Mexico often lack access to gender health care and are generally denied the ability to change their name and\/or gender on ID documents to match their gender presentation. It is indicated that:\nIt should be noted that transgender people cannot simply \u201chide\u201d who they are and thereby escape persecution by living in accordance with their birth-assigned gender role. Gender dysphoria is a serious condition, recognized by every major medical association, the only treatment for which is to live in accordance with the gender with which they identify, rather than the gender assigned at birth. Attempting to suppress one\u2019s gender identity can have dire health consequences. Moreover, a person\u2019s gender identity is a fundamental component of identity, which cannot be required to be changed or hidden as a condition of protection under asylum laws.\nAs noted, only Mexico City permits transgender people to legally change their name and gender to correspond to their gender identity. Even where such mechanisms are technically available, however, legal name changes are not accessible in practice for many transgender women. This is in part due to \u201clengthy delays and high costs-at least six months and approximately 70,000 pesos\u2026 are required, and completion sometimes depend[s] on the \u2018good will\u2019 of some civil servants.\u201d\u2026\n[\u2026]\nTransgender women lack adequate health care in Mexico. Many transgender women resist seeking medical help because they must disclose their transgender status and subsequently face hostility and threats of violence from medical providers. Medical care providers often do not want to provide medical attention to transgender patients. Providers have mocked and humiliated transgender patients using offensive language, threats, aggression, and hostility. Consequently, transgender women do not routinely access preventive or emergency care.\nIn particular, medical care to support gender transition-such as hormones or surgeries-is almost entirely unavailable to most transgender women in Mexico. While medical authorities uniformly recognize the medical necessity of transition related treatment, such care is not covered under Mexico\u2019s national health plan and licensed providers (for those who can afford to pay out of pocket) are scarce. Even where it is available, such care can be prohibitively expensive for transgender women already suffering the effects of economic marginalization discussed earlier. Without access to gender-affirming medical care, many transgender women permanently damage their skin and muscles by injecting dangerous black-market feminizing liquid silicone or other fillers.15\n[26] Further documentation notes that:\nThe May 2016 report of the Cornell Law School LGBT Clinic and the Transgender Law Center also specifies that there are \u201cno federal laws that explicitly protect transgender individuals from discrimination on the basis of their gender identity (i.e., their transgender status) as opposed to sexual orientation\u201d\u2026\n[\u2026]\nIn a short overview of, among others, hate crime legislation in different countries, the same report indicates, however, that in Mexico there is no such legislation. The report, in contradiction to the above cited explanation, states that the federal law neither criminalises hate speech nor hate crimes. The report in this context mentions article 149 Ter of the Federal Criminal Code of Mexico which refers to discrimination\u2026\n[\u2026]\nIn its query response about the situation and treatment of sexual minorities, particularly in Mexico City, Cancun, Guadalajara, and Acapulco of August 2015, the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (IRB) writes:\n\u201cA report on crimes against transgendered women sent to the Research Directorate by a representative at the Support Centre for Transgender Identities\u2026 , an NGO that advocates for the rights of transgendered women in Mexico\u2026 , indicates that transgendered women are discriminated against by the police and judicial authorities \u2026 The representative from Colectivo Le\u00f3n Gay, A.C. indicated that LGBT persons are [translation] \u2018frequently\u2019 harassed and arbitrarily detained due to their physical appearance, the way they dress, or for expressing affection in public\u2026 The representative also indicated that they are barred from assembling in public because they are seen as \u2018engaging in prostitution or giving a \u2018bad example\u2019 or \u2018bad image\u2019 to society\u2019 \u2026 16 [footnotes omitted]\n[27] In light of the cited documentary evidence regarding similarly situated persons in Mexico who did not receive adequate state protection, there is sufficient evidence before this panel to conclude that, despite efforts made by the state, at this time, the state is not able to offer adequate protection to transgender individuals like the claimant. Accordingly, the panel finds that there exists clear and convincing proof that state protection is not available to transgender individuals like the claimant in Mexico. The panel, therefore, finds that the claimant has rebutted the presumption of state protection and has established that her fear is objectively well-founded since the harm she fears cumulatively amounts to persecution.\n[28] With respect to an internal flight alternative (IFA), it is clear from the documentary evidence that societal prejudices against transgender persons are found all over Mexico, including Mexico City. There is blatant disregard for the safety as well as the wellbeing of transgender individuals like the claimant. Homicides and assaults against these groups continue under a backdrop of religious and cultural tolerance and moral condemnation. Based on the evidence adduced, the panel finds that there is no viable IFA for transsexual\/transgender persons in Mexico City, or for that matter any part of Mexico.\n[29] Based on the totality of the evidence adduced, the panel finds that there is a serious possibility, based on her evidence, that she would be persecuted due to her gender identity should she return to Mexico.\nCONCLUSION\n[30] Accordingly, the panel accepts the claimant as a Convention refugee.\n(signed) Roslyn Ahara\nMarch 11, 2020\n1 The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c.27, as amended, sections 96 and 97(1).\n2 Exhibit 2, Basis of Claim Form (BOC).\n3 Exhibit 1, Package of Information from the Referring CBSA\/CIC, Certified True Copy of Passport.\n4 Guideline 9: Proceedings Before the IRB Involving Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression, Guidelines issued by the Chairperson pursuant to paragraph 159(l)(h) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, Effective date: May 1, 2017.\n5 Exhibit 4, Personal Disclosure #1, at pp. 28-34.\n6 Ibid., BOC Addendum.\n7 Exhibit 6, Personal Disclosure #3, at pp. 3-5.\n8 Ibid., at pp. 1-6.\n9 Exhibit 4, Personal Disclosure #1.\n10 Exhibit 8, Personal Disclosure #4, at p. 1.\n11 Exhibit 7, Recusal Application.\n12 Exhibit 3, National Documentation Package (NDP) for Mexico (August 30, 2019), item 6.3.\n13 Ibid.\n14 Ibid., item 7.18.\n15 Ibid., item 6.3.\n16 Ibid., item 6.1.\n\n",

You allege that you fear that you will be harmed or killed due to your identity as a transgender woman in Morocco, but you also mention your sexual orientation as being pansexual, and I\u2019ve also considered this as part of your claim.\n[6] So, in terms of your identity, your personal and national identities as a citizen of Morocco are established on a balance of probabilities by your testimony but also by your documentary evidence that you have on file, and in particular, a copy of your Moroccan passport.\n[7] I had to analyze your credibility and whether I (audio cuts out) what you told me today, whether I believed what was in your narrative and in your supporting documents, and I found you to be very credible.\n[8] You spoke about your experiences in Morocco, about your experiences coming out to friends that you had in Morocco in person, but also to a community of people that you met online. And you talked about your experiences also coming out to your family and how that was more of a negative experience than coming out to your friends.\n[9] And when you spoke about your reason for choosing your name, the name that you now use to refer to yourself, I found that very compelling. You gave an explanation of why you chose your first name and your last name and the importance that it held for you and how you felt since using that name.\n[10] You also talked about your experience in Ottawa when you first came here and how you suffered from XXXXandXXXX XXXX and how this led you to seek help, to seek help from the healthcare system, and how you have been following hormone therapy and you have been moving towards a transaction, and how your feelings before this were very negative and that now you feel much more comfortable in your body. And there was something in your narrative that really stuck out for me as well. You wrote in your narrative that now strangers refer to you as female and that that has \u2014 that makes you feel very good inside. So, I found that very compelling and very moving, too.\n[11] I found that there were no contradictions or omissions or inconsistencies in your testimony. You gave very detailed responses and you testified spontaneously.\n[12] You also (audio cuts out) documents to support your story. So, you submitted a letter from your doctor, the doctor that you referred to today who prescribed you the medication that you are taking, the hormone therapy. You provided a letter from your partner, XXXX (ph), who has also acted as your support person today. You also provided a copy of your joint lease for your apartment with XXXX, your partner, and other roommates here in Ottawa. And then finally, you included a number of photographs, and these are photographs of yourself before your transition, photographs of yourself now, and photographs with your partner, XXXX, as well.\n[13] So, given your credible testimony and the documents that you have submitted and the fact that your testimony was consistent with your narrative and your port of entry forms, I find that on a balance of probabilities you have established the truth in your allegations and I believe what you have said today and in your narrative.\n[14] So, I just have to talk about the objective evidence. So, we have a National Documentation Package for Morocco and there is a section that is dedicated specifically to LGBT issues, or we call them SOGIE issues, sexual orientation, gender identity, (audio cuts out) expression issues. So, I find that this documentary evidence on the situation for LGBT persons in Morocco is very clear. The most stark point is the legislation against being a member of the LGBT community.\n[15] So, the Moroccan government deems lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender orientation or identity to be illegal. And this is document 6.1 in the NDP that I\u2019m referring to right now. It also mentions that society does not look kindly upon gay and lesbian relationships, considering them to be prohibited by Islam. And this echoes, of course, what you were saying about your relationship with religion and the way that LGBT community is perceived in Morocco. The same report talks about social violence, harassment, and blackmail based on sexual orientation or gender identity, and it also says that, specifically to the gender identity, people who feel that they belong to a gender other than their official gender do not openly discuss their situation for fear of being banished by society.\n[16] The next report in the package is 6.2. It talks about the family response to someone coming out as having a sexual orientation or gender identity that is kind of outside of the norm. They mention mob attacks, forced heterosexual marriage, confinement or eviction from family homes, psychological abuse. And the same report even mentions that even the authorities in Morocco are known to intimidate LGBTI activists. And it also says that there\u2019s a general social hostility and this is legitimized by public officials and by the rhetoric that is anti-LGBTQ and also pervasive kind of negative medica coverage on those issues.\n[17] More specifically to transgender people, the same report indicates that they are viewed as being mentally ill and that there is a complete lack of legal gender recognition and that this restricts their access to services, so things like healthcare services and stuff like that.\n[18] There is even \u2014 there is a quote in that report that I found particularly striking and it quotes the Human Rights Minister in Morocco in 2017 as saying that (as said), \u201cIn Morocco, we have to stop talking about homosexuals because we give them value when we talk about them.\u201d And then he said, \u201cThey are trash.\u201d So, even coming from the government there is this anti-LGBT rhetoric, and of course, because issues concerning LGBT activities are considered illegal, that is not terrible surprising.\n[19] This report also mentions that there is a national human rights council in Morocco but that it does not address LGBTQ issues. And even more so, Morocco in Human Rights Council meetings of the UN, Morocco has voted against the adaption of resolutions that support LGBTQ issues and rights.\n[20] So, based on all of that information, I find the country condition evidence is overwhelming regarding LGBTQ persons in Morocco. And so, I find that on a balance of probabilities there is an objective basis for your fear in Morocco for that reason.\n[21] So, I had to look at two other things.\n[22] The first is state protection. So, I have to look at whether the authorities could protect you in Morocco. And given the items in the package that mention authorities\u2019 attitudes towards LGBTQ persons and the fact LGBTQ activity is considered illegal, I find that the authorities are an agent of persecution in your case and therefore that on a balance of probabilities adequate state protection would not be available to you if you were to return to Morocco.\n[23] Finally, I also have to consider whether you could go to another part of your country and be safe there. So, that\u2019s called internal flight alternative. Again, because \u2014 I find \u2014 because the laws that prohibit LGBTQ activity are enforced throughout Morocco and the information to me is clear that these attitudes are pervasive throughout the country, this leads me to conclude that there is nowhere that you could be safe in Morocco. So, you have a serious possibility of persecution throughout the country and therefore there is no internal flight alternative available to you.\n[24] So, to conclude, based on all of this evidence, I find that you would face a serious possibility of persecution on the basis of your particular social group as a transgender woman and as a pansexual person if you were to return to Morocco. So therefore, I find that you are a Convention refugee, and I am accepting your refugee claim under s. 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[25] COUNSEL: Thanks very much.\n[26] MEMBER: So, I just want to say thank you to XXXX XXXX XXXX. I \u2014 I really appreciate your willingness to do this in a virtual way in particular given the difficulties that we\u2019re facing this year in 2020. So, thank you for that. Thank you for your testimony as well. I know it\u2019s not an easy thing to do, to -\u00ad especially to talk about these kinds of sensitive issues with a stranger, so I really appreciate that very much.\n[27] I want to say thank you to your partner, XXXX, as well for being support today this morning.\n[28] And thank you, Counsel, as well for your support.\n[29] COUNSEL: Thank you.\n[30] MEMBER: So, just one last thing to \u2014 to let you know is that if you change your mailing address, if you decide to move, just let the Board know, just keep your address updated because the decision I just read out to you, you will receive a written copy of that decision in the mail and we don\u2019t want you to miss that.\n[31] So, congratulations and I wish you all the best. Take good care of yourself.\n[32] COUNSEL: Thanks very much.\n[33] MEMBER: Thank you.

I would like to note that the claimant\u2019s identity documents indicate that she is male and the name on the passport submitted as evidence is \u201cXXXX XXXX XXXX\u201d. The claimant is now transitioning to a woman and therefore identifies as a woman and would now like to be addressed as XXXX, though she has not gone through any formal name changes yet. The claimant\u2019s file number is MB9-12276. At the hearing, and in rendering this decision, I have considered and applied both the Chairperson\u2019s guidelines four, women refugee claimants fearing gender-related persecution, and Chairperson\u2019s guidelines nine, proceedings before the IRB involving sexual orientation and gender identity and expression. I have considered your testimony and the other evidence in the case, and I am ready to render my decision orally. I would like to add that when written reasons are issued, they may be edited for spelling, syntax, and grammar. You are a citizen of Mexico and you are claiming refugee protection pursuant to Sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nDETERMINATION\n[2] I find that you are a \u201cConvention refugee\u201d based on your gender as a transgender woman.\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] You allege the following. In your\u2026 In your original Basis of Claim form, or your\u2026 or your BOC, you stated that you fear serious harm or death at the hands of cartels, because at least three of your family members have been kidnapped for ransom in Mexico, as you hail from a well-to-do family. In your amended Basis of Claim form, you stated that you have now come out as a woman and that you fear returning to Mexico with your new identity as a woman, because of the horrible discrimination that the LGBTQ+ people face.\nANALYSIS\nIDENTITY\n[4] Your personal identity and nationality as a citizen of Mexico has been established on a balance of probabilities by a certified true copy of your valid Mexican passport.\nCREDIBILITY\n[5] I find you to be generally credible Madam. You testified in a straightforward, open and detailed manner. For example, you described how since you were eight years old you felt like you were in the wrong body. That you enjoyed playing with dolls and other girls, and at first you thought you were gay, but then you realized that you were jealous of other girls because you wanted to be born a girl. You provided a compelling testimony about how you came out to your mother recently, and she didn\u2019t accept that you wanted to transition. You said that she called you repetitively since then, and talked to you for hours trying to change your mind. You said that she told you that no matter what, you would always be her son. I also note that you asked me not to tell your father about your transition as he initially was supposed to testify as a witness regarding the targeting of your relatives by cartels in Mexico. You said that you haven\u2019t spoken to him yet about your transition and you fear his reaction if he finds out today about it. You also went into significant detail about how it hurts you when people address you as \u201cSir\u201d or \u201cMonsieur\u201d. You gave the example about how earlier today you approached a stranger for help with something, and this person referred to you immediately as \u201cSir\u201d. You testify that you accept that no matter what you will never be fully accepted by society, excuse me, society, even if you don\u2019t wear makeup or dress like a woman. You also went into detail about how you sought support from an organisation in Montreal called Action Sant\u00e9 Transves \u2026 Transvestite and Transsexuel du Qu\u00e9bec, who have whole heartedly encouraged you to go through hormone therapy and to come to terms with your gender identity. I would also like to note that indeed, today, in front of me, you are dressed as a woman, in a squirt, and you are wearing makeup.\n[6] There were no significant inconsistencies, omissions or incompatible behaviours that were not reasonably explained. Of course, I would like to address why you omitted from your first Basis of Claim form that you identify as a woman. Your initial Basis of Claim form was signed on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2019, and you testified that you have only started hormone therapy in XXXX 2019, which is corroborated by your doctor\u2019s note labelled P-2. You said that you were initially even afraid of talking about your transition to your lawyer, worried that she might not want to retain you and represent you as a transgender woman. Given that indeed you submitted an amendment signed on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2019, which is shortly after you started the medical transition, we do not draw a negative inference in regards\u2026 I do not draw a negative inference in regards to your credibility for this omission, as it is reasonable that you only included it in your narrative after you actually started the treatment.\n[7] I also asked you about your failure to claim refuge in the U.S.A. Given that you knew at a young age that you wanted to become a woman and that Mexicans are hostile towards transgender women, you said that you only transitioned recently, so your fear of Mexican society at large has become real and apparent only now. You said that you started your transition in XXXX 2019, as noted earlier, and given that indeed you only commenced XXXX recently, and given that you had a valid Visitor Visa until XXXX 2022 according to your U.S. Visa in your expired Mexican passport, labelled document seven, I find your explanation reasonable and I do not find your failure to apply for asylum in the U.S.A. to be incompatible behaviour with someone fleeing persecution.\n[8] In support of your claim, you provided the following documents. A letter from the non\u00ad profit that you approach to support you, labelled P-2. A letter from your doctor regarding your hormone therapy, which was noted earlier, labelled P-3. And, documents from your pharmacist regarding the drugs you are taking, labelled P-4. I therefore find the following to be credible. You sought the help of a non-profit that supports transgender people in XXXX 2019. You started hormone treatment in XXXX 2019, and that you identify as a woman and you want to be called XXXX from now on and addressed with the pronouns associated with women, such as \u201cshe\u201d and \u201cher\u201d\nNEXUS\n[9] I find that there is a nexus with your fear and one of the five Convention grounds, which is gender. Therefore, your claim is assessed under Section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nPERSECUTION\n[10] The objective documentation supports your allegations that individuals in your circumstance face persecution or death in Mexico. According to the Transgender Law Center of Cornell Law School LGBT Clinic, in tab 6.3 of the National Documentation Package, transgender women regularly experience harassment and hate crimes at the hands of members of the public. The following are only a few examples of the many atrocities that transgender women have experienced in Mexico. A prosecutor in Chihuahua belittled a transgender woman who sought redress for abuse and violence she experienced, asking her \u201cSo, why are you not\u2026 So, why are you walking in the streets?\u201d In November 2011, in Chihuahua, a group of men kidnapped two transgender women in Hotel Carmen. Days later, the dismembered bodies of these women were found in a van. In June 2012 in Mexico City, the body of a transgender woman was dismembered. Her remains were found abandoned in different neighbourhoods in the Bonito Juares District. In June 2013, a police found the body of a transgender woman who headed a special unit for attention to members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transsexual, transgender, transsexual, and intersex community of the Attorney General of the Federal District. In July 2013, two attackers released pepper spray into a crowd of 500 at a beauty contest for transgender women.\n[11] Mexico has the second highest index of crimes motivated by transphobia behind Brazil. Reports of hate crimes, particularly transpho \u2026 transphobic murders, continue to rise including in Mexico City. Most hate crimes against the LGBT community go uninvestigated. In many instances, police dismiss investigations of homophobic and transphobic murders by cate\u2026 categorizing them as \u201ccrimes of passion\u201d. Indeed, it is estimated that almost 90% ofc rimes in Mexico go unreported. It follows then, that the actual number of transphobic murders in Mexico are likely much higher. Research conducted by the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada in 2019, at tab 6.2, reiterates this, that transgender individuals are regularly victims of violent hate crimes that often end in murder. It cites research that indicates the 66% of transgender women, 41% of transgender men, and 41% of intersex people who responded to the survey on LGBTQ+ discrimination regarding the rights to safety and to justice declare they were victims of physical assault. A Trans-respect Versus Transphobia Worldwide Project reported that in 2008 four transgender people were murdered in Mexico, while in 2017 the number was 65.\n[12] Tab 6.3 also states that transgender people have limited access to healthcare. A representative of Fundaci\u00f3n Trans Amor stated that there are very few cases in which a transgender person who has been denied healthcare has managed to carry out the applicable protocols such as successfully requesting a consultation with an Endocrinologist, a laboratory analysis, or obtaining a hormonal assessment, without proprieting \u2026 without providing further details. Sources reported cases of transgender and non-binary people having to stop hormonal treatment against their will or being denied access to gender confirmation medical treatment. The same document also states that transgender people also face a lot of discrimination in the workplace in Mexico. According to the Alliance for Diversity and Inclusion in the Workplace, transgender and non-binary people are less on average than lesbians, gay men, and bisexuals. According to another non-profit, 25% of transgender women respondents engage in sex work. The same source states\u2026 The same so\u2026 The same source, being the Executive Commission for Care of Victim\u2026 of Victims, states that almost all respondents who engaged in sex work were transgender, noting that this may be related to the lack of other employment options by the lack of acceptance. Given all these conditions, the cases of violence and murder of transgender women, the lack of access to medical care, and the lack of employment opportunities that leads transgender women to sex work, I find that the claimant established a subjective fear that is objectively well-founded.\nSTATE PROTECTION\n[13] I find that adequate State protection would not be available to you were you to seek it in Mexico. The objective documentary evidence in tab 6.4 indicates that police are sometimes complicit themselves in the violence that transgender people and sexual minorities face. The U.N. Special Rapporteur on extraju \u2026 extrajudicial or arbitrary executions noted that there is an alarming pattern of grotesque homicide of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender individuals, and the broad impunity for these crimes, sometimes with the suspected complicity of investigative authorities. The Executive Commission of Attention to Victims and the Fundaci\u00f3n Arcoiris report found that transwomen and homosexuals represent the group most affected by motivated physical assaults.\n[14] Furthermore, according to the U.S. Country Reports 2016, civil society groups claim police routinely subjected LGBTQ+ people to mistreatment while in custody. Even in Mexico City, where the Zona Rosa gay district is located, police harassment against LGBTQ+ members remains high. In 2016, a Federal Agency that supports those who have been victim of a federal crime or whose human rights have been violated, reported some forms of abuse by authorities, including delays in or refusal to provide services, violence and insults. In light of the objective documentary evidence, I find that you have rebutted the presumption of State protection, and that adequate State protection would not be available to you in Mexico.\nINTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE (IFA)\n[15] Considering your profile as a trans\u2026 as a transgender woman, the documentary evidence of uninvestigated murders of transgender women in Mexico, the rampant discrimination and violence that transgender women face, and the lack of State protection and the complicity of State officials in the violence transgender women go through, I find that it is unsafe for you to lo\u2026 to relocate anywhere in Mexico. I therefore find that there is no viable internal flight alternative for you anywhere in Mexico.\nCONCLUSION\n[16] Based on the totality of the evidence, I find that the claimant is a \u201cConvention refugee\u201d. Your claim XXXX XXXX XXXX is therefore accepted.\n\n",

XXXX XXXX XXXX under file MB9-04322 and I note for the record that the claimant\u2019s name in her passport is XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The claimant is a transgender woman and prefers to go by XXXX. So, that is how I identified her, but wanted to clarify that distinction. And you are claiming to be a citizen of Singapore and are claiming refugee protection pursuant to s. 96 and s. 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nAllegations\n[2] Your full allegations are set out in your basis of claim form and attached narrative. In brief, you fear the treatment you would receive in military detention due to your failure to report for mandatory military service. You also (inaudible) the treatment you would receive during the military service after your detention and your narrative briefly talks also about your fear in general of the treatment you would face by society at large as a transgender woman.\nDetermination\n[3] I find that you are a Convention refugee for the following reasons.\nIdentity\n[4] I find that you have established your personal identity and your nationality, on a balance of probabilities, through your documentary evidence \u2013 in particular, your Singaporean passport \u2013 as well through your credible testimony.\nNexus\n[5] I find that you have a nexus to the Convention as a member of a particular social group, specifically as a transgender woman fearing persecution due to your gender identity.\nCredibility\n[6] You testified in a spontaneous and forthcoming manner without any inconsistencies or omissions and I therefore accept as true what you have alleged here today and in your basis of claim form.\n[7] You credibly testified about your experience transitioning here in Canada and this was consistent with the story you provided in your basis of claim form. You talked about the depression you felt prior to your transition, your first time disclosing that you were transgender to a woman you were dating in high school, about talking with a counsellor and beginning hormone therapy for your transition and how this improved your mood, as well as about your family situation. And you supported this with documents, including two letters from XXXX XXXX XXXX (ph.) that discuss the medical treatments you have received as well as from your counsellor, XXXX XXXX (ph.), describing the improvement in your XXXX health throughout your transition. And both of these individuals speak to their fear of your worsening XXXX situation if you were to return to Singapore.\n[8] And based on your credible testimony, I find that you have a subjective fear of returning too Singapore.\nObjective Basis\n[9] Your most significant fear that you identified was the fear of the treatment you would receive if you were to return and were forced into detention for having failed to appear for the mandatory military service as required. And I find that this fear is supported in the documentary evidence.\n[10] And so, I turn first to the question of whether you would in fact be considered a deserter. And here, you submitted evidence, C-6, a document from XXXX XXXX XXXX (ph.), a Singaporean native who is a professor at XXXX XXXX in China, and he states \u2013 sorry, I jumped forward. The first question is whether you would in fact be required to engage in mandatory military service, which is required of all men in Singapore. And so, the letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX that I just began states that,\n\u201cSingapore legally recognises the sex change that post-op transgender individuals have gone through.\u201d\n[11] And so, then he writes that the treatment that you would likely face depends on whether you are classified as female or male, and that if you are still considered by the Singaporean government as male, you would continue to be obligated to enlist and serve your mandatory time in the military. And this is also supported by the quick response for information that I disclosed that was a research undertaken by the IRB. It cites a 2016 Guardian article from the United Kingdom that states that,\n\u201cA transgender woman who had not undergone reassignment surgery was expected to continue to participate in military service, although that those who had undergone reassignment were not.\u201d\n[12] And the same quite response includes a document from what I understand to be a Singaporean Transgender Support website. It\u2019s not an official documentation, but nonetheless evidence that states that in order to legally change your sex in Singapore, you have to get a medical examination report form, filled by a medical expert, that says that you have \u201ccompletely changed your genitalia from male to female or vice versa. And, again, not the most reliable of documents, but I found that was generally consistent with the rest of the information in the package regarding how Singaporean society and official institutions approach the issue of transgender individuals.\n[13] And in your case, you credibly testified and provided documentary evidence to state that you had started hormone therapy and transitioning socially, but that you have not had any gender affirmation surgery.\n[14] And so, I therefore do find that, on a balance of probabilities, you would legally be considered a man by the Singaporean military and would be forced to enlist.\n[15] And so, this now turns to the second question of whether you would likely face detention or jail time as a result of your failure to enlist. And a 2015 Response to Information Request at Tab 8.2 of the National Documentation Package references a 2012 statement by the Ministry of Defence that states that Ministry will \u201c\u2018press for \u2026 custodial sentence[s] on \u2026 defaulter[s]\u2019 based on the length of the default period\u2026\u201d And in this case, you would refer \u2013 meet the situation set in there as a shorter jail sentence for someone who has defaulted in a period in excess of two years but is young enough to serve your full operational service.\n[16] The same RIR is somewhat unclear on the total number of individuals who in fact do serve time. It references a number of deserters in the low hundreds, then references another news article that says only five individuals are facing it. It references a further one that states nineteen conscientious objectors, who are all Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, are in fact in jail for failing to doit.\n[17] I asked you about this document and you very credibly testified that your experience growing up in Singapore was that your sense is that individuals who did evade their service were in fact often prosecuted and were forced into jail times [sic]. I note that the same RIR references two specific cases where individuals were sentenced to jail time and successfully appealed and the Court overturned it and substituted a fine.\n[18] I note that XXXX XXXX XXXX letter at C-16, as well as some of the other documents, do suggest that the default rule would in fact be jail time served for failing to enlist.\n[19] And so, considering all of this evidence as a whole and that the Ministry of Defence itself has indicated that their approach is in fact to prosecute and push for jail time for those who have avoided enlisting for more than two years, a situation you find yourself in now, I find that there is a serious possibility that you would be forced to serve as a result of your failure to enlist as required.\n[20] And so, I now tum to the treatment that you fear you would receive if you were to serve (inaudible) and there is limited information based on the experience of transgender individuals in Singapore. In fact, the Quick Response contains no information on this, saying that it [sic] just could not find any information. And I note that a partial explanation for that is in the quick response itself that states \u2013 it cites an article that states that the Singaporean government does not keep official statistics on transgender people, which makes it hard to categorise precisely the harms that they face. And so, this is, to my understanding, a very clear reason why it\u2019 s hard to get specific information of this.\n[21] But your counsel put forward a number of harms that you specifically fear would happen if you were to go to prison and these include being forced to shave your hair, be referred to by your male name, be forced to wear male clothes, be refused the hormones you are currently being provided, a significant risk of harm to your psychological well-being, as well as a significant risk of mistreatment by fellow inmates as well as guards.\n[22] In support of the first three risks, your counsel pointed to XXXX XXXX XXXX letter as well as Document C-7, that XXXX XXXX XXXX refers to, titled \u201cLife in the Barracks: What You Can Expect,\u201d and this is from the Criminal Justice Club at the Faculty of Law at the National University of Singapore. Again, although not a perfect source, it is the best evidence I have available and it discusses exactly those harms that counsel alluded to as to the treatment that you would expect for failing to enlist, including having to shave your head, having to share a small cell with two other cisgender men.\n[23] In support of your XXXX well-being, I have the letters from XXXX XXXX XXXX and your counsellor that discuss the extremely harmful effect the situation would have as well as I have your own credible testimony about how you feel that such a situation would affect you if you were forced to shave your head, if you were force to spend time in the situation.\n[24] And regarding the mistreatment from fellow inmates, you have submitted documents from the US at C-8, from the UK at C-9, and from Australia at C-12, that all discuss the situation of transgender individuals and, more specifically, often transgender women in prison. And these documents all discuss the very high risk of physical and sexual violence that transgender women face in prison from fellow inmates as well as from the guards. And, I\u2019ve noted, there is no evidence of this directly in the documentary evidence for the Quick Response.\n[25] And I now refer to the report by Ben Lee Yee (ph.), Invisible, Yet Visible. In the Quick Response, it states that there are no official statistics on transgender people. That makes collecting the data on the situation of trans individuals very difficult. And I appreciate there is a significant cultural difference between generally Western societies and Singapore. Nonetheless, I find these articles highly persuasive in terms of what the situation could reasonably be expected to be.\n[26] And furthermore, the risk of mistreatment is supported by the pervasive negative attitudes in Singapore towards LGBT individuals. And in support of this is C-14, a letter from Professor Yu (ph.), which references a recent report that states that only 11 per cent of Singaporeans approve of same-sex relationships, and this is a significant increase from an earlier report, but still a very low number.\n[27] As well as the claimant\u2019s document at C-12, a 2012 report regarding LGBTQ individuals in Singapore \u2013 and it notes \u2013 that report consistently finds that trans women, of all LGBTQ individuals, faced the highest incidence of harassment and discrimination against an already marginalised group.\n[28] And so, considering all of these documents together, the specific standard rules that you would be forced to follow, the documentary evidence that Singapore is a very by-the-book and rules oriented society that very rarely is able to make exemptions for individuals who don\u2019t fit the specific neat boxes, thus you would be forced to follow all these situations.\n[29] The very significant psychological and emotional harm that these incidences would put you through as well as the very real risk of physical and sexual violence that such a situation would put you in \u2013 I find that, overall, there is a serious possibility of persecution and therefore that there is an objective basis to your claim.\nState Protection\n[30] The harm that you fear is by the State of Singapore itself and, as discussed above in the documents, that it is in fact often the prison authorities are unable or unwilling or active persecutors of trans women in prison. And I find, on a balance of probabilities, that adequate State protection would not be available to you if you were to return.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[31] Singapore is a very small country and its laws are in effect across the whole country. And so, I find that you would face a serious possibility of persecution throughout Singapore and therefore that you do not have an internal flight alternative available to you.\nConclusion\n[32] I find that you face a serious possibility of persecution as a result of being a transgender woman and being forced to enlist in military service and the treatment you would receive, likely receive, in the detention centre.\n[33] As I found that you face a serious possibility of persecution for those reasons, I have not considered the risk that you would face in serving in the military or from society at large after.\n[34] And, overall, your claim is accepted.\n\u2014 Decision concluded\n\n",

Bourassa\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Henry Igbinoba\nCountry: Nigeria\nRPD Number: TB8-13768\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2022-00210\nATIP Pages: 000053-000061\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] The claimant, XXXX XXXX XXXX claims to be a citizen of Nigeria, and is claiming refugee protection pursuant to s. 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).i\n[2] The panel has received and considered post-hearing evidence,ii namely updated medical reports.\nDETERMINATION\n[3] Having considered the totality of the evidence, the panel finds that the claimant, is a Convention refugee pursuant to s. 96 as he has established a serious possibility of persecution based on a Convention ground, namely his perceived political opinion.\nALLEGATIONS\n[4] The allegations are set out in the claimant\u2019 s Basis of Claim form.iii In short, the claimant alleges that if he were to return to Nigeria, he fears for his life at the hands of the state security apparatus, especially the military, due to his perceived political opinion based on his perceived membership in the Indegenous People of Biafra (IBOP).\n[5] The claimant alleges that he operated a business at XXX in Umuahia in Abia State. He XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX at the XXXX XXXX XXXX in Lagos to see and provide services to his customer base in Umuahia. He would shuttle between his business in Umuahia and his home is Lagos.\n[6] He alleges that in XXXX 2016, he was was detained, interrogated and mistreated by the military on suspicion of involvement with the IPOB and released without being charged.\n[7] The claimant alleges that he went to his nearby home village of XXXX XXXX to stay with relatives and recover. At the end of October 2016, he received a call from a business colleague who informed him that the military had returned to his shop at XXXX. The claimant returned to Lagos to live with his wife and family. He alleges that he remained very scared and largely stayed inside the house. He did not experience any problems after his return to Lagos.\n[8] The claimant alleges that he and his wife had planned a trip to Canada to celebate an important anniversary that had to be delayed because of what had happened to him. They left Lagos on XXXX 2018.\n[9] The claimant alleges that his wife received a call while in Canada informing her that the \u201cBale\u201d or local chief had sent men looking for her as her same sex relationship had been exposed. They separated and the claimant remains estranged from his wife. The claimant also fears the police and the \u201cBale\u201d of the area where they formerly resided and that he risks being arrested because of his estranged wife\u2019s issue.\n[10] The claimant alleges that the military have come to his home village looking for him, most recently on November 20, 2019, and that there is nowhere in Nigeria where he would be safe.\nNEXUS\n[11] The panel finds that there is a link between what the claimant fears and one of the five Convention grounds, namely, his perceived political opinion as a perceived member of the IPOB.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[12] The panel finds that the claimant\u2019s personal identity and nationality as a citizen of Nigeria and his Igbo ethnicity have been established on a balance of probabilities. This has been established through the claimant\u2019s testimony and the supporting documentary evidence filed that includes his passport, a copy of which was provided to the Board by IRCC\/ Canada Border Services Agency (\u201cCBSA\u201d).iv\nCREDIBILITY\n[13] Considering the totality of the evidence, the panel finds the claimant to be a credible witness and therefore believes what he has alleged in support of his claim as set out in oral and written testimony. The panel notes that the claimant\u2019s estranged spouse has a separate claim for refugee protection based on her own personal circumstances. She did not appear as a witness nor did she submit any evidence in support of the claimant\u2019 s claim.\n[14] The claimant testified credibly and in detail that he was detained, interrogated, and mistreated by the military in XXXX 2016 on suspicion of involvement with the IPOB and released without being charged. He described in detail how he was arrested by the military who entered his shop asking about IPOB materials, which he denied having. He was taken along with other men to a military barracks where he was detained, beaten and interrogated about the IPOB, its leadership and activities and the whereabouts of Emma Powerful. He denied any involvement with the IPOB. Two days later, he was taken to his home where they saw XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX that he used in his XXXX and was accused of being an engineer technician for Radio Biafra. They also went to his shop in XXXX where they found various XXXX that he was repairing or had for sale. He was taken back to the barracks and subjected to further interrogations and beatings. He alleges that he lost XXXX XXXX as a result of the beatings. He remained in detention for a further 10 days and was released. The document issued to him by XXXX showing that he owned a business there and his driver\u2019s licence were retained. He testified that he was never charged, and no conditions were attached to his release.\n[15] The Panel finds the claimant\u2019s account of events in Umuahia is plausible in light of the objective documentary evidence regarding the treatment of members and suspected members and supporters of the IPOB by joint military and police operations throughout the south-eastern region of Nigeria during this time period.v The panel also notes that the documentary evidencevi refers to Radio Biafra and its main host, Emma Powerful, and its role in organizing protests and calling for boycotts. According to one source, the broadcasts are illegal and are conducted live from an undisclosed location in Nigeria.\n[16] The claimant also provided evidence of his business registrationvii which the panel found to be credible.\n[17] The claimant also provided an affidavitviii from C.C. who owns a shop in XXXX XXXX\nas the claimant that corroborates the claimant\u2019s account of his detention by the military arrest as a suspected member of the IPOB and the military\u2019s return trip to XXXX and to the claimant\u2019s shop while he was recovering in his village. The panel finds the affidavit to be credible.\n[18] The claimant also provided an affidavitix from U.I., a cousin, that corroborates the claimant\u2019s account of his condition and that he cared for the claimant in the village of XXXX XXXX Umuahia in Abia State. The panel finds the affidavit to be credible.\n[19] The claimant also provided an affidavitx from M.O.O., that states that the military and plain clothed security agents came to the village on XXXX 2019 and arrested IPOB members and others and also came to the family house in search of the claimant. The panel finds the affidavit to be credible.\n[20] The claimant also submitted reports from C.E. with XXXX XXXXxi hearing clinic that references the claimant\u2019s history of head trauma by the Nigerian military and corroborates hearing loss in XXXX. The claimant testified that he receives ongoing treatment from a psychotherapist and submitted two reports into evidence.xii\n[21] Considering the totality of the evidence, the panel finds on a balance of probabilities that the claimant has a subjective fear of returning to Nigeria due to his perceived political opinion as a perceived member of the IPOB. He has established that he is a person of previous interest to the state security apparatus, especially the military, and that he was detained, interrogated and mistreated by the military in Umuahia in Abia State on suspicion of involvement with the IPOB and released without being charged and that the military continue to look for him.\nOBEJCTIVE BASIS\n[22] The Board finds that the claimant\u2019s allegations are supported by the documentary evidence, namely the national documentation package for Nigeriaxiii and claimant\u2019s disclosure, xiv and that the claimant could face a serious possibility of persecution should he return to Nigeria on account of his perceived political opinion as a perceived member of the IPOB.\n[23] The panel considered the following documentary evidence.\n[24] It was reported by Amnesty International (AI) in September 2016xv that on several occasions security forces have used excessive force against pro-Biafran activists who have attended protest marches or attempted to do so across south-eastern Nigeria. AI has documented cases of arrest, enforced disappearance and often killing of supporters and members of various pro-Biafran groups. Scores of Biafran independence supporters were in detention for attempting to hold or participate in peaceful assemblies, many of them since January 2016.\n[25] Another AI reportxvi from November 2016 refers to its research that shows a disturbing pattern of hundreds of arbitrary arrests and ill-treatment by soldiers during and after IPOB events, including arrests of wounded victims in hospital, and torture and other ill-treatment.\n[26] Other sources in addition to AI xvii report on members and supporters of IPOB as well as bystanders being injured or killed by police and military in Onitsha on May 30, 2016 during protests held to mark the anniversary of the start of the 1967 Biafra war. According to AI, this resulted in at least 17 deaths and 50 injuries and was the consequence of excessive and unnecessary use of force.\n[27] AI also noted that between August 2015 and May 2016, there were at least five similar incidents in Onitsha alone where the police and military shot unarmed IPOB members and supporters. AI reported that the military opened fire on peaceful IPOB supporters and protesters and that killing and mass arrests of members and supporters by joint military and police operations happened in October, November and December 2015.xviii\n[28] Sources also stated that Nmamdi Kanu, the leader of the IPOB, was jailed on charges including treason which is punishable by death and kept in custody until April 2017 despite the court ordering his release.xix Four IPOB members who were arrested with Nnamdi Kanu in 2015 were jailed and charged with treasonable felony. They were granted bail in June 2018.\n[29] The Nigerian military launched Operation Python Dance II in September 2017. The military raided Kanu\u2019s home as part of the operation. AI indicated that ten IPOB members were killed and twelve injured by the military and the military noted that the deaths occurred during their attempt to arrest Kanu at his home.xx\n[30] Sources indicated that the Nigerian military designated the IPOB as a terrorist organization in September 2017.xxi Also, five south eastern states including Anambra banned all IPOB activities in September 2017. Sources indicate that the Abia State Police Commissioner stated, subsequent to the terrorist designation and the ban on IPOB activities, that anyone caught with Biafran materials would be arrested and prosecuted.xxii According to other sources, the Anambra Police Commissioner indicated the ban would be enforced and anyone involved in the activities of the IPOB would be charged with terrorism, which carries a minimum sentence of twenty years and a maximum sentence of the death penalty.xxiii\n[31] Other sources reported that in September 2017, sixty pro-Biafra supporters who participated in an IPOB rally which left a police officer dead and a police station nearly burned down, were charged and jailed for conspiracy, terrorism, attempted murder and membership in an unlawful society.xxiv\n[32] Other sources indicates that 112 women in Owerri were arrested during an August 2018 protest regarding the whereabouts of Kanu and subsequently detained and charged with treason and unlawful assembly.xxv\n[33] Other sources indicated that 51 people were arrested in December 2018 for being m possession of different emblems of the IPOB.\n[34] Other sources indicate that Enugu State Joint Security Patrol teams found Biafra insignias on 140 individuals going to a funeral. All 140 individuals were arrested and charged with terrorism and sent to prison by the magistrate court until their case could be heard at the High Court.\n[35] The panel has also considered recent documentary evidence from June 2020xxvi that refers to the arrest of IPOB protesters in Abia state that were to be brought to the police headquarters in Umuahia, the same location where the claimant operated his business. More recent documentary evidence from August 2020 refers to clashes between IPOB members and the police, army and Department of State Services operatives when the police attempted to arrest them.xxvii\n[36] Considering all of the evidence, including the claimant\u2019s credible account of events that he is a person of previous interest to the state security apparatus, especially the military, and that he was detained, interrogated and mistreated by the military in Umuahia in Abia State on suspicion of involvement with the IPOB and that the military continue to look for him and the documentary evidence with respect to the treatment by Nigerian authorities of actual or perceived members and supporters of the IPOB, the panel finds that the claimant would face a serious possibiity of persecution should he return to Nigeria based on his perceived political opinion as a perceived member of the IPOB.\nSTATE PROTECTION\n[37] Based on the claimant\u2019s personal circumstances as well as the objective country documentation as referred to above, the panel finds on a balance of probabilities that it is objectively unreasonable for the claimant to seek protection from authorities in Nigeria. The state security apparatus, especially the military, is the agent of persecution. Therefore, the panel finds that there is no adequate state protection available for the claimant in Nigeria.\nINTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE\n[38] With regards to an internal flight alternative (\u201cIFA\u201d), this is not a viable option as Nigerian authorities have effective control over the territory. Based on the objective documentary evidence as set out above, the panel finds that there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout Nigeria and as such there is no viable IFA.\nCONCLUSION\n[39] Based on the totality of the evidence, the panel finds that the claimant would face a serious possibility of persecution based on his perceived political opinion as a perceived member of the IPOB. Therefore, the panel finds that the claimant is a Convention refugee and accepts his claim.\n(signed) \u201cM.

Willard\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Annie N. O\u2019Dell\nCountry: Barbados\nRPD Number: TB8-29245\nAssociated RPD Number(s): TB8-29336; TB8-29337; TB8-29338\nATIP Number: A-2021-01105\nATIP Pages: 000057-000065\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: This is an oral decision in the claims for refugee protection of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX the File number is TB8-29245, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX the File number is TB8-29336, XXXX XXXX XXXX TB8-29337 and XXXX XXXX XXXX the File number is TB8-29338.\n[2] The claimant\u2019s are seeking protection in Canada; well the principal claimant is seeking protection in Canada pursuant to Section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act on the basis of her membership in a particular social group that is women who are at risk due to domestic violence and domestic violence in Barbados.\n[3] The claimant indicates that she and the minors are all citizens of Barbados only and of no other country. The panel wishes to note that the written version of these reasons will not be edited for spelling, syntax, grammar and no references to applicable case law.\nALLEGATIONS:\n[4] The details of the claimant\u2019s allegations are found in Exhibit 2.1 before the panel in the basis of claim form narrative and also in the additional narrative at Exhibit 4 which provides an update to the initial narrative.\n[5] In summary the claimant the principal claimant indicates that she was born in Barbados XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. That she and the minor claimant\u2019s who are her children are all citizens of Barbados only. She states that her sons share a father XXXX XXXX who continues to reside in Barbados and from whom she obtained a letter of consent in order for them to travel to Canada.\n[6] She indicates that her daughter XXXX her father XXXX XXXX(ph) is the individual who the claimant is afraid of in Barbados. She details the nature of her relationship with XXXX (ph) in her narrative.\n[7] To summarize; she indicates that she met him a number of years ago when her eldest son was still quite young. She states that the relationship initially was positive but took a turn for the worst and became a very abusive one.\n[8] She indicates that over the years she\u2019s lived in a variety of different places including with XXXX(ph) father, her mother she\u2019s moved addresses a number of times but that XXXX(ph) has been abusive on a continual basis in a manner of different forms.\n[9] She indicates in her narrative that she tried to seek help from the police on a number of occasions. She indicates that help was not operationally adequate so to speak, it was not forthcoming to her.\n[10] She states that after a number of attempts to try to get help from them she gave up hope, particularly on the last occasion in the fall of 2018 when she had an altercation with XXXX (ph) in which the police were not helpful to her and gave her a solution that she believed would end up in her being charged with assault and being arrested.\n[11] It was at this point that she decided that she could no longer live in Barbados and promptly decided to come to Canada and seek help here. She entered Canada on XXXX XXXX of 2018 with the three minor children and shortly after arriving here filed a claim for refugee protection for herself and on their behalf as well.\nDETERMINATION:\n[12] After assessing all of the evidence before me madam I find that you have established on a balance of probabilities that you have a well founded fear of persecution in your country Barbados on the basis of your membership in a particular social group, that is on the basis of your gender and as a woman who fears abuse in Barbados from a partner.\n[13] I find that you have established your identities that is your own and that of the minor claimant\u2019 s on a balance of probabilities. I find as well that you\u2019ve established the credibility of your allegations on a balance, the well foundedness of your fear.\n[14] I find that you\u2019ve also provided a reasonable explanation for your delay in filing your claim here in Canada and that on a balance operational adequate state protection would not be forthcoming to you nor that there would be a viable internal flight alternative for you in Barbados.\n[15] I\u2019m going to turn to my analysis now. First with respect to your personal identities I note madam that you did provide your original passports both for yourself and the minor claimants and I have certified true copies of them before me in Exhibit 1.\n[16] I note that all of the passport copies before me indicate the dates of birth and country\u2019s of citizenship, places of birth that you have alleged.\n[17] I find therefore madam that you have discharged your onus of demonstrating your personal identities as per Section 106 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act and Rule 11 of the Refugee Protection Division rules. Accordingly I accept that all of you hold the identities that you allege.\n[18] With respect to credibility, madam I found you to be today a very credible witness. You were very straightforward, sincere, detailed, and heartfelt in the statements that you made. You were able to testify in a manner that was very consistent with the narrative that you provided of the events that occurred to you.\n[19] You were consistent with the documentation in Exhibits 2.1 and Exhibit 4. I have insufficient reason to doubt the sincerity and truthfulness of your allegations of abuse at the hands of XXXX XXXX (ph) in Barbados.\n[20] Accordingly I accept your allegations as truthful and in reaching that determination I\u2019ve also been mindful of the documentation that you have provided and your explanation for the Jack of documentation from the police, I note that in Exhibit 6 through your counsel you provided a number of documents.\n[21] You provided the Barbados police medical report, the original of which you gave tome today, you provided a copy of what\u2019s app messages to XXXX XXXX who you dealt with in Barbados, you also provided a print out of recent calls from XXXX(ph), contact information, you provided a number of letters of support from individuals who know about the problems that you\u2019ve endured with XXXX(ph), you also provided a consent letter from XXXX XXXX for the purposes of your travel.\n[22] I note as well that there is a XXXX assessment from XXXX XXXX that I\u2019ve also bore in mind in assessing your evidence today.\n[23] I\u2019ve also madam been mindful of and been guided by chair person\u2019 s Guideline 4 on women fearing gender persecution in their country of origin and I\u2019ve also been mindful of counsel\u2019s outline in her application regarding the, your emotional state and the XXXX symptoms that you are experiencing.\n[24] I find madam that you have established through your evidence and testimony today the credibility of your allegations and accept them as credible on a balance.\n[25] With respect to the delay in filing your claim here in Canada, I did ask you questions today about whether or not you were aware that you could file a claim for protection upon arrival. I note that you indicated that you weren\u2019t aware that you could qualify as a refugee claimant and therefore you were guided by a friend who gave you some advice and told you to seek legal assistance and contact a shelter.\n[26] You described the steps that you took in detail that you contacted XXXX(ph) house, that you needed to apply for legal aid, seek legal assistance, I\u2019ve bore in mind your particular circumstances and also have taken into account the fact that you were here on a valid visa, a valid visitor\u2019s stay when you were seeking legal advice.\n[27] Therefore I find that the delay of approximately a month or two in filing your claim here in Canada is not indicative of a lack of subjective fear. I accept your statements as reasonable and therefore draw no negative inference from the delay which was a rather short one.\n[28] In terms of the well foundedness of your fear, I note that the documentary evidence in particular Item 5.5 indicates that domestic violence continues to be a major problem in Barbados.\n[29] There was a, so Item 5.5 is indexed as BRB105717.E its dated March 3rd of 2017 and it\u2019s includes a survey of six hundred people in Barbados on behalf of Unicef s office for the Eastern Caribbean area and it noted that seventy six percent of respondents indicated that they thought domestic violence remained to be a major problem in Barbados.\n[30] Thirty six percent of respondents had someone close to them experience domestic violence by a spouse or partner. According to Freedom House violence against women remains widespread despite domestic violence laws in the country.\n[31] Moreover it similarly states that the violence, that violence and abuse against women continue to be a significant social problem.\n[32] A 2016 report by Inter American Developmental Bank entitled crime and violence in Barbados states that the recording of statistics related to violence in the home in Barbados is severely limited.\n[33] It goes on to state that information collection on domestic violence is inadequate due to under reporting, under documentation, administrative incapacity and a lack of a appreciation for the use of statistics and the policy formulation and monitoring cycle.\n[34] The Barbados government information service GIS further quotes the acting director of the Bureau of Gender Affairs as stating that the true incidents of domestic violence in Barbados is unknown since it is a crime that is seldom reported.\n[35] I will proceed to discuss in further the legislation and the applicability of the legislation under my state protection analysis but I would note that this document does go on to describe incidents of domestic violence, the prevalence of it in the country and therefore madam I find that your fear is, is a well founded one.\n[37] In particular with respect to the issue of state protection, I note that Item 2.1 the US Department of State report indicates that there is legislation in place to deal with domestic violence and incidents of rape and maltreatment of partners in Barbados.\n[38] I note that Item 2.1 states that the law prohibits domestic violence and provides protection to all members of the family including men and children.\n[40] The law applies equally to marriages and to common law relationships. The law empowers police to make an arrest after receiving a complaint, visiting the premises and having some assurance that a crime was committed and police made numerous arrests for domestic violence, penalties depend on the severity of the charges and range from a fine for first time offenders unless the injury is serious up to the death penalty for cases resulting in death of a victim.\n[41] It states that victims may request restraining orders which the courts often issue. The courts may sentence an offender to jail for breaching such an order. Violence\u2026nevertheless it does go on to state that violence and abuse against women continue to be significant social problems. Police have a victim support unit but reports indicated the services provided were inadequate.\n[42] The same DOS report does state that there were public and private counselling services for victims of domestic violence, rape and child abuse. The government provided funding for a shelter for women who had faced violence, the shelter also served victims of human trafficking and other forms of gender based violence.\n[43] In making its assessment the panel must assess whether or not the state protection in Barbados is operationally adequate. It is not enough to just look at efforts that are being made. The panel must assess whether or not there is an operationally adequate level of protection for you in your country.\n[44] The panel notes that you described in your narrative in detail and again today in testimony the interactions that you had with the police. I note that your statements today were very consistent with the statements you made in your basis of claim form narratives.\n[45] You state that in your interactions with the police the response was not fruitful. You state that in the last incident that you had a male and female police officer come to you and suggest that you throw a pot of boiling water on the agent of persecution as a solution.\n[46] You also state that in your dialogue with a police officer about a restraining order they indicated to you that they would get back to you and nothing further came of it.\n[47] You described as well seeking that charges be pressed against XXXX(ph) in the fall of 2017 and that the police escorted you and him in the same police vehicle wherein he was verbally accosting you for charging him, the matter did go to court, however nothing came of it even though you followed up and tried and did appear at the court.\n[48] You stated today that you sought assistance from three different police stations that you\u2019d gone to the police if you were to estimate more than twenty times, that you tried to call them and seek help from them over a period of a number of years.\n[49] The panel has bore this in mind in reviewing Item 5.5 which is a detailed summary of what is happening on the ground with police efforts in Barbados. I\u2019m going to read out what I have noted from this document.\n[50] It states that in Item 5.5 that the IDP report notes that there has recently been an attempt to improve the inadequacies of data collection on domestic violence. Through the creation of a family conflict intervention unit designed to respond to and record more detailed information on domestic violence.\n[51] The same source adds that the unit was established by the police force in June 2013 and that as a result detailed data on domestic violence is limited only to cases reported from June 2013 onwards. It goes on to state that there were two hundred and twenty cases of domestic abuse reported to the Family Conflict Intervention Unit.\n[52] In November 2016 a Barbadian newspaper The Daily Nation reported that incidents of domestic violence are on the rise noting the police logged four hundred and thirty five reports of domestic violence cases between January 1st and October 31st 2016, a slight increase over four hundred and twenty nine cases reported in 2015.\n[53] The same RIR indicates that there is legislation in place to address marital rape and domestic violence. There are also amendments to the domestic violence protection orders act that was introduced in 2016.\n[54] I note that this item is also, this legislation is also made, there\u2019s a reference made to it in Item 5.6 before the panel.\n[55] The\u2026under the state protection and police segment of this item the panel notes that the following is stated. It adds that victims may request restraining orders which the court often issued and the courts may sentence an offender to jail for breaching such an order.\n[56] According to the IDP report there is no government run shelter in Barbados for victims of domestic violence.\n[57] However sources note that the government provided a subvention to the Business and Professionals Women\u2019s Club of Barbados to run a shelter for abused women which is the only shelter available to abused women in Barbados. According to the IDP report the Barbados government is the shelter\u2019s main source of funding.\n[58] With respect to the police according to Freedom House, police responsiveness is often slow and inadequate in cases of violence against women. Country reports 2015 similarly states that there are several reports that police did not responds promptly or adequately to complaints of sexual assault and domestic violence.\n[59] Barbados today reports that police are reluctant to respond to cases of domestic violence. It indicates that there is a victim support unit within the police force.\n[60] According to the same source this unit consists of civilian volunteers and offers assistance primarily to female victims of violent crimes but reports indicated services provided were inadequate.\n[61] Sources also note the existence of a police family conflict unit. The IDP report explains that this unit was established due to a perceived need to sensitize officers responding to family and domestic violence cases. It reported that police were receiving training on domestic violence.\n[62] With respect to support services there is reference to shelters that offer psychological counsellors, intervention services. Of note is that at the final page of this report it states that there was a crisis center and twenty four hour hotline established as a conduit for the shelter for battered women.\n[63] However the same source states that the walk in crisis center was closed in October 2014 due to a reduction in fonds. There is a service alliance, violent encounters, a non profit organization.\n[64] According to the information before the panel this foundation records and monitors incidents of domestic violence and provides free counselling and legal advice, operates a hotline and tries to raise awareness.\n[65] After assessing all of this information madam and taking into consideration your own personal interaction with the police and authorities in Barbados.\n[66] The panel finds that you testimony which is found to be credible in combination with the information that we have on the adequacy of the enforcement services in Barbados leads the panel to determine that you have in your circumstance discharged the onus of demonstrating with clear and convincing evidence that operationally adequate state protection would not be forthcoming to you.\n[67] In reaching this determination the panel is mindful of the added services that may be present in Barbados. However it is clear that there is an ongoing lack of effectiveness in terms of the services provided by the police in Barbados.\n[68] The panel notes that the reports are consistent with one another in Item 2.1 and Item 5.5 and others that while there are efforts being made the services provided are deemed to be inadequate from the police and that there isn\u2019t always responsiveness on their part.\n[69] Taking this into consideration madam with your own personal interactions with the police I find that you have discharged the onus of demonstrating that operational adequate state protection would not be forthcoming to you in Barbados.\n[70] With respect to an internal flight alternative, I have bore in statement madam your, bore in mind your statement that you know that Barbados is small and that you\u2019ve lived in a different, that you\u2019ve lived in different locations and tried to seek protection from different police stations.\n[71] I note that according to Item 1.3 of the national documentation package Barbados is a very small country. The square kilometers are four hundred and thirty in total. The population is estimated at less than three hundred thousand people as of July 2018.\n[72] Given madam the small size of the country and the ongoing threats being issued to you through various people from XXXX(ph) which demonstrate a clear continued interest and determination to find you, his threat that he will locate you and kill you if you were to return to Barbados.\n[73] I find that you have demonstrated that there would not be a viable internal flight alternative for you that would be safe in Barbados given the small size of the country making it very easy for XXXX(ph) to locate you should you try to relocate throughout the country and his past efforts and abilities to continually find you, harass you and abuse you on an ongoing basis.\n[74] In conclusion I find madam that you have demonstrated that you have established your evidence on a balance of probabilities. I note that you have indicated that your children have also been abused and threatened by him. I find therefore that you have established a well founded fear of persecution on your own behalf but also on their part.\n[75] I finally note as well that you have met the onus of demonstrating that you meet the definition of a Convention refugee.\n[76] That you have established the components of Section 96 and established that there is a serious possibility of persecution for you on the basis of your membership in a particular social group that is on the basis of your gender and as a woman who is fearful of domestic violence, for your children as members of your family as well.\n[77] I therefore find madam that you are all Convention refugees and I accept your claims.\n[78] Thank you. We are concluded.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n",

The minor claimant was born in Saudi Arabia to the principal claimant and a Jordanian man. The principal claimant has been divorced from her Jordanian husband since 2011. In Saudi Arabia, the principal claimant suffered from various forms of discrimination due to her gender, her statelessness and her marital status.\n[5] The principal claimant obtained a [XXX] in [XXX] from [XXX] in Syria in 2004. She married her husband in 2007. She worked as a [XXX] in Saudi Arabia from 2005-2018. She was subjected to sexual harassment, employment discrimination and attempted sexual assault by her employer.\n[6] During the marriage, the claimants both suffered repeated physical and emotional abuse. The principal claimant was able to leave her husband and obtain a divorce. The ex-husband married another woman and provided little to no support for the claimants. He visited the minor claimant occasionally but was critical and abusive. He repeatedly threatened to take the minor claimant to Jordan to live with him. These threats intensified when the ex-husband learned that he might have to leave Saudi Arabia permanently. He informed the principal claimant that he would be leaving Saudi Arabia and returning to live in Jordan, and that he had decided to take his son with him. Fearing that she would lose her son, the principal claimant decided to leave Saudi Arabia and came to Canada in [XXX] 2018.\n[7] The principal claimant fears that if she returns to Saudi Arabia, she will continue to face discrimination and harassment as a woman. She also fears that her ex-husband will follow through on his plans to kidnap her son and force him to live in Jordan.\nDETERMINATION\n[8] I find the principal claimant is a Convention Refugee pursuant to section 96 of the Act.\n[9] I find the minor claimant is not a Convention Refugee or person in need of protection pursuant to section 96 or section 97 of the Act.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[10] I am satisfied that the claimants are not citizens of Saudi Arabia even though they were both born in that country. Birth in Saudi Arabia does not entitle a person to citizenship; it is granted only if a person\u2019s parent is a Saudi citizen.[3]\n[11] The minor claimant\u2019s identity as a national of Jordan has been established through a certified copy of his passport. He acquired this citizenship through his biological father. I am satisfied that the minor claimant is a citizen of Jordan and no other country.\n[12] The principal claimant is a stateless Palestinian. She has established her identity through a temporary passport from the Palestinian Authority as well as a travel document from Egypt. Both claimants also have Saudi Arabia resident cards.\nCredibility\n[13] The principal claimant was a credible witness. She testified in a straightforward manner and offered spontaneous details without being prompted. At no point did I find she was evading answering my questions or embellishing her responses. I have several documents before me to support her allegations, including proof of her profession as a [XXX], proof of her divorce and copies of text message exchanges between her and her ex-husband. Based on the presumption of truthfulness, the corroborative evidence, and the claimants\u2019 consistent testimony, I accept their allegations as credible. I accept that the claimants were both victims of family violence. I also accept that the claimant faced significant challenges living in Saudi Arabia as a woman and a foreigner, and that she ultimately left the country out of fear that she would lose her son.\nPrincipal Claimant\nPotential Exclusion under Article 1(f)(b)\n[14] I have considered whether the principal claimant is excluded under Article 1F(b) for child abduction, however, I find that the principal claimant is not excluded. The panel did not notify the Minister due to the finding, upon review of the evidence, that the principal claimant could likely rely on the defence of imminent harm. As explained in greater detail in my reasons, I find the claimants were victims of domestic violence in the past, that the principal claimant left Saudi Arabia out of imminent concern for her son\u2019s well-being, and that these findings are clearly determinative of the exclusion issue.\n[15] In applying Article 1F(b) the focus is on whether the acts could be considered crimes under Canadian law.[4] In this case the relevant provision is the offence of child abduction under Section 283(1) of the Criminal Code, which states:\nAbduction\n283 (1) Every one who, being the parent, guardian or person having the lawful care or charge of a person under the age of fourteen years, takes, entices away, conceals, detains, receives or harbours that person, whether or not there is a custody order in relation to that person made by a court anywhere in Canada, with intent to deprive a parent or guardian, or any other person who has the lawful care or charge of that person, of the possession of that person, is guilty of\nan indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years; oran offence punishable on summary conviction.[5][16] Further, Section 285 provides for a defence of imminent harm to Section 283(1). Section 285 states:\nNo one shall be found guilty of an offence under sections 280 to 283 if the court is satisfied that the taking, enticing away, concealing, detaining, receiving or harbouring of any young person was necessary to protect the young person from danger of imminent harm or if the person charged with the offence was escaping from danger of imminent harm.\n[17] In Mendez, the Ontario Court of Appeal considered the purpose and intent of the 1993 amendments to the Criminal Code which set out the current version of the imminent harm defence.\nBill C-126 amends s. 285 so that the accused will also have a defence if that person took the child in the course of \u201cescaping from danger of imminent harm.\u201d This amendment is intended to create a defence where a person leaves a physically abusive marital relationship and takes along the children. A battered woman should not have to choose between staying with her abuser, leaving her children with him, or escaping the violence with the children but running the risk of a charge of parental child abduction. The amendment is not, however, intended to create a broad defence.[6]\n[18] In this case, the principal claimant could not take her son out of Saudi Arabia without her ex-husband\u2019s permission. Even though the minor claimant resided fully with his mother, the minor claimant\u2019s residency in Saudi Arabia depended entirely on his father\u2019s sponsorship. Therefore, if the minor claimant wanted to leave the country, his father had to apply for an exit visa for him. The principal claimant testified that she had been trying to leave the country with the minor claimant, and that it took a lot of convincing before he finally agreed to allow her to take the minor claimant to the United States for a [XXX] conference. However, unbeknownst to the ex-husband, the principal claimant simultaneously applied for a Canadian visa, as her ultimate intention was to claim refugee protection in Canada. Therefore, although the father technically consented to his son leaving the country, he was unaware of what he was consenting to, and I find she did not obtain the father\u2019s full consent to take her son out of Saudi Arabia.\n[19] However, the facts of this case give rise to the defence of imminent harm. The principal claimant testified to a long-standing pattern of abuse against the claimants through the duration of the marriage and beyond. During the father\u2019s sporadic visits with his son, he was physically and emotionally abusive. As a follower of a strict interpretation of Islam, he became angry with his son when his hair was too long. On one occasion he hit the minor claimant for listening to music that was \u2018forbidden.\u2019\n[20] Moreover, the ex-husband consistently threatened to take the minor claimant away from her, and to take him out of Saudi Arabia to live with him in Jordan. The principal claimant, as a woman in Saudi Arabia with very few legal rights, even regarding her own child, would have no recourse to stop this from happening. She has no status in Jordan and would not be able to go to that country to protect her son from further abuse. Further, I find that if the father did follow through on his threat to remove the minor claimant from his mother\u2019s care, the minor claimant would continue to experience physical and emotional abuse at the hands of his father. Even if the father did not follow through on his threats to remove the minor claimant from Saudi Arabia, the minor claimant would likely be forced to live with his father in Saudi in the absence of his mother. Therefore, the principal claimant was left with the choice to take her son out of the country, or leave him behind and risk not only permanent separation from him but leaving him with his abusive father. In my view this is precisely the type of scenario contemplated in Mendez.\n[21] As a result, I find that the defence of imminent harm does apply to the principal claimant\u2019s actions. I have found the principal claimant to be credible in terms of the mistreatment she and the minor claimant suffered at the hands of her ex-husband. Saudi Arabian laws are inherently persecutory towards women and there are no laws protecting women and children from domestic violence. I am satisfied on the evidence that the imminent harm defence applies in the particular circumstances of the principal claimant. I therefore find that there are no serious reasons for considering the principal claimant excluded under Article 1F(b) for child abduction.\nCountries of Former Habitual Residence (CFHR)\nEgypt\n[22] I find that Egypt is not a CFHR in this case. Although the claimant is in possession of an Egyptian travel document, she has never resided in that country. Rather, she pursued an online [XXX] through an Egyptian university while residing in Saudi Arabia. Although she did visit Egypt frequently to write exams, she never had de facto residence in that country. The principal claimant testified that the longest period of time she ever remained in Egypt was for one month, and that she lived in a university dorm. She never had a fixed address. Other visits to the country were brief, lasting a matter of days. On many occasions she would leave Saudi Arabia in the morning, write her exam in Egypt, and then fly back to Saudi Arabia on the same night. During the entire period, she maintained a residence, employment and her son\u2019s schooling in Saudi Arabia. On the evidence I am satisfied that Egypt is not a CFHR.\nSyria\n[23] The principal claimant resided in Syria for a period of 8 years while she attended [XXX] school. She testified that she had a student residency permit and lived in that country as a [XXX] during the entirety of her education. I am satisfied that Syria is a CFHR in this case.\nSaudi Arabia\n[24] The principal claimant also has de facto residence in Saudi Arabia. She was born in that country, and resided there for the majority of her life with the exception of her eight years in Syria. She attended school, worked as a [XXX] and raised her son in that country. I find that Saudi Arabia is a CFHR in this case.\nWell-founded fear of persecution\n[25] In order to be found to be a Convention refugee, a stateless person must show that, on a balance of probabilities, he or she would suffer persecution in any country of former habitual residence, and that he or she cannot return to any and all of his or her other countries of former habitual residence.[7]\n[26] I find that the principal claimant meets this test. As explained in more detail below, the principal claimant has established a well-founded fear of persecution in Saudi Arabia. Further, she cannot return to her other CFHRs, which in this case is Syria. As the principal claimant\u2019s student residency expired in Syria in 2004, and she no longer has any status in that country, I am satisfied that the principal claimant is unable to return to Syria.\n[27] In terms of her fear of returning to Saudi Arabia, the principal claimant testified to the enormous challenges she faced as a woman, a stateless person, and a single, divorced mother. As a female [XXX] she experienced repeated sexual harassment from her male clients. She was subjected to an attempted rape by her male supervisor. She was not able to drive due to her gender. Beginning in Grade 4, she was forced to wear a full length abaya to cover her body, hair and face, which she was adamantly opposed to but powerless to argue against. She testified that as a woman, she was unable to move freely about, as the law dictates that a male guardian must accompany her in any public setting. Further, even though the principal claimant was divorced from her husband, she experienced constant threats from him. She testified that now that he knows she has made a refugee claim in Canada, if she returns, the punishment against her \u201cwould be multiplied.\u201d\n[28] I find that the principal claimant has established a nexus to the Convention Ground of membership in a particular social group, namely as a woman fearing gender-based persecution. The laws and customs of Saudi Arabia dictated everything from her manner of dress to her mode of transportation. As a non-citizen, the principal claimant also faced further problems that women with citizenship do not. For example, whereas women are now able to drive in Saudi Arabia, women without citizenship cannot. She experienced many years of domestic violence and did not have the right to prevent her ex-husband from taking her son away. As will be discussed, the law in Saudi Arabia regulates many aspects of women\u2019s lives in the name of religion, including who they can marry and whether and where they can work, study or travel. The objective evidence before me also support\u2019s the principal claimant\u2019s allegations.\n[29] Saudi Arabia is a deeply patriarchal society that severely restricts the rights and freedoms of women. Women are not considered to be full, independent or autonomous persons with agency. They are effectively rendered legal minors.[8] For example, a woman\u2019s testimony in court is weighed as half of that of a man.[9] A report by Americans for Democracy & Human Rights in Bahrain and the Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy explains the situation for women in this way:\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s male guardianship system is inextricably related to broader understandings of women\u2019s places in Saudi society. The \u201cideal Saudi woman\u201d is understood to be an \u201cobedient wife and mother, educated as her family permits, segregated from gender mixing unless necessary, and entrusted with preserving the Islamic morality and traditional values promoted by the Saudi state.\u201d In this way, the ideal Saudi woman is meant to be dependent on a man in the family rather than be the head of a family. This understanding of a woman\u2019s role in the family and in society underpins the level of control men have over women, particularly over their wives and daughters. For example, this level of control allows a father to declare a run-away daughter to be \u201cdisobedient,\u201d and to obtain the assistance of the police in returning his \u201cdisobedient\u201d daughter to his care.[10]\n[30] Freedom House reports that women are subject to \u201cextensive legal and societal discrimination, most notably through the guardianship system, in which every woman must rely on a close male relative to approve basic activities.\u201d[11] According to Amnesty International, women are required to have permission from their male guardian \u2014 their father, husband, brother or son \u2014 to enrol in higher education, seek employment, travel or marry.[12] This source also states that women are inadequately protected against sexual and other forms of violence. Human Rights Watch adds that women may be required to seek guardian consent to access healthcare, obtain a passport or be discharged from prison.[13] In another report, Human Rights Watch maintains that recent gender-related reforms in Saudi Arabia are partial, incomplete and in some cases, nullified by the guardianship system, which remains largely intact.[14] This is echoed by Americans for Democracy & Human Rights in Bahrain and the Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy who state that the Saudi Arabian government has not demonstrated the necessary political will to see reforms through and has failed to fully implement and enforce reform.\n[31] The Department of State (DOS) finds that widespread societal exclusion enforced by, but not limited to, state institutions restricts women from using many public facilities.[15] It states that the law requires women to sit in separate, specially-designated family sections. They often cannot consume food in restaurants that do not have such sections. According to the DOS, women risk arrest for riding in a private vehicle driven by a male who is not an employee (i.e. a hired chauffeur or taxi driver) or a close male relative. Furthermore, cultural norms enforced by state institutions require women to wear an abaya in public. The DOS reports that women have unequal marital, inheritance, divorce, child custody, citizenship, political and property rights.\n[32] Women in Saudi Arabia do not have rights equal to that of men. In this case, the principal claimant\u2019s freedom to make decisions about her movement, education, employment, healthcare, travel, marriage, and clothing are restricted by custom and the guardianship system in Saudi Arabia.\n[33] Not only do the conditions in Saudi Arabia not afford women with basic rights, women\u2019s ability to make their own decisions about issues central to their lives is seriously hampered. This represents serious, sustained and systematic limitations on fundamental issues in one\u2019s life that amount to persecution. The principal claimant seeks to live free of gender norms in Saudi Arabia. Based on the totality of the evidence, I find that the principal claimant would face a serious possibility of persecution as a woman in Saudi Arabia.\nState Protection\n[34] In terms of state protection, I do not find that it would be available to the principal claimant since the state enforces these violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[35] I also do not find that the principal claimant could live elsewhere in the country since the government enforces the persecutory laws throughout the country.\nMinor Claimant\n[36] The minor claimant is a citizen of Jordan, and I have considered whether he has a well-founded fear of persecution in that country. I have already found that the minor claimant would face an imminent harm in Saudi Arabia from his father, however, he is not a citizen of that country and I have therefore not assessed whether he has a well-founded fear in that country. The principal claimant alleges that her son faces a risk in Jordan, as he may have to live in that country with his abusive father. She also argues that she would be permanently separated from her son, as she does not have status in Jordan and would not be able to accompany him to that country.\n[37] The current location of the minor claimant\u2019s father is not clear from the evidence. The principal claimant testified that she has not spoken to her ex-husband in about a year. She believes he still lives in Saudi Arabia, as he remarried and has another family there, and he previously sent her messages from his Saudi Arabia phone number, however, the principal claimant did hear from a mutual friend that he had also set up a business in Jordan. He also repeatedly told the principal claimant that he would be relocating to Jordan. Ultimately the principal claimant does not know with certainty in which country her ex-husband resides full\u00ad time.\n[38] In this case then, the minor claimant would be returning to Jordan, a country that he has never lived in. His family there consists of his father, who may or may not live in the country full-time, and his elderly grandmother. The principal claimant alleges that she believed that her ex-husband would remove her son from her care, simply as a way to torment her, however, that he ultimately has shown no interest in raising for or caring for the child.\n[39] I have considered the principal claimant\u2019s arguments regarding family separation and am aware that the minor claimant is an [XXX]-year old boy who would be returning to a country he has never lived in, to face an uncertain and unknown situation. However, I find that the claimants have not established with sufficient evidence that the minor claimant meets the definition of a Convention Refugee or person in need of protection. There is insufficient evidence to show that he would be forced to live with his abusive father, as it is not clear that the father even lives in the country. Likewise, there is insufficient evidence to show what the minor claimant\u2019s situation would be if his father was not in the country, for example, that there would be no long-term or foster care available to a minor without family to care for him. There is insufficient evidence to establish that he would be an \u2018abandoned child\u2019 in the context of the facts in Patel.[16] I have considered the objective evidence regarding child abuse in Jordan, and agree that there are serious gaps in the legal protection afforded to children who are abused by family members.[17] However, there is insufficient evidence to establish that this would be, on a balance of probabilities, the situation facing the minor claimant. Further, the objective evidence is silent on the treatment of unaccompanied children in Jordan. While I am extremely sympathetic to the claimants\u2019 situation, and the humanitarian and compassionate factors that arise from this case, without clearer evidence to establish the risks the minor claimant would face, the principal claimant has not met her onus of establishing that the minor claimant would face a forward\u00ad looking risk under section 96 or 97.\n[40] I am mindful in this case of the court\u2019s comments in Chavez Carrillo:[18]\n[15] It is established that if an applicant has the citizenship or nationality of a country where he or she has no well-founded fear of persecution, protected person status will be denied\u2026. This Court has held on several occasions that there is no concept of family unity incorporated into the definition of Convention refugee.\n\u2026\n[17] However, the human aspect of this case is clear, and it cannot be ignored. At first glance, the RPD\u2019s decision seems to have as a direct consequence the separation of the applicant from his mother. In the event of a departure, the mother will have to choose between allowing her son to leave by himself for the United States and accompanying him to a country where she does not benefit from any legal status.\n[18] Fortunately, the solution to this problem can be found in subsection 176(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations, SOR\/2002-227 [IRP Regulations]. It provides that \u201c[a]n applicant may include in their application to remain in Canada as a permanent resident any of their family members. Therefore, when the applicant\u2019 s mother files an application for permanent residence (if she has not already done so), she will certainly include the applicant as a family member. The mother and her minor son will surely not be separated merely because he was not granted refugee status and she was.\n[41] Based on the evidence before me, I find that the minor claimant would not face a serious possibility of persecution in Jordan as a minor child, nor would he face, on a balance of probabilities, a forward looking risk of torture or personalized risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\nCONCLUSION\n[42] I find that the principal claimant is a Convention Refugee pursuant to section 96 of the Act, and the Board therefore accepts her claim.\n[43] I find that the minor claimant is not a Convention Refugee or person in need of protection pursuant to the Act, and the Board therefore rejects his claim.\n[1] Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n[2] IRB Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 4: Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution, Ottawa, Canada,March 1993, updated November 1996, and R. v.

Tock\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Gabriel Ukueku\nCountry: Nigeria\nRPD Number: VC0-01443\nAssociated RPD Number(s):\nATIP Number: A-2021-01106\nATIP Pages: 000184-000189\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] This is the decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) concerning [XXX] (the \u201cclaimant\u201d) who is a citizen of Nigeria and is making a claim for refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (the \u201cAct\u201c).[1]\nDETERMINATION\n[2] I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the Act, for the following reasons.\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] I will briefly summarize the claimants\u2019 allegations, which are found in his Basis of Claim (BOC) form[2]. The claimant is a member of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), which is a group striving for the independence of Biafra. The claimant considers himself a freedom fighter as he has not only become a member of IPOB but has risen in its ranks to become a member of the [XXX] team. As such, he was responsible for [XXX] about the group and its activities, as well as mobilizing Biafrans to join peaceful rallies.\n[4] In 2018, the claimant\u2019s father was killed by Nigerian military officers after they raided his home trying to arrest the claimant. The claimant\u2019s father tried to prevent the claimant\u2019s arrest, which resulted in his death. Soon thereafter, the claimant travelled to Canada for a conference. While in Canada, the claimant\u2019s nephew was killed by the Nigerian authorities. As a result, the claimant remained in Canada for seven months. However, he did not make a claim for protection because his wife and children were still in Nigeria and he wanted to ensure they were safe. In [XXX] 2019, the claimant was advised that the situation was improving, thus he returned to Nigeria.\n[5] However, in [XXX] 2019, an IPOB member alerted the claimant that the Nigerian military were on their way to his house. This allowed the claimant and his family to flee the area. The claimant\u2019s wife and children escaped to Cameroon while the claimant travelled to Canada and made a claim for protection. While in Canada, the claimant has become part of the IPOB Calgary League and continues to support the cause.\nIdentity\n[6] The claimant\u2019s identity as a national of Nigeria is stablished by the sworn statement in his BOC form and the certified copy of his Nigerian passport[3] before me.\nNexus\n[7] The claimant alleges that he will be persecuted by the Nigerian government due to his membership in IPOB. I find there is a nexus between this allegation and the Convention ground of political opinion. As such, I have considered this claim under both sections 96 and 97(1) of the Act.\nCredibility\n[8] There is a presumption that sworn testimony is true unless there is sufficient reason to doubt its truthfulness. In this case, I found the claimant to be a credible witness. His testimony was heartfelt and passionate. The claimant became emotional when asked to explain why he chose to join IPOB. He testified that his parents had taught him about the injustices committed against the Biafran population during the 50s and 60s, and he also observed the continued targeting of Biafrans by the Nigerian government. The claimant testified that the Biafran community did not want to be part of Nigeria because of the way the country is being managed and because of the injustices committed against the Biafran people.\n[9] The claimant was also able to credibly explain what appeared to be inconsistencies in the evidence before me. For example, the claimant was asked why he did not make a claim for protection during the [XXX] 2018 to [XXX] 2019 period that he was in Canada. The claimant\u2019 s father had been murdered prior to his travels to Canada and his nephew had also been murdered while the claimant was in Canada, thus it would be reasonable to expect that the claimant would make a claim for protection at that time. However, the claimant explained that during that trip, his wife and children were still in Nigeria. His top priority is their safety, thus he had to ensure he could travel back to keep them safe. I find this explanation to be credible given that once the claimant was able to secure his family\u2019s safety in Cameroon, he made a claim for protection.\n[10] I also questioned the claimant regarding a newspaper article in evidence which indicates that the claimant and his wife were missing after a raid by the military.[4] The article is dated November 2019; however, the military raid which led to the claimant leaving Nigeria took place in [XXX] 2019. The claimant explained that there was a second raid of his home, where his belongings were destroyed by the military. This second raid took place in [XXX] 2019, and that is the one being referenced in the article. I find this explanation to be credible as the claimant mentioned a second raid of his home in his BOC form.\n[11] I have also considered the documentary evidence before me, including evidence of the claimant\u2019s membership in IPOB Calgary,[5] his membership in IPOB in Nigeria,[6] and the continued targeting of IPOB members in Nigeria.[7]\n[12] Based on the totality of the evidence before me, I accept the claimants\u2019 allegations as credible.\nCountry Conditions\n[13] I have reviewed the National Documentation Package (NDP)[8] before me and I find that Country condition information before me establishes that the claimant has a well-founded fear of persecution in Nigeria.\n[14] The evidence before me is that IPOB is a separatist organization considered to be a secessionist group which argues that the people of Biafra have been politically, socio\u00adeconomically and culturally marginalized in Nigeria.[9]\n[15] There are reports of extrajudicial executions, use of excessive force by military, arbitrary arrests and detentions, torture and evidence of peaceful gatherings being dispersed by the firing of live ammunition with little or no warning.[10]\n[16] The President\u2019s stance on Biafran independence is described as dismissive at best, and at times hostile.[11] However, in 2017, the Nigerian military designated the IPOB as a terrorist organization; a label which has been rejected by international observers.[12] A Response to Information Request (RIR) before me indicates that following that designation, IPOB members have been targeted:\nThe Abia State Police Commissioner stated, subsequent to the terrorist designation and the ban on IPOB activities, that anyone caught with \u201cBiafran materials would be arrested and prosecuted.\u201d\nThe Anambra Police Commissioner, quoted by the Punch, a Nigerian news publication, indicated the ban would be enforced and anyone involved in the activities of the IPOB would be charged with terrorism, which carries a minimum sentence of twenty years and a maximum sentence of the death penalty.\nSince August 2015, the security forces have killed at least 150 members and supporters of the pro-Biafran organization IPOB (Indigenous People of Biafra) and injured hundreds during non-violent meetings, marches and other gatherings. Hundreds were also arbitrarily arrested.[13]\n[17] Considering that the Nigerian government has labeled the IPOB as a terrorist organization and that they continue to target members of the IPOB, I find that there is more than a mere possibility that the claimant would be persecuted if he returns to Nigeria.\nState Protection and Internal Flight Alternative\n[18] In this case, the agent of harm is the government. The authorities are targeting members of IPOB and have labeled them a terrorist organization. As such, it would not be reasonable to expect the claimant to turn to the state for protection.\n[19] In terms of an internal flight alternative (IFA), the government of Nigeria is in control of the entire state. Its persecutory declaration is in place in the entire territory; thus it would not be feasible for the claimant to move elsewhere in Nigeria and be safe. As such, I do not find that an IFA exists in this case.\nCONCLUSION\n[20] For the reasons outlined above, I find the claimant is a Convention refugee. As such, his claim is accepted.\n[1] Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n[2] Exhibit 2.\n[3] Exhibit 1.\n[4] Exhibit 4.\n[5] Exhibit 4.\n[6] Exhibit 7.\n[7] Exhibits 4 and 5.\n[8] Exhibit 3, National Documentation Package (NDP), Nigeria, July 31, 2020.\n[9] Exhibit 3, NDP, Item 13.2 Response to Information Request (RIR) NGA105658.E.\n[10] Exhibit 3, NDP, Item 13.2 RIR NGA105658.E.\n[11] Exhibit 3, NDP, Item 13.2 RIR NGA105658.E.\n[12] Exhibit 3, NDP, Item 13.5 RIR NGA106308.E.\n[13] Exhibit 3, NDP, Item 13.5 RIR NGA106308.E.\n\n",

The following is a brief summary:\n[5] The principle claimant and both of her adult daughters are Christian converts, and they fear persecution due to their conversion from Islam. The associate claimant does not identify as Christian but believes that people should be able to choose their own religion freely. Furthermore, he acknowledges a belief in God, but is not a follower of Islam as it is required in Iran.\nDetermination\n[6] I find that the claimants are convention refugees as they have established a well-founded fear of persecution based on convention grounds. Namely religion in the case of the principal claimant and the two adult children claimants and political opinion in the case of the associate claimant.\nAnalysis\nIdentity\n[7] I find the claimants\u2019 identities as nationals of Iran is established by their testimonies and the supporting documentation filed including certified true copies of their passports in Exhibit 1.\nCredibility\n[8] When a claimant swears to the truth of certain allegations, this creates a presumption that those allegations are true unless there is a reason to doubt their truthfulness. However, this presumption does not apply to inferences or speculation for which there is no evidentiary basis.\n[9] The claimants testified in a straightforward and detailed manner and with no inconsistencies in their testimonies or contradictions between their testimonies and the other evidence before me that were not explained.\n[10] The female claimants all described in detail their beliefs and contrasted that with the religion into which they were born in Iran. The principle claimant said, \u201cIf we say that we are God\u2019s children in any other religion, meaning our previous religions, if I were to say this, that I am a child of God, they would punish me. They would never allow me to continue with my life. Now, I am certain that God, the father, supports me.\u201d Her daughters echoed the support that they feel from their new religion, particularly while their mother was facing a serious health challenge.\n[11] The associate claimant described how he found out about his family\u2019s conversion, and he expressed his tolerance for other religious views. He credibly described how he wished he had known about this conversion sooner and clearly supported his family members\u2019 rights to make their own decisions about religion. As for himself, he explained that he had not converted, although he had learned a fair bit about Christianity from his family, and he remains open-minded.\n[12] I have found all of their explanations and descriptions to be compelling and clear. Furthermore, they provided the following relevant probative documents: There is a letter on page 17 of Exhibit 4 from [XXX] (ph) from [XXX] in [XXX] in the Calgary Assembly of [XXX] and [XXX] Church. The principle claimant has been attending since [XXX] 2018. Her daughters joined afterwards.\n[13] The Pastor said that the principle claimant, \u201cgave a beautiful testimony during a Sunday church service in regard to how she became a believer in Jesus Christ and accepted him as her personal saviour\u201d and studied for baptism on [XXX] of 2019. Then she joined the Bible study group according to the Pastor. The Pastor said that the daughters were baptized on [XXX] of 2020 and that they too gave public testimony of their faith in Jesus Christ.\n[14] I find these documents are relevant and served to corroborate the core allegations of the three female claimants that they are Christian converts. The narrative and testimony of the claimants corresponds to the ample objective evidence about conditions in Iran pertaining to converts from Islam as well as those who oppose the government-imposed religion.\n[15] Apparently I have no reason to doubt the central elements underpinning the claim for protection nor the claimant\u2019s stated subjective fear. I found all four claimants to be credible witnesses and therefore have accepted as true the facts that they have alleged in support of their claim.\nNexus\n[16] I find the persecution the principle claimant and her adult daughters face has a nexus to one of the five convention grounds, that of religion. And I find that the associate claimant has established a nexus to political opinion and therefore this claim will be assessed under s. 96.\n[17] I acknowledge that the principle claimant and the two adult children as women also have a nexus to membership in a particular social group as women in Iran and that the associate claimant could also be considered for membership in a particular social group as a family member of claimants facing persecution on a convention ground.\n[18] However, I have found the respective nexuses to religion and political opinion are sufficient for me to decide this claim for asylum, and therefore, I have analyzed the claims solely on these grounds.\nWell-Founded Fear\n[19] In order to be considered a convention refugee, a claimant must describe that they have a well-founded fear of persecution which includes both a subjective and an objective basis.\n[20] Based on the claimant\u2019s testimonies and supporting documents as well as the country condition documents, I find that all four claimants have a well-founded fear of persecution for the following reasons:\n[21] The principle claimant started attending church in Canada around [XXX] of 2018 with her Canadian relatives who were Christians, but she did not convert at the time. She returned briefly to Iran in [XXX] of 2019 to have her visa extended and then came back to Canada to stay with her daughters. She became more involved with Christianity through her family members and by attending church and decided to convert. However, she feared telling her husband who was still in Iran, the associated claimant, over the phone as this was risky.\n[22] Her daughters, as well, became increasingly interested in Christianity after seeing the positive changes in their mother that her Christianity had brought to her. After the associate claimant came to Canada in [XXX] 2019 having been threatened, he was able to confirm his family\u2019s conversion to Christianity, and all four of them claimed asylum while their visitors and student visas respectively were still valid. Their actions in addition to the amply country condition documents below have established their subjective fear of persecution in Iran.\n[23] The country documentation is consistent with the claimant\u2019s testimonies and fearing persecution in Iran due to the conversion of three of the claimants to Christianity and due to the forth claimant\u2019s opposition to this persecution and beliefs that religious freedom is important.\nReligion\n[24] The law prohibits Muslim citizens from changing or renouncing their religious beliefs. Under Iranian law, a Muslim who leaves his or her faith or converts to another religion can be charged with apostasy, and this is a crime punishable by death.\n[25] Amnesty International stated in June 2019, \u201cFreedom of religion and belief continues to be systematically violated. The authorities impose on people of all faith as well as atheists codes of conduct rooted in a strict interpretation of Shia Islam. The right to change or renounce religious beliefs continues to be violated with those converting from Islam being at risk of arbitrary detention, torture, and even the death penalty.\u201d\n[26] The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade assesses that those accused of religiously based charges are also likely to face charges related to national security, and they are unlikely to have adequate legal defence and are likely to be convicted.\n[27] While Shia jurors generally hold only that male apostates are to be killed, females on the other hand may only be imprisoned. The US Department of State says that prison conditions were harsh and life-threatening due to food shortages, gross over-crowding, physical abuse, and inadequate sanitary conditions and medical care.\n[28] I am satisfied that regardless of whether a convert faces the death penalty or prison, the conditions and treatment are such that both amount to persecution. Based on all the evidence before me, I find the principle claimant and her two adult daughter claimants would face a serious possibility of persecution from the state due to the conversion from Islam to Christianity if they were to return to Iran.\nPolitical Opinion\n[29] The associate claimant is in fact opposing the government\u2019s religious requirements in his support for his family members who have converted to Christianity. He described being threatened and questioned about his family members\u2019 religion in the months before he came to Canada. At that time, he was not even aware that they had converted as they had feared telling him over the phone that the authorities would discover this.\n[30] The associate claimant disagrees with the state position on religious freedom in Iran. He said that, \u201cThe Iranian regime needs to change based on the views in the constitution they\u201d unlike himself, \u201cdo not accept any other religion or belief.\u201d He said, \u201cThere needs to be an environment that allows people to choose their religion freely, to have their own beliefs, and be respected for it.\u201d\n[31] The Islamic Republic of Iran is an authoritarian theocratic republic and imposes severe restrictions on many freedoms including religious freedom. The government\u2019s human rights record remained extremely poor and worsened, and there were numerous reports of arbitrary killings and forced disappearances as well as torture by government agents, corruptions widespread at all levels of the government, and impunity is pervasive through all levels of government and security forces according to NDP 2.1 and 1.7.\n[32] I have noted that the associate claimant has expressed an opinion and is against the government of Iran by his support for religious freedom. Based on all the evidence before me, I find that he, too, would face a serious possibility of persecution based on this political opinion if he were to return to Iran.\n[34] I also note that he has vowed to stay with his family and were he to do so and they are still Christian converts, he would suffer persecution as well for that reason.\nState Protection and Internal Flight Alternative\n[35] In this case, the agent of persecution is the state. The persecution the claimants would face if returned to Iran is at the hands of the authorities, and accordingly, I find there is no state protection available to the claimants, and the presumption of state protection is rebutted.\n[36] The state of Iran is in control of all of its territories, and therefore, again on the evidence before me, I find that there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout Iran. There is no viable internal flight alternative for these claimants in their particular circumstances.\nConclusion\n[37] Based on the totality of the evidence, I conclude that the claimants are convention refugees, and accordingly, I am accepting all of their claims.\n[38] Okay, so that is the end of my decision. Interpreter, if you would like to go ahead and give a summary. That would be very welcome.\n[39] INTERPRETER: Sure thing.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014REASONS CONCLUDED\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

Smeets\nCountry: Cameroon\nRPD Number: VB9-09903\nAssociated RPD Number(s):\nATIP Number: A-2021-01106\nATIP Pages: 000174-000177\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: So, these are the reasons for the decision in the claim of [XXX], a citizen of Cameroon who is claiming refugee protection pursuant to Section 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[2] The allegations are that the claimant fears persecution at the hands of the Cameroon State authorities on the basis of his political views and in particular, his affiliation with the Southern Cameroons National Council, also known as the SCNC.\n[3] My determination is that I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee.\n[4] In terms of identity, I note that the claimant did enter the country on a false identity, i.e. using a passport that is not in his name. He has explained to me, in my opinion, plausible reasons for doing that because he had a warrant outstanding for him in his country and that was his only way of leaving safely. Since that time, he has provided a copy of his passport and his birth certificate and I\u2019m satisfied based on his testimony and the offering of these documents, that he is who he says he is.\n[5] So, I am not, I don\u2019t have a problem with the issue of identity.\n[6] In terms of credibility, I do note that the Minister filed an initial intent to intervene in this matter on the basis of credibility. However, withdrew that intention to intervene late last week.\n[7] So, in terms of my assessment of credibility, when a claimant swears to tell the truth of certain allegations, this creates a presumption that those allegations are true, unless there is reason to doubt their truthfulness. In assessing whether a claimant\u2019s statements are believable, we consider whether the facts presented are detailed, plausible and consistent.\n[8] I find that these criteria are met in this case. I found the claimant convincingly relayed what had happened to him in his written evidence and in his oral testimony.\n[9] I found him to be a credible witness, as it pertains to the central allegations regarding his claim.\n[10] In essence, the claimant has provided evidence that due to his negative experience growing up, as an anglophone in a francophone environment, where he was taxed heavily in the business that he was in, he decided to try to fight l guess, in, for lack of a better word, against the power that the francophones were imbuing in the country. And he decided to join the SCNC, which is an organization known for trying to encourage the rights of anglophones and reduce marginalization of anglophones in his country. As part of his membership in this organization, he participated in the organization of protests and arranged for transportation of the members to and from marches. He was detained for the first time in 2011 for about seven days, after participating in a march to promote the vision of an independent anglophone Cameroon. He recalls being forced into a cell with about five hundred people, where there was no toilet and he was denied food and drink. In 2016, he was again detained but this time was released after about one day. The third and final march he participated in took place on [XXX] the [XXX], 2017. From that march, he was charged with a number of offences and imprisoned in Buea for approximately four months, from [XXX] 2017 until [XXX] 2018. Eventually, he was released on bail after getting help from his lawyer and his family. In [XXX] 2018, his drivers had been transporting food to a village called [XXX] (ph). They heard gunshots, parked the trucks and ran. The village ended up being burned by the State military. The claimant did not appear for the trial of, on the charges that he was charged with because he feared that he would not receive due process. He went into hiding for about a year and was informed by his lawyer that an arrest warrant had been issued for him in [XXX] 2018. Finally, he obtained a visitor for fear of being discovered in his country, he obtained a visitor to, visa to Canada under a false name and left Cameroon on [XXX] 2019. He has not seen his family since [XXX] 2018.\n[11] I find that the claimant has provided solid corroborative evidence that supports his allegations. For example, he has provided a copy of his membership card with the SNC-, SCNC, I\u2019m noting that he\u2019s contributed from the years 2013, 2019. I\u2019ve also been provided with a copy of the warrant, which the claimant testified today was provided to him by his lawyer. I\u2019ve also been provided with copies of the boarding pass that he used to get out of his country, which shows that it was in a different name than it-, the name given, which supports his subjective fear that he would have been arrested had he used his real name if he\u2019d gone to the airport, or if he had gone through the airport on his own name. And I also have an affidavit from his lawyer, who supports his political beliefs and also the chronology of events, as it pertains to the arrest warrant and the jumping of bail.\n[12] So, based on these documents and based on the testimony and the narrative of the claimant, I find that there is sufficient evidence on the balance of probabilities, that supports the claimant\u2019s credibility.\n[13] In terms of the Nexus, I find the Nexus here is a Convention ground of political opinion and I\u2019ve also looked at the country documents and find that they do also support the claimant\u2019s political beliefs. Cameroon, a bilingual and multicultural company-, country that was known for its stability and its strong alliances with France and the U.S., is apparently slipping into a protracted human rights crisis, in the largely anglophone northwest and southwest regions that border Nigeria. Since late 2016, anglophone activists who have long complained of the regions perceived marginalization by the francophone majority, have mobilized significant segments of the anglophone population to demand more political autonomy or succession and this is found in Exhibit 3, the National Documentation Package at Tab 2.7. In a recent Freedom House report of 2019, it\u2019s noted that the conflict between security forces and separists-, separatists in the anglophone northwest and southwest regions has intensified, resulting in widespread civilian deaths and displacements and that\u2019s found in Tab 2.3 of the National Documentation Package. Human Rights Watch reported that government forces killed civilians in a context of the ongoing anglophone crisis. And security forces have set houses on fire, burning to death at least four elderly women left behind by their relatives. They\u2019ve committed extrajudicial executions, burned property, carried out arbitrary arrests and tortured detainees. A Human Rights Watch report documented a range of abuses by both sides in the anglophone regions, including arson attacks on homes and schools. According to the International Crisis Group, government forces and armed separatists killed over 420 civilians since the crisis has escalated in 2017 and that\u2019s at NDP 2.5.\n[14] In my view, the country conditions demonstrate a serious problem between the government and the anglophone activists, of which the claimant is one. I considered his profile as a member of the SCNC and the fact that he has a warrant out for him right now, and the fact that he has testified that the police came to his house looking for him. He used a fake passport to get into this country but has since provided a copy of his real passport. But I understand that using the fake passport was part of his, supports his subjective fear. I\u2019ve considered that he holds a political view that is critical of the government and I have considered the documents that show how the government treats individuals who they perceive to have an opinion that is opposite to them.\n[15] Based on this evidence, I find that the claimant has a well-founded fear of persecution and I find that he faces a serious possibility of persecution from the State, if he were to return to Cameroon, by reason of his political opinion, both real and imputed. In terms of state protection, given that the State is the agent of harm, I find there is no state protection available to the claimant and that it would be objectively unreasonable for him to have sought state protection.\n[16] I find that the presumption of state protection has been rebutted.\n[17] And in terms of an internal flight alternative, given the States\u2019 capacity and pattern of treatment of the critics of the government, given that he has an outstanding warrant for his arrest, I find that he faces a serious possibility of persecution throughout Cameroon.\n[18] Accordingly, I find there is no alternative flight available to the claimant.\n[19] In conclusion, I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee and I accept his claim.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n",

The claimants provided further details in their Basis of Claim (BOC) forms.[3] The claimants provided corroborative documents including identity documents, membership in the Action Democracy political opposition party, letters of support and screenshots of social media posts against the current regime.[4] The panel has reviewed and applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline on Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution.[5]\nDetermination\n[3] The panel finds that the principal claimant and the associate claimant, his spouse, have established that they are Convention refugees pursuant to section 96 of the Act for the reasons that follow.\n[4] The panel finds that the two minor associate claimants are neither Convention refugees pursuant to section 96 nor persons in need of protection pursuant to subsection 97(1) of the Act for the reasons that follow.\nCredibility and Well-Founded Fear of Persecution\n[5] The claimants testified in a straightforward and consistent manner, consistent with their BOC and supporting documents. The panel finds that the claimants are credible witnesses. The principal claimant and designated representative for his two minor children, the associate claimants, testified that they do not have any fears of return to the U.S. for their two American children. He confirmed that that they are citizens of the U.S. Accordingly, the panel finds that their claims fail under both section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Act.\n[6] He testified that he fears that he will be imprisoned, beaten and killed because of his political opposition if he returns to Venezuela. The two adult claimants testified that they left Venezuela in 2004 due to the persecution and threats they suffered during the Chavez regime. They testified that they did not have citizenship, permanent residence and had never made an asylum claim in the U.S. The principal claimant testified that he was able to obtain renewable work permits during their time in the U.S. He testified that they never returned to Venezuela. The two adult claimants testified that they continue to be politically active through social media, helping with humanitarian aid for opposition in Venezuela and participating in protests against the Maduro regime in Miami where they were living. The female adult claimant testified that she also fears gender-based persecution including rape by security forces as she has seen media reports regarding female opposition members who have suffered this kind of persecution in Venezuela.\n[7] The objective evidence supports the claimants\u2019 fear of return to Venezuela because of their political opposition to the current government. The objective evidence indicates that \u2018\u201dcivilian authorities\u2019 control over the security forces declined and was deeply politicized.\u201d[6] There are no independent government institutions remaining today in Venezuela to act as a check on executive power and \u201ca series of measures by the Maduro and Ch\u00e1vez governments stacked the courts with judges who make no pretense of independence. The government has been repressing dissent through often-violent crackdowns on street protests, jailing opponents, and prosecuting civilians in military courts. It has also stripped power from the opposition-led legislature.\u201d[7]\n[8] Further, the objective evidence indicates that authorities persecuted political opposition in Venezuela:\nThe most significant human rights issues included extrajudicial killings by security forces, including government sponsored \u201ccolectivos\u201d; torture by security forces; harsh and life-threatening prison conditions; widespread arbitrary detentions; and political prisoners. The government unlawfully interfered with privacy rights, used military courts to try civilians, and ignored judicial orders to release prisoners. The government routinely blocked signals, interfered with the operations, or shut down privately owned television, radio, and other media outlets. The law criminalized criticism of the government, and the government threatened violence and detained journalists critical of the government, used violence to repress peaceful demonstrations\u2026[8]\n[9] Based on the totality of the evidence, the panel finds that the claimants have established a nexus to political opinion and that they would face a serious possibility of persecution because of their political opposition against the current regime.\nState Protection and Internal Flight Alternative\n[10] Given that the state is the agent of harm, the panel finds that there is no state protection available to the claimants. Further, given the state\u2019s capacity and ongoing interest in arbitrarily detaining and abusing citizens who oppose the government, the panel finds that the claimants would face a serious possibility of persecution throughout Venezuela and it is not objectively reasonable in all of the circumstances including their particular circumstances to relocate anywhere in Venezuela. Accordingly, the panel finds that there is no internal flight alternative available to the claimants.\nCONCLUSION\n[11] For the forgoing reasons, the panel finds that the principal claimant and the associate claimant, his spouse, have established that they are Convention refugees pursuant to section 96 of the Act and the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada therefore accepts their claims.\n[12] For the forgoing reasons, the panel finds that the two minor associate claimants are neither Convention refugees pursuant to section 96 nor persons in need of protection pursuant to subsection 97(1) of the Act and the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada therefore rejects their claims.\n[1] Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n[2] Exhibit 1.\n[3] Exhibit 2.\n[4] Exhibit 4.\n[5] Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (IRB) Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 4: Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution, Ottawa, Canada, March 1993, updated November 1996.\n[6]Exhibit 3, National Documentation Package (NDP), Venezuela, September 30, 2020, Item 2.1.\n[7] Exhibit 3, NDP, Item 2.3.\n[8] Exhibit 3, NDP, Item 2.1.\n\n",

You allege that you cannot return safety to Zambia because you fear persecution by the state due to your sexual orientation as a lesbian.\nDETERMINATION\n[5] I find that you are a Convention refugee as you have established a serious possibility of persecution on account of your membership in a particular social group based on your sexual orientation for the following reasons.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[6] I find that your identity as a national of Zambia is established by your testimony and the documents provided: National identity card.[2]\nNexus\n[7] You allege that you will be persecuted in Zambia due to your sexual identity as a lesbian. I find that there is a nexus between your allegation and the Convention ground of membership in a particular social group based on your sexual orientation. As such, I have considered their claims under both sections 96 and 97(1) of the Act.\nCredibility\n[8] I find you to be a credible witness and therefore believe what you alleged in support of your claim. You testified in a straightforward manner and there were no relevant inconsistencies in your testimony or contradictions between your testimony and the other evidence before me which have not been satisfactorily explained.\n[9] You submitted corroborative documents regarding your sexual orientation through affidavits from acquaintances, family, your church and the [XXX][3]. The country condition evidence described below also supports your allegations in Zambia. Based on the presumption of truthfulness, your testimony, and the corroborative evidence, I find, on a balance of probabilities, that your allegations are credible.\nRisk of harm\n[10] To establish your status as a Convention refugee or as a person in need of protection, you had to show that there was a serious possibility that you would be persecuted, or that you would be subjected on a balance of probabilities to a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or a danger of torture if removed to Zambia.\n[11] You testified that you grew up in a very strict and religious household, and that you were taught that a women can only love a man. You spoke of how you witnessed your brother informing your parents that he was gay and the subsequent fall out he had with your parents who accused him of bringing shame and disgrace to the family. You testified that you have not heard from your brother since 2014 and that no one in your family knows where he is.\n[12] You spoke of your own questioning and doubts regarding your sexual identity growing up and how you started exploring your feelings in more depth when you arrived in Canada in 2015 to study. You testified that you no longer wanted to live a lie and be in denial of who you were and informed your two sisters who live in Canada, of your sexual orientation, even knowing it would be a difficult conversation.\n[13] According to the Zambia Penal Code Act, Section 158: Indecent practices between persons of the same sex of the Penal Code Act indicates:\n[XXX] Any female who, whether in public or private, commits any act of gross indecency with a female [\u2026] person, or procures a female [\u2026] person to commit any act of gross indecency with her, or attempts to procure the commission of [XXX] any such act by any female person with himself or with another female [\u2026] person, whether in public or private, commits a felony and is liable, upon conviction, to imprisonment for a term of not less than seven years and not [XXX] exceeding fourteen years.[4]\n[14] A report by International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association, 2015 the President Edgar Lungu declared: \u201cWe will not support homosexuality. I will not compromise human nature because of money. God made man and woman.\u201d[5]\n[15] The objective evidence highlights the challenges in Zambia in terms of advancing and protecting the rights of the LGBTQ community and the various incidences of state-sponsored homophobia and transphobia which continues to plagues the legal and political atmosphere of Zambia.[6] Based your identification as a lesbian and the state\u2019s laws and treatment of individuals who identity as lesbian, I find that there is a serious possibility of persecution if you return to Zambia. I find that you have a well-founded fear of persecution based on your membership in a particular group, based on your sexual orientation.\nState protection\n[16] I find that it would be objectively unreasonable for you to seek the protection of the state in light of your particular circumstances. Given the current legislation and that the government is an agent of persecution, it appears objectively unreasonable for you to seek the protection of the state. Consequently, the presumption of state protection has been rebutted.\nInternal flight alternative\n[17] I have considered whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for you. On the evidence before me, I find that there is a serious possibility of persecution or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment throughout Zambia, since the laws apply across the country and that you cannot be expected to hide from the state.\nCONCLUSION\n[18] Based on the analysis above, I conclude that you are a Convention refugee. Accordingly, I accept your claim.\n[1] Exhibit 2.\n[2] Exhibit 1.\n[3] Exhibit 4.\n[4] Exhibit 3, National Documentation Package (NDP), Zambia, March 31, 2020, Item 6.1.\n[5] Exhibit 3, NDP Item 6.1.\n[6] Exhibit 3, NDP Item 6.2.\n\n",

I maintained the designation of [XXX] as the designated representative for the two minor claimants pursuant to subsection 167(2) of the Act and Rule 20 of the Refugee Protection Division Rules. These claims were joined according to Rule 55 of the Refugee Protection Division Rules.\n[2] The claimants allege that FARC will murder them if they\u2019re returned to Colombia because they\u2019ve refused to pay the FARC\u2019s extortion demands. The FARC has murdered the principal claimant\u2019s uncle on [XXX] the [XXX] 2018 after their first written demands for payment were not met. I find the claimants have established on a balance of probabilities that they would personally be subjected to a danger of torture or face a risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment upon return to Colombia. My reasons follow, the claimants\u2019 identities and citizenship as nationals of Colombia were established by their testimony and the supporting documentation filed, including certified true copies of their passports in Exhibit 1.\nCredibility\n[3] When a claimant swears to the truthfulness of certain facts, there is a presumption that what they have said is true, unless there\u2019s sufficient reason to doubt the truthfulness. The claimants testified in a straightforward manner with no inconsistencies in their testimonies or contradictions between their testimonies and other evidence before me. I found the adult claimants to be credible witnesses and therefore accepted as true the facts that they have alleged in support of their claim. The minor claimant\u2019s-\u00ad, actually one did testify a little bit, the other one did not testify. The claimants provided the following relevant and prohibitive documents in their Exhibit 4. Their corporate documents showing the family owned the [XXX], a [XXX] corporation located in Bogota. Their two threatening letters referred to as pamphlets from the FARC dated [XXX] of 2018 and [XXX] of 2019. There are various reports of crime-, of the crime related to the FARC to the police, including the ones made after [XXX] 2018 and on [XXX] 2019. As well as the homicide investigation documents from the police with respect to the murder of the uncle and these include photos and a description of gun-, of his cause of death as a gunshot wound to his face. There\u2019s a copy of the-, of an advice letter from the Minister of Defense from [XXX] of 2019, which is outlining to the claimants steps that they personally should take to try to be safe.\n[4] There\u2019s a dep-, depositions from three former employees that state that they were aware that the FARC had been threatening their employers and the FARC also demanded extortion payments from the workers. I found these documents were relevant and served to corroborate the claimant\u2019s allegations that the family owned a company that was being extorted by the FARC. That they refused to pay the demand and reported the crimes to the police and that their uncle had been murdered for failure to pay the FARC. Victims of crime corruption or vendettas generally cannot establish a link between their fear of persecution and one of the Convention grounds. Although the claimants are clearly politically opposed to the FARC, they were not targeted by the FARC on the basis of their political opinion, but they were targeted for criminal extortion. So, there is no information before me indicating that FARC targeted the claimants by reasons of a Convention ground and accordingly I\u2019ve assessed these claims under Section 97(1) of the Act.\n[5] In order to be considered a person in need of protection under Section 97(1), claimants must demonstrate on a balance of probabilities that they would be subjected personally to a risk to their life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if they\u2019re returned to Co-, Columbia in this case. In addition, in accordance with 97(1)(b)(ii), the risk that the claimant faces must not be one that is faced generally by other individuals in or from Colombia. The claimants have established that they\u2019ve personally been targeted by the FARC group, in fact, the first FARC threat in the form of a pamphlet specifically named the principal claimant, her adult sons, and daughters, and includes the children that is her grandchildren, the minor claimants, in that first pamphlet. The risk the claimants face, I find, is unique to them and it\u2019s significantly greater than the risk faced by others generally within Colombia. On [XXX] of 2018, the first threatening extortion pamphlet from the FARC was delivered to the claimants while they were en route to their summer place about four hours from Bogota. Two men on motorcycles stopped them in their car about an hour away from this summer house to deliver the threat, on [XXX] they noticed motorcycles around their business in Bogota and they informed the police. They also informed police of the first threat, the claimants went to hide at their summer house on [XXX] around 7 o\u2019clock that evening, armed men came to demand the extortion payment and their uncle refused and they murdered him and threatened the entire family, if the payments weren\u2019t made. The claimants reported this to the police and a homicide investigation was opened, the claimants received a number of threatening phone calls over time, where people identifying themselves as being from the FARC, said the claimants should pay or be killed like the uncle and there was nowhere they could hide. And the FARC gave specific details about the family that made the family believe that the FARC was monitoring them.\n[6] The claimants attempted to hide in [XXX] from [XXX] to [XXX] of 2019, this is the same province as the city of [XXX]. They continued to receive threats and warnings to pay, they then returned for a short time to Bogota, never staying long in one place, as there were legal documents with respect to the business that had to be signed. On [XXX] 2019 they received a second pamphlet from the FARC which named them as military objectives and warned their employees and they-, sorry they warned their employees, closed the business, and went to the police that same day to report this new threat. The police warned them that as the threats specified they were now considered FARC military objectives, there is nowhere safe in Colombia and they should leave the country. The police did provide them advice on how to be safe but essentially, it\u2019s a self-protection type of advice that was provided, such as avoiding travel routines, routes used for transportation, et cetera, carry with you an effective device of communication, if you\u2019re at a traffic light, when you\u2019ve had to stop or stop signs et cetera, look around to see if there\u2019s anything suspicious and be ready to keep driving, and share these safety measures that you adopt yourself with your-, your family.\n[7] So clearly, the police themselves were not willing or able to more than to just give advice on what the claimants themselves could do to try to stay safe. The claimants fled to hide with a friend in Cartagena, the designated rep for the two minor claimants, their mother, was separated from her former husband and it took some time for her to locate him and get his permission to take the minor claimants out of the country. This delayed the family\u2019s departure, they received the authorization from the ex-husband on [XXX] the [XXX] of 2019 and left for Canada on [XXX] of 2019. The minor claimant\u2019s mother said that she had notarized documents giving her ex-husband\u2019s permission to remove the children from the country and that it\u2019d been necessary for her to show these documents while exiting Colombia and entering Canada. She did not have these notarized documents with her at the hearing but offered to provide them as she had them at home in Canada. On a balance of probabilities, I am satisfied that she did have authorization from the minor claimant\u2019s father to take the two minor claimants out of Colombia.\n[8] The NDP 7.2 talks about the criminal groups and says that they pursue function of ter-, functions of territorial, social and economic control exerted by violent means. Their activities include murders, smuggling, drug trafficking, kidnapping, human trafficking and so on. They\u2019re known to establish illegal checkpoint, enter private homes, and monitor private communications. NDP 7.18 states that initially the November 2016 peace process with the FARC brought over 11,000 members back to civilian life. At that time there were around 1,000 FARC dissidents who refused to cooperate and were acting in fact as de facto rulers in their desperate territories. Despite their origins, many of these dissident groups were even more abusive than the predecessors as they compete among themselves, sometimes brutalizing local communities to maintain their control. After the peace accord, the situation has worsened and there are more FARC members leaving the peace process, in spite of a concerted effort by the Colombian government with over 10 billion in U.S. assistance over the past 15 years. The rebel FARC group still operated in a large proportion of Colombia\u2019s 32 departments and currently was estimated to have about 8,000 gorillas in its ranks, and this is more, this is a post peace accord document NDP 4.5. I note also maps showing dissident elements of FARC scattered throughout the country and NDP 1.2 stated that following the demobilization of the FARC in 2017 dissidents formed groups throughout Colombia. So, there\u2019s plenty of evidence that indeed these FARC dissident groups are operational widely in Colombia.\n[9] NDP 7.21 states that the FARC is known to issue threats declaring people military objectives. When a person is declared a military objective, it means that they\u2019ve been issued a threat to be killed. When a person is a military objective their life, physical integrity, and freedom are endangered and this threat also extends to their family. These declarations can come in many forms, including the pamphlets or-, or essentially, they appear to be letters from the FARC, that the claimants received. Based on the claimants\u2019 testimony and supporting documents and the country conditions documents, I\u2019m satisfied on a balance of probabilities the claimants would be subjected personally to a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment at the hands of the dissident FARC if they return to Colombia.\n[10] Now except in situations where state is in complete breakdown, states are presumed capable to protect their citizens. To rebut this presumption the onus is on the claimant to establish on a balance of probabilities with clear and convincing evidence that their State\u2019s protection is inadequate. So, we look at country documentation, it states that a citizen, not in a position of power or in the judiciary, might not receive protection from the police or other forces, this is NDP 7.21. The a-,which is a response to information request from the IRB, one of the people the IRB spoke to was an assistant professor who said relocation within Colombia is not an option for those who\u2019ve been declared a military objective because paramilitary and guerilla structures have extended vertical organizations and large networks. As previously discussed, the FARC has wide reach in the country despite the State\u2019s efforts, after they received the first FARC pamphlet and reported it to the police, the claimant\u2019s uncle was murdered and the murder has not been solved. The FARC was able to locate the claimants in a number of places previously, the claimants describe how they were advised by police to leave the country after they were declared military objectives in the second pamphlet from the FARC. And this is in line with the country documentation that states that there is nowhere internally they can relocate and this would be despite the fact that there is a functioning state with some degree of state protection. The claimants also provided an Exhibit for that copy that I\u2019ve referred to previously on the standardized advice police give to people at risk such as the claimants and it\u2019s basically just self-care. The claimants had already been taking similar measures before they received the second pamphlet from the FARC, while stopped at an intersection in Bogota.\n[11] Satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the State of Colombia is unable to provide adequate protection to these claimants, if they return to Colombia and accordingly, I find that there is no adequate state protection for these claimants. Now, an internal flight alternative arises if a claimant who otherwise meets all the elements of a definition of someone who needs protection in their home area of a country, nevertheless, couldn\u2019t-, could live safely elsewhere in that country and therefore would not be in need protection. There is a legal test which has two prongs, on the first prong I\u2019d have to be satisfied that there would be a place in the country where the claimants could safely relocate. As well, conditions in that part of the country would have to be such that they weren\u2019t unreasonable, in all circumstances, including those particular to the claimants for them to go there and seek refuge there. Well, the FARC has shown persistence in tracking these claimants over a period of time, twice finding them while traveling on the roads, and the FARC have indicated that they have details about the family members. Furthermore, they did not hesitate to kill the uncle when he refused their extortion demands, I\u2019m satisfied that FARC has both motivation and means to harm the claimants. Furthermore, the country documents as previously discussed, shows that FARC is widely active in Colombia in spite of the 2016 peace accord. As well, the country documents previously discussed showed that for those declared military objectives, as these claimants have been, there is no viable IFA. They are not safe anywhere in Colombia.\n[12] Therefore, I find on a balance of probabilities, the claimants would be subjected personally to a risk of life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, if returned to Colombia. And accordingly, I\u2019ve accepted their claims.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n",

The principal claimant worked for the [XXX] for 13 years. He is opposed to President Maduro\u2019s government and fears persecution because of his political views. The claimant does not support any particular political party but has attended several street rallies and protests. While employed with the [XXX] the claimant heard about minor incidents of corruption and reported them to his superior. However, in his last year of working with the company, the claimant noticed some incidents of corruption that involved millions of dollars. He and two other [XXX] worked to expose this corruption in [XXX] of 2018 after the claimant no longer worked there. While the claimant was in the United States, he learned that the [XXX] were arrested, the claimant inquired with a lawyer and after confirming there were no charges against him, returned to Venezuela in [XXX] of 2018.\n[3] The claimant became politically active again upon his return, he began receiving threatening phone calls in [XXX] of 2019, in [XXX] his son was threatened and fled the country. The claimant continued to receive calls in which he was accused of consp-, conspiring against the state and hindering business deals with the [XXX]. The claimants left Venezuela on [XXX] of 2019, they did not claim protection in the United States. They learned that a group of soldiers had visited their home on [XXX], 2019 and confiscated the claimants\u2019 computers. The claimants fear that if they return to Venezuela, they will experience detention, further intimidation, or be killed.\nDetermination\n[4] I find that the claimants are Convention refugees pursuant to Section 97 of the Act for the reasons that follow.\nANALYSIS\n[5] The claimants\u2019 identities have been established today through certified copies of their passports on file and I am satisfied that they are both and as well as the minor claimant, nationals of Venezuela. In terms of credibility, there is a presumption of truth applied to all claimants, unless there is a reason to doubt their allegations. Today, both claimants testified and they were credible and straightforward witnesses, they offered canor-, candid and spontaneous testimony and did not embellish, even when given the opportunity to do so. There were no material contradictions between your testimony and the Basis of Claim forms that would cause me to doubt their allegations.\n[6] The principal claimant testified that he noticed, starting in 2014, that some purchases for the contract of services with [XXX] were taking place in a very irregular manner, outside of Venezuela laws. The claimant testified that this generated some very intense discussions with his boss, who did not respond positively. The claimant refused to approve these processes and so his boss delegated that responsibility to someone else. As the claimant rose in the company, he had access to more and more information. He testified that starting in 2017, he was involved in some very large purchases and noticed that the company was purchasing extremely expensive equipment from out of the country, which in the claimant\u2019s view was unnecessary. He filed a complaint, along with two other employees, [XXX] named [XXX] and [XXX], to the Prevention and Control of Losses in mid-2017. He hoped that this would prompt an investigation and an audit, he met directly with that manager and was hoping that some action would be taken, however, nothing was done. The claimant decided to leave the [XXX] in [XXX] of 2017 because of political pressure and because he had angered some higher up people. He clarified that at that time he had become more politically active, participating in more demonstrations as well as volunteering and coordinating logistics, to ensure people\u2019s presence at demonstrations. He also distributed water and food and would assist people who were injured, the claimant believes that this made him more visible. The claimant testified that he supported all opposition parties, although he did some volunteer work for the Democratic Action Party. After the claimant left the company at the beginning of [XXX] of 2018, the claimant met with the two other [XXX] and gave them some of the additional information he had, to add to their complaint, he then left for the United States to visit his brother. That was when he learned about the detention of [XXX] and that [XXX] had fled the country to avoid detention. The claimant spoke to a lawyer and returned in [XXX] 2018 once he felt it was safe. In [XXX] 2019, the claimant testified that he began to receive threatening phones from the Colectivos.\n[7] The claimant believes that when the armed soldiers visited his home in 2019 that they were searching for some sort of further information about the complaints they had made. When I asked the claimant, what had prompted him to ramp up his political activity in 2017, he testified that through his position with [XXX] he was watching money being given freely to other countries. While people in his country were starving and being denied access to basic services, such as water and healthcare. The claimant spoke of his country as being in the clutches of a dictatorship and a criminal organization, he described Juan Guaid\u00f3 as the only constitutionally legitimate president.\n[8] I also questioned the associate claimant today and she testified that she would accompany her husband in all demonstrations that was also not affiliated with any particular party. The claimant testified that she has never been directly threatened herself but that her children were. She described how at the end of [XXX] of 2019 when the Colectivo-, Colectivos called they threatened their son directly. They knew information about their son, including his routine and his place of study, they then threatened to kill him and he had to leave the country. The associate claimant testified that she participated in approximately 50 to 60 protests, beginning around 2014, she continued her participation, even when her husband was in the United States for several months. And so, I accept that her political opinions exist separate and apart from the principal claimant. She described the regime as malignant, the claimant also believes that their lives would be in danger if they were to return. Finally, the principal claimant testified that his former colleague [XXX] is still in detention to this day.\n[9] I have documentary evidence to corroborate the claim, including an activism certificate from the Democratic Action Party. As well as of-, as a copy of the complaint that the principal claimant made to the prevention and control of lasses. I have several letters corroborating events which took place in Venezuela before the claimants left. Based on the totality of the evidence, I accept that both claimants are opposed to the regime and have expressed anti-government political opinions, both through street protest and in the case of the principal claimant through anti-corruption complaints. Given that the claimants\u2019 house was raided, I also find that the minor claimant has established a subjective fear of returning despite her young age. I find there is a Nexus between the claimants\u2019 allegations on the Convention ground of political opinion. The duty of this Panel is, therefore, to determine whether the claimants\u2019 fears are well-founded, having accepted the claimants\u2019 allegations, I turn to the evidence on the treatment of political opponents in Venezuela.\n[10] The objective evidence before me corroborates the claim, on [XXX] of last year, the government organized snap Presidential elections that were neither free nor fair. Nicol\u00e1s Maduro was re-elected through this deeply flawed political process, which much of the opposition boycotted and the international community condemned, and this can be found at Document 2.1 of the National Documentation Package. The evidence also confirms that several thousand people have been detained in connection with anti\u00adgovernment demonstrations in Venezuela. The government routinely detains political opponents, including lesser-known activists or people whom the government believes have links to the political opposition. The government has issued an indefinite ban on all protests.\n[11] According to a report by Freedom House, also in the NDP, Venezuela is one of two countries in the Western hemisphere along with Cuba to be rated as not free by Freedom House. Political prisoners are subject to torture and other human rights abuses. There is pervasive corruption and impunity among all security forces and in government offices. Several hundred people have been killed or harmed in protests. Non\u00ad-governmental organizations also publish reports that authorities generally mistreat, abuse, and threaten to kill detainees. Civilian political prisoners were routinely held in military prisons, those found guilty of insulting the President are subject to lengthy prison terms in abhorred conditions. Opponents of the government are frequently harassed and intimidated by the National Guard, the Savane, and members of the Colectivos, family members of political opponents are also targeted.\n[12] Therefore, based on the totality of the evidence before me, I find that the claimants have established through sufficient reliable evidence that they face a serious possibility of persecution if they return to Venezuela because of their opposition to the current government and the evidence establishing that political opponents are persecuted. Further, given that the State is the agent of harm in this case, l find that there is no operationally effective state protection available to the claimants. I also find that there are no internal flight alternatives available to the claimants in their particular circumstances because opponents of the government face a risk of persecution throughout the country. I, therefore, find that the claimants face a serious possibility of persecution in Venezuela, no matter where they live.\nCONCLUSION\n[13] I find that the claimants are Convention refugees pursuant to the Act and the Board, therefore, accepts their claims, today.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n",

To summarize, the claimants fear persecution from Venezuelan authorities due to their political opinion.\n[9] All of the claimants were born in Venezuela and are citizens of Venezuela. The associate claimant and the minor claimants also obtained Colombian citizenship through the Colombian consulate while living in Venezuela. They held a right to Colombian citizenship because the associate claimant\u2019s parents were dual nationals of Venezuela and Colombia.\n[10] In 2005, the associate claimant founded a [XXX] and became its president. From 2007 onwards, the principal claimant also worked there as the company\u2019s [XXX] and [XXX]. The company distributed [XXX] for the [XXX] Venezuelan companies [XXX] and [XXX].\n[11] Since 2012, the adult claimants have been active members and supporters of Primero Justicia, an opposition political party in Venezuela. In [XXX] 2017, the adult claimants attended a large protest against the decision of the Supreme Tribunal of Justice to dissolve the opposition\u00ad led National Assembly. The next day, a plain-clothes police officer named [XXX] overhead the principal claimant discussing the protest with a customer in his store. He subsequently returned with 12 officers, arrested the principal claimant, and seized the store\u2019s merchandise.\n[12] Police interrogated the principal claimant about his participation in the protest. They released him after he agreed to pay a bribe of $[XXX] worth of [XXX]. In [XXX] and [XXX] 2017, COBIS twice returned to the claimants\u2019 store demanding bribes. The second time, the principal claimant refused and filed a complaint about COBIS with the Attorney General\u2019s Office.\n[13] The claimants started having technical problems with an [XXX] which they used to do business with [XXX] The principal claimant made inquiries and the president of [XXX] told him their access was intentionally suspended because the principal claimant had been identified by COBIS as a government opponent.\n[14] In [XXX] 2018, COBIS and four other men stopped all of the claimants in a parking lot when they were leaving a restaurant. COBIS told the principal claimant he was an \u201cenemy of the homeland\u201d who needed to be careful. The principal claimant filed another complaint about COBIS with the Attorney General\u2019s Office.\n[15] On [XXX] 2018, the Bolivarian National Intelligence Service (SEBIN) summoned the principal claimant to an interview, claiming they wanted to gather more information about his two complaints against COBIS. A SEBIN officer asked the principal claimant about his travel history and business activities and accused him of being an American spy. He gave the principal claimant a summons for a second interview about \u201ccrimes against public order and against the nation\u2019s independence and security.\u201d[3] The claimants fled Venezuela on [XXX] 2018.\nIdentity\n[16] The claimants\u2019 identities have been established on a balance of probabilities by copies of their Venezuelan passports.[4]\nCredibility\n[17] I find the claimants to be credible. They provided straightforward and spontaneous testimony. There were no relevant inconsistencies within their testimony or between their testimony and the documentary evidence before me. The claimants also provided a number of documents to support their claim, including:\nThe two complaints made by the principal claimant to the Attorney General\u2019s Office in [XXX] 2017 and [XXX] 2018;Invoices related to the claimants\u2019 business activities with [XXX];The two summons from SEBIN issued to the principal claimant;The adult claimants\u2019 Primero Justicia membership cards.[18] These documents were consistent with the claimants\u2019 allegations and I have no reason to doubt their authenticity. I thus accept the claimants\u2019 evidence as credible and I believe their allegations.\nCountries of Reference: Principal Claimant\n[19] I find on a balance of probabilities that the principal claimant is a national of only Venezuela and that he does not have a right to citizenship in Colombia.\n[20] The principal applicant is married to a Colombian citizen and is the father of three children with Colombian citizenship. He does not currently hold any type of visa or residency permit in Colombia. He testified that when he inquired with officials at the Colombian consulate in Venezuela about how he could obtain residency or citizenship through his family relationships, he was told the process was discretionary and his chances would be \u201cbetter as an investor.\u201d\n[21] The principal claimant\u2019s testimony accords with country condition evidence indicating that the process for him to obtain citizenship in Colombia is discretionary. The National Documentation Package (NDP) for Colombia outlines the steps for him to obtain Colombian citizenship. First, he must apply for a temporary three-year visa. The authorities who process applications for those visas retain discretion to require an interview and additional documentation before granting applications. Second, if he is successful in obtaining a temporary three-year visa, he would become permitted to apply for a five-year resident visa. Third, if he was successful in obtaining the five-year resident visa, he would become permitted to apply for Colombian citizenship.[5]\n[22] Given this evidence, I find on a balance of probabilities that the principal applicant does not have a right to citizenship in Columbia because the right is not automatic under the law.\nCountries of Reference: Associate Claimants\n[23] According to sections 96 and 97 of IRPA, a claimant must establish his or her claim against each country of nationality. The claimants indicated on their Basis of Claim forms and narratives that all of the associate claimants are dual nationals of Colombia and Venezuela. They confirmed this in their oral testimony. I find on a balance of probabilities that the associate claimants are dual nationals of Colombia and Venezuela and must therefore establish their claims against both countries.\nThe Claim Against Venezuela\nWell-Founded Fear Of Persecution\n[24] The claimants have established a well-founded fear of persecution in Venezuela.\n[25] The adult claimants are members of Primerico Justicia, an opposition party, and have demonstrated their opposition to the Venezuelan government by attending public protests. They are known to be politically opposed to the Venezuelan government by members of the police force, by the president of a [XXX] company, and by the SEBIN. Immediately before the claimants fled Venezuela, the SEBIN demonstrated an intention to investigate the principal claimant for \u201ccrimes against public order and against the nation\u2019s independence and security.\u201d[6] SEBIN chose to investigate the principal claimant after he complained about extortion against the [XXX] of which the associate claimant is the president. The adult claimants testified that this investigation shows that Venezuelan authorities have singled them out for political persecution and that their entire family is now at risk.\n[26] Country condition evidence corroborates the claimants\u2019 testimony. According to a report by Human Rights Watch, massive demonstrations against President Nicolas Maduro took place in 2017, fueled by discontent with his authoritarian practices and frustration over Venezuela\u2019s humanitarian crisis.[7] The government responded with \u201cwidespread and systematic use of excessive force and arbitrary detentions against demonstrators,\u201d as well as \u201cpatterns of other human rights violations, including violent house raids, torture and ill-treatment of those detained in connection with the protests.\u201d[8]\n[27] The crackdown subsequently extended beyond the protests. The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) has reported \u201csince the end of July 2017, security forces, notably the intelligence services, have continued to use arbitrary and unlawful detentions as one of the main tools to intimidate and repress the political opposition or any person perceived as a threat to the [g]overnment for expressing dissent or discontent.\u201d[9] Security forces including the SEBIN \u201chave subjected detainees to ill-treatment and torture such as electric shocks, severe beatings, rape, suffocation with plastic bags and chemicals, mock executions and water deprivation.\u201d[10] According to a research report prepared by the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada, sources report that \u201csupporters of the government see Justice First as a \u201cright-wing group\u201d or \u201ccoup-mongers\u201d and an \u201cenemy of the government.\u201d[11]\n[28] I note that the OHCHR has documented cases of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment of detainees\u2019 families and the detention of children.[12] This corroborates the adult claimants\u2019 testimony that their entire family could face persecution if returned to Venezuela.\n[29] I find the evidence before me is adequate to establish that the principal claimant became a target for investigation by SEBIN due to his political opposition to the Venezuelan government and that all of the claimants now have a well-founded fear of politically-motivated persecution from Venezuelan authorities due to their political opinion.\nState Protection\n[30] I find that state protection would not be reasonably forthcoming to the claimants in this case.\n[31] A claimant is required to approach the state for protection if protection might reasonably be forthcoming. However, a claimant is not required to risk their life seeking ineffective protection of a state, merely to demonstrate that ineffectiveness. The jurisprudence indicates that the test for a finding of state protection is whether the protection is adequate. It is not enough for there to be existing relevant legislative or procedural framework for protection if the police or other authorities are not able or willing to effectively implement those protective provisions.\n[32] In this case, when the principal claimant attempted to approach the Attorney General\u2019s office for protection from a police officer who was extorting him, it resulted in SEBIN opening an investigation against the principal claimant for crimes against the state. He received no meaningful protection from the Attorney General\u2019s office.\n[33] Country condition evidence indicates that although arbitrary detention and mistreatment of political dissidents is not legal in Venezuela, this behaviour has been condoned by the state and the state has blocked efforts to hold perpetrators accountable for it. According to the\nOHCHR, efforts made by the Attorney General\u2019s Office to identify state agents who had perpetuated human rights abuses were blocked by Venezuelan security forces \u2013 \u201cparticularly the Bolivarian National Guard.\u201d[13] The OHCHR identified instances where evidence about abuses disappeared from case files and cases where security forces allegedly responsible for killing demonstrators were released despite judicial detention orders. The \u201cOHCHR received information on only one case where investigations had led to the opening of the trial of the alleged perpetrators.\u201d[14]\n[34] Given that the state is the agent of harm in this case and the country condition evidence indicates that state authorities are unwilling to protect the claimants, I find that state protection would not be reasonably forthcoming for them.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[35] I find there is no viable internal flight alternative for the claimants. Venezuelan authorities including the police and the SEBIN are the agents of harm. Venezuela has effective control over the entirety of its own state and there is no evidence before me to suggest that their desire or ability to persecute the claimants would vary from region to region. As such, I find the claimants face a serious possibility of persecution throughout Venezuela.\nThe Claim Against Colombia\nRisk of Harm\n[36] I do not find that the associate claimant or the minor claimants face a well-founded fear of persecution or a risk to their lives, a risk of cruel and unusual punishment, or a risk of torture in Colombia.\n[37] At the hearing, the associate claimant testified she did not wish to return to Colombia because she does not know anybody there and would have difficulty financially supporting herself and her children. She also testified that Venezuelans living in Colombia face discrimination in housing and employment, and she would be readily identifiable as Venezuelan by her accent.\n[38] News articles submitted by the claimants indicate that thousands of Venezuelans have fled their country for Colombia in recent months, with approximately 800,000 Venezuelan migrants (both documented and irregular) currently living there.[15] Some Colombians have expressed xenophobia towards Venezuelans that includes verbal and physical violence, the refusal to rent Venezuelans property, and the refusal to employ Venezuelans.[16] Colombian officials, including the president of Colombia, have denounced xenophobia against Venezuelans and called for tolerance,[17] and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has launched a campaign in Colombia to generate empathy towards Venezuelan migrants.[18]\n[39] Counsel submitted there is a serious possibility that xenophobic discrimination would interfere with the associate claimant\u2019s right to obtain housing and employment in Colombia. Counsel pointed out that these rights are listed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and that board members should consider such international instruments when assessing persecution.\n[40] To be considered persecution, mistreatment must be sufficiently serious. To determine whether mistreatment qualifies as \u201cserious\u201d, I must examine: 1) what interest of the claimant might be harmed; and b) to what extent the subsistence, enjoyment, expression or exercise of that interest might be compromised. While the experiences of persons with similar profiles must be considered in determining whether ill-treatment is systemic, each case must be determined on its own facts.\n[41] I agree with counsel that the right to work and the right to housing are important interests and that in certain cases, inference with those rights can constitute persecution. However, I do not find the evidence adequate to establish that the associate claimants or the minor claimants would face a serious possibility of persecution in Colombia for the following reasons.\n[42] In the present case, neither the principal claimant nor the associate claimant indicated that they feared persecution in Colombia while preparing their Basis of Claim forms. To the contrary, they explicitly said in their narrative that they decided not to move to Colombia because they feared the principal claimant might be deported from there to Venezuela. According to their narrative,\nWhile we were considering ways to leave Venezuela, we considered whether Colombia might be an option. [\u2026] We didn\u2019t want to take the chance of applying for a residency permit [for the principal claimant] and waiting for months only to find out it had been refused. [\u2026] In the meantime, our lives would be in danger in Venezuela. We needed to go somewhere where we knew we would be safe, and protected against removal to Venezuela. It was clear that that [sic] this would not be the case for [the principal claimant] in Colombia, and [our] family was not willing to be separated.[19]\n[43] I sympathise with the claimants\u2019 reluctance to go to Colombia when it was uncertain whether the principal claimant would be able to obtain legal residency there. Given that they have a well-founded fear of persecution in Venezuela, it is reasonable that they would choose not to live in Colombia to avoid the possibility of the principal claimant being deported back to Venezuela. However, there is nothing in the claimants\u2019 narrative to indicate that they ever feared persecution within Colombia.\n[44] I have also considered the associate claimant\u2019s personal circumstances. The associate claimant holds a [XXX] in [XXX] and successfully established a [XXX] business in Venezuela. According to the claimants\u2019 Basis of Claim narrative, this business \u201cthrived\u201d until the [XXX] field became subject to a state monopoly in Venezuela.[20] Although the associate claimant and her children could be identified as Venezuelans by their accents, they also hold the benefit of Colombian citizenship. If returned to Colombia, they would not be crossing the Venezuelan land border with many irregular migrants seeking amnesty, shelter and employment while lacking citizenship status in Colombia. Although they may face xenophobic discrimination, I do not find that their ability to find housing or work would be compromised to a level that rises to persecution.\n[45] For these reasons, I find the evidence insufficient to demonstrate that the associate claimant or the minor claimants would face a serious possibility of persecution in Colombia.\nCONCLUSION\n[46] I find that [XXX] is a Convention refugee and I accept his claim.\n[47] I find that [XXX] and [XXX] are not Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection and I reject their claims.\n[1] Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n[2] Exhibits 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, and 2.5.\n[3] Exhibit 4, page 88.\n[4] Exhibit 1.\n[5] Exhibit 5, National Documentation Package, Colombia, 31 May 2019, tab 3. 7: Requirements and procedures for a person born in another country to Colombian parents to acquire citizenship; requirements and procedures for the spouse and child of a citizen to obtain permanent residency; rights and social benefits available \u2026 Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada. 9 July 2014.

The file number in this matter is TB9-32420. [XXX], you are claiming to be a citizen of Iraq and you are claiming refugee protection pursuant to Section 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[2] Based upon the totality of the oral and documentary evidence provided at the hearing, and before the hearing, I find you to be a Convention refugee pursuant to Section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act for reason of your imputed political opinion. And so, imputed political opinion is just a fancy way of saying what others think you believe. It\u2019s not necessarily what you do believe. But I accept your evidence as credible that others, including the militias that you said have threatened you, believe that you support Jewish influence and foreign influence in Iraq. That\u2019s what I mean by imputed political opinion, it\u2019s not what you actually believe but what others think you believe.\n[3] So, just to review the allegations, you described that in [XXX] 2019 in an outdoor festival in Babel, a discussion between you and your daughter was overheard. You innocently talked about the history of the \u2013 a mosque close to your home. Including the fact that it had originally been settled by Jewish people. When your remarks were overheard, they were misinterpreted including by the sister of a prominent leader of the Militia Group, AAH. When you described that the large mosque near your home had originally been settled on land owned by Jews, she and others loudly denounced you and she said under sharia law people who supp \u2013 such as yourself should be liquidated. You allege that if you return to Iraq, there\u2019s a strong likelihood you will be harmed or killed by militia members who both believe strictly in sharia law and dealing with violence of people \u2013 with people who dissent from those beliefs. You testified there\u2019s no state protection for you and no viable internal flight alternative.\n[4] Your identity as a citizen of Iraq has been established by your testimony and your passport which have been filed as exhibits at the hearing. I find on a balance of probabilities that identity and country of reference in Iraq have been established.\n[5] I find, also, that there\u2019s a nexus between your fear of persecution in Iraq and the political belief that you support Israel and Jewish and foreign influence in Iraq. This political belief has been mistakenly but (unintelligible) described to you by members of AAH. Therefore, I\u2019ve assessed your claim under Section 96 of the IRPA.\n[6] In terms of credibility, I find you to be a very credible and consistent witness. I believe what you\u2019ve \u2013 you\u2019ve told me in your Basis of Claim and your oral testimony. That you have been targeted by extremist militias who somehow believe that you support Jewish influence and foreign influence in Iraq. I accept your evidence that your innocent remarks about the history of a local masque have been misinterpreted as some sort of political statement. Particularly, I accept your account that a week after the \u2013 the remarks, the local mo \u2013 mayor and a militia leader attended your home demanding that you visit the local militia headquarters to discuss your comments. Indicating that, as a widow who is now [XXX] you wanted your son to attend the meeting with you, you successfully asked for a deferral for 30 hours. You immediately took steps to leave your home. First staying with your son\u2019s friend before taking a flight arranged for you to Canada by your son, in Ottawa. You credibly outlined that if you return to Iraq you face a possibility of being harmed or killed. Not only for being identified as a supporter or foreign interests but for \u2013 for disrespecting the militia, AAH, by failing to show up for the meeting.\n[7] You\u2019ve provided extensive documentation in support of your claim, including multiple identity documents, confirmation of your husband\u2019s untimely death and statements for \u2013 from your son. You\u2019ve also provided country documents showing the influence of militias in Iraq and how dissenters and other activists are dealt with by militias in Iraq. Based upon the evidence provided, I find that your subjective fear of persecution is established by your credible testimony and supporting documents.\n[8] The objective evidence from the NDP for Iraq shows that individuals who are perceived as deviating from religious and political norms are targets for violence. Particularly, women and widows are identified as being vulnerable. Item 5.3 of the NDP states, and I quote \u201cWidows or divorced women can face discrimination or violence on the streets targeted by anti-women death squads who target women they believe to be acting contrary to Islam.\u201d Based upon the objective documentation in the NDP, as well as your credible evidence, I\u2019m satisfied your fear of persecution is well founded and that you would face violence at the hands of militias if you were to return. Accordingly, I find that you have established a well\u00ad founded fear of persecution in Iraq on the grounds of your imputed political belief.\nState Protection\n[9] The obj \u2013 objective documentation from Iraq indicates widespread violence in various areas of Iraq with little reliable state protection available. The security \u2013 the NDP also supports your oral evidence that protection from authorities in Iraq is complicated by the fact that a number of militias have been recruited to be part of the government apparatus. Given the widespread incidence of violence in Iraq and the objective documentation confirming limited protection and resources for people like you who need help, I find that the presumption of state protection is rebutted in this case and that there will be no adequate state protection available to you if you were to return.\n[10] I\u2019ve also considered whether there is viable state \u2013 internal flight alternatives for you if you were to return. You are a widow currently in your [XXX]. You have credibly testified that realistically, there is nowhere else for you to live on your own in Iraq and to be away from harm. Particularly as you testified you had no male sponsor at the time you lived in Iraq. As 5.3 of the NDP points out, women are restricted in their movement and choice of where to live under the personal status law. Based upon your credible evidence provided, including the fact that the conditions described in the objective documentation seemed to prevail throughout the Country, and specific to your circumstances that the options for widows and single women are limited in Iraq, I\u2019m satisfied there is a serious possibility of persecution for you throughout Iraq and therefore you have no viable internal flight alternative.\n[11] So, based upon the totality of evidence before me, I conclude that you face a serious possibility of persecution on the grounds of imputed political opinion in Iraq and therefore I find you to be a Convention refugee pursuant to Section 96 of the IRPA. In short, I accept your claim.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n",

He has made a refugee protection claim under Sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nAllegations\n[3] The specifics of the claim are stated in the claimant\u2019s narrative and amended narrative, of course, the narrative is found in his Basis of Claim form (BOC). He alleges the following:\n[4] He is a citizen of Iran. He has recently been divorced. He is a well-educated individual. He has an [XXX] in [XXX] as well as a [XXX] an [XXX] in [XXX]. He has worked in Iran as a [XXX] for at least, maybe, eight years. However, I don\u2019t think he would disagree by saying that he is more of a [XXX] than anything else.\n[5] He fears to return to Iran. He fears the Iranian government; that he has been targeted, persecuted, by the Iranian authorities due to his affiliation to [XXX] and, also due to his religious affiliation, that he is Dervish Sufi.\n[6] He is, what I would describe as, an accomplished [XXX] who has gone through, what I would say, a formal background, a formal teaching, in [XXX]. He didn\u2019t go to university for that. He has won, what sounds like, local and regional, maybe even national, [XXX]. He has entertained abroad. His group \u2013 he has produced at least [XXX].\n[7] In about 2010 he, how he would describe it, officially became Dervish. Although, he was interested in learning and participating in the Dervish community years before that. And, in his particular fact situation, that he has been incarcerated, charged with what I would call fabricated allegations and was sentenced to at least one year in jail. Once released from jail he realized, or even probably before that, that the Iranian authorities would continue to harass, target him, based on his religious affiliation and, also his political affiliation.\n[8] He left Iran on or about [XXX] 2019, and made a claim for refugee protection on or about [XXX] 2019. He left his former wife in Iran with the intention of his former wife coming to Canada and reuniting with him. However, due to pressure from his in-laws, pressure on his wife, and just not the pressure on his wife but the wife, his former wife, herself, due to his activities, due to his religion, due to incarceration, there was a divorce recently.\nDetermination\n[9] The Board finds that the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to Section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. The reasons are as follows.\nANALYSIS\n[10] The Board is concerned with the issues of credibility and state protection.\nIdentity and Credibility\n[11] The Board was satisfied with the claimant\u2019s personal identity based on his testimony and a certified copy of his passport and other secondary identification documents that were filed on his behalf.\n[12] The Board found the claimant to be a credible and reliable witness. There was no significant differences between his testimony and his narrative and the numerous personal documents filed on his behalf.\n[13] One could describe this claim as a claim that has two premises or two, basically, fears\/reasons why he is leaving Iran and coming to Canada to seek international asylum, refugee protection. One, being a [XXX] which that his [XXX] doesn\u2019t fit within the context of Iranian society and the rigid perception and attitude of the Iranian authorities towards [XXX] and, well, [XXX]. Second, is that he is Dervish, he\u2019s Sufi. In fact, in his testimony, which again the Board found credible, he sort of put the two together as well, that they mesh, that being Sufi, being Dervish, and the meditation process, the calmness, the peacefulness, erased blocks and made him a better [XXX]. And he indicated that his [XXX] was not for the regime, it was not for anyone but himself and his spiritual beliefs and his worship to humanity and that includes God. And because of these two purposes, these two reasons, he is being pursued, harassed, by the authorities.\n[14] The Board found that he is indeed a [XXX], this is based on his testimony, on the numerous documents, on his activities in Canada, on the documents on the websites that show him as a [XXX]. He is a [XXX], that\u2019s a fact. Regarding his religion, is he Sufi? Is he Dervish? The answer is yes. On the evidentiary standard that this Board has to use, on a balance of probability, he is. I found his testimony when he was talking about, very briefly about, the Dervish principles, the religion, the environment, the culture, I found it to be, for him to be, articulate and not vague in his testimony and there was a truthfulness in his testimony, in his convictions, when he was talking which was certainly, was not made up. So, on a balance of probability, he is Dervish.\n[15] One then looks at the country condition articles and reports that have been filed, both by counsel and the Refugee Protection Division. Well, and one should note particularly for the Refugee Protection Division\u2019s articles, many of those articles are from well respected international human rights organizations like Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and then there\u2019s reports from agencies, state departments, from well-respected Western democracies such as this very country, Canada, Finland, United Kingdom, United States and they all state the same. And what is that? That there is \u2013 that the Dervish community, in fact, one should say all minority religious communities in Iran, are persecuted, are targeted, are looked in a very restrictive way.\n[16] Also, these articles and reports state, again clearly, that musicians are targeted. That, for some reason, the Iranian authorities see musicians as dangerous. Particularly, that they are perceived, that their music touches upon politics, more so freedom of association, freedom of expression; many things that this regime sees as threatening to them. So, the country condition articles, this Board finds that the country condition articles, his testimony, the personal documents filed, finds that if the claimant did return that he would have a well-\u00adfounded fear of persecution.\n[17] I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any need to get into the specifics of the persecutions or the lack of state protection in Iran that is directed towards religious minorities and, in particular, the Dervish community. It\u2019s in many articles. Same with discrimination, harassment that amounts to persecution directed towards musicians. Simply put, what the claimant was testifying to, what his allegations and his claims were stating, is supported by what\u2019s in the country condition articles and reports. The, at best, could be described as a Kangaroo Court that the claimant stood in for a short period of time; it must have been horrific. But again, the country condition articles and reports state exactly that, that that happens. And again, I found the testimony of this particular claimant to be credible.\n[18] So, there\u2019s a \u2013 the claimant has met the presumption that there is no adequate state protection within Iran with clear and convincing evidence, particularly given that the agent of persecution is the state.\n[19] Regarding the issue of internal flight alternatives, well there is none. Why? Because, again, the state is the agent of persecution.\nCONCLUSION\n[20] Based on this brief analysis, the Board finds that the claimant is a Convention refugee and accepts his claim. This hearing is over.\n\n",

So, I would not repeat them all here, but in brief the claimant alleges that he is a devout Ahmadi from Pakistan and that Mullahs and extremists from nearby towns and villages harassed his family and members of the Ahmadi community in general.\n[5] The claimant alleged that anti-Ahmadist laws were used at him and his family members and this increased in frequency.\n[6] He further alleges that he was physically assaulted, his firm was burned down and vandalised and that they were threats of extremist attacks again Ahmadi mosque, businesses, and other institutions in the city.\n[7] The claimant alleges that himself and his family members have faced lifelong discrimination and harassment in Pakistan because of their Ahmadi religion and that due to this persecution, his children all five of them don\u2019t live in Pakistan anymore, they currently live in Canada and Germany.\n[8] The claimant left Pakistan on [XXX] 2019, and made a claim for refugee protection and made the claim for refugee protection in [XXX] 2019.\n[9] The claimant fears harm at the hands of the extremists and also the inability to practice his religion openly and freely without fear in Pakistan.\nANALYSIS:\nPERSONAL IDENTITY:\n[10] I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the claimant has established his personal identity as a citizen of Pakistan based on a certified true copy of his Pakistani passport attached to Exhibit 1. I further find that the claimant is an Ahmadi based on the documentary evidence he submitted into evidence.\nCREDIBILITY:\n[11] Overall, despite the claimant\u2019s age, I found the claimant to be very credible witness on a balance of probabilities on what is core to his claim and also I found the claimant to be able to recall specific incidents that occurred over the years, this also includes incidents that relates to his persecution due to his religion as an Ahmadi from Pakistan.\n[12] I therefore believe what the claimant has alleged in support of his claim.\n[13] The claimant testified in a straightforward manner, there were no relevant inconsistencies in his testimonies or contradictions between this testimony and the other evidence before me that they were not satisfactorily explained.\n[14] The claimant provided sincere and heartfelt oral testimony about his beliefs and the persecution he faced in Pakistan. The claimant\u2019s evidence is not internally inconsistent or implausible or contradicted by documentary evidence or country conditions in Pakistan.\n[15] In coming to my credibility findings, I also considered the numerous specific documents turn out into evidence by the claimant in support of his allegations.\n[16] The panel also does not have sufficient reasons to discount these documents which includes the claimant\u2019s Ahmadi certificate, Ahmadi identity cards from Pakistan and Canada, Ahmadi donation receipts from Pakistan and Canada, Ahmadi executive appointment letter, Ahmadi [XXX] documents, various letters from the Ahmadi [XXX] contained in an old journal, photos with the Ahmadi [XXX], land ownership documents, claimant\u2019s other identity documents.\n[17] Based on all the evidence before me which includes the testimony of the claimant which I found to be credible, I find on a balance of probabilities that the claimant has established his religious profile as an Ahmadi from Pakistan.\nREAVAILMENT:\n[18] I had concerns about the claimant\u2019s reavailment to Pakistan in 2008 and the panel therefore accepts the claimant\u2019s explanation in regard to his re-availment and however finds that the claimant\u2019s reavailment is not determinative of his claim.\n[19] I therefore find on a balance of probabilities that the claimant is credible, accept his allegations as credible and that the claimant has established his subjective fear.\nWELL-FOUNDED FEAR, STATE PROTECTION AND INTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE:\n[20] As it relates to the well-foundedness of the claimant\u2019s fear of persecution, I find that claimant\u2019s subjective fear has an objective basis based on the objective documentary evidence before me on which I would go over.\n[21] In this case, the claimant alleges that he suffered discrimination in daily life in Pakistan and that should he return to Pakistan he would continue to face the societal discrimination and be unable to openly and freely practice his faith without fear and will continue to be target for violence by extremist and Mullahs.\n[22] I find that these allegations are indeed supported by the mutual documentary evidence contained in the National Documentation Package.\n[23] According to the National Documentation Package, Ahmadis in Pakistan are discriminated against in law, also Pakistan laws prohibit Ahmadis from identifying themselves as Muslims.\n[24] Their freedom of religion has been curtailed by series of ordinances, acts and constitutional amendments.\n[25] Also when applying for passport Pakistanis are required to declare that the Mirza Ghulam Ahmad is an imposter prophet and therefore the followers are non-Muslims.\n[26] Ahmadis are also discriminated against by Pakistan society in general and sometimes are also targets for violence by extremists which include being accused of blasphemy.\n[27] According to Item 2.1 of the National Documentation Package, the executive summary sets out the current political and general human rights issues in Pakistan.\n[28] This report confronts that discrimination against religious minorities continued in 2008 in Pakistan and violence and social religious intolerance by militant organization and other non\u00adgovernmental actors contributed to culture of lawlessness in some parts of the country.\n[29] Also, according to 2013 report, AHLC report attached to the National Documentation Package, the Pakistani government proactively victimizes Ahmadis socially, economically, and educationally.\n[30] According to 2015 report by FIDH, discrimination against Ahmadis is enforced through public policies limiting their access to education, professional opportunities and basic political and civil rights, such as pledging, which means if an Ahmadi applicant wishes to identify, that means an Ahamdi, okay, so I leave that.\nVIOLENCE:\n[31] According to the HRCP that\u2019s the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, seven Ahmadis were killed in 2013 and 16 were assaulted, some were nearly fatal injuries on account of their faith also Al\u00ad-Jazeera reports that from January to August 2014, 13 Ahmadis were killed and 12 assaulted for practicing their faith in most were the result of targeted attacks on the individuals.\n[32] These documents clearly demonstrate that Ahmadis are discriminated against in law by society at large in Pakistan and as well are sometimes the targets for violence, abuse by Islamic extremists.\n[33] The document also suggests a recent trend of increasing violence against Ahmadis in Pakistan.\n[34] The aforementioned neutral sources support the claimant\u2019s allegations that the claimant had a serious possibility of suffering serious harm if he were to return to Pakistan.\nSTATE PROTECTION:\n[35] I find that the claimant has established on a balance of probabilities that adequate State protection is not available to him. In this case above, the State is one of the agents of persecution.\nINTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE:\n[36] I find that there is no viable internal flight alternative for the claimant in Pakistan as the State is one of agents of harm.\nCONCLUSION:\n[37] Therefore I determine that the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to Section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act on the basis of his religion and I therefore accept his claim and I therefore find that the claimant is a Convention refugee.\n[38] This will conclude the hearing for today.\n[39] Madam Interpreter, so I said this will conclude the hearing for today, is there anything you need to summarize to him before I formally end the hearing?\n[40] INTERPRETER: Yes, Member, I will summarise everything else and I will give him all the details of what you just said.\n[41] MEMBER: Okay, can you go ahead.\n[42] CLAIMANT: Okay.\n[43] MEMBER: Okay good, so I need to confirm your address, so I have [XXX] okay is that correct?\n[44] CLAIMANT: Yes, it is correct.\n[45] MEMBER: [XXX], okay you will get a copy of the transcribed decision, so this will finally conclude the hearing, I am going to go off the record in the absence of any questions, concerns, okay, thank you everyone. Thank you Madam Interpreter.\n[46] INTERPRETER: Thank you Member, thank you very much.\n[47] MEMBER: Thank you so much, I will be going off the record.\n[48] INTERPRETER: Thank you very much everyone.\n[49] MEMBER: Thank you, bye, bye.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n",

Bonhomme\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Talia Joundi\nCountry: Jordan\nRPD Number: TB9-13034\nAssociated RPD Number(s): TB9-13090, TB9-13117, TB9-13128\nATIP Number: A-2021-01106\nATIP Pages: 000118-000127\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] The claimants, [XXX]and[XXX] are seeking refugee protection from Jordan pursuant to ss. 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (\u201cIRPA\u201d).[1]\n[2] [XXX] is the principal claimant and he is married to [XXX] the associate claimant. Their children are [XXX], and [XXX] the minor claimants. The principal claimant was appointed as the designated representative of the minor claimants.\nDetermination\n[3] The panel finds the principal claimant to be a person in need of protection within the meaning of s.97(1) of the IRPA.\n[4] The panel does not find the associate claimant or minor claimants to be Convention refugees or persons in need of protection.\nAllegations\n[5] The details of the claimants\u2019 allegations are more fully set out in the principal claimant\u2019s Basis of Claim Form (\u201cBOC\u201d) and amended BOC.[2] In short, the principal claimant\u2019s cousin murdered a teenaged neighbour belonging to another tribe. As a result, the principal claimant and his family are being pursued for a revenge killing by the tribe.\n[6] The oldest minor claimant, [XXX], is a citizen of the United States of America. The claimants do not make any allegations against the United States of America.\nAnalysis\nIdentity\n[7] The principal, associate and youngest minor claimants\u2019 personal identities as citizens of Jordan have been established by the principal claimant\u2019s testimony and the certified true copies of their Jordanian passports and Canadian visas on file.[3]\n[8] The panel finds on a balance of probabilities that the principal, associate and youngest minor claimants are who the say they are and that the country of reference for them is Jordan.\n[9] The personal identity of the oldest minor claimant, as a citizen of the United States of America, has been established by the principal claimant\u2019s testimony and the certified true copy of his passport issued by the United States of America on file.[4]\n[10] The panel finds on a balance of probabilities that the oldest minor claimant is who he says he is and that a country of reference for this claimant is the United States of America.\nCredibility\n[11] The determinative issue in this claim is credibility. In making this assessment, the panel has considered all the evidence, including the oral testimony and documentary evidence entered as exhibits as well as post-hearing disclosure. The principal and associate claimants both testified and although there were some inconsistences between the principal claimant\u2019s testimony, the BOCs, and the documentary evidence, the panel finds that there is sufficient documentary evidence and credible testimony going to the core of the claim to overcome the inconsistencies.\n[12] The claimants allege in the BOCs that in [XXX] 2016, the principal claimant\u2019s cousin, [XXX] murdered a seventeen year old named [XXX] by shooting him with a gun resulting in his death eight days later. The cousin and the victim were neighbours in the [XXX] neighbourhood of Irbid. The claimants submitted two news articles closely corroborating the details of the murder, including the timing and location and naming the individuals involved.[5]\n[13] However, the panel does note that there are some inconsistencies between the news sources\u2019 accounts of the aftermath and the claimants\u2019 testimony and BOCs. According to the news reports, the cousin\u2019s [XXX] and the tribe\u2019s hosting place were burned that day, after the victim\u2019s death was announced. According to the BOCs, the principal claimant began receiving weekly phone threats which increased over time and both he and the associate claimant received warnings from neighbours of threats against their lives. At some point, the principal claimant received face to face threats while working, as his job involved [XXX] in the [XXX] neighbourhood. The BOCs allege that the threats turned into action around [XXX] 2016 when the cousin\u2019s store, the clan\u2019s reception home, and the cousin\u2019s brothers\u2019 homes were set on fire. The BOCs do not mention any fires before that time.\n[14] At the hearing, the principal claimant testified that he learned of the shooting that same day as tribe members started to burn things and fire shots. When asked for specifics of what was burned, the principal claimant listed the cousin\u2019s house, two reception homes, and stores. The fires went on for a week after the shooting and after the victim died. This was repeated in [XXX]. When asked to explain this, the principal claimant described how tribe members would set fire to the building, burn it, put out the fire and then burn it again. The principal claimant was asked why he did not indicate in his BOCs that the fires happened the same day as the shooting and he responded that he did not know. When asked why the BOCs only mention fires in [XXX] 2016, the principal claimant responded that the fires increased then. Although the panel does not find that the principal claimant\u2019s explanations are compelling, the panel accepts that there were some fires related to the murder.\n[15] Aside from the timing of the fires, both claimants\u2019 testimony was consistent with the BOCs and with one another. The principal claimant was able to adequately describe in detail the threats he received, both on the phone and in person, and how they changed over time. Furthermore, the claimants have produced a number of documents corroborating various aspects of their claim.\n[16] The principal claimant alleges in his BOCs that he is being targeted because he was particularly close with his cousin and in his testimony, he added that he is a young man distinguishable in the town. The principal claimant is university educated and active in the humanitarian field, having been employed for several years with the [XXX], and later the [XXX]. The claimants submitted a certificate indicating the principal claimant was awarded a [XXX] of [XXX] in 2009 and letters confirming his employment with the [XXX] from [XXX] 2013 to [XXX] 2017 and with the [XXX] from [XXX] 2017 to [XXX] 2018.[6] The claimants submitted a letter from the principal claimant\u2019 s father expressing his fear for his son\u2019s life and that his son\u2019s life is particularly being threatened due to his relationship with the perpetrator of the shooting.[7] The claimants also submitted a letter from the leader of the [XXX] tribe dated [XXX] 2019 confirming the risk of revenge killing to the family members of [XXX] generally, including the claimants.[8]\n[17] The claimants allege that the motivation for the agents of persecution to pursue them increased when another local tribe enacted a revenge murder against another tribe in a similar blood murder situation, a year (in [XXX] 2018) after a sulha (truce) had been reached. The claimants submitted newspaper articles from [XXX] 2017 describing a truce between the two tribes due to the killing of one of the tribe members after a parking dispute. The claimants also submitted a travel advisory from the U.S. Embassy in Jordan in 2017 recommending that U.S. citizens avoid travel to the [XXX] area in Irbid due to violent incidents, including arson and fatalities in [XXX] 2017.[9] At the hearing, the principal claimant explained how word had spread that another tribe had exacted revenge whereas the [XXX] tribe had not yet done so. He testified convincingly that his fear was heightened as a result.\n[18] The claimants resided in the [XXX] neighbourhood. According to the principal claimant\u2019s testimony, it was about a one to two minute walk from where the murder occurred. The claimants moved on at least two occasions to try to ensure their safety; however, the threats followed them. The claimants submitted two tenancy contracts: one from [XXX] 2016 to [XXX] 2017 for an [XXX] address and the other from [XXX] 2018 for an address behind the [XXX] Hospital and close to [XXX] College.[10]\n[19] The claimants alleged that in [XXX] 2019, threatening messages to the principal claimant were received on Facebook and that the principal claimant\u2019s brother continues to receive threats. The claimants submitted communications to the principal claimant from \u201c[XXX]\u201d and from the principal claimant\u2019s brother corroborating this allegation.[11]\nObjective Basis\n[20] Sources in the National Documentation Package for Jordan confirm that revenge is part of tribal practices, including revenge killing. According to an article entitled, \u201cTribal Customary Law in Jordan,\u201d when a murder takes place in a village, the male members of the victim\u2019s family have the right under Bedouin law to murder a male member of the perpetrator\u2019s family. The victim\u2019s family will often choose the most respected member of the perpetrator\u2019s family so as to bring shame on the perpetrator within his own family.[12]\n[21] Counsel for the claimants submitted numerous news articles attesting to the current prevalence of revenge practices in Jordan, including killings and retaliatory fire-setting.[13]\n[22] In considering the mostly credible testimony from the principal and associate claimants, the ample corroborating documentary evidence, and the country conditions, the panel believes what the claimants have alleged in support of the claim in relation to the principal claimant and finds that a personal risk to the principal claimant\u2019s life of a revenge killing by the [XXX] tribe in Jordan is established, on a balance of probabilities.\n[23] The panel finds that there is not sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence to establish on a balance of probabilities that there is a personal risk to the lives, or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, of the associate and youngest minor claimant. There is no evidence of any threats to the youngest minor claimant, a two year old girl. The principal claimant testified emphatically that the tribe would not pick a child to exact revenge upon. The only evidence in relation to the associate claimant are warnings from neighbours of hearing of threats against their lives which the panel finds to be too vague. The principal claimant\u2019s own evidence was that he was specifically targeted due to his relationship with his cousin, his gender and profile in the community, clearly distinguishing him from his wife who is not alleged to have enjoyed a similar relationship with the cousin. There is no evidence in the country conditions of females being targeted for revenge killings for murder.\n[24] The panel does not find that there is any evidence of a nexus to a Convention ground in relation to the associate claimant and youngest minor claimant and therefore the panel finds that the associate claimant and youngest minor claimant are not Convention refugees.\nState protection\n[25] States are presumed to be capable of protecting their own citizens, except in situations where the state is in a state of complete breakdown. To rebut the presumption of state protection, a claimant has to provide clear and convincing evidence of the state\u2019s inability or unwillingness to protect its citizens.\n[26] The claimants\u2019 evidence was that the principal claimant consulted with some friends who work in the police force and was told there was nothing that could be done because he could not be given a personal security guard. The claimants submitted a document from the police directorate in Irbid dated [XXX] 2016 indicating that the principal claimant had requested protection for himself and his family from the [XXX] tribe but that he could not be provided with private protection and that if the identities of the individuals making the threats was known, further steps could be taken.[14]\n[27] In this case, tribal dispute resolution was invoked; however, the process was ineffective to the principal claimant. The claimants submitted a document that was translated as \u201cdeed of tribal truce by admission\u201d issued February 3, 2016 describing a ja\u2019ha between the Al-Rawabdeh tribe and the Al-Irjoob tribe due to the shooting on January 23, 2106 of Ayhan Ali Salah Al-Rawabdeh by Ibrahim Saleh Abdelhafiz Al-Irjoob.[15]\n[28] Sources in the National Documentation Package indicate that although tribal law in Jordan was abolished in 1975, tribal dispute resolution has come to forma prevailing part of the Jordanian culture and customs, despite the fact that it no longer constitutes a part of the Jordanian legal system. This is especially so in relation to blood crimes, honour crimes and conflicts between families.[16] In practise, the legal system defers to tribal customs and practises. Although the tribal dispute resolution process operates outside of and alongside the legal system, the state is often complicit and even active in tribal dispute resolution processes (e.g. police often supervise jalwa, atweh may be supervised by state security forces, state-appointed officials may form part of a jaha, state or members of the royal family may act as waseet).[17]\n[29] Based on the evidence before the panel, the panel finds that in this case the state is unwilling or unable to protect the principal claimant effectively.\n[30] The country information is clear and convincing evidence that rebuts the presumption that adequate state protection is available to the principal claimant in Jordan. The panel therefore finds on a balance of probabilities that the principal claimant cannot access adequate state protection in Jordan.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[31] The panel has also considered whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for the principal claimant. Jordan is a small country. The tribe pursuing the claimants is a powerful and politically influential tribe, counting a former Jordanian Prime Minister as a member. Although the tribe is based in [XXX], members live outside the village. Given the profile of the tribe, the agents of persecution would likely have no difficulty being able to locate the principal claimant throughout the country.\n[32] The panel finds that, on a balance of probabilities, the principal claimant\u2019s life would be at risk throughout Jordan and therefore finds that there is no viable internal flight alternative.\nConclusion\n[33] Based on the totality of the evidence, the panel finds the principal claimant to be a person in need of protection from Jordan and therefore his claim is accepted. The panel finds that the associate claimant and youngest minor claimant are not Convention refugees or persons in need of protection from Jordan and therefore their claims are denied.\n[34] The claimants did not make any allegations of persecution, risk of persecution or risk to life or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in relation to the United States of America in the BOCs. When asked at the hearing what the principal claimant feared for his son in the United States of America, the principal claimant responded that when they lived there, two Muslim girls and a young man were murdered close to where they were living in North Carolina. The principal claimant alleged that it was a racist crime. Without any other evidence, the panel does not find that there is sufficient credible or trustworthy evidence to establish that the oldest minor claimant would face a serious possibility of persecution, nor on a balance of probabilities would he face a risk to life or qa risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or a danger of torture, if he returned to the United States of America.\n[35] The panel finds that the oldest minor claimant is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection from the United States of America and therefore his claim is denied.\n[1] Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c.27, as amended.\n[2] Exhibit 2: Basis of Claim Form (BOC) TB9-13034 and Exhibit 11: Amended Basis of Claim Form (BOC) TB9-13034 dated January 10, 2020.\n[3] Ibid.\n[4] Exhibit 1: Package of information from the referring CBSA\/CIC.\n[5] Exhibit 9: Claimant\u2019s personal documents received January 5, 2020.\n[6] Exhibit 8: Claimants\u2019 disclosure package received January 3, 2020 (personal documents X2 and country conditions X1).\n[7] Exhibit 12: Claimants\u2019 late disclosure (personal document).\n[8] Exhibit 8: Claimants\u2019 disclosure package received January 3, 2020 (personal documents X2 and country conditions X1).\n[9] Ibid.\n[10] Ibid.\n[11] Ibid.\n[12] Exhibit 6: National Documentation Package for Jordan version August 2019, Item 9.1.\n[13] Exhibit 10: Claimants\u2019 disclosure package received January 10, 2020 (personal documents X1 and country conditions X1).\n[14] Exhibit 8: Claimants\u2019 disclosure package received January 3, 2020 (personal documents X2 and country conditions X1).\n[15] Exhibit 10: Claimants\u2019 disclosure package received January 10, 2020 (personal documents X1 and country conditions X1).\n[16] Exhibit 6: National Documentation Package for Jordan version August 2019, Item 9.1.\n[17] Ibid, Item 5.10.\n\n",

Kabateraine\nCountry: China\nRPD Number: TB9-12791\nAssociated RPD Number(s):\nATIP Number: A-2021-01106\nATIP Pages: 000110-000117\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] [XXX] (the claimant) claims to be a citizen of China and is claiming refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (\u201cthe Act\u201d)[1].\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] The claimant\u2019s allegations are fully set out in the Basis of Claim form (BOC). In summary, the claimant alleges a fear of persecution in China at the hands of the government due to his membership in the particular social group of Falun Gong practitioners.\nDETERMINATION\n[3] I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the Act.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[4] The claimant\u2019s personal and national identity as a citizen of China has been established on a balance of probabilities by his resident identity card[2], hukou and oral testimony[3].\nCredibility\n[5] When a claimant swears that certain facts are true, this creates a presumption of truth unless there is valid reason to doubt their veracity.\nThe claimant practiced Falun Gong in China\n[6] I find that the claimant was introduced to Falun Gong in [XXX] 2018. He testified that he went to a park near his family home on weekends when he visited and observed people doing exercises. He testified that after speaking with one of the practitioners he confided in him that he was diagnosed with Hepatitis B which was not responding well to treatment. During his testimony, the claimant testified that he spoke with the group leader in [XXX] 2018. When confronted with the discrepancy between his narrative where he states he was introduced to the group leader on [XXX] 2018 and not [XXX] 2018, the claimant said that he was not formally introduced in [XXX] but merely chatted informally with the group leader. I reject the claimant\u2019s explanation. The claimant is well educated. He has a [XXX] in [XXX] and worked as an [XXX] and [XXX] in China. He is [XXX] years old. His narrative specifically states that he was approached by the leader on or about [XXX] 2018. There is no mention about any prior communication only that the claimant was watching people doing exercises. Taking into account, the claimant\u2019s education and work history, his explanation for an omission about a central event in his claim is not credible. I draw a negative inference.\n[7] The claimant testified that he joined the group practice in a corner of a park in his neighbourhood. When asked if he had any concerns about practicing in a public space considering that Falun Gong was banned in China, he testified that the group was surrounded by trees and it would be difficult to see what the group was doing and the group kept the size to six people. The claimant said he practiced with the group for about a month on Saturdays.\n[8] I find on a balance of probabilities that the claimant was introduced to Falun Gong in China and joined the group practice. Although there are a couple of credibility concerns, the claimant described how he was taught exercise one in a very detailed and spontaneous manner which is consistent with the Falun Gong text[4] and his testimony was generally consistent with his narrative. He submitted a medical record which indicates his diagnosis date and repeated treatments for persistent Hepatitis B which are consistent with his narrative[5]. Therefore, the credibility concerns are insufficient to undermine his overall testimony about his introduction to and practice of Falun Gong in China.\nThe claimant feared arrest by the PSB in China\n[9] The claimant testified that there was an incident on [XXX] 2018 which caused him to stop group practice. He testified that he was at a convenience store near the park where he practiced and saw PSB officers and vehicles outside. He said the store staff told him that some people involved in an evil cult were arrested at the park plaza and some escaped but the PSB said they would be caught and arrested. The claimant testified that he had no way to contact the group leader and since he had provided the leader with his name and address, he decided to stop group practice and instead practiced alone at home.\nThe claimant omitted his resignation from his job after [XXX] 2018\n[10] The claimant testified that he resigned from his job but continued to live at his rented apartment which was close to his place of work. The claimant did not mention that he stopped working in his narrative. When confronted with this omission, he testified that he did not think this was an important detail. The claimant also failed to indicate that he stopped working in [XXX] 2018 in his immigration forms but instead indicated that he continued to work until [XXX] 2018 at which time he left China. When confronted with this discrepancy, the claimant testified that he made a mistake. I reject the claimant\u2019s explanation. Deciding to resign from one\u2019s workplace because of fear is a detail which is directly connected to the core of this claim. The claimant was very precise in completion of his immigration forms and he is well educated and worked as an accountant, a profession that is focused on details. I draw a negative inference from this omission and discrepancy.\nThe claimant travelled circuitously on route to Canada\n[11] The claimant testified that an agent arranged for his departure from China. He said he left China on [XXX] 2018 and travelled through a number of Caribbean countries staying from a month to several months in each country before arriving in Canada on [XXX] 2019. When asked about this lengthy and circuitous journey, the claimant testified that he did not know the reason but was following the directions of the agent. The claimant was asked if he questioned the agent about this lengthy route and he said he did and was told not to ask too many questions.\n[12] Since the claimant was reliant on the agent to secure his arrival in Canada, the nine-month delay is reasonable under these circumstances.\nThe claimant is also a genuine Falun Gong practitioner in Canada\n[13] I find that the claimant continues his Falun Gong practice in Canada. He testified that he continued to practice Falun Gong in Canada. He said he attends group practice at Milliken Park, distributes pamphlets and attends group study. The claimant provided detailed testimony about his first practice at Milliken Park and described taking the bus there and hearing the Falun Gong music as he walked through the park. He said he purchased Zhuan Falun and the Great Consummation Way of Falun Dafa at Pacific Mall. The claimant testified that he attends group practice weekly except on rainy days and he said he stopped attending once the COVID-19 lockdowns occurred. Overall his testimony was spontaneous, detailed and he elaborated with additional details when they were requested. He also submitted photos and a letter from a fellow practitioner to support his testimony[6].\nClaimant demonstrated knowledge of Falun Gong consistent with his profile\n[14] I find that the claimant demonstrated Falun Gong knowledge commensurate with his profile. The claimant testified about jealousy being the most harmful attachment and explained in great detail how this attachment impedes cultivation and why it is prevalent in Chinese culture. He described the three principles and how they affect mind nature, explained the origins of karma and the purpose of the exercises. He provided an example of how he incorporates the principle of truth in his life and correctly explained that the exercises are not for the purpose of healing rather to purify the body. The claimant also explained the purpose of sending righteous thoughts and described activities such as attendance at a rally on World Falun Dafa Day and distribution of pamphlets to clarify the truth. The claimant\u2019s testimony was very detailed, spontaneous and demonstrated in-depth knowledge about Falun Dafa.\n[15] When asked if he would continue to practice Falun Gong if he returned to China, the claimant responded in the affirmative and explained that his energy level is low and must be increased and also if he stopped practice, his karma would return and create adverse affects on his health.\nObjective Basis\n[16] The objective evidence is consistent with the claimant\u2019s account of fearing persecution as a Falun Gong practitioner in China[7].\n[17] At item 2.1 of the NDP, the US Department of State confirms that the People\u2019s Republic of China, is an authoritarian state in which the Chinese Communist Party, the CCP, is the paramount authority. Repression and coercion persist, including against members of banned religions and\/or spiritual practices such as Falun Gong.\n[18] An IRB Response to Information Request or RIR[8] on the treatment of Falun Gong practitioners contains information that further confirms there is a serious possibility that the practice of Falun Gong will be met with persecution.\n[19] Chinese authorities continue to label Falun Gong an \u2018evil cult\u2019 in China. In particular, items 2.1 and 12.23 of the NDP reference the State\u2019s use of harassment, intimidation, imprisonment and torture against Falun Gong practitioners. The 2019 Commission on International Religious Freedom, item 12.2, indicates that as of February 1, 2018 new regulations on religious affairs came into effect detailing strict registration criteria for religious organizations. The regulations ban unauthorized religious teaching and expands the role of local authorities in controlling religious activities. Further as of March 2018, jurisdiction over religious affairs was transferred from the State Administration of Religious Affairs (SARA) to the United Front Work Department (UFWD), an organ of the CCP. International criticism of China increased during the latter half of 2018 as the scale of government crackdown on religious freedom became widely publicized.\n[20] I find that the claimant\u2019s fear of persecution because of his Falun Gong practice has an objective basis and is well-founded, especially since he has credibly established that he was a Falun Gong practitioner in China and continues to practice in Canada.\nState Protection\n[21] A state, unless in a condition of complete breakdown, is presumed to be capable of protecting its citizens. To rebut the presumption of state protection, a claimant must provide clear and convincing confirmation of the state\u2019s inability to protect its citizens.\n[22] Given that the state is the agent of persecution, I find that it would be objectively unreasonable for the claimant to seek the protection of the state in his circumstances, and that adequate state protection would not be reasonably forthcoming.\nInternal Flight Alternative (IFA)\n[23] Given that the state is the agent of persecution with control over the entire country, I find that there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout China and therefore a viable IFA does not exist.\nCONCLUSION\n[24] Having considered all of the evidence, I find that there is a serious possibility that the claimant would face persecution in China. I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee and I accept his claim.\n[1] Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27, as amended, sections 96 and 97(1)\n[2] Exhibit 1\n[3] Exhibit 4\n[4] Exhibit 3, Item 12.7\n[5] Exhibit 4\n[6] Exhibit 4\n[7] Exhibit 3\n[8] Exhibit 3, Item 12.9\n\n",

I have considered your testimony and the other evidence and will render my decision now orally. I find that you are a Convention refugee as you have established a serious possibility of persecution in China based on your religion. Namely, being a member of the Church of Almighty God.\n[2] Your allegations were documented in the Basis of Claim form. In summary, you are a citizen of China who fears persecution in China because you practice your religion as a member of the Church of Almighty God. You alleged that if you return to China, you will be targeted by the Chinese government for your involvement in the Church of Almighty God and will be arrested. You alleged that there is no state protection or an internal flight alternative for you.\n[3] Your personal identity has been established by your testimony and supporting documents filed in the exhibits. Specifically, a certified copy of your passport at Exhibit 1 in addition to your original resident identification card, a copy of which is at Exhibit 5. I find that on a balance of probabilities your identity and country of reference have been established. I find that there is a link between what you fear and one of the five Convention grounds, namely religion by virtue of the fact that you are a practicing Christian who practices in the Church of Almighty God. As such, I have assessed your claim under Section 96.\n[4] I have found you to be a credible witness and I therefore believe what you alleged in your oral testimony and in the Basis of Claim form. Your claim is supported by documents including a letter from the church leader of your current church in Toronto. As well as a letter of support from four fellow church members. You also provided photos of you with your fellow church members and participation in a human rights demonstration at Old City Hall at which you were demonstrating for China to return freedom of speech and religion to the Chinese people.\n[5] Your claim was also well supported by your knowledge of the tenets of the Church of Almighty God. You were able to speak knowledgeably and spontaneously about the faith. Including about the several different books of faith you read, the preaching you do in public by talking to others about God\u2019s word. As well as where and how often you meet to discuss your faith and share your experiences.\n[6] In addition, you spoke about accessing the Church\u2019s websites and YouTube to watch different types of singing and skits about the Church of Almighty God which you would not be able to do in China. You also had a support witness, [XXX] (ph) who said she met you when you first came to Canada. She came to Canada in 2016 and has been a member of the Church of Almighty God in Canada since that time. She was granted refugee status in Canada having also claimed on the basis of her religion. She meets together with you and others twice a week to discuss the faith and share your experiences. You also preach in public together by getting friendly with people who will talk to you and then broaching the subject of God.\n[7] The Panel finds on a balance of probabilities that you were and are a practicing Christian. Practicing in the Church of Almighty God who holds views that have been outlawed in China.\n[8] On an objective basis, it is known from page 5 of Section 12.1 of the National Documentation Package for China, the NDP. Namely, the 2018 U.S. State Department report that the Chinese government considers the Church of Almighty God to be an evil cult. In addition, counsel filed additional country documentation. Namely an excerpt from Bitter Winter. It states that in October 2018, in Anhui province where the claimant lived, the provincial authorities launched an arrest operation of believers that belonged to the Church of Almighty God in multiple cities. Calculations put the number of members arrested in a two-week span at more than 100. And more than 500 left their homes and went into hiding.\n[9] Finally, in Section 12.3 of the NDP it was reported at page 24 of the 2018 Annual Report on Chinese Government Persecution of Churches and Christians in Mainland China that a meeting was held in Jiangsu province to promote the sinicization of Christianity. Making it clear that that means changing Christianity in China to Chinese Christianity. Amnesty International also reported at Section 2.2, page 4 of the NDP that in June, the State Council passed the revised regulations on religious affairs to come into effect on the 1st of February 2018. It codified far-reaching State control over every aspect of religious practice. And extended power to authorities at all levels of the government to monitor, control and potentially punish religious practice.\n[10] I find that you would not be able to practice Christianity in the Church of Almighty God freely in China without fear of repercussions. As such, I find that you have established an objective basis for your fear of persecution on a balance of probabilities.\n[11] In summary, I find that you have a well-founded fear of persecution. I find that China is enforcing the law against unauthorized religious practice. And does not sanction churches that are not registered which includes the Church of Almighty God.\n[12] As such, I find that there is no state protection available to you. I have also considered if there\u2019s an internal flight alternative for you. I find that there is no internal flight alternative. Again, because the Chinese government is the agent of persecution and exists in all parts of the country. Therefore, it is not safe anywhere for you.\n[13] Based on the totality of the evidence, I find that you are a Convention refugee because of a serious possibility of persecution. And I accept your claim.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n",

I therefore find it objectively unreasonable for you to seek the protection of the state.\n[32] I further find that the agent of persecution is the state and they are in control over the whole state.\n[33] So, I find that there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout the country and that there is no internal flight alternative for you.\n[34] Based on the foregoing analysis, and considering the totality of the evidence before me, I conclude that you are Convention refugee because you face a serious possibility of persecution in China.\n[35] I accept your claim.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n",

Seevaratnam\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Jared Will\nCountry: Mexico\nRPD Number: TB9-08058\nAssociated RPD Number(s):\nATIP Number: A-2021-01106\nATIP Pages: 000093-000102\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] The claimant, [XXX], claims to be a citizen of Mexico and is claiming protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).[1]\n[2] The claimant alleges she fears returning to Mexico due to her imputed and real political opinion and her membership in a particular social group, a woman.\n[3] The panel has also carefully considered the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 4: Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution, prior to assessing the merits of this claim.[2]\nALLEGATIONS\n[4] The details of the allegations are outlined in the claimant\u2019s Basis of Claim (BOC) Form and the amended Narrative.[3] A synopsis of the allegations are as follows.\n[5] The claimant testified that she grew up in a family which supported the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), and she was introduced to the party by family friends around 2012.[4] She officially joined the party in 2016.[5] She further testified that the party was actively recruiting young people in order to expand its support base. They were expected to follow the political line of [XXX],[6] the former Governor of Hidalgo from 2005 \u2013 2011.[7]\n[6] Through her sister, [XXX], and brother-in-law, [XXX][8] she was introduced to high level politicians both at the Federal and State levels. She gradually became a trusted member of the PRI inner circle.\n[7] The claimant was in a romantic relationship with [XXX], the brother of [XXX], from 2013 until 2016. The claimant testified that the [XXX] brothers were wealthy, influential, and powerful.\n[8] The claimant explained that during and following their intimate relationship, she discovered \u201cmany unsavoury things about [XXX]. He is a very corrupt person and made his money largely by diverting public fonds he owns and controls a number of newspapers but hides his interest in the papers, as he does in other businesses that he controls. He uses other peoples\u2019 identities and operates shell businesses that he controls.\u201d[9] The claimant detailed numerous other instances of corruption and extravagant spending diverting federal public fonds.\n[9] From [XXX] to [XXX] 2016, the claimant worked on the social media team for [XXX] the PRI candidate in Hidalgo.[10] The claimant explained that she knew [XXX] socially through events at her sister\u2019s home. She further explained that [XXX] was a close friend of her brother-in-law and he played a significant role at their wedding. Thus, when [XXX] was elected the [XXX] of Hidalgo in [XXX] 2016, she was disappointed that she was not rewarded with a job in the state government. She was instructed to pursue employment opportunities with his private secretary, [XXX]. He pressured the claimant to engage in an intimate relationship which she refused.[11] The claimant knew as a member of the inner trusted circle within the PRI that [XXX] and [XXX] had been lovers.[12] She explained that this was not common public knowledge and his sexual orientation (bisexual) could ruin his political career.\n[10] In 2017, the claimant became a victim of sexual harassment, theft, and stalking. She retained a lawyer and lodged a complaint with the office of the Attorney General, City of Hidalgo. After about a year, she was advised by her lawyer to drop the charges since she was being pursued by state and federal government officials. She suspected [XXX] or [XXX] as the perpetrators. Fearing for her life, the claimant fled to Canada and initiated a refugee claim.\nDETERMINATION\n[11] The panel finds the claimant to be a Convention refugee. The panel\u2019s reasons are as follows.\nIDENTITY\n[12] In Exhibit 1, the claimant has submitted a copy of her passport issued by the United Mexican States, which was certified as a true copy by an immigration officer on [XXX] 2019.[13]\n[13] In Exhibit 7, the claimant has submitted a copy of her birth certificate,[14] her membership card with the PRI,[15] and her record of employment with the government of Mexico.[16]\n[14] The panel finds the claimant to be a national of Mexico. The panel further finds that the claimant was an active member of PRI and was employed with the government of Mexico.\nCREDIBILITY\n[15] The panel is cognizant of the leading jurisprudence on the issue of credibility. Maldonado[17] stands for the principle that when a claimant swears to the truth of certain allegations, this creates a presumption that those allegations are true unless there is reason to doubt their truthfulness.\n[16] The claimant provided clear and detailed testimony regarding her experiences in Mexico and her involvement with the PRI and its inner circle. Her testimony was consistent with her Basis of Claim (BOC) Form,[18] her amended BOC narrative,[19] her personal documents,[20] as well as country condition documents provided by counsel,[21] and the National Documentation Package (NDP).[22]\n[17] Having considered the totality of the evidence, the panel finds the claimant to be a credible and trustworthy witness. Accordingly, the claimant has established her subjective fear.\nWELL-FOUNDED FEAR OF PERSECUTION\n[18] Commencing in early [XXX] 2017, the claimant became a victim of an attempted armed robbery; her cell phone was stolen, and she became the subject of a scandal on Facebook where altered nude photos were posted.[23]\n[19] The claimant reached out to her mother for assistance who contacted a lawyer, [XXX]. He made arrangement for the claimant to make a report on [XXX] 2017 with the Attorney General\u2019s Office (PGR, Procuraduria General de la Republica), State of Hidalgo.[24]\n[20] Subsequent to filing the report, the claimant received harassing telephone texts from one of the police officers who was present at the PGR when she initiated her complaint.[25] She stated that she also received \u201cmany obscene messages on my cell phone as well as on social media.\u201d[26]\n[21] The claimant feared for her safety and asked [XXX] if he could provide a bodyguard to protect her but he said it was unnecessary.[27]\n[22] In [XXX] 2018, the claimant was followed by a black SUV. The claimant accelerated her vehicle and entered her gated neighbourhood where she resided. She promptly contacted her lawyer, [XXX], to report the incident and obtain an update on the PGR investigation.[28]\n[23] Her lawyer asked the claimant to attend at his office and informed her that senior government officials at both the federal and state levels were instrumental in harassing, defaming, and threatening her. He advised the claimant not to pursue her complaint with the PGR any further.[29] Her lawyer reimbursed all legal fees she had paid to his law firm.[30]\n[24] The claimant suspects that the assailants are retained and their actions are orchestrated by either by [XXX] or [XXX] who are attempting to muzzle her from revealing information she is privy to such as the embezzlement of public federal funds by [XXX] for personal gain and advancement, the sexual orientation of [XXX] (bisexual), his drug use, and his relentless sexual advances towards the claimant, and his belief in \u201csanteria\u201d(witchcraft). The claimant believes that both men are capable of violence and will be vindictive towards her if they suspect the claimant of divulging incriminating information. She explained that they want to maintain their political career and public image since they are both very ambitious and continue to maintain their reign within the PRI apparatus and advance further within the government of Mexico.\n[25] A media report indicates that [XXX] is one of the candidates for mayor of Pachuca in the 2020 elections. The article states that he is the brother of [XXX], the [XXX] of the [XXX] and [XXX].[31]\n[26] The media report dated [XXX] 2019 indicates that [XXX] the right hand man to the [XXX] of Hidalgo, [XXX], is \u201csituated as the likely successor of the [XXX] for the state office\u201d[32] since he has \u201cmarketed himself throughout the entire state.\u201d[33] He is poised to run for [XXX] in 2022.[34]\n[27] The panel has carefully reviewed objective, reliable, and current documentary evidence to assess the objective basis for this claim. Both counsel\u2019s country conditions package on Mexico[35] as well as the NDP indicates that the Mexican political arena is seeped in corruption, impunity, and sexism.\n[28] The US Department of State (DOS) Mexico Country Report on Human Rights 2019 states as follows:\nThere were several reports government entities or their agents committed arbitrary or unlawful killings, often with impunity. Organized criminal groups were implicated in numerous killings, acting with impunity and at times in league with corrupt federal, state, local, and security officials.[36]\n[29] An article titled, \u201cMexican women in politics: no glittering careers and no power\u201d, states as follows:\nMexican women are also barred from politics through pressure that can include political violence (causing damage to their public image), double workloads that prevent them from achieving a work-life balance and even sexual harassment.[37]\n[30] An article dated September 2019, indicates that \u201crampant impunity continues to plague Mexico according to a study that shows there has been negligible improvements in prosecution rates over the past year.\u201d[38]\n[31] International Human Rights Program and Pen Canada for freedom of expression has authored an article titled, \u201cCorruption, Impunity, Silence: The War on Mexico\u2019s Journalists.\u201d[39] The article attributes impunity to the failure by the Mexican authorities to \u201csuccessfully prosecute over 90 percent of the cases brought before them.\u201d[40]\n[32] An article titled, \u201cUnprecedented wave of political violence rocks Mexico\u201d,[41] indicates the following:\nIn less than 24 hours this month, three women running for office in Mexico were murdered bringing the total number of female candidates assassinated to 17.\u201d[42]\nAccording to Senator Martha Tagle, \u201cthese facts revel a serious situation that women in politics are experiencing, and that it is political violence based on gender.\u201d[43]\n[33] The above article sheds light on the role gender violence plays in elections and the specific ways in which women are silenced.[44]\n[34] The panel finds the claimant has established a serious risk of persecution based on her imputed and real political opinion, and her membership in a particular social group, a woman.\nSTATE PROTECTION\n[35] There is a presumption that except in situations where the state is in complete breakdown, the state is capable of protecting its citizens.[45] To rebut the presumption of state protection, a claimant must provide clear and convincing evidence of the state\u2019s inability to protect its citizens.[46]\n[36] The claimant testified that she was defamed,[47] but the police failed to investigate and prosecute the matter since they are in collusion with politicians. She stated that both entities are corrupt.\n[37] The US Department of State (DOS) Mexico Country Report on Human Rights 2019 states as follows:\nSignificant human rights issues included reports of the involvement by police, military, and other government officials and illegal armed groups in unlawful or arbitrary killings, forced disappearance, and torture; harsh and life-threatening prison conditions in some prisons; impunity for violence against human rights defenders and journalists; violence targeting persons with disabilities and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex persons.\nImpunity for human rights abuses remained a problem, with extremely low rates of prosecution for all crimes. The government\u2019s federal statistics agency (INEGI) estimated 94 percent of crimes were either unreported or not investigated.[48]\n[38] An Article titled, \u201cCorruption at a Level of Audacity Never Seen in Mexico\u201d[49] details a scenario similar that of the claimant. It states as follows:\nEmpowered citizens, transparency laws and a freer media are now exposing the schemes that governors have used to siphon public fonds for their private use. But though the scrutiny has produced mounting evidence of misdeeds, the governors have rarely faced justice.\nGovernors who like Presidents serve one six-year term, control state legislatures, state auditors and state prosecutors \u2013 a dominance that gives them the poser of a modern potentate.\nThat leaves it to federal prosecutors to pursue wrong-doing but the response has been tepid.\nDuring the more than 70 years that the party (PRI) governed Mexico without interruption, it became synonymous with corruption.\n[39] The panel finds that the claimant fears persecution or serious harm at the hands of the state and federal high ranking and influential politicians; therefore, based on objective and current documentary evidence,[50] and her sworn viva voce evidence, she cannot avail herself of the protection of the authorities. The security forces have failed to protect the claimant.\nINTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE (IFA)\n[40] The Federal Court of Appeal established a two-part test for assessing an IFA in\nRasaratnam and Thirunavukkarasu:\n(1) As per Rasaratnam, \u201cthe Board must be satisfied on a balance of probabilities that there is no serious possibility of the claimant being persecuted in the part of the country to which it finds an IFA exists\u201d[51] and\/or the claimant would not be personally subject to a risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture in the IFA.\n(2) Moreover, the conditions in the part of the country considered to be an IFA must be such that it would not be unreasonable in all the circumstances including those particular to the claim, for him to seek refuge there.[52]\n[41] The claimant bears the burden of proof to demonstrate that she would be persecuted on a Convention ground, or subject personally, on a balance of probabilities, to a risk to life, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in all of Mexico.\n[42] The panel identified the Yucatan region as a potential place for internal relocation because the Mexico Peace Index 2019 identified this region as being the least impacted by crime.[53]\n[43] The claimant testified that the [XXX] brothers own property in the Yucatan region and their influence and power reaches throughout Mexico.\n[44] The panel finds that an IFA is not reasonable given the particular profile of the claimant who is a young single woman being pursued by high level state and federal PRI politicians specifically [XXX] and [XXX] who yield enormous power and influence nationally. Since the claimant fears persecution or serious harm at the hands of individuals who are synonymous with corruption and the state, she will not be able to internally relocate to escape that risk.\nCONCLUSION\n[45] For the above mentioned reasons, the panel finds [XXX] to be a Convention refugee. The claimant has established that there is a reasonable chance of persecution, if she were to return to her country of nationality, Mexico, today.\n[1] The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), S.C. 2001, c.27, as amended, sections 96 and 97(1).\n[2] Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 4: Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution: Update, Guideline Issued by the Chairperson Pursuant to section 65(3) of the Immigration Act, IRB, Ottawa, November 25, 1996, as continued in effect by the Chairperson on June 28, 2002, under the authority found in section 159(1)(h) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[3] Exhibit 2, Basis of Claim (BOC) Form, Narrative, received March 27, 2019; Exhibit 5, BOC Narrative Amendments, received February 4, 2020.\n[4] Exhibit 5, BOC Narrative Amendments, received February 4, 2020, lines 16 \u2013 17.\n[5] Exhibit 7, Personal Documents, received March 13, 2020, item 2, at pp. 3 \u2013 4.\n[6] Exhibit 5, BOC Narrative Amendments, received February 4, 2020, lines 22 \u2013 25.\n[7] Ibid., lines 41 \u2013 44.\n[8] Exhibit 7, Personal Documents, received March 13, 2020, item 3, at pp. 5 \u2013 7.\n[9] Exhibit 5, BOC Narrative Amendments, received February 4, 2020, lines 57 \u2013 61.\n[10] Ibid., lines 33 \u2013 35.\n[11] Ibid., lines 96 \u2013 102.\n[12] Ibid., at pp. 114 \u2013 116.\n[13] Exhibit 1, Package of information from the referring CBSA\/CIC.\n[14] Exhibit 7, Personal Documents, received March 13, 2020, item 1, at pp.1 \u2013 2.\n[15] Ibid., at pp. 3 \u2013 4.\n[16] Ibid., items, 4 \u2013 11, at pp. 8 \u2013 47.\n[17] Maldonado, Pedro Enrique Juarez v.

Stocks\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Jeffrey L. Goldman\nCountry: Albania\nRPD Number: TB9-05661\nAssociated RPD Number(s):\nATIP Number: A-2021-01106\nATIP Pages: 000088-000092\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] [XXX] (claimant) is a citizen of Albania. He claims refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] The particulars of his claim are detailed in his Basis of Claim Form (BOC)[1] and were explained further in his oral testimony. In summary, the claimant alleged he is a bisexual male. He had a boyfriend in his hometown. The relationship became known after the sister of his boyfriend, [XXX] found text messages on his phone. The claimant was assaulted with a bat by [XXX] uncles. The claimant was taken to the hospital where he was treated by hospital staff. When they discovered why he was attacked, the doctor and nurse stated this is what happens when people try to pervert\/corrupt men. The hospital staff refused to treat him.\n[3] The claimant also alleged that after his father died, his uncle took care of the family. His uncle, [XXX] is a policeman. When he learned that the claimant was in a same sex relationship, he was outraged. He blamed the claimant\u2019s mother for giving him \u201cthe gay disease\u201d. [XXX] beat the claimant\u2019s mother and brother. Later, [XXX] with other police officers found the claimant who had been in hiding; he was beaten by [XXX] and the other officers.\n[4] The claimant fears returning to Albania. He asserts that he cannot seek protection in Albania. The people of Albania are homophobia. The police will not protect him. His uncle is a member of the police and has influence. He cannot live safely anywhere in Albania.\n[5] The panel finds that the claimant is a Convention refugee for the reasons that follow.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[6] The panel finds that the claimant has established his identity as a national of Albania, based on a certified copy of his Albanian passport on file.[2]\nCredibility\n[7] When a claimant swears that certain facts are true, this creates a presumption that they are true unless there is valid reason to doubt their veracity. The determination as to whether a claimant\u2019s evidence is credible is made on a balance of probabilities. Having considered the claimant\u2019s testimony, the panel found the claimant testified in a spontaneous and forthright manner. There were no material inconsistencies or omissions.\n[8] The claimant provided satisfactory evidence to establish on a balance of probabilities that he is at risk in Albania. This includes but is not limited to the profile of the claimant\u2019s uncle who is a police officer. While same sex relationships are not illegal in Albania, there are strong homophobic sentiments. This in itself would be insufficient to grant protection; however, in the case of the claimant, taking into account his personal circumstances, the panel finds that there is more than a mere possibility of persecution owing to his sexual orientation.\n[9] The Constitution of Albania provides protection from discrimination in general, but does not specifically refer to the grounds of sexual orientation or gender identity. Hate crimes and hate speech on the grounds of sexual orientation or gender identity are prohibited in the Penal Code; however, the legislation only created a contradictory situation in Albania, combining an outward appearance of legal protection with hostility and discrimination still present within key institutions.[3]\n[10] A state is presumed to be capable of protecting its citizens, except in cases where the state is in complete breakdown. Albania is a functioning democracy.[4] The panel has assessed state protection in Albania in the claimant\u2019s particular circumstances. As indicated in item 2.1 of the National Documentation Package (NDP) for Albania, \u201c[p]olice did not always enforce the law equitably. Personal associations, political or criminal connections, poor infrastructure, lack of equipment, or inadequate supervision often influenced law enforcement. Poor leadership and a lack of diversity in the workforce contributed to continued corruption and unprofessional behavior. Authorities continued to make efforts to address these problems by renovating police facilities, upgrading vehicles, and publicly highlighting anticorruption measures.\u201d[5]\n[11] As previously noted, the claimant\u2019s uncle, a police officer and the head of the family is included as an agent of persecution. The panel notes that his uncle is well-connected amongst his peers. The panel finds that the claimant has rebutted presumption of state protection.\n[12] The panel notes that the documentary evidence consistently indicates that police did not always enforce the laws equitably and that personal associations, political or criminal connections, poor infrastructure, lack of equipment or inadequate supervision often influenced law enforcement.[6] [emphasis added]\n[13] In light of the panel\u2019s findings regarding state protection for the claimant in his particular circumstances, and the claimant\u2019s testimony, the panel finds, in these particular circumstances, there is no viable internal flight alternative.\nCONCLUSION\n[14] The panel finds that the claimant has established a serious possibility of persecution owing to his sexual orientation.\n[15] The panel accepts this claim.\n[1] Exhibit 2\n[2] Exhibit 1\n[3] Exhibit 3, NDP for Albania (30 September 2019), item 6.3.\n[4] Exhibit 3, National Documentation Package (NDP) for Albania \u2014 September 30, 2019 Version.\n[5] Exhibit 3, item 2.1.\n[6] National Documentation Package, Albania, 30 September 2019, tab 6.5: Country Policy and Information Note.

On that same day, the panel rendered its oral positive decision and Reasons for decision. This is the written version of the oral decision and Reasons that have been edited for clarity, spelling, grammar and syntax with added references to the documentary evidence and relevant case law where appropriate.\n[1] MEMBER: [XXX] and [XXX], I have considered your testimonies and the other evidence in your case, and I am ready to now give you my decision orally. You will receive a written copy of this decision, but it will be edited for any spelling, syntax and grammar before it is sent out to you.\n[2] This is the decision of the claims of [XXX] and [XXX], who claim to be citizens of Mexico, and who seek refugee protection pursuant to Sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.[1]\n[3] The allegations that you make are fully set out in each of your basis of claim forms and amendments.[2] In summary, you each fear persecution in Mexico because you are gay men. You suffered physical, verbal, sexual abuse and discrimination. You allege that there is no location in Mexico where you could relocate and live safely.\n[4] Your claims were joined as per Rule 55 of the Refugee Protection Division. Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9 was followed throughout this hearing.[3]\n[5] The issues in your hearing were credibility, delay in claim, and internal flight alternative.\n[6] Regarding your identities, I find on a balance of probabilities that you are who you say you are, and that you are citizens of Mexico. I base this finding on the passports you provided Canadian authorities,[4] and the voter identity cards you submitted as evidence.\n[7] With regards to your credibility, your testimonies as to the circumstances of the problems you experienced in Mexico as a result of your sexual orientation were straightforward and spontaneous. Neither of you made any apparent attempts to embellish your claims.\n[8] However, there were some obvious inconsistencies in the evidence provided by each of you between your narratives and your oral testimony this morning. I do have concerns about the omissions in your testimonies regarding dealings with the police and discrimination at work.\n[9] Nevertheless, the information each of you provided in your testimonies is consistent with information you have given in your basis of claim forms. Some of these allegations are confirmed by the multitude of original documentation that you have provided to me.\n[10] The personal documents include reference letters from friends and family, medical records, employment records, correspondence regarding human rights complaints in Mexico and in Canada, as well as photographs of various events that you have attended here in Toronto.\n[11] Your personal documentary evidence is overwhelming, and I give it significant evidentiary weight.\n[12] Regarding your delay in making claims for protection, you explained that it took a considerable time to gather useful information that finally led you to make claims for protection.\n[13] I accept this explanation for the delay, and I make no adverse credibility findings against you.\n[14] I therefore have considered the objective evidence in your case. Having considered the country condition documents, I find that the situation for you in Mexico is dangerous. Conservative attitudes prevail in Mexico. Public displays of affection are not considered socially acceptable.\n[15] I rely specifically on three documents; 6.1, 6.2 and 6.4 in the national documentary package.[5] I also will mention that the United States Department of State report for 2020 indicates, and I quote, \u201cDiscrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity was prevalent, despite a gradual increase in public tolerance of LGBTI individuals.\u201d\n[16] In 2016, Letra S, L-E-T-R-A and then \u201cS,\u201d which is an LGBTQ non-governmental organization, published information according to which 1,310 cases of killings of LGBT persons motivated by homophobia were committed in Mexico between 1995 and 2016. Over the past 10 years, there have been 71 homicides a year on average.\n[17] A report from the UN noted the alarming pattern of grotesque homicides of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals, and the broad impunity for these crimes, sometimes with the suspected complicity of investigative authorities.\n[18] According to one report, trans women and homosexuals represent the group most affected by motivated physical assaults. There is considerable evidence about the number of people who belong to the LGBT community that have been killed over these last many years.\n[19] Mexico City, where you\u2019ve indicated that you lived for a short period of time, is regarded by some to be the safest place in Mexico to members of the LGBTQ community. The response to information request at 6.4 indicates that violence against LBGTQ (sic) persons in Mexico City is virtually unheard of. However, civil society groups claim that police routinely subjected LGBTI persons to mistreatment while in custody, and this information can also be found in the Department of State report.\n[20] Your counsel has also provided considerable evidence with regards to the treatment of homosexuals in Mexico.\n[21] I therefore find that there is a strong objective basis for the fear you have of being persecuted in Mexico. find that you have subjective fear of persecution, violence, and death in Mexico on the basis of your sexual orientation, and the objective evidence supports that subjective fear.\n[22] I proposed Guadalajara as an internal flight alternative city in which you could potentially live openly as gay men. The response to information request I have mentioned earlier indicates that the members of the LGBT community in Guadalajara report feeling safe.\n[23] However, you have made it clear that you do not feel safe anywhere in Mexico, and this is in part due to the discrimination against sexual minorities that is pervasive throughout the country.\n[24] I note that the response to information request I\u2019ve referred to provides information about the role of the Catholic church in exacerbating homophobia and transphobia in Mexico. It is the influence of the church that has stubbornly impeded the efforts of the government in Mexico to protect and guarantee equality and protection for the LGBTQ community. While the response lists Guadalajara from one source as being a safe place for sexual minorities, I find there is more overwhelming evidence that gay men are frequently targeted everywhere in Mexico by state and civilian actors alike.\n[25] I also note that you testified that you would be discriminated against by the medical community when dealing with your HIV status, as you\u2019ve experienced in the past.\n[26] Relying on the documentary evidence I\u2019ve referred to, I find that there is no viable internal flight alternative in Mexico that is both safe and reasonable for you in all circumstances. The serious possibility of persecution that you face is endemic throughout Mexico, and I therefore find that there is no place in the country that you could live openly as gay men and be safe.\n[27] I have considered your testimonies, your documentary evidence, and the country conditions, and I find that there is a serious possibility of persecution on a convention ground, if you were to return to Mexico.\n[28] I therefore find that you, [XXX] and you, [XXX], are convention refugees, and I accept your claims. I wish you well.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n[1] The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), S.C. 2001, c.27, as amended, sections 96 and 97(1).\n[2] Exhibits 2.1, 2.1, and 13.\n[3] Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9: Proceedings Before the IRE Involving Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression, Guidelines issued by the Chairperson pursuant to paragraph 159(1)(h) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, Effective date: May 1, 2017.\n[4] Exhibit 1, Package of information from the referring CBSA\/IRCC.\n[5] Exhibit 3, National Document Package (NDP) for Mexico \u2013 September 30, 2020 Version.\n\n",

Casimiro\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Stacey Margaret Duong\nCountry: China\nRPD Number: TB8-33095\nAssociated RPD Number(s):\nATIP Number: A-2021-01106\nATIP Pages: 000077-000083\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] [XXX] (\u201cthe Claimant\u2019) makes a claim for refugee protection pursuant to s. 96 and s. 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (\u201cIRPA\u201d).\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] The Claimant\u2019s allegations are fully set out in his Basis of Claim form[1] and in his testimony. He alleges that he is a citizen of the People\u2019s Republic of China and that he fears persecution by the Chinese government because he is a Falun Gong practitioner.\n[3] One of the Claimant\u2019s co-workers died as a result of a workplace accident. The Claimant became very sad and started to develop sleeping problems. He had nightmares and dreamed about his co-worker. As a result, the Claimant woke up feeling very exhausted and depressed. He was suffering from right arm pain and was diagnosed with a shoulder muscle spasm. A friend learned about his health situation and introduced him to Falun Gong.\n[4] His friend told him that Falun Gong could help him. He explained to him the basic principles of Falun Gong, and he urged him to give it a try.\n[5] His friend agreed to teach him privately and he began to learn from him on [XXX] 2017. He experienced improvements for his condition after about two months of practicing Falun Gong with his friend.\n[6] The Claimant then decided to join the group practice with his friend on [XXX] 2017. He went to practice with the group once a week. However, the group experienced a problem on [XXX] 2018.\n[7] They found out that two members from another group of practitioners in their town were arrested by the police (\u201cPSB\u201d). As a result, the group suspended their practice. All the members were advised to go into hiding.\n[8] The Claimant went to hide at his wife\u2019s cousin\u2019s place. While in hiding, the Claimant discussed the situation with his family. The family decided that the Claimant should leave China for safety. The Claimant then used the services of a smuggler to help him get out of China.\n[9] The smuggler flew with the Claimant from Beijing to Toronto on [XXX] 2018.\n[10] After arriving in Canada, the Claimant hoped to return back to China, if the situation improved. However, he learned from his wife that the PSB came to his home to look for him. They asked his wife for his whereabouts.\n[11] His wife also learned that the group\u2019s leader was arrested. The PSB returned to their home and left a summons for the Claimant. The PSB also went to the homes of his close relatives to look for him.\n[12] As a result, the Claimant made a claim for refugee protection. Since arriving in Canada, he also joined a Falun Gong group.\n[13] The PSB continues to look for the Claimant in China. He fears arrest, detention and abuse if he is to return to China on account of his Falun Gong practice. The Claimant also wishes to continue practicing Falun Gong freely, which is something he could not do in China.\nDETERMINATION\n[14] The panel finds that the Claimant is a Convention refugee, as he has a well-founded fear of persecution on the basis of his membership in a particular social group as a Falun Gong practitioner.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[15] The Claimant explained that the smuggler took his passport upon arriving in Canada as he still owed money at that time. The Claimant to this date, had failed to pay the remaining balance owing to the smuggler. He did attempt to recover his passport by trying to contact the smuggler through a relative, however they had lost contact with the smuggler. To date, he had not secured the return of his passport. However, based on his original Resident Identity card and Hukou, which were presented at the hearing and which are contained in Exhibit 6, the panel finds that the Claimant is a citizen of China and he is who he says he is on a balance of probabilities.\nCredibility\n[16] The Claimant\u2019s testimony regarding his introduction to Falun Gong, his Falun Gong practice in China, as well as his Falun Gong practice in Canada were consistent with his other evidence.\n[17] He testified that his initial hope was to return to China but after he found out from his wife that the PSB came to his home to look for him, he knew that he can no longer return to China. He testified that the PSB left a summons for him as per Exhibit 6. He also testified about the continued interest of the authorities in him back in China.\n[18] The panel notes that the Claimant claims to be a Falun Gong practitioner since [XXX] 2017. The Claimant testified that Falun Gong is a dual cultivation system. He testified about how Karma in our body creates illness and how Falun Gong could help transform Karma into Virtue (black substance transformed into white substance).\n[19] He testified about the concept of attachments and getting rid of personal attachments. He described how his friend showed him the Falun Gong exercises. He testified about some of the challenges he faced when learning the exercises. He testified that there is a total of five exercises. In the course of his testimony, he identified the first and second exercises.\n[20] He elaborated on how Karma is accumulated and how to get rid of its effects. He testified about the principles of Truthfulness, Compassion and Forbearance and how he applies these to his daily life. He talked about increasing one\u2019s mind\/nature.\n[21] He talked about Master Li Hongzhi and the Zhuan Falun. He testified about how his group in China had no access to the Zhuan Falun but instead utilized photocopies as part of their study. He also identified other books that are important to Falun Gong practitioners.\n[22] The Claimant also testified about his Falun Gong practice here in Canada. He testified about how he was introduced to a group of practitioners in Canada. The Claimant continues to practice the exercises at the park, he also attends a group to study the Zhuan Falun and he also distributes Falun Gong materials.\n[23] The Claimant\u2019s profile as a Falun Gong practitioner was also supported by a number of photos depicting his practice in Canada and two letters from fellow practitioners.[2] The panel notes that the photographs appear to have been taken at numerous locations and times.\n[24] Similarly, the panel asked him why he continues to practice Falun Gong despite recovering from his health issues. He testified that practicing Falun Gong is a lifelong commitment and that one doesn\u2019t stop practicing just because one gets\/feels better.\n[25] The panel finds on a balance of probabilities that the Claimant is a genuine Falun Gong practitioner. He has a genuine desire and plans to continue his practice of Falun Gong into the future.\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution\n[26] The documentary evidence is clear that Falun Gong practitioners face persecution in China. Falun Gong is banned as an illegal group in China and the country conditions evidence is consistent in its reports that Falun Gong practitioners face arrest and even torture, according to several credible sources.[3]\n[27] Exhibit 3, Item 1.7 which is the United Kingdom\u2019s Operational Guidance Note, discusses that Falun Gong practitioners over the years have been tortured, harassed, arbitrarily detained, imprisoned, and have faced other serious restrictions on their right to freedom of expression.\n[28] It explains that the Falun Gong movement has been outlawed in China, and the State regards it as an evil cult. Falun Gong practitioners have reportedly been subjected to detention, ill\u00ad treatment, and it states that the risk of ill-treatment escalates significantly when a practitioner engages in activities that are reasonably likely to bring them to the notice of authorities. This includes the public practice of Falun Gong exercises, recruitment of new members, and dissemination of Falun Gong information. The risk of ill-treatment also increases when a person ignores a warning against continuing Falun Gong activity.\n[29] Exhibit 3, Item 2.1 the United States Department of State Report indicates that practitioners of Falun Gong reported systematic torture.\n[30] Exhibit 3, Item 12.2, indicates that the Chinese government has banned Falun Gong and labelled it an \u201cevil cult\u201d. Authorities regularly target Falun Gong practitioners and force them into labour camps. In detention, they suffer sexual assault, torture, violence and organ harvesting.\n[31] Therefore, the Panel finds that the Claimant\u2019s fear is a well-founded one supported by personal and objective evidence.\n[32] The panel finds that the Claimant is a genuine Falun Gong practitioner on a balance of probabilities, and so he would face a serious possibility of persecution if he were to return to China.\nState Protection\n[33] As the state is the agent of persecution, adequate state protection would not be available to the Claimant.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[34] Given that the Claimant is a genuine and ongoing Falun Gong practitioner, even if he were to relocate, his risk remains the same as the State\u2019s control exists all over China. Since the agent of persecution is the state, there is no internal flight alternative for the Claimant, as there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout the country.\nCONCLUSION\n[35] For the above reasons, the panel finds that the Claimant is a Convention refugee, as he holds a well-founded fear of persecution on the basis of his membership in a particular social group, as a practitioner of Falun Gong. His claim is therefore accepted.\n[1] Exhibit 2.\n[2] Exhibit 6.\n[3] Exhibit 3, National Documentation Package for China (20 December 2019) Items 2.1, 12.22 and 12.23.\n\n",

You are claiming to be a citizen of Turkey and are claiming refuge protection pursuant to section 96 and 97 (1) one of the Immigration and Refuge Protection Act. I have considered your testimony and the other evidence in the case. And I am ready to render my decision orally. I find that you have established a serious possibility of persecution in Turkey by virtue of your imputed political opinion and your membership in a particular social group namely because of your familiar relationship to your father. The specifics of your claim are said out in the narrative of your Basis of Claim Form filed as Exhibit 2. The following is a summary your allegations.\n[2] You are a citizen of Turkey. You fear persecution at the hands of Turkish authorities and members of the Justice and Development Party or AKP\u2026 AKP. Because of your imputed political opinion as a former [XXX] who is perceived to be a member or supporter of Gulenist Movement and oppose to the government and AKP\u2026 AKP. You also allege a fear of persecution at the hands of Turkish Authorities and Members of the AKP because of your membership with the particular social group namely your familiar relationship to your father who is under investigation for his imputed membership in the Gulenist Movement. You allege that there is no state protection for you or an Internal Flight Alternative. Your personal identity as a citizen of Turkey has been established by your testimony and the supporting documents filed as Exhibit 1, namely your passport issued by the government of Turkey and your Turkish Identity Card. I find that on the balance of probabilities, identity and country of reference have been established. I find that there is a link between what you fear in one of grounds under section 96 of the Immigration and Refuge Protection Act, namely political opinion and membership in a particular social group. Therefore, I assessed your claim under section 96 of that act. The test under section 96, is whether there is a serious possibility of persecution should you return to Turkey and I have found that you have met that test.\n[3] In terms of your general credibility, I found you to be a credible witness and I therefore believe what you have alleged in your total\u2026 oral testimony in your Basis of Claim Form. Your evidence was detailed and consistent both internally and with your documentation. Throughout the hearing you were articulate, responsive and forthright. You are able to elaborate on your narrative and gave detailed explanations to the questions. Your claim was well supported and I know that no material inconsistencies or omissions searched at presumption of truthfulness could be rebutted.\n[4] Specifically you have established on a balance of probabilities of following. In [XXX] 2012, you joined Turkish Armed Forces as a [XXX]. You were also chosen to attend in [XXX] 2016, training at the [XXX] (phonetics) second main [XXX]. You filed documents in support of this claim. You heard about the July 15, 2016 coup attempt which according to the authorities, more specifically the Justice And Development Party or AKP was conducted by the Gulenist Movement. You heard about the attempt that day while visiting your parents. Your [XXX] ordered you to return to the [XXX] which you did that day. You were ordered to stay at the [XXX] until [XXX] 2016. On July 31, 2016, Decree 669 ordered the closer of ail military schools and aca\u2026 academies. All cadets of military academies and military high schools including [XXX] were dismissed from the military. You filed excerpts of Decree 669 in support of your claim. The stated aim of the decree was to take the necessary measures to fight against terrorism. The AKP in power during attempted coup blamed the Gulenist Movement and labelled it a terrorist movement. You justified that the dismissed [XXX] were perceived as affiliated to a terrorist organisation the Gulenist Movement. Decree 669 provided that senior [XXX] up to graduate would still receive Diplomas from different Universities.\n[5] You received your Diploma from [XXX] University in [XXX]. The Diploma states that it is issued pursuant to Decree 669. You filed the Diploma as an exhibit. You believe that, this confirms that you have been a permanently blacklisted by the regime as a terrorist. You had several former [XXX] classmates who have had to flee Turkey and become refugees elsewhere who have been killed by lynching and who have been sentenced to life imprison for their imputed affiliation with the Gulenist Movement. In [XXX] 2017, you filed a petition to the Ankara 6th administrative court to get reinstated into the military. You filed as an exhibit the decision of the court rejecting your petition. On [XXX] 2018, the police raided the house of your closest friend and former [XXX] classmate. He had to flee to Germany, where he is now a refugee. That is when you realize that you would also be targeted. On [XXX] 2018, arrest warrants were released for 120 [XXX]. You hid until you had the means to leave for Canada on [XXX] 2018.\n[6] In [XXX] 2020, your uncle and father informed you that there is a warrant for your arrest. Your father tried to get further information about the charges, but was not provided with such information. You filed statements from your uncle and father and supported this claim along with an official document informing your father that the charges against you are confidential, but providing a file number for the case against you.\n[7] Before the coup attempt, your father was a [XXX] in the General Directorate of [XXX]. He was dismissed on [XXX] 2017 by decree 679. He later learned that\u2026 that he was named as Gulenist Movement follower. Your father filed a petition to the Ankara 16th administrative court to be reinstated into the [XXX]. You filed as an exhibit the decision of the Ankara 16th administrative court, rejecting your father\u2019s petition. You filed the decision of the Ankara 25th administrative court supporting your claim that there is an on-going investigation into your father\u2019s imputed involvement with the Gulenist Movement. You testified that one of your former [XXX] classmates was arrested just last week by the Turkish authorities.\n[8] You also produced a significant amount of documentation in support of your claim. These documents include the following filed as Exhibit 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3, your [XXX] identification card supporting the claim that you were a [XXX] in the [XXX]. The authorities in Turkey announced that 95 percent of [XXX] were followers of the Gulenist Movement. Your [XXX] and [XXX] indicating that they were issued in accordance with decree 669. Your Turkish [XXX] student vacation document confirming that you stayed at the [XXX] (phonetics) second main [XXX] for two weeks following the coup attempt.\n[9] Record document from the Ankara 16th administrative court, supporting the claim that your father petitioned to reverse your dismissal as a [XXX]. A letter of support from a close friend and former [XXX] supporting the claim that he was targeted by the authorities and is now a refugee in Germany. It also supports that the claim that some of your former [XXX] colleagues were sentenced to life imprisonment after the coup attempt.\n[10] Letters from your and uncles supporting the claim that in [XXX] 2020, the authorities approached your uncle looking for you and told your uncle that there was an arrest warrant against you. A petition made by your father in [XXX] 2020, requesting to know the crime for which you are sought by police, the authorities released the number of the case against you, but no further information. Documents supporting your claim that your father was [XXX] with the General Directorate of [XXX] that he was suspended after the attempted coup and eventually dismissed. A decision from the 25th administrative court of Ankara from the summer of 2020 supporting a claim that there is an on-going investigation against your father. There is no reason for me to cast any doubt on the voracity of these documents and as such, I pla\u2026 place great weight on these documents to support the allegation and overall claim.\n[11] I find that your subjective fear is established by your credible testimony and I believe what you have alleged on a balance of probabilities. The objective country reports are consistent with your evidence about the plight of former [XXX] who are imputed to be followers of the Gulenist Movement. The National Documentation package for Turkey dated March 31st, 2020 at exhibit 3 item 1.7 states that the Gulenist Movement is a term used to describe those who follow the US based Islamic Cleric Fethullah Gulen. The movement is not a political party neither is it a religion. The Gulenist Movement is believed to have a large number of sympathizers in Turkey, some estimate the number to be in millions.\n[12] In May 2016, the Turkish government declared that the Gulenist Movement was an illegal terrorist organisation and in June 2017, the Supreme Court appeal ruled that the Gulenist Movement is an armed terrorist organisation. The coup attempt of the 15th July, 2016 was attributed by the Turkish Government to members of Gulenist Movement. A state of emergency was put in place in Turkey a few days after the coup. And this has been renewed since then. By September 2017, 21 emergency decrees had been issued and the scope of the emergency law had been broadened to include those who belong to, connect to or have contact with the Gulenist Movement. One of the emergency decrees provided that, officials involving\u2026 involved in putting down the coup, tackling-related threats and implementing state of emergency measures would not face prosecution. Since the 2016 coup attempt, authorities have dismissed or suspended more than 45,000 police and military personnel, and more than 130,000 civil servants, dismissed one-third of the judiciary, arrested or imprisoned more than 80,000 citizens and closed more than 1,500 non-governmental organisations on terrorism-related grounds primarily for alleged ties to the movement of cleric Fethullah Gulen whom the government accuses of masterminding the coup attempt and designated by the government as the leader of the Fethullah terrorist organisation.\n[13] Exhibit 3, item 8.7 states that in the period between the unsuccessful coup in 2016 and March 2017, the Turkish government fired more than 22,000 sol\u2026 officers, soldiers, and cadets for alleged links with the Gulen Movement. In March 2017, the then Turkish Minister for National Defense announced that those fired consisted of 6,511 officers and 16,409 soldiers and military cadets. The latter group consisted of 4090 cadets at military colleges, 6,148 training centres for non-commissioned officers including privates and corporals and 6,179 at University Military Training Institutions.\n[14] In January 2019, the Turkish authorities reported that at least 58 Generals and 629 Senior Officers have been sentenced to life imprisonment for involvement in the failed coup and for links with the Gulenist Movement. In January 2019, the Turkish authority also arrested 63 people on charges of involvement with the Gulenist Movement including 46 helicopter pilots in active service. Earlier that month, more than 100 soldiers and former cadets at Military Training Institutions were arrested throughout Turkey.\n[15] The claimant filed at Exhibits 5.1 and 5.2, several recent articles about the continued persecution of former military cadets. For instance in September 2017, internet news reported that arrest warrants have been released for 69 former cadets. In November 2017, Turkish media Memurlar reported that 30 cadets were among the 240 taken into custody. In December 2017, Memurlar reported that dismissed cadets were among 62 suspects taken into custody. In March 2018, the Turkish states news agency Anadolu agency reported that former cadets were among the 19 suspects arrested in Manisa and Usak. In March 2018, Anadolu reported that among 35 suspects apprehended for their imputed support of the Gulenist Movement were dismissed soldiers and military school students. In March 2018, The World Bulletin reported among 20 suspects arrested in the northern Kastamonu province were on duty soldiers and former cadets. In June 2018, a pro-Turkish news agency The Daily Sabah, reported that former military cadets were among the 102 suspects for which arrests warrants were issued. On July 3rd, 2018, Anadolu reported that a dismiss cadet was among the 13 suspects arrested in Eastern Turkey.\n[16] You feel being targeted by the Turkish authorities for imputed political opinion, but also for your relationship with your father who is targeted for his imputed membership into the Gulenist Movement.\n[17] The NDP or National Documentation Package for Turkey and Exhibit 3 at item 2.1 provides a basis for that fear. United States Department of State report notes that family members of targeted individuals are also at risk of persecution. It states that, using anti-terror legislation, the government targeted family members to exert pressure on wanted suspects. Government measures included cancelling the passports of family members of civil servants suspended or dismissed from state institutions as well as those who had fled authorities.\n[18] Exhibit 3 item 13.6, the United Kingdom\u2019s Home Office reports that members of families of people who are critical of the government will be targeted. If the police cannot find the person they are looking for, they will take another family member. This was very common during the emergency. Families were threatened by phone and their houses were raided. A report of the Asylum Research Consultancy found at Exhibit 3 item 1.4 also notes following his visit to Turkey in September 2016, the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights found that a series of measures of particular concern to the commissioner are those which target directly or are liable to affect family members of suspects in an automatic fashion.\n[19] In addition to the evictions termination of lease agreement and freezing up assets of the said suspects, which are likely to create unnecessary hardship and victimisation for family members. The commissioner notes other measures of an administrative nature such as a possibility of annulling passports of spouses of suspects who are themselves not under investigation and the unlimited access by administrative authorities to the personal data of family members of suspects. This approach raises extremely serious concerns. The commissioner is worried that such measures will inevitably fuel the impression of guilt by association already voiced by many of their interlocutors. In the opinion of the commissioner, any measure treating family members of a suspect also as potential suspect should not exist in democratic society even during a state of emergency.\n[20] As you have established, your subjective fear and an objective basis for that fear, I find you will have established of well-founded fear of persecution.\n[21] I turn now to state protection. When making a refugee claim, the claimant must establish on a balance of probabilities that adequate state protection is not available. There is a presumption that state protection is available and the onus is on the claimant to provide and clear and convincing evidence to be part of such\u2026 such protection.\n[22] In this case, the agent of persecution is the state that is the persecution you would face should you return to Turkey as at the hand of authorities. This is supported in part by the investigation conducted by the authorities against the claimant\u2019s father for his imputed political opinion as a supporter of the Gulenist Movement and also the evidence said that there is an arrest warrant against you for your imputed political opinion as a supporter of the Gulenist Movement. The country condition documents outlined in this decision also support the claim that the authorities are the perpetrators and persecutors of those involved or perceived to be involved in the Gulenist Movement.\n[23] Accordingly, I find that there is no state protection available for you. I have also considered whether a viable Internal Flight Alternative exists for you, the agent of persecution is the Turkish government. The evidence reviewed above confirms that oppressive treatment of those suspected of supporting the Gulen Movement is nationwide. I find that there is a serious possibility of persecution for you throughout tricky and therefore find that there is no viable Internal Flight Alternative.\n[24] In conclusion, based on the totality of the evidence, I find you to be a convention refugee because you have demonstrated a serious possibility of persecution in Turkey by virtue of your imputed political opinion and membership in a particular social group, namely your familial relationship with your father who is imputed to be a supporter of the Gulenist Movement. I accept your claim.\n[25] CLAIMANT: Thank you very much.\n[26] COUNSEL: Thank you Madam Member.\n[27] MEMBER: Welcome to Canada.\n[28] CLAIMANT: Thank you so much.\n[29] MEMBER: Thank you very much for your detailed testimony. (voice overlapping). Thank you Mr. Interpreter for coming at the last minute and doing such a good job on the interpretation.\n[30] INTERPRETER: Thank you Madam.\n[31] MEMBER: And thank you Counsel, this was a very well documented file. And 1. 1 thank you for your work.\n[32] COUNSEL: Thank you.\n[33] MEMBER: And this concludes our hearing.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n",

You will receive an unedited transcript of this oral decision in the mail in approximately three weeks and your counsel will also receive a copy and she can answer any related questions you may have at that time.\n[2] This is the decision for [XXX] File number TB8-29465. You are all claiming to be citizens of Sri Lanka and you are claiming refugee protection pursuant to Sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[3] I have considered your testimony and the other evidence in the case as well as oral submissions from counsel.\n[4] I find that you are all Convention refugees for the reason that you have established there is a serious possibility of persecution in Sri Lanka based on your imputed antigovernment political opinion as suspected LTTE supporters.\n[5] By way of background you allege the following; you sir are a Sinhalese [XXX] and you met with several potential customers who are all young Tamil men. While these men were in your vehicle you were stopped at a police check point where the police found problems with your passengers identity documents.\n[6] You say the police then detained you and the Tamil men in your vehicle. During your ten day detention you were physically assaulted by six police officers and you were forced to attend multiple police stations to look at line ups of photographs and prisoners in an effort to identify alleged LTTE suspects.\n[7] After ten days of detainment you say you were released on the condition that you would report to the police station every month. However you did not obey those instructions and instead you and your family went into hiding and then you made your way to Canada within a few weeks.\n[8] After you left Sri Lanka and when you failed to report to the police station as instructed, you say the police visited your mother in law, searched the house and threatened to arrest you because of your disobedience if you were to return to Sri Lanka.\n[9] Your personal identities as citizens of Sri Lanka have been established by your testimony and the supporting documentation namely copies of your birth certificates, national identity cards and passports. While your name does appear slightly differently on your birth certificate you provided a reasonable explanation that your name has changed shortly after your birth and the evidence of this can clearly be seen on Paragraph 13 of your birth certificate.\n[10] I therefore find on a balance of probabilities that identity and country of reference have been established for all of you.\n[11] I find that there is a link between what you fear and one of the five convention grounds, specifically your imputed antigovernment political opinion as suspected LTTE supporters. This claim is therefore assessed under Section 96 of the act.\n[12] In terms of your general credibility I found you to be a credible witness and I therefore believe what you have alleged in your oral testimony and in your basis of claim form. You described in extensive detail the circumstances surrounding your meeting with the three potential customers your ride to drop off the customers and your eventual detention at the police station.\n[13] Not only were you able to provide a step by step description of what happened but your provided spontaneous details and additional aspects of the environment, clothing and emotions involved during these events.\n[14] You described your time at the police station and the punishment you received at the hands of the police. You described the weapons involved, the surrounding environment, the ill-treatment you received and the officers involved.\n[15] Finally you described the ongoing circumstances of your ten day detention including the cell conditions, the various trips to the police stations and your emotions during that time. Your description of events was provided in a detailed and straightforward manner and I have no reason to disbelieve your testimony.\n[16] You presented your testimony in a clear and consistent manner and you responded spontaneously to questioning.\n[17] In support of your testimony your provided medical documents describing your injuries as well as sworn affidavits from your parents regarding the difficulties your family has experienced.\n[18] In particular you provided a sworn affidavit from your mother in law which confirms that the police came to her house looking for you and when it was clear you and your family had left the country the police became angry and threatened to arrest you if you return.\n[19] Based on the evidence before me I\u2019m satisfied that there is a serious possibility of persecution for you and your family members should you return to Sri Lanka. I\u2019m satisfied that you have experienced past persecution at the hands of the police, I\u2019m also satisfied that the Sri Lankan authorities have a record of your detention and once you enter the Sri Lankan airport you and your family will be flagged for disobeying police instructions.\n[20] The objective evidence regarding the country conditions in Sri Lanka is consistent with you allegations that there is a serious possibility of persecution if you return to Sri Lanka. I looked at a number of documents in the national documentation package dated March 29th 2019 as well as counsel\u2019s country conditions documents which are in Exhibit 13.\n[21] The objective evidence at items 1.5, 2.1 and 10.9 are ail consistent with your allegation that perceived LTTE supporters are targeted by the state and there is continued monitoring and surveillance by Sri Lankan authorities as well as ongoing harassment of those who are suspected of supporting the LTTE regardless of their ethnicity.\n[22] In addition the objective evidence at Article, sorry at Item 14.1 supports your allegation that as you have been accused of violating Sri Lankan law by allegedly lying to the police and failing to report monthly as instructed you are now considered a person of interest to the Sri Lankan authorities and you and your family will likely be flagged at the airport and sent to the police directly from the airport.\n[23] In light of the fact that you are a Sinhalese family I have also considered the implications of the recent elections, specifically on you and your family members. The media articles that were submitted to me by counsel confirm that the new Gotabaya Rajapaksa government has not hesitated to arrest or detain any person regardless of their ethnicity if they are perceived to hold antigovernment political opinions.\n[24] For example according to an article found at Exhibit 13 the new president illegally detained an employee at the Swiss Embassy and acquired a list of names from her of Sri Lankan citizens who had fled the country as well as the names of people who had assisted them.\n[25] The new president has also imposed a travel ban on over seven hundred police officers and members of the Criminal Investigations Division for the mere fact that they were investigating him for human rights abuses.\n[26] The Centre for Policy Alternatives is quoted in this article as saying Sri Lanka is beginning a slow decent into something very frightening.\n[27] For these reasons based on consistent and credible evidence including the country condition documents I find your fear of persecution to be well founded.\n[28] For the reasons already stated I am satisfied that there is a serious possibility of persecution at the hands of the state should your return to Sri Lanka. As the state is the agent of persecution in your situation I am satisfied that you have rebutted the presumption of state protection because the state is unwilling to protect you and you cannot access or otherwise expect to receive adequate state protection throughout Sri Lanka.\n[29] Furthermore as the state is the agent of persecution I\u2019m satisfied that it would be unsafe for you to seek refuge anywhere else in Sri Lanka. Therefore there is no viable internal flight alternative.\n[30] Based on the forgoing analysis l find that you have established there is a serious possibility of persecution on a convention ground namely your imputed antigovernment political opinion as suspected LTTE supporters.\n[31] I therefore find that you are all Convention refugees and I accept all of your claims. Thank you very much, have a wonderful afternoon.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n",

Akinyemi\nCountry: Nigeria\nRPD Number: TB8-15998\nAssociated RPD Number(s):\nATIP Number: A-2021-01106\nATIP Pages: 000048-000056\nREASONS FOR DECISION\nINTRODUCTION\n[1] These are the reasons for the decision in the claim of [XXX] who claims to be a citizen of Nigeria, and is claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).[1]\n[2] In rendering these reasons, the panel has considered and applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guidelines on Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution,[2] and applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guidelines on Proceedings Before the IRB Involving Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression.[3]\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] The claimant alleges that she faces persecution at the hands of Nigerian authorities and members of Nigerian society on account of her sexual orientation as a lesbian. The claimant also alleged that she faces a risk of forced female genital mutilation (FGM) at the hands of her paternal relatives.\n[4] While the claimant has identified a fear of FGM, the panel finds that the determinative issue in this claim is the claimant\u2019s sexual orientation. Therefore, the reasons for this decision are centered on findings about the claimant\u2019s profile as a lesbian. The panel will not render findings surrounding the claimant\u2019s fear of FGM.\nDETERMINATION\n[5] The panel finds that the claimant is a Convention refugee as she has established a serious possibility of persecution on account of her membership in a particular social group, as a lesbian woman.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[6] The panel finds that the claimant\u2019s identity as a national of Nigeria is established by the claimant\u2019s oral testimony and documents filed in evidence, including the claimant\u2019s Nigerian Birth Certificate.[4]\nCredibility\n[7] The panel finds the claimant to be a credible witness and therefore accepts what the claimant has alleged in support of her claim. When a claimant swears to the truth of certain allegations, this creates a presumption that those allegations are true unless there be reason to doubt their truthfulness.[5] The claimant testified in a straightforward manner and, there were no relevant inconsistencies in the claimant\u2019s testimony or contradictions between testimony and the other evidence before the panel which have not been satisfactorily explained.\n[8] The claimant testified that while she was in Nigeria she came to realise her sexual orientation, that she is a lesbian, at the age of 10 or 11 years old. She stated that she initially thought something was wrong with her because all of her friends would talk about boys, yet she would think about girls. The claimant testified about the challenges she faced in Nigeria, stating that she would often try to hide herself and stay away from people that she found attractive. The claimant testified that her parents hold strong religious values and she was aware that her sexual orientation would not be accepted in her community.\n[9] The claimant stated that she eventually confided in her mother about her sexual orientation. However, at that time, the more pressing matter that was concerning the claimant\u2019s mother was fear of forced FGM of the claimant. The claimant stated that her paternal grandmother comes from a line of traditional worshipers who carry out female genital mutilation. The claimant alleged that her paternal relatives attempted to force her to undergo FGM, with the intention of subjecting the claimant to the FGM procedure in [XXX] 2015. The claimant alleged that her mother arranged for her to flee Nigeria on [XXX] 2015 at the age [XXX] years old in order to avoid forced FGM.\n[10] The claimant moved to the United States where she resided, without legal status, in the care of her mother\u2019s cousin, Ms. E. The claimant alleged that while in United States, she became involved in a romantic relationship with a same sex partner in [XXX] 2015. The claimant testified that she was confronted by Ms. E on [XXX] 2018, regarding the nature of her relationship with her female friend from school, at which time the claimant admitted that she was involved in a same sex relationship with this female. The claimant alleged that Ms. E became upset about her sexual orientation and told the claimant to leave her home immediately. The claimant then fled to Canada where she had family friends. The claimant arrived in Canada on [XXX] 2018.\n[11] The claimant stated that her relatives in Nigeria have become aware of her sexual orientation and her father has disowned her. The claimant stated that members of her family and community in Nigeria have vowed to kill her for bringing shame to the family name.\nFailure to Claim Asylum Does Not Undermine the Claimant\u2019s Subjective Fear\n[12] The claimant testified that she resided in United States between the period of [XXX] 2015 to [XXX] 2018 and did not claim asylum. The claimant testified that the reason she did not claim asylum upon arrival in United States is because she did not know anything about asylum. She stated that as she became older, she realized she did not have legal status in United States however she was unaware that she could speak with a lawyer to apply for legal status. The claimant testified that she never tried to claim asylum because she did not know how to do so. The claimant testified that she also experienced fear that she may not be granted legal status in the United States. She stated that these fears stemmed from her understanding of the president of the United States administrative views on immigrants at the time.\n[13] The panel has assessed whether the claimant\u2019s failure to claim asylum in United States immediately upon entry to United States undermines the claimant\u2019s subjective fear. Considering the claimant\u2019s personal circumstances, including the fact that she was [XXX] years old upon arrival in united states, traveled to united states on her own, had limited education, and was allegedly fleeing a risk of gender-based violence, the panel finds that the claimant\u2019s explanation for not claiming asylum upon entry to United States is reasonable. The panel has considered whether the claimant\u2019s failure to claim asylum in United States when she became older undermines the claimant\u2019s subjective fear. The claimant was born [XXX] and turned [XXX] years old in July 2018. The claimant entered Canada on [XXX] 2018. Therefore, the claimant was a minor during the entire time spent residing in United States. Considering the claimant\u2019 s age, level of maturity, lack of parental accompaniment, and limited knowledge of the United State\u2019s asylum claim system, the panel finds that the claimant\u2019s explanation for failure to claim asylum, after spending approximately two and a half years in United States, is satisfactory. Therefore, the panel finds that the claimant\u2019s failure to claim asylum in United States does not undermine the claimant\u2019s subjective fear.\nStatus in United States\n[14] The claimant testified that she entered the United States illegally by use of travel documents belonging to her cousin, who is a citizen of United States. The claimant testified that she does not have any form of legal status in United States and has never applied for legal status in United States. RPD search results revealed no history of Temporary Visa Application attached to the claimant\u2019s name. Fingerprints of the claimant submitted to the US Department of Homeland Security database resulted in a result of \u2018no match\u2019. In light of the evidence before the panel, the panel finds on a balance of probabilities that the claimant does not have legal status in United States.\nDocumentary Evidence\n[15] The claimant was asked whether she has any documentary evidence to demonstrate communications with her former same sex partner who she dated in United States. The claimant testified that she does not have any evidence of communications as she deleted the messages. The claimant testified that the reason she deleted all messages between herself and her former partner was due to the fact that she tried to be as discreet as possible. The claimant stated that her family members openly expressed disgust for any form of homosexual activity. The claimant testified that she kept her same sex relationship a secret from her relatives in United States. The panel finds the claimant\u2019s explanation for a lack of documentary evidence to be reasonable. Considering that the claimant was residing in a familial environment that was discriminatory towards lesbian and gay individuals, the panel finds that it is reasonable that the claimant would delete evidence of communications between herself and her same sex partner.\n[16] The clamant provided support letters from her mother and cousin, including photo identification of each.[6] The letters corroborate the information provided in the claimant\u2019s claim.\nLGBTQ+ Services and Experience in Canada\n[17] The claimant testified that she is not aware of any LGBTQ+ organizations in Canada. She stated that she has never considered attending any type of LGBTQ+ services as she is not used to engaging in such programs. The claimant declared that she wants to be open about her sexuality in Canada however she finds it challenging to be completely open about her sexuality after having to be secretive about her sexual orientation for her entire life. The claimant testified that she does not use any social media apps to meet people in Canada. The claimant testified that she was involved in two same sex relationships during her adolescence and at this time she is single and not interested in entering a relationship at this time.\n[18] The panel finds the claimant to be a credible witness and accepts that the above noted events have occurred as alleged by the claimant in her oral and written testimonies. Accordingly, the panel finds that the claimant has established on a balance of probabilities that she is a lesbian woman.\nObjective Basis\n[19] The panel has assessed the objective basis for the claimant\u2019s fear of persecution in Nigeria. In making the assessment, the panel must consider the claimant\u2019s personal circumstances and vulnerabilities, and in this regard, the panel refers to the UNHCR Handbook. Guidance from the UNHCR Handbook on Determining Refugee Status, and Canadian jurisprudence, indicates that discrimination can amount to persecution cumulatively when the following conditions are met. First, there must be a number of discriminatory acts which take place in a general atmosphere of insecurity in the country of origin. The discriminatory acts must be of such a nature that they are substantially prejudicial to the person concerned. Where the cumulative nature of discrimination results in an insecure future for the person concerned, this constitutes persecution.\n[20] The documentary evidence clearly states that same sex relationships are criminalized in Nigeria. The Same Sex Marriage (Prohibition) Act enacted in January 2014, effectively renders illegal all forms of activity supporting or promoting LGBTIQ rights.[7] Federal legislation prohibits a marriage contract or civil union entered into between persons of the same sex and provides penalties for the solemnisation and witnessing of same thereof.[8] A person who enters into a same sex marriage or union is liable on conviction to a term of 14 years imprisonment. Furthermore, a person who witnesses or is involved in any form of organization, club, society, or meetings surrounding same sex relationships is liable on conviction to a term of 10 years of imprisonment.\n[21] The objective evidence addresses the social stigma surrounding same sex relationships in Nigeria. Sources indicate that any sexual orientation that is not heterosexual is considered to be unnatural, demonic, and immoral in Nigeria.[9] Sources indicate that many LGBT individuals enter heterosexual relationships to \u201ccover\u201d for same-sex relationships. Bisexual individuals may marry members of the opposite sex due to societal pressures to marry and have children as well, and due to homophobic persecution, stigma, and in order to avoid suspicion of having a non-heterosexual orientation.[10]\n[22] In summary, the objective country condition evidence supports a conclusion that there is a clear objective basis for the claimant\u2019 s fear of persecution on account of her sexual orientation as a lesbian. Accordingly, the panel finds that the claimant has a well-founded fear of persecution.\nSTATE PROTECTION\n[23] States are presumed to be capable of protecting their citizens, except in situations where the country is in a state of complete breakdown. The responsibility to provide international (or surrogate) protection only becomes engaged when national or state protection is unavailable to the claimant. To rebut the presumption of state protection, a claimant must provide \u201cclear and convincing\u201d evidence of the state\u2019s inability to protect its citizens. A claimant is required to approach the state for protection if protection might reasonably be forthcoming. However, a claimant is not required to risk their life seeking ineffective protection of a state, merely to demonstrate that ineffectiveness.[11]\n[24] In this case, the claimant fears persecution at the hands of Nigerian authorities and the Nigerian community because of the fact that individuals involved in same-sex relationship are criminalized and ostracized in Nigeria. As the state is the agent of persecution, the panel finds that it would be objectively unreasonable for the claimant to seek the protection of the state in light of the claimant\u2019s particular circumstances.\nINTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE\n[25] The panel has considered whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for the claimant in Nigeria. On the evidence before the panel, the panel finds that there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout Nigeria. The Federal laws of Nigeria enforce the criminalization of same sex relationships, and are applicable throughout the country. Therefore, the test fails on the first prong, and a viable internal flight alternative does not exist for the claimant in Nigeria.\nDECISION\n[26] For these reasons, the panel finds that the claimant faces a risk of persecution if she returns to Nigeria. Accordingly, the panel finds [XXX] to be a Convention refugee pursuant to Section 96 of the Immigration and refugee protection act. Therefore, the claim is accepted.\n[1] Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27, as amended, sections 96, 97(1)(a) and 97(1)(b).\n[2] Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 4: Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution: Update.\n[3] Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9: Proceedings Before the IRB Involving Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression, May 1, 2017\n[4] Exhibit 1, Package of Information from the Referring CBSA \/ IRCC\n[5] (Maldonado [1980] 2.F.C. 302 (C.A.))\n[6] Exhibit 4\n[7] National Documentation Package, Nigeria, 29 November 2019, tab 6.1: Treatment of sexual minorities, including legislation, state protection, and support services; the safety of sexual minorities living in Lagos and Abuja (February 2012-October 2015).

Bebbington\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Joo Eun Kim\nCountry: Syria\nRPD Number: TB7-20660\nAssociated RPD Number(s): TB7-20661, TB7-20662 TB7-20663, TB7-20664\nATIP Number: A-2021-01106\nATIP Pages: 000043-000047\nDECISION\nOn February 4, 2020, the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) heard the claim of [XXX], [XXX]and [XXX] who claim refugee protection under sections 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA). On that same day, the panel rendered its oral SPLIT decision and Reasons for decision. This is the written version of the oral decision and Reasons that have been edited for clarity, spelling, grammar and syntax with added references to the documentary evidence and relevant case law where appropriate.\n[1] MEMBER: Back on the record. I\u2019ve considered your testimony in this claim and other evidence and I\u2019m ready to render my decision orally.\n[2] These are the reasons for the decision in the claims of [XXX] and [XXX] who claim to be citizens of Syria and are claiming refugee protection pursuant to Sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.[1]\n[3] I\u2019ve appointed [XXX] as the designated representative of the minor children, [XXX] and [XXX].\nALLEGATIONS\n[4] You state you\u2019ve lived in Kuwait until 2017 when your work permit was cancelled. You have no path to citizenship in Kuwait. You allege that you are being sought by government forces in Syria.\n[5] Your full allegations are set out in your basis of claim form narrative and its amendments.[2]\nDETERMINATION:\n[6] I note that one of the claimants [XXX] is a citizen of the United States. The board finds that the claimant has not provided any credible or trustworthy evidence to establish that he would be persecuted in the United States pursuant to Section 96 of the IRPA or be at risk pursuant to Section 97 of the IRPA.\n[7] I find there is insufficient evidence to establish that there is more than a mere possibility of persecution in the US for the American minor claimant. The American minor claimant\u2019s request for refugee protection is rejected.\n[8] I find on balance that the remaining claimants would be subjected personally to a risk to their lives or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment should they return to Syria for the following reasons.\nIDENTITY:\n[9] I find that your identities other than that for the US born claimant, as nationals of Syria is established by your testimony and supporting documentation filed including your passports, a series of Syrian country documents as well as documents pertaining to Kuwait.[3]\nCREDIBILITY:\n[10] I find you to be credible witnesses and therefore believe what you have alleged in support of your claim. You testified in a straightforward manner; there were no relative inconsistencies in your testimony or contradictions between your testimony and the other evidence before me which have not been satisfactorily explained.\n[11] When a claimant swears to the truth of certain allegations this creates a presumption that those allegations are true unless there\u2019s a reason to doubt their truthfulness, this is found in Federal Court case law in Maldonado.[4]\nOBJECTIVE BASIS OF FUTURE RISK:\n[12] The Situation of Sunni\u2019s in Syria.\n[13] The Assad family has ruled Syria since former president Hafez Al-Assad seized power in Ba\u2019athist coup in 1970 his son Bashar Al-Assad, became president in 2000 following the death of his father.\n[14] The Assad\u2019s hail from the Alawis\u2019 an off shoot of Shia Islam that represents approximately thirteen percent of Syria\u2019s population. Along their rise to power the Assad family placed loyal Alawis\u2019 in key positions throughout the government including in the security intelligence and military sectors.\n[15] Both Assad regimes spent decades forging strategic ties with prominent Sunni Muslim families and religious authorities in order to consolidate their hold on political and economic power.\n[16] This fragile balance of religious ethnic and ideological identities persisted for decades until it finally collapsed in early 2011 as mass uprisings proliferated throughout.\n[17] Despite the largely non-violent nature of the anti regime demonstrations that spread across the country beginning in March of that year, the Assad government responded with a violent crackdown that represented peaceful movement, while allowing armed rebel factions to dominate the uprisings as the situation deadly devolved into a full-scale civil war later that year.[5]\n[18] The Syrian conflict has been described by a number of sources as having evolved to a largely sectarian conflict.[6]\n[19] As a consequence of the complex sectarian dynamics of the countries ongoing civil war more than five hundred thousand people have died and more than twelve million people have been displaced.\n[20] Sunni Muslims while they constitute the large majority of the population in Syria are reported as being disproportionately targeted by the government and its allied militias that are largely viewing religious affiliation as a proxy for political beliefs and assume that most Sunni\u2019s support, supported the opposition to its rule.[7]\n[21] There were continued reports of war waged by the Alawis\u2019 dominated government against the opposition forces and terrorist groups resulted in significant casualties among the majority Sunni population.\n[22] The government continued its widespread and systematic use of unlawful killings including the repeated use of chemical weapons and forced disappearances, torture and arbitrary detention to punish perceived opponents including civilians the majority of whom were Sunni Muslims.\n[23] Sources report that the government and its allies have killed, arrested and physically abused members of the Sunni Muslim community and have seized property of those who fled with the explicit intention of permanently displacing these individuals and change in the religious demography of these areas by populating the areas with Shia and Alwaite\u2019s residents.[8]\n[24] Media and academic experts said the government continued to portray the armed resistance and sectarian terms saying the opposition protestors and fighters were associated with extreme Islamic factions and terrorists seeking to eliminate the country\u2019s religious minority groups and its secular approach to governance.[9]\n[25] There is little indication in the evidence at the disposal of the panel that the situation has markedly improved since the production of these reports.\n[26] Based on the credibility of your allegations, the documentary evidence as I\u2019ve set out above I find you have established a future risk that you will be subjected to harm.\nSTATE PROTECTION:\n[27] The panel is of the opinion that in light of the above described situation presently prevailing in Syria, the Syrian state can be described as being in a state approaching complete breakdown. Consequently, the presumption to the effect that the state is capable of protecting its citizens does not apply in the present case.[10]\n[28] Hence in that content given the fact that the state is in some cases the agent of persecution the panel concludes there is clear and convincing evidence the claimants would not be able to obtain adequate protection if they would be in danger in Syria.\n[29] I find that it would be objectively unreasonable for the claimants to seek the protection of the state in light of your particular circumstances.\nINTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE:\n[30] I have considered whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for you. Given the fact that the principal claimant\u2019 s fear of persecution is based in his credible testimony, that he is being sought by the Syrian authorities aside from his identity as a Sunni Muslim, a consideration for an IFA in all zones under the control of the Syrian state is not relevant to the present case as it can be assumed that the claimant and his family would face persecution in all of these areas.\n[31] Moreover, the panel is of the opinion that it would not be viable in the present circumstances given the profile of the claimants to establish themselves in areas under the control of non-state actors.\n[32] On the evidence before me, I find it is not objectively reasonable in all the circumstances including those particular you for you to seek refuge in Syria for the reasons I have described.\nCONCLUSION:\n[33] In conclusion, based on the analysis above, I conclude that you are persons in need of protection and accordingly I accept your claims.\n[34] Thank you. You will receive a copy of my decision in the next few weeks so it will be transcribed, it will come back to my desk and I\u2019ll sign off on it. I will put in any applicable references, correct any of my grammatical errors and it will then be provided to you.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n[1] Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27 as amended, sections 96 and 97(1).\n[2] Exhibit 2, Basis of Claim (BOC) Form (TB7-20660), received September 6, 2017; Exhibit 7, BOC Amendment, received November 22, 2017; Exhibit 12, BOC Amendment, received January 27, 2020.\n[3] Exhibit 13, Claimants\u2019 Personal Supporting Documents, received January 27, 2020.\n[4] Maldonado v.

His passport proves his identity and that he is a citizen of Turkey.\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] He was a practicing [XXX] in Turkey and a supporter of the Hizmet movement since age\n13. His family were supporters as well. His father and brother were suspended from their jobs and criminally charged in 2016 for suspected connections to a terrorist organization in relation to the Hizmet or Fehtullah Gullen movement after the failed coup of 2016. The claimant [XXX] father in his court case. The father was convicted and sentenced to more than six years imprisonment and his appeal was rejected.\n[3] The claimant who had not been formally accused of crimes in Turkey, feared being discovered or accused of being a Hizmet follower like his father. Some of the claimant\u2019s [XXX] had already been accused and arrested.\n[4] After his father\u2019s failed appeal, the claimant left Turkey for his safety and the claimant made a refugee claim in Canada.\n[5] After arriving in Canada, he testified in his refugee hearing the police came looking for him at his home and office and that an arrest warrant has been issued against him in Turkey.\nDETERMINATION\n[6] The claimant is a \u201cConvention refugee\u201c. He established a serious possibility of persecution on account of his political opinion (Hizmet supporter or follower).\nANALYSIS\nCredibility\n[7] The claimant was sufficiently credible as a witness regarding his allegation that he is a Hizmet follower or supporter.\n[8] There were several other areas where the claimant was not credible but those elements were not determinative and it was necessary to give the claimant the benefit of the doubt for those other elements. An example of a non-credible element that was not determinative was his late disclosure in his hearing testimony where he testified that he, two months ago, became aware that he was the subject of an arrest warrant in Turkey, though he had declared at the start of the hearing that his basis of claim (BOC) form was \u201ccomplete\u201d, where there was no mention of an arrest warrant against the claimant in his BOC and where his BOC clearly instructs him to make an update of his BOC if there is new information to submit in his hearing.\n[9] What I retained as credible was that the claimant probably supported the Hizmet movement, as his father and brother did and for which his father received a lengthy prison sentence.\n[10] The claimant submitted probative evidence in support of his claim. He submitted court documents showing the charges against his father, where the claimant was the [XXX], and against his brother and a Turkish government decree naming his father as an accused in association with a terrorist organization and association with FETO (Gullen movement) and its members (Document #4).\n[11] Having considered all of the evidence, I conclude that the claimant is not the subject of an arrest warrant in Turkey, he was not accused of connections to the Gullen movement, but that his father was and the claimant himself was forced to hide his support for the Gullen or Hizmet movement in whatever degree he supported Hizmet so not to be accused or arrested in Turkey.\n[12] The National Documentation Packages for Turkey (NDP), dated 29 March 2019, shows that the current government in Turkey has forcefully repressed perceived political opponents such as the Gullen movement, including abuse and detention of their friends or family members (NDP, tabs 1.7 and 4.6). The NDP shows that Turkish authorities are reported to have committed abuses and serious mistreatment of detainees (NDP, tabs 1.7, 10.1 and 10.2). Political dissidents have been severely dealt with by the governing power in Turkey (NDP, tabs 4.5 and 13.1).\nState Protection\n[13] There is clear and convincing evidence before me that the state is unable or unwilling to provide the claimant with adequate protection, for the reasons stated above.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[14] On the evidence before me, I find that there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout Turkey for the claimant, for the reasons stated above.\nCONCLUSION\n[15] The claimant is a \u201cConvention refugee\u201c.\n[16] I accept his claim.\n\n",

Principal file number MB9-15304.\n[2] The claimants are stateless Palestinians with the exception of [XXX], who is a citizen of the United States.\n[3] They all claim refugee protection m Canada pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[4] Prior to the start of the hearing, [XXX] was named as the designated representative for his three children, who are minors.\nDetermination\n[5] I have considered your testimony and the other evidence in the case and I am prepared to render my decision orally.\n[6] A written version of these reasons will be provided to you by mail at a later date.\n[7] I find that [XXX] and [XXX] have established on a balance of probabilities that they face a well-founded fear of persecution in their country of former habitual residence due to their nationality or ethnicity as stateless Palestinians.\n[8] Your claims are therefore accepted.\n[9] With respect to the claim of [XXX], it has not been established that she faces a serious possibility of persecution, or on a balance of probabilities, a risk to her life, or risk of cruel or unusual treatment or punishment, or danger of torture, in the United States.\n[10] Her claim is therefore denied.\nAllegations\n[11] Your allegations are detailed in your Basis of Claim forms.\n[12] In summary, [XXX] was born in a refugee camp in South Lebanon in [XXX] to Palestinian parents.\n[13] After completing his university studies in Turkey, [XXX] went back to Lebanon to find work, but was refused several opportunities on account of his status as a Palestinian refugee.\n[14] In [XXX] 2000, he obtained a visa to travel to the U.A.E. Once there, he found a job and remained in the U.A.E. until his final departure in [XXX] of 2019.\n[15] [XXX] was born in Lebanon in [XXX] to Palestinian parents.\n[16] In 1987 she and her family fled Lebanon and travelled to the U.A.E.\n[17] [XXX] and [XXX] met in the U.A.E. and they married in 2003.\n[18] In 2014, [XXX] became friends with a work colleague by the name of [XXX] (Ph.).\n[19] In [XXX] of 2016, [XXX] travelled to Lebanon in order to renew his Lebanese travel document.\n[20] He was to go for an interview with a Lebanese official and members of the Hezbollah.\n[21] Considering that [XXX] worked in the field of [XXX] for nearly two decades in the U.A.E. and was familiar with various military bases, he was told to provide information about military sites in the U.A.E. to [XXX], who had ties with the Hezbollah.\n[22] [XXX] returned to the U.A.E. with the intention of not cooperating with the Lebanese authorities and never going back to Lebanon.\n[23] In [XXX] of 2019, [XXX] was summoned by the [XXX] Services.\n[24] He was questioned about his relationship with [XXX].\n[25] [XXX] was told that he was no longer welcome in the U.A.E. and that he and his family had to leave.\n[26] On [XXX] 2019, [XXX] along with his wife and children, travelled from the U.A.E. to the U.S.A.\n[27] On [XXX] 2019, the claimants crossed the Canada\/U.S. border and applied for refugee status upon entry.\nIdentity\n[28] The personal and national identity of [XXX], as a citizen of the U.S., is established on a balance of probabilities by her birth certificate from the State of Hawaii, her U.S. passport, and her U.A.E. resident visa that are on file.\n[29] I find that the other claimants have established their personal and national identities as stateless Palestinians based on their UNRWA Family Registration Card, their Palestinian refugee cards, as well as the birth certificates of [XXX] and [XXX].\nCountries of Former Habitual Residence\n[30] In cases where a claimant is stateless, an examination of the claimant\u2019s countries of formal habitual residence is required.\n[31] As far as to finding what constitutes a country of former habitual residence, established jurisprudence states that:\n[32] \u201cWhile claimants \u2014 a claimant needs to have established a significant period of de facto residence in a country of former habitual residence, the term implies a situation where a stateless person was admitted to a given country with a view to a continuing residence of some duration.\u201d\n[33] With this in mind, I have considered whether Lebanon and the U.A.E. may qualify as countries of former habitual residence for the stateless claimants.\n[34] Both the adult claimants were born in Lebanon.\n[35] [XXX] spent approximately 20 years in Lebanon and has a variety of documents from the Lebanese authorities which confirms that he was admitted to Lebanon with the view of continuing residence.\n[36] From 2000 to 2019, he lived and worked in the U.A.E. And although he alleges he can no longer return there, the fact remains that he did establish de facto residence in the U.A.E. and was admitted with a view to continue residence there.\n[37] I therefore consider both the U.A.E. and Lebanon as countries of former habitual residence for [XXX].\n[38] As for [XXX], while she was born in Lebanon, she only spent four years there.\n[39] Nevertheless, the Federal Court, in the decision Al-Khateeb, stated that:\n[40] \u201cSignificant period of de facto residence can mean something other than a substantial period of time and a short period can be significant.\u201d\n[50] I\u2019ve considered [XXX] period of time in Lebanon to be significant, considering that she continues to have official ties to Lebanon as a resident of that country and a recognized refugee by the Lebanese Republic.\n[51] I therefore consider Lebanon to be a country of former habitual residence for [XXX].\n[52] I also considered the U.A.E. to be a country of former habitual residence for [XXX], given that she lived there for approximately three decades.\n[53] As for [XXX] and [XXX], I also find that their countries of former habitual residence are Lebanon and the U.A.E.\n[54] While they did not reside in Lebanon for an extended period of time, as their parents did, they have spent time there and they are recognized as residents of Lebanon by the Lebanese authorities, as indicated in the Lebanese refugee cards and their UNRWA Family Registration Cards.\n[55] Given the two identified countries of former habitual residence in this case, I will examine if the claimants, other than [XXX], would suffer persecution in Lebanon, and if so, whether they have the right to return to the United Arab Emirates.\nCredibility\n[56] Testimony provided under oath is presumed to be truthful, unless there is a reason for doubting its truthfulness.\n[57] The adult claimants were each genuine, sincere, and candid in their testimony. There was no attempt to embellish or exaggerate their claims.\n[58] Although [XXX]\u2013[XXX] testified as to the harassment and discrimination he suffered in Lebanon.\n[59] He also explained the fears that he has for his wife and children should they accompany him to Lebanon.\n[60] The allegations regarding the harassment and discrimination suffered by Palestinians in Lebanon and their limited to access to employment, education, and health care is consistent with the documentary evidence in the National Documentation Package for Lebanon. I refer to the documents in section 13 of the National Documentation Package for Lebanon.\n[61] I also note that [XXX] has provided a variety of documents regarding his work experience in the U.A.E.\n[62] For these reasons, I find the claimants have established their allegations on a balance of probabilities.\nSection 96 Analysis for the Stateless Claimants\n[63] The determinative issue for me in these claims is whether, as stateless Palestinian refugees in Lebanon, the claimants face a forward-looking serious possibility of persecution on the basis of their Palestinian nationality. This includes a serious possibility of cumulative discrimination amounting to persecution.\n[64] For the reasons outlined above, I find that you have established your identities as stateless Palestinians whose former habitual residence is Lebanon.\n[65] I find that based on the objective country evidence regarding the treatment of stateless Palestinians in Lebanon, you all face a serious possibility of cumulative discrimination amounting to persecution.\n[67] Item 13.1 of the National Documentation Package for Lebanon is a Response to Information Request which cites the U.S. Department of State Report in saying that:\n[68] \u201cThere is widespread and systematic discrimination against Palestinian refugees in Lebanon.\u201d\n[69] The same document cites sources which state that:\n[70] \u201cPalestinians in Lebanon are more at risk of arbitrary detention, torture, and kidnapping.\u201d\n[71] And that:\n[72] \u201cPalestinians lack basic social, economic, political, and civil rights.\u201d\n[73] Item 13.4 of the National Documentation Package, another Response to Information Request, reports that:\n[74] \u201cDiscriminatory policies against Palestinians in Lebanon are systematic and Palestinians have been discriminated against by the Lebanese state for decades. There are few signs that this will improve. Palestinian refugees are characterized as poor or often live in extreme poverty and are economically disadvantaged.\u201d\n[75] Item 13.2 in the National Documentation Package for Lebanon, a more recent UNHCR report states that:\n[76] \u201cPalestinian refugees in Lebanon reportedly continued to face acute socioeconomic\ndeprivation and legal barriers to their full enjoyment of a broad range of human rights.\n[77] Palestinian refugees in Lebanon are reported to have historically been marginalized and excluded from key aspects of social, political, and economic life, with no right to own immovable property, severely curtailed access to public services such as health and education, and restrictions regarding specific professions and limited job opportunities.\u201d\n[78] Finally, Item 13.7 of the National Documentation Package for Lebanon, a Danish Immigration Service Reports cites an international organization at page 28 of the report, stating that:\n[79] \u201cThe situation of Palestinian refugees in Lebanon, with regard to the access to public education, health care, and employment was not changed in recent years and Palestinians remain excluded from access to public services in Lebanon.\u201d\n[80] On the basis of this evidence, I find that the treatment of Palestinian refugees in Lebanon and restrictions to employment, property rights, and movement, and their denial of access to healthcare and education by the Lebanese State constitutes cumulative discrimination amounting to persecution.\n[81] Given my conclusion, I have not analyzed the allegations of [XXX] being threatened by the Lebanese authorities. However, I did note that I find these allegations to also be credible.\nState Protection and Internal Flight Alternative for the Stateless Claimants in Lebanon\n[82] A number of human rights abuses persist within the Palestinian camps in in Lebanon in\ngeneral.\n[83] These include arbitrary arrest and detention of Palestinians by state security forces and by autonomous Palestinian security groups.\n[84] Lebanon is not a signatory to the 1951 UN Refugee Convention and Palestinian refugees who live in Lebanon are denied citizenship rights in that country.\n[85] Lebanon does not recognize the UN\u2019s 1967 Protocol and does not recognize the basic rights and legal obligations to people with refugee status.\n[86] Information from the Danish Immigration Services sets out the social discrimination against Palestinians in Lebanon and notes that:\n[87] \u201cThey are less protected and often linked in the Lebanese media to insecurities, civil war, and radical groups.\u201d\n[88] The former Minister of Lebanon has stated that:\n[89] \u201cPalestinians in Lebanon are in complete misery and a very dire situation.\u201d\n[90] [XXX] testimony and the documentary evidence referenced above make it clear that state protection and relocation within Lebanon are not options for the claimants.\n[91] The U.S. Department of State Report sets out that:\n[92] \u201cSevere discrimination against Palestinians is widespread and systematic throughout all areas of Lebanon, particularly outside of refugee camps.\n[93] Legislation in Lebanon prohibits Palestinian refugees from owning property in the country.\u201d\n[94] For all these reasons, I find on a balance of probabilism that adequate state protection is not available to the claimants and that an internal flight alternative is also not available, as they would not be able to reasonably relocate within Lebanon.\nInability to Return to the U.A.E.\n[95] The claimants maintain in their testimony that they cannot return to the U.A.E., where they had temporary residence.\n[96] [XXX] was ordered to leave the country by the Emirate Security Officials and subsequently had his employment terminated.\n[97] He maintains that neither he, nor his family, can return to the U.A.E. at this point.\n[98] In addition to [XXX] testimony, I have also considered the Response to Information Requests at Tabs 14.1 and 14.2 of the U.A.E. National Documentation Package.\n[99] Tab 14.1 indicates that after a six-month absence, a resident of the U.A.E. cannot re-enter the country without having to obtain a new visa.\n[100] Given [XXX] credible allegations, it is unlikely that [XXX], or his family, could obtain a new visa and re-enter the U.A.E.\n[101] As a result of the above, I find that the stateless claimants cannot return to the U.A.E. as a country of formal habitual residence.\nRefugee Claim of [XXX], Citizen of the U.S.\n[102] Under section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, a refugee claimant \u2014 a refugee claim must be established in regards to the claimant\u2019s country of nationality.\n[103] As mentioned earlier, [XXX] is an American citizen.\n[104] Consequently, I considered the possibility of persecution and the risk of harm that she would face in the U.S.\n[105] When questioned on the risks to [XXX] stated that he had no fears for his daughter in the U.S., other than the fact that she would be separated from her parents.\n[106] Counsel for his part had no argument regarding any potential persecution or risk of harm to [XXX] in the U.S.\n[107] In order to be considered refugees, claimants must face a well-founded fear of persecution based on a Convention ground.\n[108] In my view, the claimants have not established that [XXX] would face persecution for a ground stated under the Convention.\n[109] With neither a link to the Convention, nor a fear of persecution, I conclude that she is not a refugee, as per section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[110] Furthermore, the claimants have not made any allegations that [XXX] faces a danger of torture in the U.S., as per section 97(1)(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, or a risk to her life, as per section 97(1)(b) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[111] Regarding cruel and unusual treatment, I do not find that [XXX] could find herself separated from her parents upon return to the U.S., on a balance of probabilities.\n[112] There are provisions under the Canadian Immigration and Refugee Protection Act that will more likely than not allow [XXX] to remain in Canada with her parents, given their soon to be status of Convention refugees.\n[113] The claimants have therefore not demonstrated that [XXX] would face harm as described under paragraph 97(1)(b) on a balance of probabilities.\nConclusion\n[114] Having considered all the evidence, including your testimony, I find that [XXX] and [XXX] are Convention refugees pursuant to section 96 of the Act and I therefore accept your claims.\n[115] I find that [XXX] has not established that she faces a serious possibility of persecution or, on a balance of probabilities, a risk to her life, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or danger of torture in the United States. Her claim is therefore denied.\n[116] I want to thank you for your testimony today and I wish you and your children all the best.\n[117] \u2014 Upon concluding\n\n",

        "unofficial_text":"2020 RLLR 121\n\nCitation: 2020 RLLR 121\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: March 18, 2020\nPanel: Carolyn Rumsey\nCounsel for the Claimant(s):\nCountry: Cuba\nRPD Number: MB9-00025\nAssociated RPD Number(s):\nATIP Number: A-2021-01106\nATIP Pages: 000019-000024\nBY THE PANEL:\n[1] Your claim number is MB9-00025. You are claiming to be a citizen of Cuba, and you are making a refugee claim pursuant to Section 96 and sub-Section 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. We call it the IRPA. So, because you are a minor, as we discussed during the hearing, you are 17 almost 18. [XXX] (phonetic), who is not a claimant has acted as your designated representative for these proceedings. So, because of your legal status as still being a minor, I have also considered and applied our Chairperson guideline three, which is on child refugee claimants, procedural and evidentiary issues.\nDETERMINATION\n[2] So, my determination. For the reasons that follow, I find that you have established that there is a well-founded fear for yourself in Cuba\u2026 or a well-founded fear of persecution, sorry. So, this fear is based on your political opinions, which are against the government in your country of origin. I therefore find that you are a \u201cConvention refugee\u201d pursuant to Section 96 of the IRPA.\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] So, just to talk about your allegations, very briefly. Your detailed allegations are contained in your Basis of Claim form, which we also talked about today. So, you have written about and testified as well about the problems that you had had with your father, who has applied pressure on your to go into [XXX], and follow, sort of, in his footsteps, which you have made clear that you don\u2019t wish to do. That\u2019s not the path that you want to follow in your life. Your father is a member of [XXX]. You provided an identity card for his membership of the [XXX] in Cuba. This problem that you have with your father created further tensions because of your anti\u00adgovernment views in general, your political opinion.\n[4] You also told me about an incident that occurred when you were in school back in Cuba. You say that shortly after the death of Fidel Castro, you were shown a film which was very positive regarding him, and his family, and the government. And, you say you were overheard by your teacher in class discussing this and criticizing the family and the government with your friends. And so, you mentioned that your teacher threatened to send you to the principal\u2019s office, and you spoke quite a bit about your fear of what that could lead to more long term. So, you were afraid that the police could get involved in that sense, and that things could become much more serious for you as a result.\n[5] You also have testified that you have been away from Cuba for quite some time at this point, I believe that\u2019s it\u2019s been about a year and a half, so you fear that this could raise suspicions about you because the government keeps track of the movements of its citizens. And, that people who spend a long time away are often political dissidents, and you fear that this could be something that highlights your presence to them as well. So, you have alleged that you fear being imprisoned or harmed by the State authorities if you were to return to Cuba.\nANALYSIS\nIDENTITY\n[6] So, for my analysis, in terms of your identity, I find that your personal and national identity as a citizen of Cuba are established on a balance of probabilities by the documentary evidence on file, in particular a copy of your Cuban passport.\nCREDIBILITY\n[7] In terms of your credibility, I found that your testimony was credible today. You testified spontaneously, without hesitation, you answered my questions directly and with lots of detail. There were no significant contradictions, no omissions, no inconsistencies in your testimony, or when compared with your narrative. I found you especially credible when you were talking about your difficult relationship with your father, based on these problems that you have had, your disagreements about your views in general, about the [XXX], about the government and those kinds of things. You testified that your father first started putting pressure on you at the end of your grade nine year in school, which would have been approximately three years ago. And, you spoke about this incident that took place in class. Also, I found you to be credible when you were talking about that. I found also your testimony about your fears of returning to be credible. And, even more convincing for me was your testimony about wanting to become a [XXX] or a [XXX]. So, you clearly stated to me that you could not return to Cuba and be silent about the things that happened there, about the way that your country is run. And, you even said that if you get to stay in Canada, you would like to continue to support those views about Cuba from afar.\n[8] So, when we have claimants come in and talk about feeling persecuted because of their political opinion, sometimes\u2026 or often times they have a lot of incidents to speak of. You are 17-years-old. You\u2019ve been here for a year and a half. So, you were quite young when you left your country. I\u2019ve taken that into consideration given that there weren\u2019t a lot of incidents. But I still found that you had a lot to talk about. You had a lot to say about your political opinions. And again, the most important part for me is that you made it clear that you could not return to Cuba and keep silent, which would make you a target for the authorities. In terms of your evidence, you\u2019ve submitted your father\u2019s I.D. car as well as some photos of him in [XXX]. So, to conclude this part of the decision, I found that you are a credible witness. I believe the allegations that you\u2019ve made in support of your claim today. So, based on your credible testimony and the documents that you\u2019ve submitted, I accept what you have alleged to day and in your narrative. I believe that you have established on a balance of probabilities that you would be a target; you would be at risk of being targeted for your political opinions in Cuba.\nOBJECTIVE BASIS\n[9] So, I took a look at objective evidence as well, and we have a package of information for each of the countries that we received claimants from. For the Cuban package, I find that the evidence is clear about how political opponents are treated in Cuba, and even perceived political opponents, how they are treated by the authorities. So, I\u2019ll just talk about that a little bit. Item 2.1 of the report is the United States Department of State report, it talks about Cuba being an authoritarian State. It\u2019s a one-party system, and the constitution recognizes the Communist party as the only legal party, and the highest political entity of the State. This government participates in unlawful and arbitrary killings, intimidation and physical assault of human rights and pro-democracy activists, political dissidents, other detainees and prisoners. And, they do this with impunity. So, they don\u2019t receive any kind of\u2026 they don\u2019t have to account for their actions essentially. The police use laws against public disorder, contempt, lack of respect, aggression, failure to pay minimal or arbitrary fines as ways to detain, threatened and arrest civil society activists. So, they have\u2026 they have a lot of things that they can use against\u2026 against people who are advocating against the government, basically.\n[10] There\u2019s an Amnesty International report at section 4.3 of the NDP, that talks about President Obama\u2019s visit in the year 2016. And, they refer to dozens of activists and independent journalists being detained including some members of Women in White, the organization that you spoke about, the wives and family members of people who are held in prison in Cuba. Human rights\u2026 A human rights organization that is not recognized by the government also reported 762 politically motivated and arbitrary detentions per month between 2014 and 2016. And, finally, the same report states that the Committee to Protect Journalists ranks Cuba tenth on the 2015 list of the world\u2019s most censored countries, and it also classified Cuba\u2019s laws on free speech and press freedom as the most restrictive in the Americas. So, that\u2019s the objective evidence that I have. And, I find on a balance of probabilities there is an objective basis for your claim.\nSTATE PROTECTION\n[11] So, we have to look at State protection. But I find that you\u2019re quite clear that the agent of persecution and who you fear is the State itself. So, we could not expect you to have access to adequate State protection in Cuba, because you have an anti-government viewpoint, and the objective basis\u2026 the objective evidence shows that the government targets individuals who oppose them. So, based on this evidence, I find that on a balance of probabilities adequate State protection would not be available to you if you were to return to Cuba.\nINTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE\n[12] And, finally, in deciding refugee claims, we have to look at whether or not you have what\u2019s called an internal flight alternative. So, that means we have to look and see if there is another place in your country where you could be safe. I didn\u2019t even ask you any questions about that today because again I think you\u2019ve been very clear that you fear the State. The State controls the entire country. So, I find that it\u2019s clear that on a balance of probabilities that there would be no safe place for you in Cuba. So, there is no safe internal flight alternative.\nCONCLUSION\n[13] So, finally, based on the totality of all of this evidence, I conclude that you would face a serious possibility of persecution on the basis of your political opinion in Cuba. Therefore, I find you to be a \u201cConvention refugee\u201d. I am accepting your refugee claim under Section 96 of the IRPA.\n\n",

They claim refugee protection in Canada pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (the Act).[1]\n[2] Prior to the start of the hearing, the Panel appointed the principal claimant as the designated representative for the minor female claimant.\n[3] In reaching its decision, the Panel took into consideration the Chairperson\u2019s Guidelines No. 4 on Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender Related Persecution.[2]\nALLEGATIONS\n[4] The claimants\u2019 detailed allegations are contained in the principal claimant\u2019s Basis of Claim form (BOC)[3] and in the revised narrative, dated [XXX] 2020.The associated and the minor female claimant has adopted the allegations of the principal claimant.\n[5] The principal claimant fears being initiated into a cult because of a promise made by his father, to the cult members, whereby the father had nominated the principal claimant as his successor in the cult.\n[6] The principal claimant was unaware of his father\u2019s cult membership and the promise. During his father\u2019s burial ceremony, on the [XXX] 2010, while the principal claimant and his family were waiting for the Imam to perform the prayer, three cult members, dressed in traditional cult attire, suddenly arrived in his house and demanded to perform the burial as per their own traditions and left after singing some religious incantations and this was the first time that the principal claimant learnt of his father\u2019 s cult association.\n[7] On the principal claimant\u2019s wedding night, on [XXX] 2014, five cult members came to the house of the principal claimant and gave him a parcel which revealed that he has been promised by the father to the cult and that he should prepare himself for the initiation otherwise dire consequences await him.\n[8] The same cult members came back again on the naming ceremony of the minor female claimant on [XXX] 2015 and reminded the principal claimant that they hope his next child is a male child so that they could offer the male child as a sacrifice and initiate the principal claimant into the cult.\n[9] The principal claimant unequivocally told them about his disinterest in becoming a cult member and shortly thereafter, he started receiving threatening calls, which continued despite the claimants\u2019 relocation from Ibadan to Oshogbo in Osun State.\n[10] Besides the cult members, the claimant\u2019s also fear [XXX], the current wealthy and influential family head with strong business ties, who has been strongly forcing and pressuring the claimants to perform Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) on the minor female claimant as per the traditional beliefs to uphold the family dignity and honour.\n[11] [XXX] made two unsuccessful kidnapping attempts on the minor female claimant, the first being on [XXX] 2017 and the second on [XXX] 2017.\n[12] The principal and the associated claimant further allege that they are both being personally targeted by [XXX] and his henchmen because of their non-compliance with the practice of FGM.\n[13] Fearing for their lives, the claimants left Nigeria on [XXX] 2017, were in the United States (US) until [XXX} 2018 and claimed asylum upon arrival in Canada.\nDETERMINATION\n[14] The Panel has considered all of the evidence and finds that the claimants have established that they face a serious possibility of persecution under section 96 of the IRPA, for the minor female claimant on the basis of her membership in a particular social group, namely girls fearing female genital mutilation (FGM) and for the principal and the associated claimant on the basis of their membership in a particular social group \u2013 family, particularly, Nigerian parents refusing to subject their daughter to FGM. Accordingly, the Panel concludes that they are all \u201cConvention refugees\u201d pursuant to section 96 of the Act.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[15] The claimants\u2019 personal and national identities as citizens of Nigeria are established, on a balance of probabilities, by their testimony and by the documentary evidence on file, including copies of their Nigerian passports.[4]\nNexus\n[16] With respect to the female minor claimant, the Panel finds that there is a link: between her fear and one of the five Convention grounds, as a member of a particular social group of women or girls fearing FGM in Nigeria. For the principal and the associated claimant, as the parents of the minor female claimant, there is a link with their membership in a particular social group, family. Accordingly, their claims have been assessed under Section 96 of the Act.\nCredibility and subjective fear\n[17] Testimony provided under oath is presumed to be truthful, unless there are reasons to doubt its truthfulness.[5] In the present case, the Panel has no such reason. The Panel finds the claimants to be credible witnesses and believes, on balance of probabilities, the key allegations of their claim. Their testimony was spontaneous, straightforward, direct and internally coherent with the documentary evidence on file and there were no significant contradictions, inconsistencies or omissions between the written and oral testimony. They were both spontaneous in their answers and the Panel did not find that they tried to embellish or exaggerate their narratives.\nFGM of Minor Female Claimant\n[18] The claimants testified in detail about the pressure and threats they received from the family head [XXX], to have their daughter subjected to FGM, as well as the importance of FGM to the family of principal claimant. The principal claimant credibly alleges that he comes from a family that adheres to traditional beliefs regarding performing FGM on every girl child of the family from the age two (2) and older.\n[19] The principal claimant provided a comprehensive testimony of the events as they unfolded starting from [XXX] 2016 until the claimants\u2019 departure from Nigeria. He testified that he was invited by [XXX] for a family meeting on [XXX] 2016, and it was during this meeting, the family members offered to the principal claimant the choice of choosing a date for performing FGM on the minor female claimant and when he refused to pick a date for the circumcision, [XXX] called the principal claimant towards the end of [XXX] 2016 and told the principal claimant that [XXX] 2017, is the date fixed for the circumcision of the minor female claimant.\n[20] The principal claimant further testified that when he did not take the minor female claimant for circumcision on the fixed date, the family members namely [XXX] and [XXX], at the behest [XXX], attempted to kidnap the minor female claimant from her house on [XXX] 2017. The associated claimant credibly testified how she was slapped on her ear by [XXX] while she was trying to rescue the minor female claimant from the kidnapper and that the whole situation was defused when their neighbor, [XXX], interjected to save the minor female claimant.\n[21] The claimants\u2019 testimony is further corroborated by the affidavit of [XXX][6], their neighbor and the Panel accords full probative value to the said document.\n[22] The principal claimant went on to explain that out of fear they decided to relocate to Oshogbo, Osun State but on [XXX] 2017, [XXX], posing to pick the minor female claimant from her school, went to the school in an attempt to kidnap her and the situation was brought under control only when the proprietor of [XXX] School called the principal claimant, seeking his permission to allow the female minor claimant to go with [XXX]. The principal claimant further described how [XXX] was chased away by the school authorities after the principal claimant refused to give his consent allowing [XXX] to pick minor female claimant from the school. The associated claimant testified that she too got a call from the para educator of the minor female claimant, asking if the associated claimant is aware that the minor female claimant will be picked by [XXX]. The claimant\u2019s oral testimony is keeping in line with their written testimony and is further corroborated by the letter from the proprietor of [XXX] School[7]. The Panel accords full weight to this document.\n[23] The principal claimant further testified that on [XXX] 2017, [XXX] called him and unambiguously told him that either they should bring the minor female claimant to the family or the family will eliminate them in order to perform the circumcision of the minor female claimant, thereby protecting and upholding the tradition of the family. From that time forward, the claimants realized that they would not be safe in Nigeria and they ramped up their efforts to leave the country. The principal claimant\u2019s testimony is corroborated by the affidavit of his mother-in-law[8] and his aunt[9].\n[24] Thus, in light of the two failed kidnapping attempts of minor female claimant by [XXX] and the threatening phone call on [XXX] 2017, the Panel concludes that, on balance of probabilities, [XXX] is interested in performing FGM on the minor female claimant.\nObjective basis\n[25] The principal claimant\u2019s allegations are consistent with the objective documentary evidence on FGM in Nigeria. The documentary evidence indicates that the practice of FGM \u2018continues to thrive\u2019 and is widespread in Nigeria, such that several thousand girls and women are subjected to it, despite the passing into law of the Violence against Person\u2019s (Prohibition) Act (VAPP)[10].\n[26] The documentary evidence states that decision to subject a girl to FGM in Nigeria is up to the girl\u2019s parents.[11] Though the tradition varies from one ethnic tribe to another, but the evidence indicates that the involvement of family members is a common feature.\n[27] According to the said documentary evidence[12], parents are free to oppose the rituals but then it goes on to explain that refusals come with consequences such as ostracism, stigmatization, blackmailing, denial of intracultural benefits and physical abuse.\n[28] The principal claimant testified that [XXX] and other members of his family believe that if a girl is not circumcised, she will grow up to be a prostitute and will bring defame to the family and that if anything untoward happens in the family, for instance, if there is a death in the family or somebody has an accident, or someone loses a job, has a broken marriage or if somebody\u2019s child failed an exam, the claimants will be blamed for the unfortunate events which will give [XXX] and the family an impetus to hunt down the claimants.\n[29] Thus, the Panel concludes, on balance of probabilities, that [XXX] and other family members are capable of forcing FGM on minor female claimant despite the opposition of the principal and associated claimant.\nSTATE PROTECTION\n[30] For the reasons below, the Panel finds that the claimants have rebutted the presumption of state protection with clear and convincing evidence that the state of Nigeria would be unable or unwilling to provide the claimants with adequate state protection.\n[31] The principal claimant was asked if he had made a police complaint about the two failed kidnapping attempts of the minor female claimant by [XXX]. He testified that making a police complaint would have yielded no results as [XXX] is a wealthy businessman, is politically well-connected and would have used the clout to get away with the complaint. The principal claimant went on to explain that considering it\u2019s a family matter, police would have been reluctant to intervene had he complained.\n[32] The Panel finds the principal claimant\u2019s explanation reasonable. Moreover, the objective evidence also indicates that the police response to traditional or customary matters is typically non-\u00adinterventionist. The research provides that \u201cin practice, people cannot necessarily rely on the police\u201d and it is the custodians of cultural or traditional rites that ultimately determine the fate of the individual\u201d.[13]\n[33] The Violence against persons (Prohibition) Act, 2015, is the federal law attempting to prohibit FGM across the whole county. The VAPP Act aims at eliminating gender-based violence in private and public life by criminalizing and setting out the punishment for acts including rape (but not spousal rape), incest, domestic violence, stalking, harmful traditional practices, and FGM. However, the VAPP Act is only in effect in the Federal Capital Territory, and as such, the remaining states must pass legislation to implement it across the country.[14] The documentary evidence further states that state governments have, to date, been slow to respond to the introduction of the VAPP Act. As of June 2018, only 13 states had adopted anti-FGM legislation.[15]\n[34] Despite the legislation, however, the documentary evidence indicates that the practice of FGM continues to thrive in Nigeria.[16] There have been no prosecutions of perpetrators of FGM in Nigeria since the passing of the legislation.[17] The documentary evidence also provides that it is extremely difficult for women and girls to obtain protection with respect to FGM, and that there is widespread community support for these practices and the traditional attitude of police help to support them.[18] Accordingly, the Panel finds that despite there being laws prohibiting FGM in Lagos and Abuja and in certain other states, these laws are not being enforced such that the claimants could reasonably expect adequate state protection from FGM in Nigeria.\n[35] Given the evidence, the Panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that adequate protection would not be provided to the minor female claimant or to the claimants for objecting to the practice, in Nigeria.\nInternal Flight Alternative (IFA)\n[36] At the hearing, the Panel identified Abuja, Port Harcourt, and Lagos as potential IFA locations (together, the \u201cIFA locations\u201d). However, the Panel finds that the claimants face a serious possibility of persecution throughout Nigeria. The Panel has considered the Jurisprudential Guide in the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) decision TB7-19851 but after careful consideration, the Panel does not view the circumstances of this case as an appropriate one to apply Jurisprudential guide given the far reach and influence of [XXX].\nMeans available for [XXX] to find claimants in Port Harcourt, Abuja and Lagos\n[37] The principal claimant testified that [XXX] has an [XXX] business which is operated from Port Harcourt, has a wife, kids and a half-brother in Port Harcourt and that the claimants can run into them in a mall, hospital, park or any other public place and there could also be a possibility of [XXX] kids and minor female claimant attending the same school. Because of all this, it will be very easy for [XXX] to find the claimants in Port Harcourt. The principal claimant further credibly alleged that [XXX] can also use power and connections to track down the claimants in Port Harcourt.\n[38] Furthermore, the principal claimant testified that he has many family members in Abuja, with whom he can have a coincidental encounter at a bank, shopping mall or a gas station and then they can always let pass [XXX] know that claimants are in Abuja who can then kill or harm them or kidnap the minor female claimant.\n[39] The principal claimant also explained that since Lagos is close to Ibadan and he has brothers and sisters living there, it will be easy for [XXX] to track him down there. He provided the example of how after the shop of one of his brother\u2019s got burnt, the claimants were blamed for the torching of the shop because of their refusal to comply with traditional practice of performing FGM on the minor female claimant. He went on to explain further that incidents like these can be an impetus for the extended family to disclose the claimant\u2019s location in Lagos to [XXX] if the claimants relocate to Lagos.\n[40] Moreover, after their relocation to Oshogbo in [XXX] 2017, [XXX] was not only able to find the claimants but also attempted to kidnap the minor female claimant on [XXX] 2017.\n[41] Hence, the Panel concludes that, on balance of probabilities, [XXX] has the means to find the claimants in Port Harcourt, Abuja and Lagos.\nMotivation to find the claimants\n[42] The principal claimant explained that [XXX], despite considering himself to be a guardian of traditional and family practises, has a vested interest in performing FGM of the minor female claimant since [XXX] wants to be a king and the kingmakers might use against [XXX] the fact that a girl from his own family has not been circumcised and that if he cannot make his own family adhere to their traditional beliefs and customs, [XXX] cannot be a good king.\n[43] The principal claimant\u2019s testimony is further buttressed by the affidavit from [XXX][19], mother-in-law of the principal claimant and the affidavit of [XXX][20], aunt of the principal claimant. Both these affidavits mention the constant threats hurled at them by [XXX] because of their alleged complicity with the claimants, vis-\u00e0-vis their refusal to subject the minor female claimant to FGM.\n[44] Hence, the Panel concludes that, on balance of probabilities, [XXX] has the means and motivation to find the claimants in Port Harcourt, Abuja and Lagos.\n[45] Thus, the Panel concludes that because the agent of persecution has the means and the motivation to find the claimants anywhere in Nigeria, there is no viable IFA in Nigeria for them. Furthermore, the Panel notes the absence of state protection for traditional practices and FGM throughout Nigeria.\n[46] Accordingly, the Panel finds that the possibility of an IFA fails on the first prong.\nCONCLUSION\n[47] Having considered and assessed the evidence in totality, the Panel concludes that the minor female claimant has established a serious possibility of persecution in Nigeria based on her membership in particular social group, Nigerian female fearing FGM.\n[48] The Panel also concludes that the principal and the associated claimant have established a serious possibility of persecution in Nigeria based on their membership in particular social group, namely family; in particular, Nigerian parents refusing to subject their daughter to FGM.\n[49] The Panel finds that the claimants are Convention refugees within the meaning of Section 96 of the Act.\n[50] The Panel, therefore, accepts their claims.\n[51] Since the Panel has found the claimants to be Convention Refugees within the meaning of Section 96 of the Act, the Panel does not deem it necessary to make an analysis of the fear of the principal claimant stemming from his refusal to be initiated in a traditional Yoruban cult, under section 96 and subsection 97(1) (b) of the Act.\n[1] Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c, 27, as amended.\n[2] Chairperson Guidelines 4: Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution.

Fraser\nCountry: Mexico\nRPD Number: MB7-12502\nAssociated RPD Number(s): MB7-12711, MB7-12712, MB7-12789\nATIP Number: A-2021-01106\nATIP Pages: 000001-000006\nREASONS FOR DECISION\nINTRODUCTION\n[1] These are the reasons for decision in the refugee protection claims filed by [XXX] and [XXX], who are alleging that they are citizens of Mexico and who are claiming refugee protection under section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).\n[2] [XXX], you were appointed as the designated representative for the minor children.\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] You fear senior leadership of the [XXX] department of the State of Tabasco, Mexico.\n[4] [XXX], you stated that after you were hired, you reported many anomalies and indicators pointing to corruption to your supervisor, whom you trusted. However, she was ultimately cooperating with the individuals you had reported. You stated that you received many veiled threats.\n[5] An altercation then took place on [XXX] 2017, in which your wife was followed in a vehicle and stopped by an armed man who appeared to be a soldier. She stated that he was surprised to see her with a child; she attributed his surprise to the fact that you are the one who usually drives the truck she was using that day.\n[6] You then stated that some men entered the shop run by you and your wife. They asked for you and demanded that you pay them so they could ensure your safety.\n[7] You then lost your job without any justification and you received death threats in connection with your shop, which prompted you to seek refuge in Quintana Roo.\n[8] After arriving there, you received text messages on your cellphone containing death threats. You tried to settle there. However, after a job interview, a company higher-up from Mexico City mentioned you could not be hired due to problems you had had with influential individuals. You again feared even more for your life and your family\u2019s lives and decided to leave the country.\n[9] You believe that you have neither a viable internal flight alternative (IFA) nor access to state protection.\nDETERMINATION\n[10] I determine that, on a balance of probabilities, you would be personally subjected to a risk to your life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if you were to return to Mexico, for the reasons that follow.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[11] I find that your identities have been established by means of your testimony and the copies of your passports filed on the record.[1]\nCredibility\n[12] I find that you are credible witnesses; therefore, I believe your main allegations in support of your refugee protection claims.\n[13] Your testimony was sincere and did not contain any relevant inconsistencies. There were no relevant contradictions between your testimony and the other evidence before me that were not satisfactorily explained.\n[14] You indicate in the first version of your written account that the senior leadership, whom you fear, sent you polite messages but you specified during the hearing that they were veiled threats. You explain the content of the messages, with details, in an amended written account filed after you changed lawyers. Given the circumstances in your file, I find that the details you brought forward during the hearing and in the amendment to your written account explain this difference between your testimony during the first hearing and your first written account.\n[15] You also failed to discuss the threatening text messages you received on your cellphone after you arrived in Quintana Roo. You first explained that you had focused on the elements you were able to demonstrate and that there had been a lack of communication between you and your first lawyer. Given the very specific circumstances of your case, the reasons why you were forced to find a new lawyer and the fact that you provided numerous documents to support your allegations as a whole, I find that this omission is reasonably justified.\n[16] As for the documents you filed to support your claims, you filed a note indicating that you had indeed been hired by the [XXX] department. You also filed examples of official letters that you had sent to your supervisor to report the irregularities and acts of corruption that you kept track of at work.[2]\n[17] You also submitted photographs[3] of the shop you ran, as you stated, while you also worked at the [XXX] department. You also provided photographs of the shop\u2019s closing[4] and the threats you stated you received, written across it. Finally, you also filed photographs of the truck[5] in which the female claimant was threatened.\n[18] The panel has no specific reason to doubt the credibility of these documents and finds that they are probative in supporting your allegations of fear.\n[19] In order to establish that you are a \u201cperson in need of protection,\u201d you must demonstrate that there is a serious possibility that you would be subjected, on a balance of probabilities, to a risk to your life, to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or to a danger of torture if you were returned to Mexico.\n[20] I find that the evidence submitted in support of your allegation establishes that there are, on a balance of probabilities, serious reasons to believe that you would be subjected to persecution or the other alleged harm.\n[21] You received many threats from influential [XXX] department personnel whom you had tried to report. Meanwhile, you were getting visits from criminal group members who were extorting money from you. During the hearing, you indicated that the people visiting your shop addressed you by the title you had at the [XXX] department. You also alleged that these individuals were paid by the influential personnel of the department and you consider that this demonstrates that the area\u2019s criminal groups are connected to the department.\n[22] Not only did those people threaten you and your family, but they also followed your wife while she was driving your truck, which suggests the threats were becoming increasingly serious.\n[23] Furthermore, the objective evidence in the National Documentation Package (NDP) on Mexico confirms that corrupt federal officials and their ties to various criminal groups are a significant and ongoing reality in Mexico.[6]\n[24] The city of Tabasco, where you lived, is in the lowest tier of safe cities, which means it is one of the cities in Mexico with one of the highest crime rates and impunity rates for both crime and human rights abuses.[7]\n[25] I find that it would be objectively unreasonable for you to seek state protection considering the particular facts of your refugee protection claim. In addition to the previously cited documentary evidence confirming the high impunity rate, the individuals who threatened you and whom you fear hold important public administration positions and they therefore have significant influence and resources that enable them to be informed of your undertakings if you were to try to file a complaint against them.\nInternal flight alternative\n[26] I also assessed whether you have an IFA available to you. I find that there is nowhere in the country where you would not face, on a balance of probabilities, a risk to your lives or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\n[27] When you sought refuge in Quintana Roo with your family, you continued to receive threatening messages on your cellphone. The content of these messages indicated that the individuals who were looking for you were aware that you had left the area for the location where you were hiding. After that, you tried to find a job in that region and you were told that you must have been having problems with important individuals, because the head office of the company you were applying to had decided not to hire you. This situation demonstrates that your name had been given to an organization, with significant reach beyond the city of Tabasco and influence in Mexico City. That was when you learned that you would not be safe anywhere in Mexico. The panel agrees.\nCONCLUSION\n[28] For the above-mentioned reasons and after analyzing all of the evidence, I determine that you are \u201cpersons in need of protection\u201d within the meaning of paragraph 97(1)(a) or 97(1)(b) of the IRPA.\n[29] I therefore allow your refugee protection claims.\n[1] Document 1 \u2014 Information package provided by the Canada Border Services Agency and\/or Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada: passports.\n[2] Document 6 \u2014 Exhibits P-6 to P-9.\n[3] Document 6 \u2014 Exhibit P-11.\n[4] Document 6 \u2014 Exhibit P-12.\n[5] Document 6 \u2014 Exhibit P-14.\n[6] Document 3 \u2014 National Documentation Package (NDP), Mexico, August 30, 2019, Tab 2.1: Mexico.

In the event that written reasons are issued, a written form of these reasons may be edited for spelling, syntax and grammar and references to the applicable case law and documentary evidence may also be included.\n[3] The claimant claims to be a citizen of Burkina Faso and is claiming refugee protection pursuant to Sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nDetermination\n[4] The Panel finds that the claimant is a Convention refugee, as the claimant does have a well-founded fear of persecution on a Convention ground in Burkina Faso.\n[5] Its reasons are as follows.\nAllegations\n[6] The claimant\u2019s complete allegations are set out in the Basis of Claim form and need not be repeated here in detail.\n[7] To summarize briefly, the claimant is a member of the Burkinabe ethnic group, he is Muslim. He was violently threatened on [XXX] 2019, as he was headed to the Mosque for early morning prayers. Four armed persons on motorcycles stopped him and asked him where he was headed. These armed persons were jihadists and terrorists. The men asked the claimant if he was the one going to teach children at the Nusoubou (ph) school. He could not see their faces but he recognized their clothes and voices from the Mosque. The men took him on their motorcycle. He promised not to return to the school in question. They warned him against any non-Quranic teachings and that he not talk about them. They released him. After that, he started trying to leave Burkina Faso. He says that he\u2019s able to recognize them and that they know him and his family. He adds that jihadists can be found throughout Burkina Faso and have accomplices everywhere. He left Burkina Faso on [XXX] 2019. He paid a large amount of money in order to leave the country. His trip was facilitated by three persons. His parents, siblings and two of his children remain in Burkina Faso. His spouse is a citizen of the Ivory Coast, where she resides with their other child. The claimant also alleges fear of risk to his life, risk of torture or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment at the hands of the same agent of harm. The claimant alleges that neither state protection or safe and reasonable internal flight alternatives are available in his country of nationality.\nANALYSIS\n[8] The main issue is identity. The issue arises as the claimant was undocumented upon arrival in Canada.\nIdentity\n[9] The claimant\u2019s national identity has been established by the testimony and supporting documentation filed and entered in these proceedings. The current and previous two Burkina Faso passports are on file, along with other documents provided by the claimant.\n[10] The Panel is satisfied of the claimant\u2019s identity as a citizen of Burkina Faso. The claimant worked repeatedly over many years in Lebanon. He has provided a translation of his Lebanese visa, which does not give rise to concerns over an eventual permanent status in Lebanon. This leaves the question of any citizenship or other such status in Ivory Coast, stemming from the claimant\u2019s current marriage to an Ivorian citizen, as described in his Basis of Claim form and testimony. Ivorian citizenship law stipulates that subject to certain articles of the law, a foreign man marrying an Ivorian woman becomes Ivorian at the time of the marriage and this is in Item 3.1 of the National Documentation Package on Ivory Coast. The law indicates that in cases own citizenship la-, law allows him to maintain that citizenship, the groom in this situation can refuse to become Ivorian. He must do so before the marriage. The claimant testified that he does not have a status in Ivory Coast and never did. The claimant testified that he married his wife in a non-recognized religious ceremony, which took place in Lebanon.\n[11] The Panel is satisfied that the claimant is not a citizen of Ivory Coast and that he does not have an automatic right to Ivorian citizenship.\n[12] The Panel finds that he is a citizen of Burkina Faso only.\nNexus\n[13] For the claimant to be a Convention refugee, the fear of persecution must be by reason of one of the five grounds enumerated in the Convention refugee definition. In other words, the claimant must have a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion.\n[14] The Panel finds that the harm feared by the claimant is by reason of one of the five grounds enumerated in the Convention refugee definition, namely imputed political opinion against jihadists. This is rooted in the claimant\u2019s interpretation of Islam, which is not tolerated by the jihadists.\nCredibility and Subjective Fear\n[15] When credibility is assessed, there are two principles that are followed.\n[16] Firstly, when a claimant swears to the truthfulness of certain facts, there is a presumption that what he is saying is true unless there is reason to doubt it.\n[17] Secondly, when assessing credibility, the Panel is entitled to rely on rationality and common sense. The determination as to whether a claimant\u2019s evidence is credible is made on a balance of probabilities. The claimant\u2019s telling of the problems he encountered with jihadists, in the context of his work at a primary school, are very consistent when one compares the Basis of Claim form and Basis of Claim form amendment, on the one hand and on the other hand, the numerous interviews with CBSA conducted while the claimant was in immigration detention on identity grounds.\n[18] The Panel draws a positive inference from this finding that the claimant is credible when describing the problems he encountered with jihadists in Burkina Faso.\n[19] The Panel gives little weight to the cousin\u2019s statement to CBSA, that the claimant had no problems in Burkina Faso. This is, is the Panel has not had the opportunity to interview the cousin, who has not clarified the basis for his statements. The Panel note that the claimant says his cousin does not know him well and the claimant also testified that his cousin is a drunkard.\n[20] The Panel has no reason to doubt the claimant\u2019s assertions.\n[21] An examination of the claimant\u2019s 2014 passport shows that he exited Ivory Coast in [XXX] 2019, entering Burkina Faso in [XXX] \u201919. His explanation for his decision to enter Burkina Faso in 2019, when the country was in turmoil, is reasonable in the circumstances.\nSubjective Fear\n[22] The claimant provided copies of three Burkina Faso passports issued respectively in 2005, 2009 and 2014, they are found at Exhibit 6. The claimant has travelled to Lebanon to work as a driver on numerous occasions over the years since 2010 and up to 2019. His passport also shows a Lebanese exit stamp dated [XXX]of[XXX] 2019.\n[23] As the Panel accepts that the claimant did not have permanent residence status in Lebanon or another status allowing him to live and work there, the Panel does not draw a negative inference from the claimant\u2019s failure to return to Lebanon in 2019, after the problems he encountered with jihadists in Burkina Faso. The claimant states in his Basis of Claim form that he travelled through Thailand in China on his way to Canada. He did not claim asylum in either, as he describes them as countries for tourists. Though this is not a strong explanation for a failure to claim elsewhere, his failure to claim asylum in these two countries is of no real consequence, given his credibility in regards to his main allegations.\nSimilarly Situated Persons and Objective Basis\n[24] The U.S. Department of State report on Burkina Faso notes that armed groups connected to violent extremist organizations perpetrated more than three hundred attacks in 2019, resulting in hundreds of civilian deaths and many displaced people. The state of affairs is documented in other country conditions documents. The Panel accepts the violent extremist groups reek insecurity in Burkina Faso, which is a small landlocked country.\n[25] The Panel accepts that the claimant runs a serious possibility of targeting by jihadist, as a result of the state of affairs.\nState Protection\n[26] Claimants must show on a balance of probabilities that adequate state protection is not available. The issue before the Panel was whether it was objectively unreasonable for the claimants to have sought state protection. While states are presumed to be capable of protecting their nationals, it was opened to the claimants, according to the law, to rebut the presumption of protection with clear and convincing evidence.\n[27] The Panel finds on the evidence that the claimants have rebutted that presumption.\n[28] The Panel\u2019s reasons are as follows.\n[29] The presumption of state protection is rebutted by the failure of Burkina Faso authorities to provide effective adequate protection at an operational level. This failure is established by the hundreds of extremist attacks resulting in hundreds of civilian deaths in 2019, Human Rights Watch in a 2020 document and this is at page 111 of counsel\u2019s disclosure at Exhibit 6, describes the state of affairs as [XXX] amounting to [XXX] a non-international armed conflict under the laws of war.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[30] The analysis of internal flight alternative fails on the first prong. The 2018 Crime and Safety report at, mentioned at Item 2.1, indicates that Mali based extremist groups are active in the Sahel region of the country especially near the Malian and Niger borders. Mali based terrorist groups have claimed or been implicated in attacks in Ouagadougou in 2017 and 2016. The attacks, which were initially concentrated in the Northern Sahel region, have steadily spread to several other regions. Even Ouagadougou is described as facing a severe threat of terrorism and this is in counsel\u2019s Exhibit 6, page 106.\n[31] I accept that the country is locked or the Panel accepts that the country is locked in a downward spiral, as a result of this violent extremist activity. The porous borders which allow the penetration of various extremist groups from surrounding countries, makes the entire country dangerous for someone such as the claimant, who faces a serious possibility of persecution throughout Burkina Faso.\nCONCLUSION\n[32] Having considered all of the evidence, the Panel determines that there is a serious possibility that the claimant would be persecuted in Burkina Faso for one of the five grounds enumerated in the refugee Convention.\n[33] The claimant has established his identity and is credible in his main allegations. Having come to this conclusion, the Panel has not conducted further assessment under Section 97(1).\n[34] The Panel concludes that the claimant is a Convention refugee and the Panel therefore accepts his claim.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n",

        "unofficial_text":"2020 RLLR 117\n\nCitation: 2020 RLLR 117\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: November 27, 2020\nPanel: Megan Kammerer\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): N\/A\nCountry: Pakistan\nRPD Number: VB9-05568\nAssociated RPD Number(s):\nATIP Number: A-2021-00945\nATIP Pages: 000213-000227\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] This is the decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) in the claim of [XXX] as a citizen of Pakistan who is claiming refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (the \u201cAct\u201c).[1]\n[2] In hearing and assessing this claim, I have considered and applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline on Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution[2], which offers guidance in recognizing women as members of a particular social group and also with respect to other gender specific issues present in this claim.\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] The claimant is a former permanent resident of Canada who alleges that she has been emotionally and physically abused by her ex-husband in Pakistan. She states that this abuse began in 2014, was related to the claimant\u2019s failure to sponsor her ex-husband to come to Canada, and continued until the claimant left Pakistan in 2016.\nDETERMINATION\n[4] I find that the principal claimant has a well-founded fear of persecution on the basis of her gender and is therefore a Convention refugee under section 96 of the Act.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[5] I find that the claimant\u2019s identity as a national of Pakistan has been established through her testimony and the supporting documentation filed, including her passport.[3]\nCredibility\n[6] When a claimant swears to the truth of their allegations, this creates a presumption that those allegations are true, unless there is a reason to doubt their truthfulness. In this case, there were some significant concerns with credibility. During testimony, the claimant made some inconsistent statements with respect to the abuse that occurred in Pakistan and was unable to adequately explain her delay in submitting her refugee claim. However, I do not find that these problems are significant enough to overcome the presumption of truthfulness.\nStatements regarding the abuse\n[7] The claimant testified that she decided to leave her abusive ex-husband in 2016 and fled from Pakistan to Sri Lanka so that she could obtain travel documents from the Canadian High Commission for herself and her children. During an interview at the High Commission in Sri Lanka on [XXX] 2016, the claimant was asked about whether her ex-husband had hurt her \u201cin any way\u201d and whether he had abused her physically or verbally. The claimant replied that her ex-husband had hurt her verbally but not physically. When asked whether she was still in a relationship with him, the claimant replied that her ex-husband \u201cis just not listening to me right now that we would be better off in Canada. His family does not like the way we got married. It is a love marriage.\u201d When asked whether the claimant would continue to attempt to sponsor her husband, the claimant replied \u201cYes, he says he does not want to go now but he will agree with me and I will sponsor him.\u201d[4]\n[8] During her hearing before me, the claimant testified that her ex-husband had abused her physically on many occasions between [XXX] 2014 and [XXX] 2015 as well as between [XXX] 2015 and [XXX] 2016. She testified that when she left Pakistan in [XXX] 2016 her intention was to leave and divorce her husband.\n[9] When asked about the discrepancy between her testimony and the statements she made to representatives at the Canadian High Commission in Sri Lanka, the claimant explained that she did not understand the question and so that is why she said that her husband only abused her verbally. She explained that when she was at the High Commission she was so upset that she had \u201cno thoughts of my own\u201d and \u201cno idea what I am doing\u201d and had misspoke. She also indicated at that point that she still hoped her ex-husband might change and they might reconcile.\n[10] I accept the claimant\u2019 s explanation with respect to these inconsistencies. I note that trauma can have an impact on memory and understand that a victim fleeing abuse might not have yet full reconciled or decided whether or how to end her relationship. I also note that these statements were made at a time when the claimant was in turmoil, shortly after fleeing from Pakistan and learning that her permanent residency status in Canada might no longer be valid.\n[11] I also note that there are numerous statements in the GCMS notes disclosed by the Minister which are consistent with the claimant\u2019s version of events recounted during testimony and that these statements pre-date her refugee claim, thus strengthening her credibility. For example, during that same interview which took place at the High Commission on [XXX] 2016, the claimant told officials that her husband and his family forced her to stay in Pakistan and that she had to leave the country without them knowing, that her husband first tried to prohibit her from leaving Pakistan in 2014, and that she was only able to obtain his permission to leave Pakistan to travel to Canada for one month in 2015 to go work on his permanent residency application. The official conducting the interview and drafting the note characterized this as \u201cforcible confinement.\u201d[5]\n[12] Likewise, in an interview conducted on [XXX] 2016, the claimant again told officials that \u201cher husband and his family forced her to stay in Pakistan\u201d which caused her to lose her PR status.[6] Similarly, on [XXX] 2016 the GCMS notes read: \u201cWife seeking to return to Canada in order to divorce and gain full custody of the children. Subject also the intention of pulling her sponsorship. Wife states that she fears the subject as he may try to get to Canada to kidnap the children.\u201d[7]\n[13] These statements are consistent with the allegations of abuse that the claimant has made against her ex-husband and his family, which includes the allegation that her ex-husband and his family would not let her leave the family home.\n[14] Given the claimant\u2019s explanation, as well as the additional statements about the abuse in the GCMS notes that pre-date the claimant\u2019s refugee claim, I do not find that the inconsistent statements made about the nature of the abuse are sufficient to undermine the presumption of truthfulness.\nDelay in submitting a refugee claim\n[15] The claimant arrived in Canada on [XXX] 2016 and was provided with a hearing date to appeal the decision that she had not met the residency requirements necessary to retain her permanent residency status. Her hearing before the Immigration Appeal Division took place on November 23, 2017, the claimant did not appear, and her appeal was thus held to be abandoned by way of decision dated December 11, 2017.[8] Despite this, the claimant did not submit a refugee application until [XXX] 2019.\n[16] The claimant testified that she was confused about the time of the hearing before the Immigration Appeal Division, as she had recently moved from Toronto to Calgary, and did not realize the hearing had been set for Eastern Standard Time rather than Mountain Standard Time. She explained that she missed the hearing and that when she received the decision notifying her that the appeal had been abandoned she retained counsel to help her explain why she had missed the hearing and appeal the abandonment decision. She further explained that she last spoke with her lawyer approximately one week ago and that he continues to be in contact with the Immigration and Refugee Board and that he has not yet received a response regarding her missed hearing. She states that she did not submit a refugee claim earlier because she was waiting to receive a response about the missed hearing from the IAD.\n[17] I asked the claimant if she had any corroborating documents from her lawyer regarding the appeal he is allegedly conducting on her behalf. She explained that she had asked her lawyer for a written statement but that he did not provide one. When asked why the claimant did proceed to file the refugee claim given that her lawyer continued to make inquiries with respect to her claim before the IAD, she explained that she needed legal status in order to remain in Canada and to obtain employment.\n[18] I do not accept the claimant\u2019s explanation regarding her delay in submitting a claim for refugee status. I do not find it believable that her lawyer continues to make inquiries with respect to her abandoned IAD claim nearly three years after that claim was held to be abandoned and that she does not possess any documentation which corroborates this.\n[19] The claimant has not provided a reasonable explanation for why she did not submit a refugee claim until [XXX] 2019. However, I am not prepared to find that this delay undermines her credibility with respect to risk and subjective fear to such an extent that her claim must fail. There could be many reasons why a woman in the claimant\u2019s position would not submit a refugee claim promptly.\nConclusion on Credibility\n[20] The claimant was not a compelling witness. She had to be prompted on several occasions to provide detail and at times she was notable to provide a reliable and cohesive account of her actions. Moreover, there were some inconsistencies between the way in which she described the abuse to different officials. However, as is set out in more detail below, her narrative about the abuse that she endured at the hands of her ex-husband and his family is believable and is supported in many different ways by the objective country evidence about Pakistan. Accordingly, I find that the claimant is a credible witness with respect to the allegations of abuse and her assessment of the risks that she would face if she were to return to Pakistan.\nNexus\n[21] The claimant alleges that she has been abused by her spouse. I find that the persecution the claimant fears has a nexus to the Convention ground of particular social group, namely female victims of domestic violence.\nPotential Exclusion\n[22] The claimant gave birth to her daughter in Canada, but did not have her ex-husband\u2019s permission to travel to Canada with their two sons, who are Canadian citizens. However, as is explained in the reasons that follow, the claimant has a defence pursuant to s. 285 of the Criminal Code[9], given that she has traveled to Canada to protect herself and her children from danger of imminent harm.\n[23] I also note that the claimant obtained a court order from a Canadian court on [XXX] 2018 providing her with sole custody of her three children. The claimant\u2019s ex-husband was served and there is no indication that he responded. The claimant has provided a copy of this court order to me.[10]\n[24] I thus do not find that the claimant could be excluded under Article 1(F)(b) of the Act.\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution and Risk of Harm\n[25] The claimant is a former permanent resident of Canada who alleges that she fears her ex- husband will kill her if she returns to Pakistan.\n[26] The claimant received permanent residency status in Canada in [XXX] 2007, having been sponsored by her brother who lives in Canada. Between 2007 and 2016, she spent time living in both Canada and Pakistan.\n[27] The claimant testified that she met her ex-husband in 2007 in Pakistan and that they got married in Pakistan on [XXX] 2010. The claimant submitted an application to sponsor her ex-husband to become a permanent resident of Canada in [XXX] 2011. The sponsorship application was denied and the claimant initiated an appeal.\n[28] The claimant lived in Canada for various periods of time between her wedding and [XXX] 2014. She testified that when she returned to Pakistan on [XXX] 2014 her ex-husband had changed and he had suddenly become violent. She attributes this change to the fact that she had been unsuccessful at sponsoring him and that the application and subsequent appeal were taking a long time to process.\n[29] The claimant testified that she stayed in Pakistan with her ex-husband between [XXX] 2014 and [XXX] 2015. During this time, she lived with her ex-husband and his family. She testified that during this time he was emotionally and physically violent towards her on many occasions.\n[30] The claimant explained that she lived with her ex-husband and his parents. The claimant testified that his parents did not intervene to assist her. In fact, she says they were also frequently abusive. As explained in more detail below, this allegation is consistent with the objective evidence about domestic violence in Pakistan.\n[31] The claimant testified that during this period her husband refused to allow her to leave the family home. She testified that she attempted to contact the Canadian consulate in Islamabad and they told her they could not intervene because it was a family matter. In order to try to get help, she contacted a friend who called the police. The police visited the family home in approximately [XXX] 2014. When they arrived, the claimant\u2019s ex-husband did not give the claimant permission to speak with them. He told the police that they had had a small misunderstanding at home and there was no need for their assistance. The claimant testified that the police did not try further to assist her and that after they left her ex-husband abused her physically. She says that after this incident she felt more scared to call the police. Again, the claimant\u2019s description of this incident is consistent with the objective evidence on state protection in Pakistan, described more fully below.\n[32] The claimant testified that her ex-husband also abused their children.\n[33] The claimant returned to Canada in [XXX] 2015. She explained that she was able to negotiate with her ex-husband to allow her to leave the country because she told him she needed to make inquiries about the appeal of his permanent residence application. The claimant\u2019s ex\u00ad husband allowed her to travel to Canada for one month but told her she would not be allowed to bring their children with her to Canada.\n[34] The claimant stayed in Canada between [XXX] 2015 and [XXX] 2015. The claimant explained that she did not consider staying in Canada and leaving her husband during this period because her children were still in Pakistan.\n[35] The claimant testified that when she returned to Pakistan in [XXX] 2015 things were fine for about two days. After that, the physical and verbal abuse started again. The claimant estimates that the abuse occurred every other day. The claimant says that she contacted the Canadian consulate and once again they told her to contact the police and the courts in Pakistan to help her resolve this issue.\n[36] At one point the claimant left her husband to go stay with one of her friends. The claimant\u2019s friend came and picked her up when her husband was out and the claimant was home alone. The claimant stayed with her friend for approximately 15-20 days, but says that ultimately her husband found her. She believes that he was able to trace her location using her cell phone because he has a friend who works for a mobile company.\n[37] The claimant returned home with her ex-husband and she testified that for a month or two the relationship was fine but then ultimately the abuse escalated once again. This is consistent with the dynamics of abuse.\n[38] Rather than ask the claimant to specifically describe the abuse that she endured at the hands of her ex-husband and his family, as such questions can often be retraumatizing and are unnecessary, I asked her to describe the impact that the abuse had on her. She explained that it caused her to feel stressed out, was mentally exhausting, and that all that she could think about was how she could escape the situation.\n[39] The claimant learnt she was pregnant again in 2016 and that the baby was a girl. She says that her ex-husband and his family began pressuring her to have an abortion because they wanted another boy. She says that she decided at that point she needed to leave her ex-husband.\n[40] The claimant left Pakistan with her children on [XXX] 2016. She traveled to Sri Lanka so that she could apply for Canadian passports for her children, who had been born in Canada, as well as obtain a valid permanent residency card as hers had expired in [XXX] 2016. She arrived in Canada on [XXX] 2016 and submitted a refugee claim on [XXX] 2019.\n[41] The claimant testified that she is worried that her ex-husband will kill her if she returns to Pakistan. She explained that in her culture \u201cmen do not leave things like this\u201d because it \u201crelates to honour.\u201d\n[42] The claimant\u2019s allegations are supported by the objective evidence. In Pakistan, women face direct, cultural, and structural violence through a deeply entrenched system of patriarchy in all aspects of public and private life.[11] The Women, Peace and Security Index 2019\/20 places Pakistan at 164 out of 167 countries regarding women\u2019s peace and security in the world. Other sources similarly indicate that Pakistan has been ranked the sixth most dangerous country in the world for women and that rates of violence against women, including domestic violence, are increasing in the country.[12]\n[43] The U.S. Department of State Report addresses domestic violence as one of the significant human rights issues in Pakistan. The report says that no specific law prohibits domestic violence and that domestic violence is widespread. Forms of physical violence including beating, physical disfigurement, shaving of women\u2019s eyebrows and hair, and homicide. Family related disputes can result in death or disfigurement by burning or acid. Women who try to report abuse face serious challenges. Police and judges are sometimes reluctant to take action in domestic violence cases, viewing them as family problems. Authorities routinely return abused women to their abusive family members.[13]\n[44] Studies of domestic violence in Pakistan attribute it to deep-rooted patriarchal norms around femininity and masculinity. Such studies have found that if a wife makes a mistake, disobeys her husband, or is wrong, then the husband is viewed as having the justification to beat her.[14] The evidence also overwhelmingly indicates that in Pakistan women\u2019s freedom of movement is restricted. In most households, women are expected to stay at home when they reach puberty and not allowed to have a job, go outside, or meet anyone. This is exacerbated in situations of domestic violence.[15]\n[45] Studies have found that while physical violence is often the most visible form of violence, subtle forms of psychological violence are probably more common. These include verbally abusive language, criticism, and threats, including threatening to \u201cburn them\u201d or \u201cthrow acid\u201d on them.[16] In a study conducted in 2008, researchers found that 100% of women had reported having experienced psychological violence.[17]\n[46] The objective evidence indicates that women often not only face violence from their male partners, but also from their in-laws at home, given the tradition of extended families living together in Pakistan. Domestic violence in Pakistan encompasses broader family violence and includes violence perpetrated by members of the marital family, which has been shown to be extremely common. In fact, co-residence with in-laws has been found to be a driving factor for violence.[18]\n[47] Although the claimant has been living in Canada since 2016, and has not been in contact with her ex-husband during that time, she testified that she is still at risk and that he will punish her because she decided to leave him. She explained that this relates to honour and would be treated as a serious breach. I accept that the claimant\u2019s ex-husband and his family adhere to deeply patriarchal values about the role of women and will punish women who defy this norm. In leaving her husband and taking their children to Canada, the claimant has defied her ex-husband\u2019s assumed authority.\n[48] I find that the claimant faces a significant forward-looking risk of serious harm from her ex-husband should she return to Pakistan. I make this finding based on all the evidence before me, including the claimant\u2019s credible testimony about the ways in which her ex-husband physically and psychologically abused her, as well as objective evidence which indicates that domestic violence is tied to deeply rooted patriarchal norms and that women who are perceived to transgress or challenge those norms are particularly at risk.\nState Protection\n[49] In all refugee claims, the state is presumed to be capable of protecting their citizens unless there is clear and convincing evidence to the contrary. In this case, the claimant testified that she asked a friend to call the police on her behalf, and that while the police visited her home she did not receive any meaningful assistance. Her ex-husband refused to allow her to speak to the police and told them that they had had a minor family related dispute. The police did not pursue the matter further.\n[50] The claimant\u2019s experiences with state authorities in seeking protection from domestic violence are supported by the objective documentary evidence in the National Documentation Package. The country condition documents indicate that domestic violence crimes are mostly unreported in Pakistan as it is still seen as a private matter and a matter of shame or dishonour. Pakistan has no comprehensive federal law to tackle violence against women. Although some states have passed legislation on domestic violence, these laws are not operationally effective protection mechanisms for victims.\n[51] Sources indicate that the challenges around implementing legislation on domestic violence in Pakistan are \u201cenormous\u201d and that police and judges are reluctant to take action in domestic violence cases as they view these as \u201cfamily problems.\u201d Sources also indicate that members of the police service are often verbally abusive when reports of domestic violence are made, and that the police are more likely to question the character of the woman than to help her. Rather than taking action to eradicate violence against women, police appear to enforce social norms to ensure that women do not oppose patriarchal rules. Women similarly have problems accessing the judicial system to obtain protection.[19]\n[52] In view of this evidence, I find that state protection for female victims of domestic violence in Pakistan is inadequate. While the authorities have made efforts to address domestic violence through legislation, these efforts have not been effective on the operational level. In this case, the claimant did make an attempt to obtain protection from the police, who did not even take the step of speaking directly with the claimant. The objective country information evidence demonstrates, however, that state protection is rarely available from authorities in Pakistan. I therefore find that the presumption of state protection has been rebutted in the case of the claimant.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[53] The final issue is whether the claimant has a viable internal flight alternative (IFA) in Pakistan. In order to determine whether an IFA exists, I must assess whether there is any location in Pakistan in which the claimant would not face a serious possibility of persecution and whether it would be reasonable to expect her to move there.[20]\n[54] At the outset of the hearing, I proposed Karachi and Islamabad as potential IFA locations for the claimant. The claimant testified that most of her family lives in Canada rather than Pakistan, and that she has no family at all living in Karachi or Islamabad. The claimant has remarried but her current husband lives in Canada and there is no indication that he would return to Pakistan with her. The claimant explained that it would not be easy as a single woman to live alone in one of those cities and that due to lack of support she would not be able to survive.\n[55] I accept the claimant\u2019s testimony on this point and find that it would be objectively unreasonable, in the context of Pakistan, to require the claimant to relocate and live independently as a single woman. The OECD Report on Social Institutions and Gender Index describes how difficult it is for a woman to live alone in Pakistan. Both laws and customs limit the extent to which women can access property and financial resources. Women are discouraged from working outside the home and are often unable to access formal bank accounts because doing so requires two male guarantors. Only 36% of women own phones, compared with 80% of Pakistani men, and there are reports that women have been killed simply for owning phones, due to the social stigma around interaction with unrelated males.[21]\n[56] The claimant would be separated, single, and without family support in an IFA location. Given the objective evidence, the claimant would be at risk and would struggle to be able to support herself and open a bank account. In such circumstances, I do not find that relocation to an IFA location is a reasonable option.\nCONCLUSION\n[57] For these reasons, I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee and I accept her claim.\n[1] Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n[2] Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (IRB) Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 4: Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution, November 13, 1996\n[3] Exhibit 1.\n[4] Exhibit 5, p. 10.\n[5] Exhibit 5, p. 10.\n[6] Exhibit 5, p. 8.\n[7] Exhibit 5, p. 5.\n[8] Exhibit 5, pp. 19-21.\n[9] R.S.C., 1985, c.

You heard of Hizmet colleagues having been detained by Turkish government authorities and you have been informed that police have attended your former home numerous times in search of you personally commencing in 2017.\n[4] In 2014, you moved to Cyprus on a student permit and you resided there until 2018. At that point, you travelled to the United States and you met with the leader of the Hizmet movement Mr. Fethullah Gulen himself.\n[5] You fear that if you return to Turkey you will be persecuted on account of your Hizmet affiliation.\n[6] My determination, sir, is that you are a Convention refugee pursuant to s. 96 of the IRPA and your claim is, therefore, accepted.\n[7] The reasons for that determination follow now:\n[8] Your identity and your status as a national of Turkey have been established by the copy of your Turkish passport on file and I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that you are a citizen of Turkey and no other country.\n[9] Though you did spend some time in Cyprus, I\u2019m satisfied on a balance of probabilities that you were there on temporary permits only with no citizen like status. First, as a student and then as a teacher. This is sufficiently corroborated in my view by the copy of your student permit which is found at Exhibit number 5.\n[10] Your fear of persecution in Turkey is by reason of affiliation with the Gulen or Hizmet movement which started decades ago as a religious movement in Turkey. Today, it\u2019s a little bit wider than that it bridges gaps between religion, politics and charitable work. The movement operates a network of schools, businesses, media outlets, charities, private hospitals and health clinics and so on. And Turkish President Erdogan has closed schools and media outlets in Turkey associated with the movement and he has categized it as a terrorist organization.\n[11] Based on the nature of the Hizmet movement as it straddles these political and religious lines, I conclude that there is a nexus between your allegations of persecution and the Convention grounds of religion as well as political opinion. Accordingly, I will assess your claim for protection under s. 96 of the IRPA.\n[12] I\u2019ll touch briefly on your credibility now. In refugee determination cases there is a presumption that claimants and their allegations are truthful and I have identified no material inconsistencies or contradictions between your basis of claim and the other evidence before me, and your narrative does correspond to the objective evidence about conditions in Turkey for those belonging to or being associated with the Gulen movement.\n[13] You have also provided a copy of a summons corroborating the fact that police in Turkey have sought you out, and you have provided a photo of yourself with Mr. Gulen himself taken when you visited him in the United States where he resides in exile.\n[14] Ultimately, I have no reason to doubt the central element of your claim for protection, namely that you belong to the Hizmet Movement. Having accepted this, I also accept that you subjectively fear persecution in Turkey.\n[15] And I\u2019ll note that I take no negative inference from your failure to claim protection in the United States, as you\u2019ve indicated that was in part due to the present administrations animus to refugee claimants, and I find that to be a reasonable explanation. I turn now to the objective evidence regarding the treatment of Gulen followers in Turkey, and I\u2019ll rely largely on Item 4.6 of the most recent national documentation package for that country. This is an IRB research and information report dated January 6, 2020, so it\u2019s actually quite recent.\n[16] Now, as I\u2019ve already referenced the Gulen movement is active around the world it operates schools, businesses, media outlets and charities. And Gulen followers have been continually targeted by the Turkish government following the 2016 failed coup attempt. Though the government has labelled that movement as a terrorist organization effectively declaring war on it. Many businesses have since closed due to their links with the Gulen movement and those suspected of being Gulen followers have been directly targeted resulting in many many serious violations of human rights on a systemic basis.\n[17] I\u2019ll quote two prominent leaders in the Turkish government to give you an idea. Turkish President Erdogan is reported to have said in 2018 and I quote:\nWe\u2019re purging every Gulenist in the army in the police and in state institutions, and we will continue cleansing these organizations of them because we will eradicate this cancer from the body of this country and the state. They will not enjoy the right to life. Our fight against them will continue until the end. We won\u2019t leave them merely wounded.\n[18] The Turkish Economy Minister said something along the same lines in 2016 and I quote:\nWe will put those responsible for the coup, referring of course to the Gulen Movement members, into such holes for punishment that they won\u2019t even \u2014 that they won\u2019t even be able to see the sun of God as long as they breathe. They will not see the light of day. They will not hear a human voice. They will beg for death saying just kills us.\n[19] Authorities have taken these comments to heart and have vigorously acted on them. According to one report, a purge of Hizmet members within the state apparatus has resulted in the dismissal, detainment and arrest of tens of thousands. One source sites a 150,000 individuals dismissed, 500,000 investigated, 100,000 arrested, 6,000 academics discharged, 4,500 judges and prosecutors dismissed and 300 journalists arrested. Dismissals also include the cancellation of passports preventing people from leaving the country and escaping persecution.\n[20] The government has, through 2019, continued to detain and arrest even merely suspected Hizmet sympathizers. The Guardian newspaper reports that in February 2019 the government-issued arrest warrants for a further 1,100 people with suspected connections to the Gulenist movement.\n[21] Similarly, Reuters indicates that the ordering of the arrest of 1,100 people is one of the government\u2019s largest operations against alleged supporters of the Gulen Movement.\n[22] Al Jazeera has stated that more than 760 people were detained in operations all across Turkey. Although 122 of those were later freed under judicial supervision.\n[23] Another source indicates that evidence is not necessary to keep someone in prison for months or years when they are suspected Gulenists, and another says the parallel is compounded a compromised justice system in which judges do not release suspects for being \u2014 for fear of being labelled Gulenists themselves.\n[24] It\u2019s further reported that Hizmet detainees have faced different forms of torture and ill-treatment by the police and other government forces. Human Rights Watch indicates that cases of abductions which likely amount to enforced disappearances are \u2014 are, pardon me let me rephrase that. Human Rights Watch reports that there are cases of abductions which likely amount to enforced disappearances by state authorities. Abductions or kidnappings reportedly serve as part of the persecution launched by the Turkish president and his government primarily against participants of the Gulen movement.\n[25] Further, it is reported that the Turkish government targets people using guilt by association. The office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has observed such a pattern of application of punitive measures targeting not just primary \u201csuspects\u201d such as civil servants or human rights activists, but also people associated with them particularly family members including children, siblings, parents and other relatives as well as friends, neighbours, work associates or even social media contacts that they do not necessarily know. This, of course, violates principles of individual responsibility, fairness and legal certainty.\n[26] Based on the foregoing objective evidence and my finding that, sir, you are indeed a Hizmet or Gulen follower, I find that you have established with sufficient credible and reliable evidence that you face a serious possibility of persecution in Turkey.\n[27] I\u2019ve considered whether state protection or an internal flight alternative is available to you, however, as the state is the agent of persecution it would not be reasonable for you to seek state protection in Turkey nor would it be forthcoming if you were to do so. More likely you would be handing yourself over for persecution.\n[28] For similar reasons an internal flight alternative is not available. The persecution of Gulen followers occurs uniformly throughout Turkey and the government has declared that the movement is a terrorist organization. As Gulen followers, suspected followers and even family members of followers are targeted uniformly throughout the country there is nowhere you could go in the country where you would be free from a serious possibility of persecution.\n[29] Ultimately my conclusion, sir, is that you are a Convention refugee and I accept your claim under s. 96 of the IRPA.\n\u2014 DECISION CONCLUDED\n\n",

In short you state that you left Egypt because you fear persecution because of you religion, that being a Coptic Christian. You feel there is nowhere you could live safely in Egypt. In doing this decision, I reviewed the Chairperson\u2019s Guidelines for victims of gender-based persecution given that there is a gender component of religious persecution that you fear in Egypt. You provided a detailed narrative in your Basis of Claim. In short, you come from Christian parents and have been practicing as a Coptic Christian your whole life in Minya and then in Cairo.\n[3] Once you left primary school and moved into secondary education that was government run, you felt for the first time the religious discrimination as a religious minority. Through the period of 2007-2009, you witnessed and increase in anti-Christian violence perpetrated by Muslim extremists. This environment existed and would flare up at points so that sometimes you had to stay home from work at the [XXX] in Cairo because it was too dangerous for you to be out alone as a Christian woman.\n[4] You were having difficulties in your marriage as your husband was having relationships outside of the marriage so you decided that a period of separation would be best. You had planned to visit your sister in Canada and applied for a travel visa for you and your son. However, while you were at your father\u2019s [XXX] (sic), 2018, you were approached by a man named [XXX] (sic), who knew of your circumstances and said he was interested in marrying you ad converting you to Islam.\n[5] On the evening of [XXX] 2018, as you and your son were returning from a weekly church service meeting, you were stopped by this [XXX] and another person while you were parking your car. He tried to drag you out of your car and the other man attacked the windshield with a large stick. You tried to drive away to escape and you hit the other car. In the process of this incident you were assaulted with a sharp object.\n[6] You were able to get away and called your father who took pictures of the car for insurance and also went to the police to report the incident. When he arrived at the police station he found that the [XXX] was there with his followers claiming that you had hit them and that you were the criminal. The police offered a solution of reconciliation in order to give some \u2060\u2013 and your father accepted this in order to give him some time to try to protect you.\n[7] When he came back home he decided that you should go to another house belonging to the church that was not known to the [XXX] and his followers. Subsequently you were threatened over the phone with the final offer of agreeing to marry the [XXX] and convert to Islam with your son or you would both be slain in the street. You fear there is nowhere safe for you or your son to live as a single Christian woman anywhere in Egypt.\n[8] I find that you are Convention refugees according to Section 96 of the Act for the following reasons.\n[9] With respect to the issue of your personal identities as nationals of Egypt, it\u2019s been established by your Egyptian it\u2019s been established by your Egyptian passports and Canadian visas, copies which (sic) were submitted to the Board. You testified in a straightforward and consistent manner today and I find that you were a credible witness. You did not embellish your claim and there were no material inconsistencies or contradictions within your evidence and there \u2060\u2013 that were not reasonably explained or that undermined your credibility in respect to the central allegations.\n[10] You testified about the ongoing discrimination that you and other Christians face everyday living in Egypt and how this discrimination has intensified over the years and become persecutory especially since the revolution in 2011 where more Islamic extremists act with greater impunity.\n[11] You stated that as a Christian woman you were a much easier target and further, that Islamic fundamentalist like the [XXX] look to target Christian especially since conversions to Islam was seen as a victory or triumph. You also provided significant corroborative documents with respect to your religion and the persecution you suffered from the [XXX]. You\u2019ve provided photos of the damage clone to your car, a medical report outlining the injuries you suffered from that attack, a statement from your ex\u00ad-mother-in-law regarding the attack you suffered and threats form the [XXX] and he\u2019s well known to be a dangerous and extremist Islamic individual in Minya.\n[12] As well, she submitted some information around the suspicious circumstances of her son\u2019s death and you have attacked the death certificate, all at Exhibit 5. Also you have attacked your baptism certificates indicating your Christian faith and this can also be found at Exhibit 5. So based on the totality of evidence before me, I find that you\u2019ve established a nexus to a Convention ground namely religion. Further, based on the totality of the objective evidence, which I\u2019ll highlight in a moment, I find that you have established that you would face a serious possibility of persecution on the basis of religion in Egypt as a Coptic Christian.\n[13] I find that the objective evidence provides a basis for your well-founded fear of persecution in Egypt on the basis of your religious beliefs and practice as a Coptic Christian and accordingly I find you\u2019ve established your claim. The NDP, or National Documentation Package, establishes that Egypt is presently an unsafe place to openly express a Christian identity.\n[14] According to Freedom house Report in the National Documentation Package, Egypt is a country where religious minorities and atheists face religious persecution and violence with Coptic\u2019s in particular suffering numerous cases of forced displacement, physical assaults, bomb and arson attacks, and blocking of church construction in recent years.\n[15] According to the US Department of State in 2019, Coptic Christians suffered sectarian violence. There were incidents of mob violence and vigilantism. World Watch Monitor, a website that reports the story of Christians around the world under pressure for their faith reports that on June 17th, 2016, more than 5,000 people mobbed homes of cops in their settlement near Alexandria and looted ten homes after reports that a Coptic man was turning his home into a church. According to one newspaper source, since the 19702 Islamists and Egypt have used attacks on Christians as a tactic in their struggle against the state, further stating that in each period of violence with the state, Coptic\u2019s serve as a target to Islamists who then home to revoke a disproportionate state repression and rally the large Muslim population to their cause.\n[16] It is reported that terrorists groups target churches in order to break whatever national unity may exist between the Muslims and Coptic\u2019s of Egypt. According to material collated in 2018 by the Board\u2019s own research unit, President Al Sese (ph) is keen on improving the situation for Coptic Christians and the country recently saw its appointment of its first female Coptic governor.\n[17] However, the Board\u2019s report also notes that numerous churches have been closed due to risk of attack, World Church construction is prevented, churches are picketed by slogan-chanting protestors, and attacked by brick-throwing mobs. Muslim men have kidnapped minor Christian girls with impunity and criminal investigations against extremists have been thwarted by weak measures and implementation.\n[18] Ultimately I conclude that your fear of persecution in Egypt on account of your religious identity is objectively well-founded and that you face a serious possibility of persecution. There is a presumption that a state, if it\u2019s in control of its territory, will make serious efforts to protect its citizens. Failure to seek protection from authorities can be fatal to a claim unless it can be established that the protection would not be forthcoming. It is up to claimants to rebut the presumption of state protection with clear and convincing evidence that the state cannot or will not protect them.\n[19] While the evidence does not establish that the entire Egyptian population is hostile to Christians and while there are some examples of the state attempting to curb Islamists zealotry, these are few and far between. For example, sources report that the government continues to use customary reconciliation when violent incidents occur in place of criminal investigations and prosecutions. Amnesty International states that regarding the use of \u201ccustomary reconciliation\u201d impunity has contributed to a significant increase in violent acts against Christians.\n[20] According to Human Rights Group, reconciliation sessions put Christians at a disadvantage and result in some cases in Christian families being forced to leave their villages and sell their property.\n[21] In your particular circumstances, and individual, the [XXX], singled you out as a target of his interest in marrying you and converting you to Islam and appears to have had some support of the local authorities and been able to act with impunity. In fact, your father was asked to use this customary reconciliation in place of putting a complaint forward.\n[22] Therefore I conclude that the Egyptian government has shown little ability to restrain the attacks and intimidation efforts of anti-Christian extremists. Ultimately the presumption of state protection is rebutted because the objective evidence cited above confirms that the state is unwilling or unable to adequately protect you.\n[23] For an Internal Flight Alternative to be viable with respect to a Section 96 claim, there must be no serious possibility of the claimants being persecuted in the suggested IFA. Further, conditions in the suggested IFA must be such that it would not be unreasonable in all the circumstances including those particular to the claimants in question, for he claimants to seek refuge there. I\u2019ve considered whether an IFA exists in Egypt for you, however, the situation for Christians is largely uniform throughout the whole of Egypt and as such I find there is no place within the country where you could go where you would not face a serious possibility of persecution.\n[24] Accordingly, there is no IFA available.\n[25] So for the forgoing reasons, I determine that you are Convention refugees under Section 96 of the Act and I therefore accept your claims.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n",

It addresses a number of issues, including the unique challenges individuals with diverse SOGIE face in establishing their SOGIE, and in presenting their refugee claims, the danger of stereotyping and inappropriate assumptions, as well as, what to consider when assessing credibility and evidence.\nDETERMINATION\n[4] Having considered the totality of the evidence, I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee for the following reasons.\nALLEGATIONS\n[5] The details of the allegations are fully set out in the claimant\u2019s Basis of Claim Form (BOC).[3] To summarize, the claimant alleges a fear of persecution at the hands of his family, society at large and the state authorities in Turkey, due to his sexual orientation as a gay person.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[6] The claimant\u2019s personal and national identities were established, on a balance of probabilities, by his Turkish passport, certified true copy of which was provided by the Minister.[4]\nNexus\n[7] I find that there is a connection between the persecution that the claimant fears and the Convention ground of membership in a particular social group, namely that of gay men in Turkey.\n[8] I find the claimant to be a credible witness. His testimony was straight-forward, detailed and frank. The claimant did not embellish. There were no discrepancies, contradictions, or omissions in the claimant\u2019s oral and documentary evidence, that went to the core of the claim. Therefore, on a balance of probabilities, I accept that the claimant has established he is a gay man.\nBackground and self-identification\n[9] The claimant recounted that he comes from a family that is middle class and religious. His father is the head of the family, his mother is a housewife. The claimant has two older sisters whose marriages were arranged. The claimant self-identifies as a gay man. When asked what this term means to him, he stated that the meaning is different in Canada than in Turkey. In Turkey, he said it is synonymous to being \u201cin prison\u201d because there you cannot express your homosexuality openly, you must hide it and live your life \u201cbehind the scene\u201d because it is unsafe to do so in public.\n[10] He testified that he started to feel different around the age of 9 or 10 but did not understand why at the time. When he asked his mother what the homosexual meant, a word he had heard on the television, she replied that he did not need to know and not to ask her such things. In his community, people were warned to keep their children away from homosexuals because they have no morals, are ill, and spread disease.\nFirst experiences\n[11] The claimant was able to describe his first romantic encounters with the same sex. He was particularly affected by his experience with a high school student from another city. He provided details on how they met, what attracted him to the student, and where their \u2018encounter\u2019 took place. He was also able to express his emotions when the student\u2019s cousin walked in on them, and describe the injuries he suffered as a result of the ensuing scuffle and how it explained them to his parents when he arrived back home. The claimant stated that after this incident he closed his Facebook account and changed his SIM card for his mobile to prevent from his friend\u2019s cousin from finding him.\n[12] I asked the claimant if he had ever disclosed to anyone in Turkey that he was gay, and he replied that he confided his secret to a close high school friend, but only after she had divulged to him that she was a lesbian. This was confirmed in a letter from the said friend. Otherwise, he concealed his sexual orientation. I questioned him why he had not opened up to his more liberal aunt who lived in a different city than his parents, and he replied that although she was more liberal, she was still homophobic. He did not trust her to keep his secret and feared the potential repercussions he would suffer at the hands of his family, especially his father, if she told them he was gay.\n[13] The claimant testified that he some sexual relations with men during his university days, however he said they were not serious or long-term relationships.\nIncident of abuse\n[14] The claimant stated that on two occasions he was verbally and\/or physically assaulted due to his sexual orientation. The first occurred at an eatery in Istanbul where he and his lesbian friend were accosted by men shouting, \u201cPeople should be burned alive. Your women look like men and your men look like women. Because of you people the world is going to end soon.\u201d Other patrons joined in. The owner sensing trouble asked them to leave. Angered by what happened, his friend called the police. The police came, but did nothing, they just told them to go to another caf\u00e9. A few months later his lesbian friend was violently attacked in Istanbul and required hospitalization. The friend confirmed what happened at the eatery and the attack on her in a letter submitted into evidence.[5]\nLong-term relationship\n[15] The claimant engaged in a long-term relationship with a man in Istanbul. The claimant moved to Canada with this man to pursue English language studies. After the relationship broke down, the man threatened to reveal the claimant\u2019s sexual orientation to his family.\nConfrontation with father\n[16] The claimant testified that his father called him on [XXX] 2019. He wanted to know where his son was. When the claimant told him he was in Canada, the father became angry and said, \u201cyou go to Canada and sleep with men?\u201d He had heard about his sones \u201cbad habits\u201d from his friend and had seen photos. The claimant\u2019s father told him the that he would purchase a ticket for him to return to Turkey and that once he was back in the village \u201cwe will solve your problems there\u201d.\n[17] The claimant testified that his father said he would bury him alive and once he knew his son had disappeared, he would kill himself because his son had dishonoured him, and he could not face people. The claimant said that his father was screaming and swearing at him on the telephone and that he hung up on him and has not spoken to him since. He changed his telephone number so his father could not reach him. He does however communicate with his eldest sister, with whom he is the closest, once a month to get updates on the situation at home, but that she deletes his number after each call. The claimant filed a claim in Canada for refugee protection on [XXX] 2019.[6]\n[18] As to his involvement in the LGBT community in Canada, the claimant said he had registered with an LGBT NGO for a training but did completed it due to the COVID pandemic.\n[19] I accept on a balance of probabilities that the claimant has a subjective fear of persecution.\nObjective Basis\n[20] Furthermore, I find on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant\u2019s subjective fear has an objective basis.\nWorsening situation\n[21] According to the National Documentation Package and country conditions documentation submitted by counsel, homosexuality has been decriminalized in Turkey since 1858 and for many years the LGBTI community enjoyed much freedom. However, the situation has worsened since the 70s when a succession of conservative governments came into power and systemically targeted the LGBTI community with repressive measures.[7]\n[22] Today, the situation of sexual minorities lags behind the standards of the European Union and the United Nations. Consequently, LGBT people in Turkey face discrimination, violence \u2013 both physical and emotional, stigmatization and marginalization.[8]\nFreedom of assembly\n[23] Following an attempted coup on 15 July 2016, the Turkish Government declared a state of emergency. During this period, human rights and fundamental freedoms were severely restricted or suspended. A ban was imposed on public assemblies and activities of various civil society organizations.\n[24] In November 2017, Ankara\u2019s governor imposed an indefinite ban on events organized by LGBTI associations because they risked \u201cinciting hatred and enmity\u201d and therefore the ban was needed to \u201cprevent crimes being committed\u201d, \u201cprotect public health and morality\u201d and \u201cprotect other people\u2019s rights and freedoms.\u201d Pride events are also banned in Istanbul, Izmir, Antalya and Mersin. The NGOs Kos GL and Pink Life unsuccessfully challenged the ban in local administrative courts. Appeals to regional administrative court and to the Constitutional Court are pending. The ban violates Turkey\u2019s national and International obligations to respect and protect rights to equality before the law and freedom of peaceful expression and association.\n[25] The impact of the ban is that it stigmatizes and marginalizes LGBTI people and makes them very vulnerable to attacks. LGBTI people are cast as immoral and criminals. As a result of this, many experienced LGBTI activists have sought asylum abroad.[9]\nPerception and Attitude of Turkish Society\n[26] Although founded as a secular state, traditional Islamic values are deep-rooted in Turkey\u2019s government and society. Turkish society is patriarchal and gender roles are clearly defined. While homosexuality is not banned in Turkey, it is largely viewed as immoral and unnatural behaviour. A global study conducted by Pew Research Center in 2013 reports that acceptance of homosexuality in Turkey remains at a mere 9 percent.\n[27] The conservative AKP government considers the family to be the primary social institution and sees its values and traditions as essential to nation building and maintaining peace. Modem values are thus perceived as a threat to the disintegration of traditional social values. A majority of politicians do not support the LGBTI cause because this does not align with the values and morals of Turkish society. The Minister for Women and Family Affairs has publicly referred to homosexuality as \u201ca biological disturbance\u201d or \u201ddisease and biological disorder in need of treatment\u201d.[10]\n[28] Furthermore, articles submitted by the claimant report that President Erdogan is tapping into strong nationalist and religious groups to bolster the sagging popularity of the AKP. In June 2019, Ali Erbas, who leads the Religious Affairs Directorate in Turkey, preached in a televised sermon on the coronavirus outbreak condemning homosexuality because it brings illness and decay. The head of the Turkish Red Crescent made a homophobic tweet in July of this year, which was sharply rebuked by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.[11]\nHonour Killings\n[29] So adverse is Turkish society to sexual minorities that many LGBTI individuals are killed by members of their own family for having \u2018brought shame \u2018to the family. Two well publicized cases of \u201chonour killing\u201d are that of 18-year old Ahmet Yildiz killed by his father in 2008, and 17-year old Rosen Cicek murdered in 2012 by his father and two uncles. LGBT advocacy groups closely followed the two trials and sought to become intervening parties in the proceedings. The courts rejected their requests. Honour killings are hard to document in Turkey because they are often covered up by families and police avoid investigating them.[12]\nDiscrimination\n[30] Turkey does not have an anti-discrimination law perse, but anti-discrimination clauses are found in the Turkish constitution as well as various criminal, administrative and civil laws. The protected grounds explicitly enumerated differ from each other and are non-exhaustive.\n[31] Sexual orientation and gender identity are not listed among the protected grounds in the Turkish Constitution or other laws for example (the Penal Code, Labour Law, Basic Law on National Education, Law on Civil Servants, Civil Code, Law on Social Services, Regulation on Minimum Wages). Therefore, LGBTI persons\u2019 rights are neither guaranteed, nor specifically protected under Turkish law. This critical gap in the law, which allows the courts to make rulings to the disadvantage of LGBTI persons.\n[32] The Human Rights and Equality Institution of Turkey (HREIT) is mandated to investigate, ex-officio or upon applications made, all allegations of discrimination and to render decisions on such cases. Both the European Commission and the UN Human Rights Committee have expressed concerns about the independence of the HREIT.\n[33] In 2019, the HREIT rejected complaints by trans persons of discrimination in accessing accommodations and services. A study by Mustafa Ozturk found that most LGBTI hide their sexual orientation in the workplace for fear of discrimination and those who do \u2018come out\u2019 experience severe discrimination or are terminated.\n[34] The European Commission has reported cases where police officers, teachers, bank personnel, and city workers that have lost their jobs due to their sexual orientation.[13]\nHate Crimes\n[35] Hates crimes target people for who they are or are perceived to be. Although Turkey does have a law against hate crimes (Article 22 of the Turkish Penal Code), it does not include sexual orientation and gender identity as one of the protected grounds.\n[36] The OSCE Office of Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) reported that Turkey\u2019s law enforcement agencies do not record the bias motivations of hate crimes and that violations of human rights of LGBTI persons, gender-based violence, hate speech and crimes remain a matter of serious concern. Furthermore, the mainstream media under reports such crimes.\n[37] The lack of explicit legal protection for LGBTI persons and persistent discrimination against them amounts to a tacit endorsement of discrimination and violence against LGBTI persons. The documentary evidence shows that between 2010 and 2014, 41 murders of LGBTI personas were motivated by hate. Hate-crimes are not thoroughly and promptly investigated and often under punished in Turkey.[14]\n[38] Courts frequently reduce sentences for hate crimes against LGBTI persons by applying Article 29 of the Turkish Penal Code (\u201cAny person who commits an offence in a state of anger or severe distress caused by an unjust act shall be sentenced to a penalty of imprisonment for a term of eighteen to twenty four years where the offence committed requires a penalty of aggravated life imprisonment and to a penalty of imprisonment for a term of twelve to eighteen years where the offence committed requires a penalty of life imprisonment.) The Penal Code does not define what an unjust act is.[15]\n[39] Having considered all of the evidence, I find on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant\u2019s fear of persecution is well-founded. He would not be able to live openly as a homosexual in Turkey where he faces a serious possibility of persecution, and it is unreasonable to expect him to conceal his sexual identity or expression, in order to live free of persecution.\nState Protection\n[40] As one of the agents of persecution is the Turkish state, adequate state protection is not available to the claimant.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[41] Neither does the claimant have a viable internal flight alternative. Turkey is in control of all of its territories and consequently there is no place he can go in the country that is safe.\n[42] Considering the totality of the evidence before me, I find that the claimant, [XXX], faces a serious possibility of persecution at the hands of his family, society at large and the state authorities, due to his sexual orientation as a gay person, if he returned to Turkey.\nCONCLUSION\n[43] To conclude, I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee and therefore his claim for asylum is accepted.\n[1] Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c.27, as amended, sections 96 and 97(1)\n[2] Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9 of the Refugee Protection Division: Guideline issued by the Chairperson pursuant to paragraph 159(1)(h) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act: Involving Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression.

I have considered your testimony and the other evidence in this case and I am ready to render my decision orally.\n[2] The principal claimant, [XXX], and the minor claimant, [XXX], claims to be citizens of Iran and are claiming refugee protection pursuant to Sections 96 and 97 sub \u2013 Subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[3] INTERPRETER: Sorry, can you keep the sentences short please so I can? I got this one but still.\n[4] MEMBER: I \u2013 I was wondering, is it possible for you to translate simultaneously so that I can read the decision for the record and the claimant will also receive the decision in writing. Do you know how?\n[5] INTERPRETER: It\u2019s going to be a little hard. No. I can\u2019t do that.\n[6] MEMBER: Okay, umm. Okay, I\u2019ll read it in parts then.\n[7] INTERPRETER: Thank you, sir.\n[8] MEMBER: The principal claimant, [XXX], and the minor claimant, [XXX], claims to be citizens of Iran and are claiming refugee protection pursuant to Sections 96 and Subsection 97(1) of Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. The principal claimant was appointed as the designated representative of the minor claimant. In considering this matter, I have considered Chairperson\u2019s Guideline on women refugee claimants and child refugee claimants.\n[9] INTERPRETER: I didn\u2019t get that, sorry. Can you please speak a little louder?\n[10] MEMBER: Okay, umm. Counsel, this decision will be sent in writing. Would you \u2060\u2013 is it possible for you to translate to them when in your office when you receive it? Or, they\u2026\n[11] COUNSEL: Yes. Is it the (inaudible)? As long\u2014I mean at the end of the day I think they want to know whether the decision is positive, I think today.\n[12] MEMBER: It is positive.\n[13] COUNSEL: It\u2019s positive?\n[14] MEMBER: Yes.\n[15] COUNSEL: Okay.\n[16] MEMBER: Okay.\n[17] CLAIMANT: Thank you. Thank you.\n[18] COUNSEL: . Okay, so I will read it to them in (inaudible) because of the mask and all these little logistics, it\u2019s difficult to hear you (inaudible).\n[19] MEMBER: Yes. I appreciate that. I appreciate that, counsel.\n[20] CLAIMANT: Thank you so much.\n[21] MEMBER: Determination.\n[22] CLAIMANT: Thank you.\n[23] MEMBER:\nDetermination\n[24] I find you are both refugee Conventions for \u2013 Convention refugees for the following reasons:\n[25] I find that the claimants have established a serious possibility of persecution on the grounds of their membership to a particular social group, namely women facing gender-based violence due to their position to discrimination of women in Iran. Particularly, Iran\u2019s dressing code. In light of this finding, the Panel has not assessed whether the claimants were victims of domestic abuse in Iran.\n[26] The allegations of the claims are found in the Basis of Claim form. In summary, the principal claimant allege that she fears harm in Iran at the hands of her husband. And you alleged you are your husb \u2060\u2013 you \u2060\u2013 you allege that your husband was abusive, and you fear this abuse will continue if you were to return to Iran. The minor claimant also fears abuse at the hands of her father.\n[27] The principal claimant testified that the claimants do oppose the Iran \u2060\u2013 Iran\u2019s laws that compel women to wear hijab.\nIdentity\n[28] Your identities as citizens of Iran have been established on a balance of probabilities through your testimony and the certified true copy of your passport found in Exhibit 1.\nCredibility\n[29] Overall, I found you, the principal claimant, to be a credible witness on a balance of probabilities. Your testimony was straightforward and spontaneous. There was no material inconsistency in your testimony. Also, I note that you did not embellish your testimony.\n[30] You have testified that women in Iran do not generally have a place. That means they don\u2019t have equal status or treatment in society. It is defined woman has no right to divorce and are forced to marry. You testified that your marriage was arranged through your family and you really didn\u2019t have a choice to refuse. You were pressured into marrying your husband. You also testified that the minor claimant was harassed and bullied in school due to her preference to cut her hair short, wear boy\u2019s jacket and t-shirts. You testified that women are not given value, their freedom of speech is limited, and they don\u2019t have freedom of choice.\n[31] In contrast, you testified that you and the minor claimant have no \u2060\u2013 have not been wearing hijabs since you came to Canada. You testified that you are more comfortable without hijab. I note that the claimants appear before the Panel without hijab. Therefore, I find that on balance of probabilities the claimants oppose the Iran\u2019s dressing code that restricts women\u2019s freedom of choice. I therefore find that you are credible and I acc \u2060\u2013 I accept your allegations as credible in that you have established your \u2013 your and the minor claimant\u2019s subjective fear.\nObjective Basis\n[32] I find that your subjective fear has an objective basis based on the objective evidence before me. In the National Documentation Package for Iran, which is attached to Exhibit 3, Item 2.1 indicates that the law provides that a woman who appears in public without appropriate attire, such as the cloth scarf veil over head and a long jacket, or a large full-length cloth covering legs cloth covering, may be sentenced to flogging and fined.\n[33] Item 5.4, in the NDP, states that there\u2019s no legal definition of what constitutes appropriate hijab. Generally, girls as young as seven years old are required to wear proper hijab. This document further states the policing of women bodies is not confined to the State. Iran veiling laws have enabled thugs and vigilantes who feel they have the duty and the right to enforce Islamic Republic values to harass and assault women in public. As a result, on a daily basis, women and girls face random encounters with strangers who beat and pepper-\u00adspray them, call them whores and make them pull their headscarves down to completely cover their hair.\n[34] The Panel therefore finds an objective and subjective basis to the claimants\u2019 fear regarding the compulsory hijab on the balance of probability.\nState Protection\n[35] State protection would not be reasonably forthcoming as authorities themselves are the agents of persecution.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[36] Given that the State is the agent of persecution, there is no internal flight alternative in the claimants\u2019 circumstances.\nCONCLUSION\n[37] Based on a totality of evidence, I find the claimants are Convention refugees. I therefore accept their claims.\n[38] Thank you and good luck.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n",

He is seeking refugee protection in Canada pursuant to s. 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[3] The allegations of the claim are found in the Basis of Claim form. In summary, the claimant fears persecution by homophobic family members and other homophobic people in the future in Kenya. He claims that he cannot live openly as a bisexual man in Kenya because homophobia is widespread. Even if he were to live in secret having relationships with men, he fears being discovered. Kenya has laws against sexual relationships between men.\n[4] I find that the claimant has satisfied his burden of establishing a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground upon return to Kenya.\n[5] The identity of the claimant is established on a balance of probabilities through the certified true copy of his passport currently held by the Canadian Border Service Agency, CBSA.\n[6] Regarding credibility, when a claimant swears that certain facts are true, this creates a presumption that they are true unless there is a valid reason to doubt their truth. The claimant testified about his marriage to a woman in Kenya with whom he had three children, but also about his bisexual relationships in the United Arab Emirates and later with a Kenyan lover where he took a holiday in Tanzania and with whom he had romantic relations in Kenyan before he fled to Canada with a visa. His testimony was consistent with the narrative in his BOC \u2014 or, substantially consistent.\n[7] In 2004, the claimant had his first sexual relationship with a man, a work colleague in the United Arab Emirates, which put the claimant in peril there so that he stopped working in the UAE and returned to Kenya. Back in Kenya in 2016, he began an affair with another man, again a colleague, and was again put in peril because of it when vacationing with his lover in Tanzania. His family in Kenya found out about his lover and threatened his life for \u2014 and threatened the claimant\u2019s life for bringing shame to the family. The claimant\u2019s testimony was materially consistent with the Basis of Claim.\n[8] He also produced at the hearing an email to an agency here in Toronto which supports his testimony about his identity as a bisexual man. Also, he had testify a witness, his uncle, to whom he fled in Canada. The uncle substantiated his circumstances as a married man in Kenya and talked about what support he gave to the claimant here in Toronto.\n[9] While there were some inconsistencies in the claimant\u2019s testimony, the Basis of Claim, and the claimant\u2019s witness\u2019 testimony, they were not material to the issue of whether he is bisexual, and the claimant\u2019s explanations for the inconsistencies have satisfied me that he is telling the truth regarding his sexual orientation. I find that the claimant is generally credible and that on a balance of probabilities he is bisexual.\n[10] The overall objective evidence supports the claim. The claimant\u2019s testimony was consistent with descriptions in the NDP, Exhibit 3, of widespread discrimination against men in Kenya who have same-sex relations, while the most recent item on the issue, item 6.6 from the UK\u2019s Home Office, April 2020, reports that discrimination is lessening, it is still taboo in many families and communities in which violence will flare up. I find that in the documentary evidence there is an objective basis for the claimant\u2019s fear of persecution and his fear is well founded.\n[11] As well, the criminal law prohibits same-sex sexual relations between men with a maximum penalty of 21 years in prison. Therefore, with regard to state protection, I find on a balance of probabilities that rather than being protected from assaults by homophobic attackers, it is more likely that the claimant reporting to authorities that he is gay would be at risk of prosecution and would unlikely be protected. Given that the laws of the state have criminalized sexual relations between men, I find that it would be objectively reasonable for the claimant to seek protection of the state in his circumstances.\n[12] Regarding an internal flight alternative, I find there is nowhere for the claimant to live safely in Kenya given that the criminalization of sexual relationships between men affects the entire country. I find that there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout Kenya given the pervasive discrimination against gay couples and I find that there is no possibility of adequate state protection in any part of the country. Therefore, a viable IFA does not exist for the claimant who, although bisexual, has testified that he is essentially bisexual and is \u2014 and will behave as a bisexual man.\n[13] Having considered all of the evidence, I find on a balance of probabilities that the claimant is bisexual and given his profile, there is a serious possibility that he would face persecution with inadequate protection if he were to return to Kenya.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013\n\n",

You alleged you hoped the problems at home would settle and that you had planned to return to Columbia.\n[18] You alleged that while in Toronto in [XXX] 2019, you received a distressing call from the female claimant\u2019s mother advising that a threatening letter had been left by the Black Eagles, as well as a dead dog on the doorstep. The letter threatened both of your lives due to your animal rights activism.\n[19] You alleged you felt you could not at that point return to Columbia and immediately initiated a refugee claim without \u2026 without delay.\n[20] You allege if you return you will be physically harmed, killed, and you also would not be able to continue your animal rights activism.\n[21] You allege that there is no State protection for you or an internal flight alternative.\n[22] With regards to identity, your personal identity as citizens of Columbia has been established by your testimony and the supporting documents, namely those in Exhibit 1 the \u2026 the Columbian passports, your USA and Canadian visas, and I find, on a balance of probability, that identity and country of reference have been established.\n[23] With regards to nexus, I find that there is a link between what you fear and one of the five grounds, namely political opinion, opposition to government corruption, and as animal rights activists. Therefore, I\u2019ve assessed this claim under Section 96.\nCredibility:\n[24] In terms of your general credibility, I found you to be credible \u2026 both credible witnesses and I therefore believe what you have alleged in your oral testimony and in your Basis of Claim Form.\n[25] Specifically, your testimony was provided in a spontaneous and genuine way without any inconsistencies or contradictions with the numerous documents that you\u2019ve disclosed.\n[26] Your \u2026 your testimony about your animal rights activism was \u2026 was detailed and genuine, and without hesitation or preparation, you permitted me to view your social media pages for the \u2026 for your foundation, which \u2026 which provided consistent evidence about your adoption, process, animal welfare work, your animal activism, and your interaction with your \u2026 with your community.\n[27] Your knowledge and history provided about your motivation to become animal rights activists was detailed, genuine, and very personal, specifically, as it relates to the issue regarding street animals, which you explained is, you know, quite problematic in Columbia, and that was your main focus.\n[28] Your testimony about your reasons for speaking out and about the issues you incur at the government animal shelter were not only consistent with your very detailed and genuine documents, but also with your testimony about your convictions and your beliefs. You simply could not stay silent or not speak out. In doing so you drew unwanted and dangerous attention.\n[29] I find your testimony and supporting evidence in this regard to be credible and uncontested.\n[30] The copies of the threatening text messages that relate to the threats to your complaints about the concerns at the shelter and the corruption you uncovered, the transcript of the call received from a former shelter worker who had also been threatened, the numerous and extremely detailed right of request letter sent to the mayor\u2019s office and the municipal Unit of Agriculture and Technical Assistance or UMATA for short.\n[31] I find your evidence credible about not claiming in the USA or Canada, given you had filed police reports and that it wasn\u2019t until the threats escalated further with the \u2026 with the female claimant\u2019s mother receiving the threatening letter from the Black Eagles as well as the dead dog on the door, and you determined at that point essentially your fear was quite crystalized and you have alleged you were no longer safe in Columbia and you initiated a refugee claim without delay.\n[32] Additionally, the other documents support your claim. The \u2026 the registration for the [XXX], the registration for your businesses, the Facebook and Instagram pages, the copies of numerous texts between clients who had adopted animals from the shelter only to find out that they were sick and had not been properly cared for there. And, of course, that\u2019s what led you to initiate your investigation.\n[33] And the threats were directly related to your activism and your investigation and complaints of government corruption, and that\u2019s also what brought about obviously the \u2026 the persecution.\n[34] So, I find that your subjective fear is established by your credible testimony and I believe what you have alleged, on a balance of probabilities. There\u2019s also an objective basis for your fear.\n[35] So, with regards with the Black Eagles, I\u2019m referring to NDP Item 7.10 and Item 7.11, specifically about the Black Eagles that notes that they have a known political agenda. They are involved in social and political extermination of social and political activists, as well as disappearances, homicides, and extortion.\n[36] And the country condition documents that your counsel provided in Exhibit 6 also confirm as well that the means of their communicating their threat was in keeping with essentially their style or their \u2026 their sort of modus operandi if you will, threatening letters left under the door as well as the letter had an insignia match, the letter that you provided.\n[37] With regards to \u2026 so, there is a well-founded fear. Your subjective fear has an objective basis and I find you have a well-founded fear of persecution.\n[38] With regards to the issue of State protection, the presumption of \u2026 there is a presumption that a State can protect its citizens unless the State is in a complete breakdown or there\u2019s past personal experience where the State was not forthcoming, or we look to similarly situated persons. Okay. And to rebut the presumption there must be clear and convincing evidence.\n[39] I found that both of you are credible and that there is clear and convincing evidence to rebut the presumption of State protection.\n[40] You made efforts at many levels to get assistance with your concerns. When the threats were escalated you went to the police who advised you and you took them at their word, that they couldn\u2019t do much other than, you know, call us every now and then for a \u2026 for a patrol. They referred you to the fiscalia. I find that you\u2019re credible in stating that you went to the fiscalia. The fiscalia was not able to help you. But at that point too, you know, you were \u2026 you were in the process of doing everything that you could.\n[41] You took a vacation and that again, is where things shifted. There \u2026 it\u2019s almost like a bit of sur place claim. The situation happened where your mother received the threatening letter and the dead dog, and at that point you realized that, you know, your lives were truly in danger and that if you had waited and stayed, you know, maybe things wouldn\u2019t have turned out as they had.\n[42] There was an objective basis for you not feeling that protection was forthcoming. And the evidence throughout the NDP, specifically, in 2.1 the DOS report, 2.17 speaks about social leaders.\n[43] 9.2 and 9.5 confirm that despite efforts to put protection in place, activists, social leaders, and those that expose and speak out on government corruption are the most vulnerable and that protection is often delayed, ineffective, and essentially not adequate at an operational level, this was what you were experiencing. So, your experience is \u2026 is manifest in the objective evidence.\n[44] The claimants \u2026 you made efforts that were reasonable, but I find that your reason for not pursuing further protection is also to be reasonable, given your personal circumstances, as well as the objective country documentation, and I do find that you have rebutted the presumption of State protection.\n[45] State protection would not be reasonably available to you in your particular circumstances, especially considering the level of corruption within the government, and that you were specifically speaking out about government corruption. As such, the State is somewhat of an agent of persecution and as such, it\u2019s not reasonable to expect adequate protection from the State.\n[46] Flowing from that, we consider IFA, internal flight alternative. And yes, I did flag Barranquilla and Cartagena, but I find that \u2026 again, this is a two prong test. The first prong is about safety. Would you be safe from persecution in the IFA? I find that you would not. Therefore, there is no IFA. A \u2026 a suitable IFA does not exist.\n[47] You cannot be expected to stop your activism. It\u2019s been very clear from your testimony that that is core to your beliefs and \u2026 and it\u2019s just the same as, you know, a SOGIE claim. We couldn\u2019t ask someone to stop being gay. We cannot ask someone to stop their activism. This is something that\u2019s true to your \u2026 to the core of your beliefs.\n[48] You also were located in Bogota, which is a major metropolitan.\n[49] The Black Eagles do have connections throughout Columbia. They often fill in the gaps left by other paramilitary and narco-military groups when they disband. As well there\u2019s the corruption connection with the government corruption.\n[50] The first prong, as I said, is not met. You would not be safe and I do find that there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout the country.\n[51] Therefore, in conclusion, based on the totality of the evidence and your counsel\u2019s submissions, I find that the claimants [XXX]and[XXX] to be Convention refugees and I accept your claim.\n[52] CLAIMANT: Thank you.\n[53] COUNSEL: Very good. Thank you.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n",

The claimant is a citizen of Sudan and is claiming refugee protection pursuant to Sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act based on a political opinion. I find that you are a Convention refugee for the following reasons.\n[2] Regarding the allegations, these are noted in your Basis of Claim form, the following is just a very short summary. You are a young man from Khartoum having studied and worked as a [XXX]. You have recently\u00ad, last summer been involved-, been interviewed by the BBC and critically spoke of the government, the Sudanese Government. At the time you were temporarily living in Cairo, you heard from your family member shortly after that interview that the authorities were aware of your comment and you were then afraid to return back to your country. You traveled to the US and then shortly after that you came to Canada and made a refugee claim. You\u2019ve provided many more details in your file, that\u2019s just a short summary for the purpose of the reasons.\n[3] Regarding your identity. Your identity as a national of Sudan was established by your testimony and the supporting documents filed such as your passport. Your identity as a [XXX] was established by documents provided such as [XXX] that you were involved in and some [XXX] of that [XXX] on the [XXX] that you did in [XXX]. Your identity as political opponent was established by your testimony, you clearly detailed your position regarding the Sudanese Government in various recent events in the country. As well your interview transcript, I think you provided and some of your social media postings also reflects that opposition to the government.\n[4] Regarding credibility, I found you to be a credible witness. The only concern I had was your failure to claim in the US. You know, your brothers there, your safe in the US, they do have a functioning asylum system, not that speedy but still its there. But that\u2019s not enough to fail your claim. Okay, it\u2019s the only concern that I had. As well as I\u2019ve mentioned you provided proof of your activities as a journalist and your position is clear regarding the government. And your fear of returning to Sudan is supported in the documentary evidence, this is the objective reports that I have on the human rights situation in Sudan today. I note from the documentary evidence and this is at Exhibit 3, Item 2.1 that the Sudanese government re-\n[5] MEMBER: Can you understand my English? Do we still need the interpreter or do you want him?\n[6] CLAIMANT: No, I understand you.\n[7] INTERPRETER: Okay.\n[8] MEMBER: Okay. Mr. Interpreter you can take off if you want? Do you want to go and have your break now?\n[9] INTERPRETER: That\u2019s fine, I can go.\n[10] MEMBER: Okay, okay. It\u2019s up to you.\n[11] INTERPRETER: If you want to remain just in case of something.\n[12] MEMBER: Sure, sure. We are almost finished anyway but you don\u2019t need to interpret. I knew that his English was-, was pretty good.\n[13] Okay, so along as you can understand me, I\u2019m just going to let you know and you already know this anyway that Sudanese Government restricts political participation, uses lethal force against demonstrators and detainees. Security force has detained and physically abused political opponents without charge. Recent reports in our NDP package at Exhibit 3 talks about the Sudanese authorities monitoring-, this is at 4.18, authorities monitor online political activity. I also have many, many reports from Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch that talk about Jack of freedom for [XXX] and that [XXX] who were speaking out are harassed, are arrested, are detained without charge, are taken to unknown locations and really treated quite harshly if they are speaking out publicly regarding the government. So, your fear of returning to Sudan given the person that you are and are known to be is supported in the objective evidence.\n[14] Regarding state protection, I find that you have rebutted the presumption of state protection. In your case, the agent of persecution is the State. And we know from the documentary evidence that the Sudanese Government ranks very, very poorly internationally under freedoms and they certainly haven\u2019t been able to deal with abuses committed by their authorities. So even if you were to complain about how the security forces were treating you, it doesn\u2019t seem that there\u2019s any recourse available for you that\u2019s adequate in Sudan today.\n[15] Regarding an internal flight alternative, again I don\u2019t find that there\u2019s anywhere safe or reasonable that you could locate in Sudan where you would be safe from the State. Again, the agent the persecution in the State.\n[16] In conclusion, having considered all of the evidence, I find you have established a serious risk of persecution. I find that you are a Convention refugee and I accept your claim.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n",

The claimants are [XXX] and [XXX], they seek refugee protection against Iran pursuant to Sections 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. For the following reasons the Panel finds that the claimants are Convention refugees and this claim is accepted.\n[2] For ease of reference, where this decision makes reference to the claimant, that means the male claimant although these reasons apply equally to both claimants.\n[3] This claim was based on the following allegations. The claimant became interested in Christianity when he visited an uncle in Romania. The claimant and his wife came to Canada in [XXX] 2018 for the claimant\u2019s education. In [XXX] 2019 the claimant\u2019s wife returned to Iran with their new born son. When she returned she encountered problems with authorities at the Iranian airport because her son was wearing a Christian cross. The son\u2019s Canadian passport was confiscated and the claimant\u2019s wife struggled for 4 months to have it returned. The claimant\u2019s wife returned to Canada on [XXX] 2019. They immediately made their refugee claims, signing their Basis of Claims on [XXX] 2019.\n[4] The identities of the claimants were established on the basis of their Iranian passports. The originals of which were ceased by the Minister.\n[5] The Panel had two concerns about the credibility of this claim. First was that the claimant delayed seeking protection in Canada until [XXX] 2019, despite being here in Canada as a Christian convert since [XXX] 2018. Second the Panel was also concerned that the claimant\u2019s wife returned to Iran with a Christian cross on her son, knowing that it could have caused problems. Regarding the delay to seek protection, the claimant explained that his wife was pregnant at the time they arrived and turning his mind to making a refugee claim was difficult with his wife\u2019s pregnancy. Regarding the return to Iran, the claimants explained how the cross was covered under their son\u2019s clothing and they simply did not think this would cause problems for them.\n[6] While the Panel does have concerns, the Panel finds these explanations do somewhat mitigate the Panel\u2019s concerns. The Panel does not find that these concerns ultimately undermine the credibility of this claim in its entirety or the presumption that the claimants have been truthful. In all of the respects the Panel did find that this claim is credible. The claimant spoke about his religious conversion to Christianity, he spoke about why he became interested in it, about why he continued to develop his faith and about how the faith has impacted his life. He spoke about the church he attended here in Canada, and the steps he has been taking to become baptized. The Panel found this evidence and testimony was compelling.\n[7] Other than noted above, there were no inconsistencies in the evidence. The claimant was straight-forward, spontaneous, and elaborated with significant detail upon the allegations. Where the Panel did have concerns, they were either reasonably explained, or otherwise did not outweigh the evidence supporting this claim. The Panel has access to the National Documentation Package for Iran, incredible sources such as the US DOS report and UK Home Office reports for example. These sources make clear that apostacy in Iran is illegal and punishable by death even though the female claimant herself may not be Christian, these are the country conditions evidence. The Panel was also satisfied that the female claimant herself would potentially face significant risk given her husband\u2019s conversion, and given the difficulties she has already encountered in Iran.\n[8] Given that the Panel finds the claimant\u2019s conversion is genuine, the claimants fit the profile of persons at high risk of persecution.\n[9] Whereas the State is the agent of persecution, the claimants have rebutted the presumption that state protection would not be adequate and forthcoming. Excuse me. The claimants have rebutted the presumption that state protection would be adequate and forthcoming. Likewise, there is no location in Iran the claimants could go where they would not face a serious possibility of persecution.\n[10] For all these reasons, the Panel finds that this claim is credible. The claimants fear is well-founded. The claimants face a serious possibility of persecution in Iran on a count of religion. The claimants are Convention refugees and this claim is accepted.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n",

You will receive an edited \u2026 unedited transcript of the decision in the mail. Your counsel will also get a copy so if you have any questions you\u2019re welcome to ask him.\n[3] You claim to be citizens of Nigeria claiming refugee protection pursuant to Section 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[4] I find that both of you are Convention refugees for the following reasons.\n[5] The allegations of your claim can be found in the Basis of Claim Form in Exhibit 2. The details were elaborated today in your testimony. In summary, you the principal claimant, fear persecution in Nigeria due to your sexual orientation as a member of a particular social group, namely because you are bisexual. You also fear persecution at the hands of your first husband whose abusive relationship you escaped when you fled Nigeria for the United States.\n[6] Your son the minor claimant fears persecution as a child of a bisexual women who will be ostracized by the community members and might face spiritual cleansing to rid him of his mother\u2019s sins.\n[7] Based on the type of claim I\u2019ve carefully considered Chairperson\u2019s guidelines 9, 4, and 3. So, sexual orientation and gender identity, women refugee claimants, and child refugee claimants.\n[8] I find your identities as nationals of Nigeria have been established, on a balance of probabilities, through your testimony, through your valid Nigerian passports which were presented when you made your claim in Exhibit 1. I find no reasons to doubt the authenticity of those documents.\n[9] In terms of your general credibility I find you to be a credible witness. Principal claimant, you have testified in a straightforward manner. There were no relevant inconsistencies in your testimony or contradictions between your testimony and the other evidence before me. I also find that were no embellishments made within your testimony. Therefore, I accept what you have alleged in support of your claim including the following.\n[10] Central issue of your claim is sexual orientation so I put a lot of weight into your testimony and documents relating to your past and current same sex partners in Nigeria and in the United States.\n[11] You testified about your first relationship and your longest relationship in Nigeria which you had to end as you fled the country in 2016. You did not escape because your sexuality was revealed, but because you had been in an abusive relationship until [XXX] 2016 with a man who physical and verbally tormented you, after the divorce you still could not escape his threats and left in [XXX] 2016 on a visitor\u2019s visa to the United States.\n[12] There you met your second husband who started the sponsorship process so you could stay in the US permanently. However, because you were also in a same sex relationship and your husband found out he stopped the process of sponsorship in [XXX] 2017. Told your family and relatives in Nigeria about your sexuality and his unwillingness to have a bisexual wife.\n[13] After consulting with the church members in the United States you understood that you would not be able to obtain the status there. Returning to Nigeria would mean being persecuted by the community and the State for being a bisexual. So, you were advised to go to Canada and claim refugee protection here.\n[14] I did not \u2026 you did not present any supporting letters from your previous same sex partners. You lost contact with your Nigerian partner in 2016 because she was upset with you leaving her and going to the US.\n[15] Your US partner did not support your after you split from your second husband and did not want anyone in the Nigerian community in the United States to know about you two. You yourself were ashamed and still feel ashamed of who you are and not ready to share your feelings with anyone.\n[16] Your family members in Nigeria known you\u2019re a bisexual and you also received telephone threats from your second husband\u2019s family who told you not to come back to Nigeria. In addition, your son, if returned to Nigeria would have to probably undergo the spiritual cleansing to rid him of the mother\u2019s sins and homosexuality.\n[17] While in Canada you have been an active church member though in Windsor participating in services regularly and volunteering in the local community centre. But even now it is hard for you to share your feelings and have a relationship with anyone. You\u2019re still depressed about your past relationship and the consequences they had for you.\n[18] In general, I find your testimony today was credible and, on balance of probabilities, you, the principal claimant, are a bisexual woman.\n[19] As to the minor claimant I asked whether he would face any harm if he\u2019s returned to Nigeria. You said he would not face any serious harm but would \u2026 would be separated from his mother.\n[20] During the counsel\u2019s questioning you said that if your son gets \u2026 you also added if your son gets into the hands of the elders who know you\u2019re bisexuality he will have to go through dangerous ritual cleansing. In addition, he will be discriminated against and ostracized as a family member of the bisexual. The harassment, as counsel indicated in his submissions, could amount to persecution and risk to boy\u2019s life.\n[21] I find there is a link between what you fear and one of the give Convention grounds. As noted earlier the Convention ground for your claim is a particular social group. So, on a balance of probabilities, I accept that you are a bisexual woman and the minor claimant your son is a family member of the bisexual. Your claim is analyzed pursuant to Section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[22] The overall objective evidence supports your claim for Convention refugee protection based on the membership in a particular social group, namely sexual orientation as a bisexual.\n[23] National Documentation Package for Nigeria in Exhibit 3 Items 6.1, 2.1, and 6.7 indicate that same sex relationships are criminalized in Nigeria. In particular, according to the Same Sex Marriage (Prohibition) Act all forms of LGBTQ activity, supporting and promoting it are illegal in Nigeria. Anyone convicted of entering into a same sex marriage or civil union may be sentenced to 14 years in prison. Anybody aiding or assisting homosexual activities faces a punishment of up to 10 years in prison.\n[24] Any sexual orientation that is not heterosexual is considered to be unnatural, demonic, and immoral in Nigeria.\n[25] The documentary evidence further indicates that family members of LGBTQ persons face treatment amounting to persecution and it\u2019s found in Tab 6.11, 10.1 in the National Documentation Package. So, family members of sexual minorities including spouses, parents, children, and siblings face ostracism, stigmatization, embarrassment from community members, other extended family members. Family members of sexual minorities can be cut off from their community, can be insulted and assaulted by community members.\n[26] In addition and as pointed by the counsel, Nigerian police force have arrested and detained relatives of wanted person. You as a bisexual is a wanted person in Nigeria. This act is often undertaken by the police with the intent of drawing a wanted person from hiding and forcing their surrender to law enforcement authorities.\n[27] So, counsel was right. Tab 10.1 actually points out that fact that family members of wanted persons will be and can be detained with no particular reason.\n[28] The minor \u2026 according to counsel\u2019s submissions in addition the minor claimant could be\u2026 also face a great possibility for his persecution, increased danger that could lead to chi Id abduction, him being pressured into spiritual cleansing rituals that elders would perform on him.\n[29] Overall, the objective country condition evidence supports conclusion that both of you, you and your son, have an objective basis for your claim. You as a bisexual person and the minor claimant your son as a family member of the bisexual person.\n[30] You also fear police, authorities, and Nigerian community in general as same sex relationship is criminalized across Nigeria. I find it would be objectively unreasonable for you to seek protection of the authorities in Nigeria. Adequate State protection would not be available to you as you fear the State.\n[31] With regards to possible viable internal flight alternative in Nigeria, given the laws, the Federal laws of Nigeria criminalizing same sex relationship, I find there is a serious possibility of persecution for you throughout Nigeria. Therefore, a viable internal flight alternative does not exist for you in Nigeria.\n[32] As per your son the minor claimant, I also considered IFA for him, but again in his particular circumstances it is unreasonable to relocate anywhere in Nigeria without adults. It\u2019s simply not safe.\n[33] So, having considered all of the evidence I find there is a serious possibility that you would face persecution in Nigeria pursuant to Section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[34] I conclude that you are both Convention refugees based on your membership in a particular social group, principal claimant as a bisexual and the minor claimant as a family member of a bisexual. I therefore accept both your claims. Thank you.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n",

In summary, the claimant alleges intimate partner violence from her son\u2019s father, who abused her, threatened her life, and attempted to recruit her to join the Mungiki criminal sect. She alleges that there is no state protection for her, nor is there any place for her to live safely in Kenya due to the failures of the state to protect women facing domestic violence and because her son\u2019s father has continued to try to find her in different locations.\nChairperson\u2019s Guidelines\n[3] The panel has considered and applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guidelines on Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution[2] and in particular, Part C Evidentiary Matters, and Part D Framework of Analysis, to assess credibility and analyse the internal flight alternative (IFA), within the claimant\u2019s own social, cultural, and economic context:\n\u201cIn determining the reasonableness of a woman\u2019s recourse to an internal flight alternative (IFA), decision-makers should consider the ability of women, because of their gender, to travel safely to the IFA and to stay there without facing undue hardship. In determining the reasonableness of an IFA, the decision-makers should take into account factors including religious, economic, and cultural factors, and consider whether and how these factors affect women in the IFA\u201d (Part C).\u201cConsiderations: Whether there would be undue hardship for the claimant both in reaching the location of the IFA and in establishing residence there\u201d (Part D).[4] An application was allowed for procedural accommodations for the claimant as a vulnerable person, according to the Chairperson\u2019s Guidelines on Procedures with respect to Vulnerable Persons appearing before the Board.[3] A [XXX] assessment was disclosed[4] with recommendations for accommodations from a qualified Canadian medical doctor specialising in [XXX]. Accordingly, procedural accommodations included: varying the order of questioning; using a soft and gentle tone of questioning; allotting adequate time to answer questions, repeating questions as necessary; taking frequent breaks as needed; limiting the number of questions about dates and timelines; and limiting the questions about the details of the domestic violence.\n[5] The [XXX] diagnosed the claimant with [XXX] and [XXX]. In addition to severe [XXX] of [XXX] and [XXX], the assessment also indicated symptoms of her disorders that might affect testimony including, \u201csignificant avoidance of thinking and talking about the past to the point of not having been able to disclose certain aspects of the trauma until now\u201d and \u201cdifficulties with focus and memory\u201d. The [XXX] also described the claimant as being \u201cvery disorganized in the way she described her past [\u2026] tangential and circumstantial, and sometimes vague in her answers [\u2026] and all these are seen in severe and chronic trauma.[5]\u201d The panel considered the objectives of Guideline 8 first to recognize the particular difficulties of the claimant and factors that may impair her ability to present her case and second to ensure the ongoing sensitization of the panel to prevent the claimant from re\u00adtraumatization by the hearing process.\nDETERMINATION\n[6] The claimant has established a serious possibility of persecution in Kenya on account of her membership in a particular social group. Therefore, the panel finds that she is a Convention Refugee pursuant to section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).\nANALYSIS\n[7] The panel has considered all the evidence relating to the allegations including the claimant\u2019s testimony, personal and country documents, and counsel\u2019s written representations.\nIdentity\n[8] On a balance of probabilities, the panel finds that the claimant has established her personal identity and Kenyan citizenship based on the certified true copy of her Kenyan passport.[6]\nNexus\n[9] There is a nexus between the claimant\u2019s allegations and one of the five Convention grounds, specifically membership in a particular social group as a Kenyan woman who is at risk of gender-based violence. Therefore, this claim has been assessed under s 96 of the IRPA.\nCredibility\n[10] The panel finds the claimant\u2019s testimony and evidence to be credible and generally reliable in assessing her fear of persecution. The claimant was forthcoming and detailed in her responses. There were no relevant inconsistencies or contradictions between the testimony and other evidence. The central allegations of this claim pertain to the claimant\u2019s relationship to her younger son\u2019s father (FK). Therefore, the panel has focused its findings on the claimant\u2019s former intimate-partner relationship and gender-based violence, as well as the agent of persecution\u2019s membership in the criminal Mungiki sect and ongoing interest in locating her and her youngest son.\nThe claimant endured Intimate Partner Violence at the hands other child\u2019s father\n[11] The claimant moved with her older son to Mombasa in 2010, where he attended secondary school and she earned income from selling fruit in the market. She began a relationship with a patron of her stall, FK, who was originally from Nairobi and who was the same ethnicity as her, Kikuyu. He had two children and a wife, and he told the claimant that he was divorced, though he did not prove this to her. Their relationship began with him visiting her stall, and then visiting her at home. He began to beat her during his visits. The claimant became pregnant for him in 2011 and the beatings became worse during her pregnancy. He visited almost daily and was often drunk. After her youngest son was born in [XXX][7], he continued to visit her and to beat her brutally. The panel asked whether her older son or neighbours had witnessed any of this abuse or its effects. She explained that neighbours had tried to intervene, but she did not stay in touch with any of them after she fled Mombasa in 2013, although she occasionally ran into them in Nairobi and they would tell her that FK was still looking for her and threatening to harm her and take his son. She also explained that she never indicated to her older son that she was being abused by FK because he had been in boarding school in Mombasa. He would not have witnessed the abuse, she was too ashamed to let him know, and if he did learn about the abuse he would have tried to confront FK, which would have been dangerous for him. For these reasons, she had no letters of support regarding the abuse. The panel asked her whether her older son knew why she was in Canada, and she said that he did. Her older son has also sent her original documents for the claim from his address in Nairobi.[8] The panel weighed the claimant\u2019s explanations for the lack of personal documents, and found them to be reasonable given her particular circumstances, which include her avoidance of sharing details of her abuse.\n[12] The claimant mentioned in her BOC going to the hospital at least once during her stay in Mombasa due to a fall caused by FK, where she was treated with injections, and she also states that she had to go to the hospital various times because of his abuse. However, no contemporaneous hospital or medical records were produced from that time. The claimant did disclose hospital records from [XXX] from [XXX] and [XXX] 2019[9] and explained in her BOC that she attended appointments to investigate increasing pain in her leg from the abuse she experienced with FK.\n[13] The panel asked whether she ever reported his abuse to the police in Mombasa and she said that she reported FK to the elders before she became aware of his Mungiki membership; however, the abuse did not stop after the elders met with him.[10] The claimant did not disclose any letters from the elders in support of her claim; however, going to the elders is consistent with the Kenyan NDP, which says that in matters of domestic violence, people frequently use traditional dispute resolution mechanisms addressed by village elders as an alternative to official channels.[11]\n[14] The panel has analysed the absence of documents from Mombasa as follows. The panel notes that the claimant was able to provide documents from locations where she continues to have a network of support, which she can draw on to help her to substantiate her allegations of abuse, such as [XXX]. The abuse that she directly experienced was associated with Mombasa. She moved four or five times in Mombasa and environs, including neighbouring Kilifi County[12]; however, FK would locate her and harass her while she was vending, and he also threatened to kill her. Referring to her [XXX] assessment, the [XXX] described the claimant\u2019s [XXX] and [XXX] in relation to her trauma, as well as memories of abuse that she considers \u201cunmentionable\u201d. As such, she literally might be avoiding having her support network risk their lives, as she sees it, to get documents in Mombasa since FK still resides in Mombasa as far as she is aware, and she testified that she does not know what FK might do to her family because she and her younger son are in hiding. Given the unspeakable abuse she experienced in Mombasa, and the shame she says she feels, the panel finds that her credibility regarding the abuse outweighs any negative inferences arising from this gap in the claimant\u2019s documentary evidence. For the reasons that preceded, the panel finds that the claimant has established, on a balance of probabilities, a fear of persecution as a victim of domestic violence at the hands of FK.\nWell-founded fear of persecution \u2013 Objective Basis\n[15] The panel finds that the claimant\u2019s subjective fear of persecution has an objective basis. The socio-cultural acceptance of domestic violence by a large minority of the population has a serious impact on the female demographic, indicated by Kenyan authorities who reveal, \u201cdomestic violence as the leading cause of preventable, nonaccidental death for women during the year\u201d.[13] The prevalence of violence against women is particularly notable in the Kenyan Demographic and Health Surveys Program (DHS) statistics that show, \u201cthe number of women who have experienced violence since the age of 15 has actually increased from 38.5% in 2008\/9 to 44.8% in 2014, with husbands\/partners the main perpetrators. [Further] 41.8% of women (aged 15 to 49) and about 36% of men felt that hitting or beating the wife was justified in certain domestic situations\u201d.[14]\n[16] The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant has established a pattern of violence that was not remedied by community intervention, and that the violence amounts to a violation of a fundamental human right. The panel is satisfied that there is an objective basis to the claimant\u2019s subjective fear, and she has established a well-founded fear of persecution based on her gender.\nSTATE PROTECTION\n[17] The claimant described her attempts to find relief from the abuse from the elders; however, the matter was taken to the police only once. She was in hiding at her mother\u2019s house in Nairobi after fleeing Mombasa and, a few months later, her mother found a threatening note at their door from FK. She and her mother went to the police who referred her to the Area Chief\u2019s office. The Area Chief wrote a letter dated [XXX] 2019 summarizing that FK was looking for the claimant and his son, and stating that the claimant should look for safety while an investigation is conducted in the matter. The panel asked her about the investigation and police response, and she said they sent patrols but did not follow up to let the family know the status of their investigation. She said that she does not know if they wrote a report following her complaint, but when they read the note they referred her to the Chief\u2019s office. Police referral of the matter is consistent within the Kenyan NDP that indicates that mediation and conciliation in family matters is widely promoted by police who avoid domestic issues.\n[18] The objective evidence in the NDP indicates that Kenya is making progress in recognizing the rights of women, with various policy and administrative reforms. However, at the level of implementation and enforcement, the NDP describes a high level of tolerance of violence against women that undermines the effectiveness of state protection, including difficulties to investigate and prosecute gender-based violence.[15] Further, domestic violence is a pervasive problem and, \u201cExcept in cases of death, police officers generally refrained from investigating domestic violence, which they considered a private family matter\u201d.[16] According to the NDP, \u201cpolice officers often do not enforce the illegality of rape\u201d[17] and the enforcement of laws pertaining to rape and domestic violence is limited.[18]\n[19] The panel finds that there is clear and convincing evidence to rebut the presumption of state protection, on a balance of probabilities, and that adequate state protection would not be reasonably forthcoming in this particular case.\nINTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE (IFA)\n[20] In determining the viability of an IFA, a two-pronged test must be considered. First, the panel must be satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that there is no serious possibility of persecution in the suggested IFA. Secondly, conditions in the part of the country proposed as an IFA must be such that it would not be unreasonable to seek refuge there in all the circumstances, including those particular to the claimant. The second prong of the IFA test is an objective one: is it objectively reasonable to expect the claimant to seek safety in a different part of the country? Generally, the documentary evidence in the NDP discusses conditions for women in Nairobi; however, the panel infers that the challenges outlined also relate to relocating to other places in Kenya. Eldoret was a possible IFA put to the claimant, and it was an IFA that she had attempted in the past, at the home of her uncle. However, even if FK could not locate her in the IFA, the panel finds that it would be unreasonable for the following reasons.\nOngoing Medical Treatment is Beyond the Claimant\u2019s Reach in the IFA[21] The claimant has submitted physical and mental health records that have established that she requires ongoing medical treatment. In the context of the severity of her trauma, the [XXX] noted that the claimant will \u201cnot be able to make full use of any treatment modalities until the threat of her trauma recurring is permanently removed\u201d.[19] She has undertaken counseling at the Riverdale Immigrant Women\u2019s Centre as well as the Canadian Centre for Victims of Torture, both of which have provided letters[20] regarding her [XXX] and [XXX] techniques.\n[22] Further to her frail [XXX] condition, the claimant has undergone surgery in Canada to remove a large growth from her [XXX], she has persistent left hip discomfort caused by [XXX] and [XXX] a [XXX] of the shoulder, and an [XXX] tear.[21] Consequently, she has severe pain in her [XXX] and restricted [XXX] of her [XXX]. She is undergoing [XXX], and requires ongoing diagnostic testing for other issues.\n[23] While the objective documentation suggests that the Ministry of Public Health and Sanitation provides free primary health care, with a focus on preventative care for all, \u201cpublic hospitals lack doctors, nurses, drugs, and other medical necessities, and a recently introduced medical insurance program is not accessible to low income earners or the unemployed.\u201d[22]Further, considering the objective evidence regarding mental health services in Kenya, item 6.2 of the NDP states that the topic of mental health is taboo in Kenya and not seen as a medical or social problem that can be treated.[23] Item 5.5 indicates that mental health \u201cservices are \u2018sparse\u2019 and are not covered by general health insurance.\u201d[24] While this may be a generalized problem amongst the poor throughout the country, the IFA requires the claimant to live away from her social and family network in [XXX] while caring for her young son, which is an additional hardship as an older, single parent, without a stable source of income, struggling to manage her own [XXX] health. It is the claimant\u2019s particular circumstances that suggest that an IFA would be unreasonable for her and detrimental to her well-being, particularly when considering her employment and housing options.\nEmployment is precarious, unstable, and difficult for the claimant to obtain in the IFA[24] The objective evidence in the NDP, Item 5.5 indicates that women face discrimination in accessing credit and they are concentrated in the informal sector, which is characterized by low wages, menial jobs that are available erratically, and a reliance on referrals through one\u2019s social or informal networks, which exposes women to a high risk of abuse and violence.\n[25] Other than her elderly uncle, the claimant\u2019s network is non-existent in Eldoret, placing her in a vulnerable position as a woman who is new to the city, and exposed to gender-based discrimination, ethnic discrimination, and sexual violence.[25] Further, Item 5.5 states that widows may engage in sex-work to make a living in Nairobi[26] and, as a lone-parent undertaking forced re-location to an IFA, the claimant is similarly situated to widows in her vulnerability to life\u00ad threatening or degrading work to support her son and herself because, like the widow, she also does not have a husband.\n[26] The claimant has completed seven years of primary school only. With this level of education, her previous work history consisted of street vending, domestic work, and agricultural labour, each of which provided a meagre unstable income. In Eldoret, the most accessible income-generating activity for the claimant, given the limitations of her physical condition and age, is street vending. The objective information from the NDP, Item 2.1, suggests that street vending places women at risk of daily harassment and abuse. According to a study of street vendors in Nairobi, \u201charassment was the main mode of interaction between street vendors and authorities,\u201d demands for bribes by police amounted to three to eight percent of a vendor\u2019s income, and sexual abuse were common.[27] Although this information pertains to the country\u2019s capital, it is not unreasonable to think: that the harassment, corruption, and abuse would extend to vending conditions for women in other cities and towns as the NDP refers to \u201cwidespread impunity\u201d[28] for gender-based violence.\n[27] Considering the severity of her [XXX], a return to the conditions that precipitated her abusive relationship might worsen her condition. The claimant\u2019s history of violence at the hands of her child\u2019s father began while she was a street vendor, and continued even though she tried to move within Mombasa so he could not find her. The [XXX] assessment referred to her feeling \u201cdehumanized, helpless, powerless, and terrified for her life\u201d[29] in Kenya and in Saudi Arabia, and \u201cextreme distrust of others\u201d. By contrast, the very act of street vending requires one to engage with strangers and, according to the NDP, to cope on a daily basis with intimidation and abuse, which is completely incompatible with her [XXX] health. On a balance of probabilities, the panel finds that the claimant would face destitution in the IFA resulting from irregular employment and employment conditions that may be harmful to her health.\nDifficulty accessing appropriate housing[28] Based on her irregular and limited income, afforded by her education, age, and status as a single-parent, the claimant would also have difficulty finding appropriate housing for her and her son. With respect to the objective documentary evidence, NDP Item 5.5 states that more than half of Nairobi\u2019s residents live in \u201cinformal settlements\u201d, where women represent 46 percent of the population of slum-dwellers, and women who arrive to the city can generally only afford informal housing.[30] The claimant alleged that she would not be able to rely on her elderly uncle to support her again; the claimant does not own property, she does not stand to inherit, and her income is likely to be precarious, so she would likely fall into the category of the urban poor if she were to re-locate internally. The objective evidence suggests that women residing in informal settlements as sole-providers, \u201clive hand to mouth, putting together the money and food needed for the family from a range of sources, including money given by churches, cooking and selling food, trading in petty items, begging or scavenging, carrying loads at construction sites or engaging in sex work\u201d.[31]\n[29] The UK Home Office notes, \u201cIn general, where the threat is from non-state agents, internal relocation to another area of Kenya is likely to be reasonable, depending on the nature and origin of the threat, and the individual circumstances of the person. Women and girls face discrimination and restrictions in their social and economic rights, and may find relocation more difficult than men.\u201d[32] Moreover, \u201cwomen with no support network and without any accompanying family members may find it unreasonable to relocate\u201d.[33] On a balance of probabilities, the claimant would face a high risk of housing instability and homelessness.\n[30] The documented challenges of employment, and housing upon relocating, and the claimant\u2019s [XXX] symptoms of[XXX] and difficulty trusting others, in combination with her age, status as a lone parent, lack of social or kinship network, level of education, and limited work history, make it objectively unreasonable and unduly harsh to require the claimant to start over in a new part of Kenya, where she would continue to live in intense fear.\n[31] Although the courts have set a high bar for finding a proposed IFA to be unreasonable, the panel finds that this bar has been met in the claimant\u2019s specific situation. This analysis of the appropriateness of the IFA is linked to the Gender Guidelines and applied to the particular case of this Kenyan woman to consider how she would be affected in her own circumstances. The claimant would face significant hardship in finding employment and housing. Without employment, the claimant would face poverty. The objective evidence is clear that people in poverty face significant issues when accessing healthcare, and the claimant has demonstrated her need for both medical and psychological treatment. As the test for an IFA fails on the second prong, the panel finds there is no viable IFA for the claimant anywhere in Kenya.\n[32] Considering that the claimant has been found to be credible, and that there is no IFA for her, the panel finds that she has established a well-founded fear of persecution under section 96 of the IRPA.\nCONCLUSION\n[33] The panel has considered all of the evidence and has determined that there is a serious possibility that the claimant would be persecuted in her country of nationality due to her Membership in a Particular Social Group, women.\n[34] The panel finds that the claimant is a Convention refugee, pursuant to Section 96 of the IRPA; therefore, the claim for protection is accepted.\n[1] Exhibit 2.\n[2] Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 4: Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution, September 1996 (the Gender Guidelines).\n[3] Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 8: Procedures With Respect to Vulnerable Persons Appearing Before the IRB, amended December 2012 (the Vulnerable Persons Guideline).\n[4] Exhibit 8.\n[5] Ibid.\n[6] Exhibit 1.\n[7] Exhibit 6, p 11.\n[8] Ibid., p 1.\n[9] Exhibit 6, pp 18-24.\n[10] Exhibit 10.\n[11] Exhibit 3, KEN \u2013 31 January 2020 \u2013 2.1, p 33.\n[12] Exhibit 1.\n[13] Exhibit 3, KEN \u2013 31 January 2020 \u2013 2.1, p 34.\n[14] Ibid., Item \u2013 5.3 p 18.\n[15] Ibid.\n[16] Ibid., Item \u2013 2.1, p 34.\n[17] Ibid.\n[18] Ibid.\n[19] Exhibit 8.\n[20] Exhibit 6, pp 41-42.\n[21] Ibid., pp 25-33.\n[22] Exhibit 3, KEN \u2013 31 January 2020 \u2013 5.5, p 7.\n[23] Ibid., Item \u2013 6.2, p 5.\n[24] Ibid., Item \u2013 5.5, p 8.\n[25] Ibid., p 5.\n[26] Ibid. p 6.\n[27] Ibid., Item \u2013 2.1, p 48.\n[28] Ibid., Item \u2013 5.5, p7.\n[29] Exhibit 8.\n[30] Ken \u2014 31 January 2020 \u2014 5.5, p 3.\n[31] Ibid., p 5.\n[32] Ibid., Item \u2013 1.7, p 13.\n[33] Ibid., Item 1.4, p 7.\n\n",

Can you pronounce your daughter\u2019s name for me, [XXX]?\n[2] Claimant: [XXX].\n[3] Member: Thank you.\n[4] Citizens of China who seek refugee protection pursuant to Sections 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. This decision is being rendered from the Bench and a written form of the reasons may be edited. I find that you are Convention refugees, I find you have Nexus to the Convention for religion as Christians.\n[5] With respect to the allegations you provided a comprehensive Basis of Claim narrative. To summarize you are a Christian and have been since 2017. You attended an underground church in China weekly since that time. Your church was raided [XXX] 2018 at Sunday service and the leader was taken into custody. The PSB took down your name and threatened you. Your family was called to pick you up and they too were threatened when they arrived.\n[6] On [XXX] 2018, three neighborhood committee officers went to your home and conducted a re-education program. They also threatened that if you attempted to attend church again that there would be severe consequences. Your family attempted to convince you to stop going to church but as you were not willing to do so it was agreed that you and your daughter would leave.\n[7] You engaged the services of a Snakehead, applied for a U.S. visa and left China on [XXX]. You and your daughter flew though Hawaii then Seattle and then drove to the Canadian border. You made your claim shortly after arriving. You fear returning to China because you cannot practice your faith without being targeted by the PSB.\n[8] With respect to your identities, your identities were established by your testimony as well as the documents filed including copies of your passport.\n[9] Your credibility was determinative in your claim and I found you to be a credible witness today.\n[10] While I had some concerns regarding the fact that you lied in the past in an attempt to obtain a Canadian visa, and again in the application for the US visa, as well as to US immigration officials at the interview. I found that these concerns were not determinative given the overall credibility of your testimony and the other evidence you provided.\n[11] You\u2019ve expressed a sincere Christian faith and a commitment to practice, as well as a desire to continue to raise your daughter in the Christian faith. It is an important part of your family life which you could not continue to engage in if were to return to China. This is supported by the documents you filed including your letters of support.\n[12] I found persuasive your testimony with respect to why you could not attend a State sanctioned church. Including that it places State above God which is a violation of the first Commandment, and also the importance of spreading the Gospel for which you stated is a mission given by Christ. And that you continue to engage in spreading the Gospel since coming to Canada.\n[13] Regarding state protection and availability of an internal flight alternative, I find that it is the State authorities whom you fear. You\u2019ve been warned by State officials, have in fact undergone re-education during which you were told if you practiced again you would be severely punished. I accept that you are at heightened risk in the context of the current country conditions given this.\n[14] I also find that there is no Internal flight alternative given the State officials are the persons targeting you. I understand that the NDP documents are mixed with respect to the risk in China but for the more recent NDP as noted by your counsel references a change in circumstances, including an increase in the targeting of Christians more recently and this has taken place in your home province. Given your particular circumstances and your previous history with police contact which I found credible, I believe that if you were to return there is more than a mere possibility you would be targeted again, especially given your commitment to spreading the Gospel.\n[15] Similarly, I find the inability for your daughter to be raised in a Christian faith which you testified she has embraced herself, amounts to persecution. As noted by counsel, the country condition documents indicate that minors are specifically forbidden from attending churches or from receiving any religious information. In that respect your choice to raise your daughter in the Christian faith would itself be a risk.\n[16] Based on the evidence that you provided today as well as the country documents, I find your fear of persecution in China to be objectively well founded.\n[17] I conclude that you are both Convention refugees and I accept your claims.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n",

When you do get the written reasons for your case, the written form of these reasons will no longer be edited for spelling, syntax and grammar. However, I have, I want to reassure you that I have considered all the applicable case law and the documentary evidence which I have before me and although there may be some grammatical mistakes, the essence of this decision is what I\u2019m going to say right now.\n[2] The claimant, [XXX], you claim to be a citizen of Sudan and you\u2019re claiming refugee protection pursuant to Sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[3] You were born on [XXX] of [XXX], which makes you [XXX] years old when you came into Canada and therefore, a designated representative has been provided to, the designated representative being [XXX], who was present today as well as assisting you for your claim. In deciding your claim, I\u2019ve considered the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline number 3 with regards to Child Refugee Claimants specifically, unaccompanied minors who have sought protection in Canada.\n[4] This is my determination.\n[5] After considering the totality of the evidence before me, I find that you are a Convention refugee based on your perceived political opinion for the following reasons.\nAllegations\n[6] Your allegations were set out in your Basis of Claim form, which is Exhibit number 2, which today was amended to also include the designated representative\u2019s signature since she was not designated prior to you providing your Basis of Claim form.\n[7] To summarize, you are, you were born as I said in [XXX] in Khartoum, Sudan. You were a high school student in Khartoum and who went to a demonstration in [XXX] 2019 with some neighborhood friends. At that point, you were detained and beaten by the security forces and when you were released, your sister who\u2019s a dentist, helped you with the bruises and your injuries and you went back for another demonstration a week later and at that point afterwards, the police or the security forces came looking for you and you went into hiding. Your parents obtained a visa to United States and you were sent out of Sudan to United States by your parents. You were for two days in United States and you crossed a border into Canada in [XXX] 2019 and you sought protection in Canada as a minor unaccompanied claimant.\nANALYSIS\n[8] Your identity. Your identity as a national and a citizen of Sudan is established, on a balance of probabilities, by your testimony and the supporting documentation, specifically, your passport which was seized by CBSA when you entered Canada. I also had some issues with regards to your age, which I will talk about in the credibility section.\n[9] However, I find that you have on a balance of probability, established who you say you are.\n[10] As for, as credibility is concerned, I have used the Child Guidelines with regards to assessing your credibility. There\u2019s a presumption of truth unless there are inconsistencies, contradictions and omissions in your written evidence and I did not find that, except there was a very minor problem with regards to your birth certificate. There was a discrepancy about your age, the translated document said that you were born in [XXX], however, I find that you provided a reasonable explanation. I did have Madam interpreter here also look at the original document, which according to her it isn\u2019t [XXX], that it was translated by mistake as to being, you being born in [XXX].\n[11] I found you to also be credible for a young person. I did use, as I said, the Gender gui-, sorry, the Child Guidelines, we had many conferences. I found it, the DR to be very helpful in trying to provide evidence with regards to your identity and your relatives here. You also, there was corroborating evidence from doctors here and a [XXX] report. I also took into consideration your family and your friends corroborating evidence. I had some family members here in Canada, that was a witness here, [XXX], who\u2019s also a con-, a, a, a, a claimant as well, as I had your friend here who was a witness with regards to going to Sudan and bringing the documentary evidence to Canada for your claim.\n[12] I do note that you have, as a young person, as a minor, you had family here in Canada and that is why you did not ask for protection in United States and that is reasonable tome.\n[13] I find that also your, your own oral testimony and your written testimony to be credible. You did state that you would be, it would be ok that educational documents are available from Khartoum if I needed to have those to be sent to me.\n[14] Therefore, I find that you are a credible witness that, as I stated also there were two witnesses here as well.\n[15] Fear in refugee protection is forward-looking and it\u2019s the perception of the persecutor and I do find that you would be, there would be a reasonable chance of persecution, that you have met the subjective element of, of your claim, that you were perceived to be anti-government if you were to return. The documentary evidence also speaks of massive demonstrations in the last few years in, in Khartoum, that these were led by many young people, there were university students, high school students who also participated in these massive demonstrations. As far as the objective documentary is concerned, I have taken into consideration Exhibit number 3 which is the NDP with regards to the DOS report, there are many Human Rights Watch reports, Amnesty International and UN documents with regards to what is happening in Sudan. And Sudan has been under an oppressive government for many years, although there have been some changes in the last year, I find that based on the objective documentary evidence, as well as what you did testify to that these changes are not durable or substantive. I say this because although al-Bashir was overthrown in April 2019, the military in June 2019 attacked and killed peaceful demonstrators that were camping outside of the military and the court houses, this is what you said as well as what I have in the documentary evidence. I also find that the documentary evidence talk about the interim government which is headed by someone who has been involved in genocides in Darfur, specifically I\u2019m speaking about Hemetti NISS is still monitoring and pursuing those who are deemed to be anti-government. Although you are a young person, I have to look at the future, you have some future plans that you articulated that includes being able to live freely and with purpose and being able to, to live a life in that, does not include being oppressed. I do find that you\u2019re too young to be expected to give eloquent, I guess your future plans but I am, as I said I\u2019m using the, the Child Guidelines. Having said that, I find that your evidence is, it should not be deemed to be the same as an adult. There\u2019s some things you didn\u2019t know about. For example, with regards to surrounding your past experiences and your fear of future pers-, persecution, I do find that the documentary evidence specifically, psychological report states what you fear, what you have experienced previously and I find that using the, the Guidelines, that there might be some gaps with regards to who you came here to stay with but I don\u2019t think that is central to the claim.\n[16] Therefore, I find that you have provided credible evidence, that the objective and the subjective elements have been met.\n[17] As far as state protection is concerned, state protection would not be reasonably forthcoming in this particular case, since the State is the agent of persecution.\n[18] I also find that you do not have a viable internal flight alternative, since the State is in control of all of its territories in Sudan and also you are a minor claimant and you would not be able to live on your own without your family in Sudan.\n[19] I do find that you, you, one of your other fears, that is forward-looking, would be that you may be forced to go and serve in the military because military service is compulsory in, in Sudan.\n[20] Therefore, based on the foregoing analysis, I find that you are a Convention refugee and I accept your claim.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n",

Saleem Akhtar\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Jonathan E Fedder\nCountry: Uganda\nRPD Number: TB9-04769\nAssociated RPD Number(s):\nATIP Number: A-2021-00945\nATIP Pages: 000140-000147\nREASONS FOR DECISION\nINTRODUCTION\n[1] The principal claimant, [XXX], and the associate minor claimant, [XXX] (collectively called claimants) are citizens of Uganda and seek refugee protection, pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (the \u201cAct\u201c)[1]. The principal claimant who is the biological mother of the minor claimant has been appointed as the designated representative for him.\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] The allegations of this claim are found in the claimants\u2019 Basis of Claim (BOC) Forms.[2] In short, the principal claimant alleges that she was physically, emotionally and psychologically abused and threatened in Uganda and fears persecution to her as well as to her son, by her former common-law partner, [XXX] (AB) and his family, should they return to Uganda. AB is the biological father of the minor claimant in this matter.\n[3] The principal claimant further alleges and believes that there is no adequate state protection available to them in Uganda, nor any place for them to live in safety in Uganda due to AB\u2019s official position serving as a member of the Special Forces Command providing security to the President of Uganda.[3]\nDETERMINATION\n[4] I find [XXX] and [XXX], to be Convention refugees, within the meaning of section 96 of the Act. The reasons of my decision are as follows:\nFACTS AND ANALYSIS\n[5] In arriving at this decision, I considered the principal claimant\u2019s oral testimony, documentary evidence[4], the counsel\u2019s oral submissions, and the relevant portions of the documents contained in the National Documentation Package (NDP) pertaining to Uganda[5].\n[6] In addition, I considered and applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guidelines on Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution and Guidelines on Child Refugee Claimants.\nThe Claimants\u2019 Identity and Country of Reference Established\n[7] I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the principal claimant has established her personal identity and her country of reference (Uganda) as well as that of the associate minor claimant. I have relied on certified copies of their Ugandan passports[6], and the oral sworn testimony of the principal claimant.\nNexus Established\n[8] I find there is a nexus between what the principal claimant fears and one of the Convention grounds, specifically, as a woman who has experienced domestic abuse and persecution, she is a member of a particular social group because of her gender. I also find there is a link: between what the minor claimant fears as associated risk and one of the Convention grounds, specifically, by virtue of being a minor dependant of the principal claimant who is his biological mother. Therefore, these claims have been assessed under section 96 of the Act.\nThe Principal Claimant was Credible\n[9] Generally, a claimant\u2019s evidence given under oath is presumed to be truthful unless there are valid reasons to doubt its veracity. The determination regarding whether or not evidence is credible is made on a balance of probabilities.\n[10] In this case, I found the principal claimant\u2019s testimony made on her personal behalf as well as on that of the associate minor claimant mostly credible about the threats and persecution they suffered at the hands of AB and his family. Over all, the principal claimant\u2019s testimony was consistent with the BOC, and corroborated by the supporting documents. She testified in a straightforward manner about their fears without embellishment, and there were no inconsistencies that went to negatively impact the core of the claim. Her answers were generally spontaneous. She provided details and expanded the conversation as it related to her relationship with AB and the abuse she and her son sustained at the hands of AB and his family.\n[11] The principal claimant was able to provide details about how her relationship started and progressed over-time, how she initially liked and enjoyed her relationship with AB including activities she and AB did together in Uganda. However, the relationship between the principal claimant and AB\u2019s family has always been one of mistrust, having divergent views about how she and her minor son should be treated in terms of Mukyankole Muhima clan traditions. She belongs to Muganda tribe. She testified she did not know that the Muhima people, particularly the elite, do not mix with other Ugandans. This is more important and truer when it comes to marriages, as they generally do not marry outside the tribe.\nThe Claimants\u2019 fear of persecution\n[12] In her BOC as well as in her sworn oral testimony, the principal claimant testified that she and AB met in 2010 while both of them were studying at the [XXX] University in Uganda. After learning that she was pregnant, she proposed to him for formal marriage, which he, initially, resisted, however, she convinced him to get married. AB did not invite his family to this marriage because the principal claimant was not from his tribe. The principal claimant testified that, at the time when she met him and became pregnant, she did not know that AB belonged to Muhima tribe and that he was a member of the Special Forces Command, serving the President of Uganda. After the birth of their son, both the principal claimant and AB started living together. Despite that, AB never formally introduced her to his family, as his wife, because he was afraid that his family would not accept her due to her belonging to a different tribe.\n[13] The principal claimant testified that when AB\u2019s family learned about the relationship between her and AB, they expressed their shock. People of Muhima tribe are particular about protecting their bloodline, and do not approve of a Muhimi man producing children with a non\u00ad Muhimi woman. AB started distancing himself from the claimants. In [XXX] 2014, the claimant learned that AB had married a Muhimi woman. When she confronted him, he became violent. He physically assaulted her and hit her with a belt and pushed her into a cupboard, causing back injury. She reported the abuse to the Nalya Police Station. They did not help her. They advised her to go back home and resolve the matter within the family. However, they promised to call him and speak to him, which she believed, they never did.\n[14] The principal claimant testified that, in 2015, AB\u2019s attitude and behaviour towards her and their son became markedly negative and abusive. He demanded that their son should not carry surname \u201cBIRARO\u201d because AB no longer wanted to recognize him as his son due to his \u2018impure Muhima heritage\u2019. The principal claimant objected to that, which resulted in AB\u2019s more physical and emotional abuse towards the claimants. He would beat up, punch and kick her frequently. On one of such occasions, when she sustained more visible injuries, she went back to the Nalya Police Station, hoping that after seeing physical injuries resulting from the physical abuse by AB, police officials would help her and provide protection. But, their response was \u2013 go back and resolve the matter within the family. For the next more than two years, she sustained physical and emotional abuse of various degrees. She again approached police in May 2017, and sought protection. But, this time, too, she did not get any assistance from police. In fact, one of the police officials mocked saying \u201cCan\u2019t you see that you are Muganda and he is Muhima.\u201d\n[15] In early July 2018, AB told the claimant to leave his home as early as possible. Later, on July 21, 2018, he came home agitated and asked why she was still there at his home. He also accused her of damaging the property. He assaulted, punched and kicked her, causing damage to her spleen. In August 2018, she packed up her personal stuff and moved to an Airbnb. A few days later, when she went to pickup her son from the daycare, she was told that one of AB\u2019s friend, whom the claimant also knew, had taken the child on AB\u2019s command. The claimant was upset at this \u2018abduction\u2019. However, she successfully managed to retrieve the son against the wishes of AB.\n[16] After realizing that her son could be abducted and harmed and that police would not protect the claimants against powerful AB, the claimant, along with her son, decided to leave Uganda for Canada, for safety reasons. Upon arrival in Canada, the principal claimant filed a refugee protection claim for herself as well as for the minor claimant.\n[17] I noted the claimant\u2019s failure to seek asylum in 2017 and 2018 when she visited the United States and Germany respectively. This issue was put to the claimant who testified that she did not seek asylum because, on both occasions, she had come to attend work-related conferences and that her son was not with her on both occasions because she could not get visa for her son. She testified she thought and wanted to do file refugee protection claim in the U.S. or in Germany, but, she could not imagine leaving her son in Uganda at the mercy of AB and his family who were already bent upon hurting him and eliminating him.\n[18] I find the claimant has adequately explained failure to claim asylum in the United States of America. I find her explanation reasonable within the given circumstances, and, therefore, will not draw any negative credibility inference regarding subjective fear.\nSupporting Documents\n[19] In support of her claim and that of the minor claimant, the principal claimant produced several documents, including identity documents, police reports, medical reports from Uganda and psychological assessment and medical reports from Canada, affidavits from friends in Uganda, letters of support from Ugandan and Canadian friends including letters from the minor claimant\u2019s teachers in Uganda, a letter of support from the Canadian Centre for Victims of Torture (CCVT), some relevant emails and text messages, some relevant family photos, and country conditions[7]. These documents mostly corroborate the claimant\u2019s narrative. On a balance of probabilities, I find the claimant\u2019s testimony as well as the documents submitted to be credible.\nSubjective Fear\n[20] The principal claimant gave details as to how badly she and the minor claimant were treated, emotionally and psychologically, by AB. She testified they were living in Uganda under constant fear of harassment, persecution and death threats. Her son had to stop attending school due to constant fear of being abducted and harmed, may even be killed. She further testified she was not helped by the police, despite her reaching out to them multiple times for protection.\n[21] I find the principal claimant\u2019s testimony on her personal behalf as well as on behalf of the associate minor claimant, credible in relation to the core of the claim. I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the abuse and death threats occurred, as alleged. I also find there is more than a mere possibility of persecution against the claimants at the hands of AB and his family, based on their clan influence as well as AB\u2019s high position in the government whereby they could threaten and harm the claimants with no fear of punishment by the State. Hence, I find the claimants have established their subjective fear.\nObjective Basis Established\n[22] The NDP sources for Uganda note that domestic violence is widespread in Uganda, and offenders are rarely prosecuted[8]. The same sources note the existence of hatred and violence based on clan differences, particularly, in matters of marriages.\n[23] The NDP sources add that Ugandan society generally does not consider domestic abuse a crime, and police officers often do not consider it a serious offence, rather, they treat it as a family matter and generally advise the victim to resolve the matter within the family. This is all the more so when the agent of persecution is influential, resourceful and connected with the government, as is the case in this claim. These sources also indicate that the police do not, generally, interfere in clan mattes. They consider that such matters should be resolved by clan leaders, based on their traditions.\n[24] I find the claimants have established objective basis for their claims. Hence, I find the claimants has established a well-founded fear of persecution against them in Uganda.\nAdequate State Protection Not Available\n[25] I find that the principal claimant has rebutted the presumption of state protection with clear and convincing evidence. The NDP for Uganda states that the police often treat domestic abuse as a family matter, and do not consider it a serious offence[9]. Similarly, the police leave the clan differences to be resolved by clan chiefs. Despite such an attitude of the police, the claimant asked for police protection, at least three times, but she did not receive any protection.\n[26] I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the state is unable or unwilling to protect the claimants, particularly considering that the principal agent of persecution (AB) is a high official in the government, connected with the Special Forces Command who provide security to the President of Uganda. As such, I find that, on a balance of probabilities, adequate state protection would not be available to the claimants.\nNo Viable Internal Flight Alternative (IFA) Available\n[27] The available country conditions\u2019 evidence as per the NDP for Uganda and the claimant\u2019s sworn testimony are consistent about the prevalence of corruption among police services in Uganda. This would make AB who is influential and well-connected with the government to corrupt the police forces, and thus, on a balance of probabilities, diminish the viability of any IFA for the claimants. As such, I find the claimants have established that there is more than a mere possibility of persecution against them, and that, on a balance of probabilities, there would not be a viable IFA for the claimants anywhere in Uganda.\nCONCLUSION\n[28] I find there is a serious possibility that the claimants would face persecution, should they return to Uganda.\n[29] Having considered the totality of the evidence, I find that the principal claimant, [XXX] and the associate minor claimant, [XXX], are Convention refugees, pursuant to section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[30] Therefore, I accept these claims.\n[1] Immigration and Refugee protection Act, S.C. 2001, c.27, as amended, and package of information from the referring CIC\/CBSA (pages un-numbered).\n[2] Exhibit 2, Basis of Claim (BOC).\n[3] Exhibits 2, 5 to 7.\n[4] Ibid.\n[5] Exhibit 3, NDP for Uganda, June 28 29, 2019.\n[6] Exhibit 1, Package of information from the referring CIC\/CBSA (pages un-numbered).\n[7] Exhibits 1, 2, 5 to 7.\n[8] Exhibit 3, NDP for Uganda, June 28, 2019, items 2 and 5.\n[9] Ibid.\n\n",

The claimant, [XXX] is a citizen of Nigeria and claims a well-founded fear of persecution based on her sexual orientation as a lesbian. She additionally fears persecution from her relatives based on her gender, as they\u2019re attempting to force her into prostitution. In assessing your claim, I have considered Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9 proceedings before the IRB involving sexual orientation and gender identity and expression.\n[2] Interpreter: According to Section 9, right?\n[3] Member: I\u2019ve considered the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9. Do you mind actually if you-, can you do simultaneous interpretation, if you don\u2019t mind?\n[4] Counsel: At the back\n[5] Member: So, if you can flip your microphone and just.\n[6] Counsel: Thank you. (inaudible) here you can sit. Just talking to her (inaudible)\n[7] Interpreter: Oh ok, ok, ok, ok.\n[8] Counsel: Sit beside her\n[9] Interpreter: Oh ok, ok\n[10] MEMBER: Thank you. I\u2019ve also considered the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 4 on gender-related claims.\n[11] I find that you are a Convention refugee pursuant to Section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[12] The details of your claim are documented in your Basis of Claim form and were elaborated upon by you orally during the hearing.\n[13] In summary, you fear persecution in Nigeria at the hands of the government and society at large, due to your sexual orientation as a lesbian woman.\n[14] Your identity as a national of Nigeria has been established on a balance of probabilities through your passport on file at Exhibit 1.\n[15] There was an issue in that you transited through the US in [XXX] 2018 with a false US passport and there is therefore no biometric match despite this trip. There is also no objective evidence of your stay in the United States.\n[16] Nevertheless, I find that you have established that you do not have any status in the United States through your co-, spontaneous and consistent testimony.\n[17] With regard to credibility, I have found you overall to be a credible witness. You testified in a straightforward manner and there were no inconsistencies that were not reasonably explained. Given that I have found you to be a credible witness, I also accept what you have alleged in support of your claim, including the following.\n[18] You first became aware of your sexual orientation when you were growing up in Nigeria. You had two same-sex relationships in Nigeria. You were not able to express your sexual orientation freely in Nigeria. They, your relatives attempted to force you into prostitution in 2016. You were assaulted when you refused. You presented documentary evidence in support of your claim, including a medical report confirming your assault in 2016, letters of support from your ex-girlfriends in Nigeria, letters of support from your brother and mother in Nigeria, a letter of support from your previous employer in Nigeria and documentation from the 519 program and the Black Coalition for AIDS Prevention.\n[19] I did have some concerns about your alleged relationship in Canada, as your testimony had inconsistencies with regards to the progression of your relationship. I also had concerns about the lack of any documentation to corroborate this one year relationship.\n[20] While I do draw a negative inference from these inconsistencies and from the lack of documentation, I do find that you credibly established that you were in same-sex relationships in Nigeria. I therefore find that this concern is not determinative.\n[21] Having regard to all the evidence, the claimant established, on a balance of probabilities, her lesbian orientation.\n[22] The most recent Department of State report on human rights practices in Nigeria, at Item 2.1 indicates that, human rights issues included crimes involving violence targeting LGBTI persons and the criminalization of status in same-sex conduct based on sexual orientation and gender identity. At Items 6.11 of the NDP, the Comprehensive Immigration and Refugee report on the situation of sexual and gender minorities in Nigeria, caver the period between 2014 and 2018 indicates the following. Sources report that since Nigeria passed the SSMPA in 2014, which hads been used as a tool by authorities and society to act against sexual minorities, including to carry out human rights violations, such as torture, sexual violence, arbitrary detention, violations of due process rights and extortion. Sources indicate that Nigerian society generally disapproves of sexual minorities. Sources indicate that sexual minorities are generally not accepted by family members. According to sources, labels such as gay, lesbian and transgender and bi-sexual are used in Nigeria often with derision or in a derogatory manner.\n[23] Sexual minorities do not or are reluctant to openly identify as sexual minorities because it is dangerous for them, as they may face violence or be ostracized. Both les-, both, both bi-sexuality and homosexuality are viewed negatively and neither bi-sexuals nor homosexuals are accepted in Nigerian society. According to sources, sexual minorities are subject to mob attacks or violence, vigilante groups have reportedly targeted and attack sexual minorities. The documentary evidence establishes an objective basis for this claim. The same IRB report at, Item 6.11 of the NDP indicates the following. Sources indicate that police raid gatherings of sexual minorities and arrest them often. Police extorts sexual minorities when they are arrested or detained. According to sources, state protection is not available to sexual minorities in Nigeria, given that homosexual acts are illegal. The SOGIE Guidelines indicate as follows. The criminalization of the existence or behavior of individuals with diverse SOGIE, may create a climate of impunity for perpetrators of violence, and normalize acts of blackmail, sexual abuse, violence and extortion by state and non-state actors.\n[24] Based on the claimant\u2019s personal circumstances, as well the-, as the objective country documentation, I find that adequate state protection would not be available to her in Nigeria.\n[25] The claimant has rebutted the presumption of state protection.\n[26] The Response to Information Request, at Item 6.1 of the NDP indicates that, the intolerant attitude towards homosexuals is prevalent throughout Nigeria. The SOGIE Guideline states that it is well established in law, that an IFA is not viable if an individual, with a diverse SOGIE, must conceal their SOGIE in order to live in that location.\n[27] I therefore find that you face a serious per-, possibility of persecution in Nigeria based on your, based on your sexual orientation.\n[28] In conclusion, I, I find that [XXX] faces a serious possibility of persecution in Nigeria on the basis of her sexual orientation. Therefore, she is a Convention refugee and I accept her claim.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n",

He claims refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (\u201cIRPA\u201d).[1]\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] The claimant\u2019s allegations are found in his Basis of Claim (\u201cBOC\u201d) form[2] and amended BOC forms.[3] In summary, the claimant fears persecution by the Ghanaian police and his community, particularly in the form of mob violence, on account of his sexual orientation as a bisexual man. The claimant fears that if he returns to Ghana he will be persecuted and\/or killed.\nDETERMINATION\n[3] The panel finds that the claimant has established that he faces a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground, namely, his membership in a particular social group \u2013 individuals with non-heteronormative sexual orientations \u2013 upon return to Ghana.\n[4] In making this determination, the panel has considered the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9: Proceedings Before the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada Involving Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression (\u201cSOGIE\u201d).[4]\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[5] The identity of the claimant has been established on a balance of probabilities through the certified true copy of his Ghanaian passport that was seized by the Minister,[5] in addition to a copy of his Ghanaian birth certificate.[6]\nCredibility\n[6] When a claimant swears that certain facts are true, this creates a presumption that they are true unless there is a valid reason to doubt their veracity.\n[7] Having reviewed all the evidence, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant identifies as bisexual and fears persecution because of his sexual orientation if he returns to Ghana. While the panel also had credibility concerns about other parts of the claimant\u2019s evidence, those concerns did not outweigh the allegations that were proven on a balance of probabilities. Given that the claimant has credibly made out key allegations and established a subjective fear of persecution, the other concerns are not determinative.\nThe claimant identifies as a bisexual man\n[8] The claimant testified credibly about his relationship with his long-time same sex partner,\nW.Y. The claimant met W.Y. when he was 9 years old through their mutual love for soccer, and grew up playing soccer together; they were the closest of friends. Eventually, their relationship became intimate when the claimant turned 15 years old. The claimant testified that even after their relationship became sexual, it took time for the two men to verbally acknowledge the nature of their relationship and express their feelings to one another. The claimant said that he was shy and needed to build up courage to tell W.Y. that he had feelings for him. When W.Y. said those feelings were reciprocal, the claimant was overwhelmed with happiness. The claimant submitted photos of himself and W.Y. attending community weddings together and in their soccer jerseys in support of his claim.[7] The claimant testified to the content of these photos spontaneously and clearly. The panel finds the photographic evidence of their relationship credible.\n[9] The claimant spontaneously and clearly provided details about his relationship with W.Y. that were not found in his BOC forms. The claimant described W.Y.\u2019s love of dance and music and W.Y.\u2019s unparalleled ability to calm the claimant down and lift his spirits when he was feeling upset. The claimant described a physical and emotional attraction to his partner, and explained that he and W.Y. had a lot in common including their professional involvement in soccer and their religious upbringing. The claimant also testified credibly about the steps he and W.Y. took to hide their relationship, including their carefully timed visits, the claimant\u2019s marriage to a woman, and their use of football\u2019s masculine image in Ghana to hide their sexual orientations.\n[10] Therefore, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant has established that he identifies as a bisexual man and was involved in an intimate relationship with a man in Ghana named W.Y.\nThe claimant has a subjective fear of being persecuted in Ghana on account of his sexual orientation\n[11] The claimant testified spontaneously about his country and community\u2019s views towards homosexuality. When the panel asked the claimant about his upbringing, he explained that he and his family were deeply religious Muslims and there were rules dictating behavioural \u201cdo\u2019s and don\u2019t\u2019s.\u201d When the panel asked the claimant for an example of those \u201cdo\u2019s and don\u2019t\u2019s,\u201d the claimant immediately answered that a \u201cdon\u2019t\u201d includes two men sleeping together. The claimant explained that he was given a religious education as a young man, and learned that the Bible and Quran view male homosexual relationships as blasphemous and punish such behaviour by stoning. While the claimant never personally viewed members of the gay community being persecuted, he heard about instances of mob and police violence against gay people on the radio and in the newspapers. The claimant said that one radio station reported an instance of police violence against a gay individual and the commentators laughed during their reporting and agreed with the police abuse. The claimant added that both Christians and Muslims preached against homosexuality in his community.\n[12] The panel asked the claimant why he did not make a claim for asylum in the United States when he was contracted to [XXX] in [XXX] from [XXX] to [XXX] of 2018.[8] The claimant answered that, during that time, he was on a work visa to [XXX]. He had not experienced any persecution because of his sexuality in Ghana and did not think anyone at home would discover him and W.Y. The claimant added that he did not even know about the concept of \u201casylum\u201d at the time and the thought of seeking that kind of protection did not come to his mind.\n[13] The panel finds this explanation reasonable. In 2018, the claimant was a young man looking to further his [XXX]. He was in love with his same-sex partner in Ghana, had taken steps to hide this relationship from everyone he knew, and did not think he would be discovered. Therefore, the panel does not draw a negative credibility inference with respect to the claimant\u2019s failure to make an asylum claim in the United States during his time in [XXX].\n[14] The panel asked the claimant why he did not make an asylum claim in Chicago upon his arrival there in [XXX] 2018 after fleeing persecution in Ghana. The claimant testified that he was staying with a Ghanaian friend in Chicago, and although he was in the United States he was surrounded by the Ghanaian expatriate community and did not feel safe telling them why he left Ghana. The claimant said that he did not know anything about the formal process of seeking asylum when he arrived in the United States, and his primary objective was to leave Ghana for his personal safety. Once in Chicago, the claimant began researching how to be safe as an individual with a non-heteronormative sexual orientation and he found a Canadian Pride Parade website and reasoned that Canada would protect him. This is the reason he came to Canada for protection.\n[15] The panel finds this explanation reasonable. At the time he fled Ghana, the claimant was a [XXX]-year old man. He testified that he stopped his studies at the age of [XXX] in order to pursue his soccer career. The claimant had no background in law and was not aware of the concept of \u201casylum\u201d until he crossed the Canadian border and border services agents directed him to a lawyer. The claimant testified that he feared for his safety while staying with his friend in the United States because his friend\u2019s community was Ghanaian. For that reason, the claimant did not perceive his situation in the United States as safe and sought refuge approximately two and a half months later in Canada. Given the claimant\u2019s explanation, age, and level of education, the panel does not draw a negative credibility inference with respect to the claimant\u2019s failure to seek asylum during his time in the United States from [XXX] to [XXX] of 2018.\n[16] The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant was so fearful of being persecuted on account of his sexual orientation in Ghana that he did not even feel safe in the United States because he was living among the Ghanaian expatriate community.\n[17] After assessing the claimant\u2019s evidence about how the Ghanaian government and his community treat members of the gay community, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant has a subjective fear of persecution in Ghana on account of his identity as a bisexual man. As a result, this claim is being assessed under s. 96 of the IRPA, and the panel finds the claimant has established a nexus to a convention ground, namely, his membership m a particular social group \u2013 individuals with non-heteronormative sexual orientations.\n[18] While the panel had credibility concerns about how the claimant lost contact with W.Y. and the details surrounding how the claimant\u2019s relationship with W.Y. was discovered, these concerns were insufficient to overcome the findings that the claimant was in a relationship with W.Y. and that he has made out his sexual orientation on a balance of probabilities.\nOBJECTIVE EVIDENCE\n[19] The objective evidence in this case supports the claimant\u2019s allegations.\n[20] Section 104 of the Ghanaian Criminal Code (\u201cthe Code\u201d) criminalizes same-sex conduct between consenting adults, and refers to such conduct as \u201cunnatural carnal knowledge.\u201d Consensual same-sex intimacy with an individual over 16 years old is categorised as a misdemeanour, with a sentence of up to 3 years\u2019 imprisonment.[9]\n[21] Prominent Ghanaian politicians have voiced their opposition to and disdain for the gay community. In February and July of 2017, the Speaker of Parliament, Professor Mike Ocquaye, referred to homosexuality as an \u201cabomination\u201d and called for stricter laws against same-sex conduct.[10] During a radio interview in April 2018, the Second Deputy Speaker of Parliament, Alban Bagbin, said that \u201chomosexuality is worse than [an] atomic bomb.\u201d[11] In March 2020, an organizer for the main opposition party in Ghana, the National Democratic Congress, said: \u201cHomosexuality is a disease. In veterinary [medicine] you don\u2019t have to condone homosexuality; you have to kill all animals that attempt same-sex mating. Why should we humans do that?\u201d.[12]\n[22] Homophobic rhetoric is not limited to national and local government officials \u2013 it pervades Catholic, Evangelical, Islamic, and traditional religious institutions as well as Ghanaian media outlets. While these forces, along with the criminalization of same-sex activity in Ghana, rarely lead to prosecution of gay individuals, they contribute to a climate of discrimination, violence, arrests, threats, and punishment of the gay community both in public and private settings.[13]\n[23] With respect to persecution of gay individuals in the private setting, the National Documentation Package (\u201cNDP\u201d) for Ghana, Item 6.2, documents numerous instances of parents disowning their children and forcing them out of their family homes upon discovering their sexual orientation. This aligns with the claimant\u2019s evidence that, since his sexual orientation became known in his community, the claimant has lost contact with his parents due to their anger towards him for \u201cshaming\u201d his family due to his sexual orientation. Counsel submitted country documentation from February 2020, found in Exhibit 7, wherein the Ashanti Region Chief Imam, Sheikh Muumin Abdul Haroun, described homosexuality as an \u201cevil that must not be countenanced in any way because it is despised by God.\u201d This evidence also aligns with the claimant\u2019s testimony about the deep-seated homophobia in his masque and Muslim community.\n[24] NDP Item 6.2 documents instances of violence perpetrated against members or perceived members of the gay community. In January 2016, a mob of students at a high school in Kumasi, the claimant\u2019s home town, attempted to lynch three male students who were accused of engaging in homosexuality. The attackers were armed with clubs, machetes, and stones. The school responded by expelling the three intended victims. According to NDP Item 6.6, in August 2019 police briefly detained a young man reporting a robbery because the man mentioned he was gay.[14] In August 2014, a mob in Walewale threatened to lynch a 21-year old male student because he was gay. Police responded by arresting the intended victim.[15] An article submitted by counsel notes that, as recently as October 2020, a mob stormed an area of Accra armed with machetes, stones, and sticks in search of a suspected gay person, and the mob leader said: \u201cWe want to make Ghana a hell for gay practitioners and their supporters.\u201d[16]\n[25] The panel therefore finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant\u2019s subjective fear of persecution in Ghana on account of his identity as a bisexual man has an objective basis, and is well-founded.\nSTATE PROTECTION\n[26] There is a presumption that a state can protect its citizens unless the state is in a situation of complete breakdown. A claimant can rebut this presumption with clear and convincing evidence to the contrary.\n[27] In this case, the agent of persecution is the state because the forward-facing persecution the claimant would face in Ghana is, in part, at the hands of state authorities \u2013 that is, members and supports of the Ghanaian government and police force.\n[28] The NDP reflects mixed evidence with respect to the availability of state protection for members of the gay community. Item 6.6 states that certain individuals in the Ghanaian Police Force have made efforts to protect members of the gay community, such as Assistant Commissioner of Police Jones Blantari.[17] The NDP adds that some gay rights activists have noted that police attitudes towards protecting members of the gay community are slowly changing, \u201cwith community members feeling more comfortable with certain police officers whom they could turn [to] for assistance\u201d [emphasis added].[18]\n[29] However, despite evidence of individual members of the Ghanaian police force making positive efforts to protect members of the gay community, the objective country evidence depicts an overall lack of adequate state protection for members of the gay community in Ghana.\n[30] NDP Item 6.6 indicates that, as recently as 2019, there were reports of police reluctance to investigate claims of assault or violence against members of the gay community. While there were no reported cases of police or government violence against members of the gay community in 2019, the NDP notes that stigma, intimidation, and the attitude of the police toward gay persons were factors in preventing victims from reporting incidents of abuse.[19] Other reports cited instances of members of the gay community being arbitrarily arrested by police when seeking their help, and being subject to extortion as well as sexual and physical abuse by police.[20]\n[31] Based on the claimant\u2019s personal circumstances as well as the objective country documentation, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant has rebutted the presumption of state protection with clear and convincing evidence. As someone who identifies as bisexual, there is no state protection available to the claimant in Ghana.\nINTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE\n[32] The panel has also considered whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for the claimant.\n[33] Given that the state is one of the agents of persecution, that homosexual activity between consenting adults is criminalized in Ghana, and there is no objective evidence that shows the state does not have control over the entire country of Ghana, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant would face a serious possibility of persecution throughout Ghana and therefore a viable internal flight alternative does not exist for him.\nCONCLUSION\n[34] The claimant testified credibly that he identifies as a bisexual man and spent many years in a same sex relationship with a fellow soccer player, W.Y. The claimant also provided reasonable explanations about why he did not make asylum claims in the United States. While the panel had credibility concerns with certain parts of the claimant\u2019s evidence, those concerns did not speak to the heart of the claim and were not sufficient to rebut the presumption of truth in this case.\n[35] Having considered the claimant\u2019s testimony, the supporting evidence presented, and the objective evidence, the panel finds there is a serious possibility that the claimant would face persecution at the hands of the Ghanaian state, its agents, his family, community, and the Ghanian community at large if he returned to Ghana.\n[36] For the aforementioned reasons, the panel concludes that the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to s. 96 IRPA.\n[37] Therefore, the claim is accepted.\n[1] Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27, as amended, sections 96 and 97(1).\n[2] Consolidated List of Documents (CLOD), Exhibit 2.\n[3] CLOD, Exhibits 5, 10.\n[4] Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9: Proceedings Before the IRB Involving Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression.\n[5] CLOD, Exhibit 1\n[6] CLOD, Exhibit 6, p.1.\n[7] CLOD, Exhibit 6, pp. 4-12, 32-33.\n[8] The claimant provided evidence to support his employment as a [XXX] in [XXX] during this time.

Ruthven\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Michael F. Loebach\nCountry: Saudi Arabia\nRPD Number: TB8-23393\nAssociated RPD Number(s):\nATIP Number: A-2021-00945\nATIP Pages: 000120-000125\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: [XXX], also known as [XXX] (phonetics), I have considered your testimony, Sir, as well as the written evidence that was presented in support of your claim and I am ready to render my decision of your claim orally. You are claiming protection pursuant to Section 96 and Subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. The details of your claim are documented in your Basis of Claim Form and its narrative which is found in Exhibit 2 as well as the narrative amendments which are found in Exhibit 7. I find that these amendments are minor and that they add clarifying statements and that they correct spelling differences. I have granted a bit more leeway in spelling differences as the translation of certain letters of the Arabic alphabet may allow numerous English language variations.\n[2] In summary, you fear returning to Saudi Arabia based on your Palestinian nationality. You described in your Basis of Claim Form narrative in Exhibit 2 and Exhibit 7 problems that you faced in numerous facets of your life including schooling, healthcare, and your neighborhood community. You expanded on this written evidence in your testimony this afternoon partially based on these problems your family relocated to Bahrain to ensure that you and your older brother [XXX] (phonetics) would have a better and cheaper access to post-secondary education.\n[3] Your responses in your Basis of Claim Form indicate that your older brother [XXX] (phonetics) made a claim for protection in Canada in early [XXX] 2018, the following month [XXX] 2018 your father informed you that he could no longer provide for tuition and other university expenses in Bahrain due to a deteriorating financial situation on his part. Your testimony elaborated on these circumstances this afternoon.\n[4] I find that you are a convention refugee pursuant to Section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act based on the persecution that you face in Saudi Arabia related to your stateless nationality. You testified that you are not a citizen of any country and you alleged that you are a stateless Palestinian who is born in Saudi Arabia. Your responses to Schedule A in Exhibit 1 indicate that your parents were each born in Saudi Arabia as well and your responses within question 5 of your Basis of Claim Form in Exhibit 2 indicate that both your parents and all of your siblings and your half-sister are also stateless Palestinians.\n[5] I find that the presented Kingdom of Saudi Arabia birth certificate corroborates that you were born in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia on [XXX], it is found in Exhibit 8, in your Basis of Claim Form responses in Exhibit 2 you enumerated that each of your family members are residents of either Saudi Arabia or Canada in the case of your older brother [XXX] (phonetics).\n[6] In support of your stateless nationality claim, you presented your valid Palestinian Authority Passport and your valid Arab Republic of Egypt travel document for Palestinian refugees. The Palestinian Authority Passport is found in Exhibit 1 with a translated copy in Exhibit 8, the Egypt travel document is found in Exhibit 8. I find no reason to doubt the authenticity of either of these documents. Item 1.10 of the Occupied Palestinian Territory National Documentation Package found in Exhibit 3 indicates that the Occupied Palestinian Territory Gaza and the West Bank do not presently meet the criteria for statehood under international law.\n[7] Based on the country condition evidence as well as the personal identity documentation that you educed, Sir, in addition to the credible testimony that you provided this afternoon, I find that you have established that you are a stateless Palestinian on a balance of probabilities. Based on the stateless determination, I carefully considered any possible countries of former habitual residence for you Sir.\n[8] These are known as the (inaudible spot-01:46:11) factors in our jurisprudence. The concept of former habitual residence seeks to establish a relationship to a state which is broadly comparable to two dots between a citizen and a country of nationality, that is the term implies a situation where the stateless person was admitted to a country with a view to a continuing residence of some duration without necessitating a minimum period of residence. The claimant must have established a significant period of De Facto residence in the country in question. The claimant does not have to be able to legally return to a country of habitual residence.\n[9] Further holding travel documents is not a determinative factor if the person has never resided in a potential country of former habitual residence, that is a determinative factor and that country cannot be a country of former habitual residence despite there being a right to return and reside in that country. Based on your presented travel documents, I looked at both Egypt and the occupied Palestinian territory, you testified that you have never been to Gaza or the West Bank in the occupied Palestinian territory. There is also a dearth of evidence before me regarding you ever been a resident of Egypt despite being in possession of a valid Arab Republic of Egypt travel document for Palestinian refugees. Based on these considerations, I find that the occupied Palestinian territory including Gaza and the West Bank is not a country of former habitual residence for you. In addition, I find that Egypt is not a country of former habitual residence for you Sir.\n[10] In regards to the United States, your Palestinian authority passport included a temporary resident visa to the United States of America, you were issued a B1-82 temporary residence visa indicative of being granted entry to that country for a short period of time, typically six months or less. The entry stamp in your passport in Exhibit 1 and Exhibit 8 indicated that the authorities in that country granted you the standard six months of temporary residence upon your [XXX] 2018 entry. Despite this permission to stay for six months, I note that you travelled from New York City, New York State to Detroit, Michigan the following day according to your responses to question 9 of Schedule 12 found in Exhibit 1. The claim for protection in Canada was made on [XXX] 2018 according to the Canada Border Services Agency officer notes found in Exhibit 1. Based on these considerations, I find that you had no view to a continuing residence in the United States of America and that you did not have a significant period of De Facto residence in that country, and therefore finally United States is not a country of former habitual residence for you, Sir.\n[11] You spent more than 5 years in Bahrain including time as an adult. You completed your secondary studies in that country and began three years of your university studies according to your responses to Schedule A in Exhibit 1 and your academic record in Exhibit 8. Based on these considerations, I find that you had a view to a continuing residence in Bahrain during your secondary and post-secondary studies and then you had a significant period of De Facto residence in Bahrain prior to your most recent departure in [XXX] 2018. I therefore determine that Bahrain is a country of former habitual residence for you, Sir. You testified that you do not believe you can return to Bahrain as your status there is dependent on your studies. I find the visas in your passport support this testimony. I also find your testimony regarding your father\u2019s financial problems to be credible based on the family\u2019s decision to return to Saudi Arabia and you were forced to withdraw from your university studies.\n[12] The National Documentation Package for Bahrain is found in Exhibit 5 and also supports the lack of availability to obtain permanent status, for example, Item 2.1 indicates that even if you married a Bahrain citizen you would not have a path to citizenship in Bahrain as a noncitizen of that country. I have no evidence to establish that you retained permission to enter and remain in Bahrain for continued residence after your post-secondary studies ended in 2018. You were born in Saudi Arabia and you lived in that country for [XXX] years up until the end of grade [XXX].\n[13] Based on this I find that you had a view to a continuing residence in Saudi Arabia and that you had a significant period of De Facto residence in Saudi Arabia prior to your most recent departure on [XXX] 2018. I therefore determine that Saudi Arabia is a country of former habitual residence for you, Sir. In order to be found a convention refugee, a stateless person must show that on a balance of probabilities he or she would suffer persecution in any country of former habitual residence and if he or she cannot return to any of his or her countries of former habitual residence. These are known in jurisprudence as the (inaudible spot-01:50:58) requirements. There were a few times when I had to repeat questions, I find that you testified at the hearing in a straightforward and consistent manner without the use of embellishments, contraindications or omissions from the details that you presented when you made your claim for protection in Canada. Your narrative is very detailed in its descriptions of the problems that you faced growing up and living in Saudi Arabia as a young adult. You self-identified being a stateless Palestinian as per your responses in your Basis of Claim Form in Exhibit 2. You testified that your father is supporting all of your younger siblings and your half-sister and then your mother has been living with her family in Dammam for about two years.\n[14] Based on your testimony about the death threats made against you starting in [XXX] 2018 as well as the numerous examples you provided in your narrative and your narrative amendments about challenges you faced in schooling, healthcare, and neighborhood participation in Saudi Arabia, I find that you have a subjective fear of returning to Saudi Arabia. The overall objective evidence supports your claim for convention refuge protection based on your stateless nationality in Saudi Arabia. There are various documents in the Saudi Arabi National Documentation Package found in Exhibit 4 that confirm that there is no codified asylum system for those fleeing persecution in Saudi Arabia and the country is not party to the 1951 refugee convention or its protocol. Item 1.3 indicates that Saudi Arabia has 70,000 stateless residence including Palestinians; however, the estimated number of Palestinians in Saudi Arabia is 287,000 according to Item 2.6 and Item 3.9. Being stateless in Saudi Arabia can result in significant violation of rights which is included lack of access to public education, healthcare, and other services and inability to access employment, social alienation, and psychological challenges which is also found in Item 3.9.\n[15] I find that you educed sufficient evidence to establish that your ability to reside temporarily in Saudi Arabia was entirely due to the work permits and related sponsorship from your father. There is no evidence before me to establish that you, your parents, or any of your siblings has ever held permanent status in Saudi Arabia or to establish that you ever had access to a such status.\n[16] According to Item 3.1 and Item 3.5 in Saudi Arabia only citizens have access to education, healthcare, public housing, courts, and judicial procedures, legal services and other social services. Noncitizens have to pay for their elementary school and high school education even though these are public schools.\n[17] According to Item 14.2, Palestinians are subject to the same regulations as foreigners in Saudi Arabia. Foreigners must have Kafala or sponsorship to obtain work permits and residence permits. The sponsor can be a Saudi citizen or accompanied and the residence is of a limited duration and renewable under certain circumstances. The Ministry of Interior is entitled to withdraw the right of residence and its permit from any foreigner and instruct him to leave the country at any time without mentioning any reasons. Access to services such as health and education depends on provisions contained in the work contract.\n[18] Item 2.1 and Item 2.4 indicate that employers or sponsors control the departure of foreign workers and residents from Saudi Arabia and foreign citizen workers under sponsorship require guardian\u2019s consent to travel abroad. Foreign workers cannot change job unless they have a no objection letter from their existing employer and some employers confiscate worker\u2019s passport to prevent them from leaving.\n[19] Based on these considerations, I find that the objective country condition evidence supports you would not be allowed to enter Saudi Arabia should you return to that country. I therefore determine that you had a relationship with the state of Saudi Arabia which is not broadly comparable to a relationship between a citizen and his\/her country of nationality.\n[20] In regards to your lifetime cumulative treatment including treatment of simulated situated persons in Saudi Arabia who are noncitizens, Palestinians or stateless persons, I find that the cumulative effect Saudi policies related to education, healthcare, and employment are discrimination against noncitizen that rises to the level of persecution. I therefore determine that you face a well-founded fear of persecution in Saudi Arabia. The authorities of Saudi Arabia are your primary agents of persecution as the authorities in action subsequently enforce laws that put noncitizens and stateless residents at a significant disadvantage over the citizens of Saudi Arabia. I considered the possible avenues of redress for noncitizen resident of Saudi Arabia such as yourself.\n[21] Item 2.1 indicates that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is a monarchy, the State Security Presidency or SSP, the national guard, the ministries of defence and interior, all report to the king. Significant human rights issues included all unlawful killings, executions for nonviolent offenses, forced disappearances, torture of prisoners, and detainees by government agents, arbitrary arrest and detention, political prisoners and arbitrary interference with privacy. In the judicial system, there are traditionally no published case law on criminal matters, no uniform criminal code, no presumption of innocence, and no doctrine that binds charges to follow legal precedent. In light of the country condition evidence, I find that it will be objectively unreasonable for you sir in your particular circumstances as a noncitizen to seek the protection of the authorities in Saudi Arabia. I find it unreasonable to expect you to seek redress or protection from the police or any other authorities in Saudi Arabia.\n[22] Based on this, I find that you have rebutted the presumption of state protection with clear and convincing evidence, I find that on a balance of probabilities, adequate state protection would not be available to you should you return to Saudi Arabia.\n[23] The authorities of Saudi Arabia are in full control of their territory. You fear the policies enacted by the authorities of Saudi Arabia which in cumulative effect rises to a level of persecution. As the agents of harm include the state, I find that there would be no places or regions in Saudi Arabia which could offer you safety from the reasonable chance of persecution in your particular set of circumstances. I find that you have a well-founded fear of persecution throughout Saudi Arabia and there is no viable internal flight alternative for you. I further find that you are a stateless Palestinian with Saudi Arabia and Bahrain as your countries of former habitual residence. You do not have authorization to return to either of these countries. As such, I find that you are a convention refugee pursuant to Section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act based on your nationality as a stateless Palestinian and based on the serious risk of persecution in Saudi Arabia, I therefore accept your claim.\n[24] I am going to return to you all of the original documents that you presented to me and that concludes our hearing this afternoon. Do you have any questions before we end?\n[25] INTERPRETER: Did you accept my claim?\n[26] MEMBER: Yes. Any other questions?\n[27] CLAIMANT: No.\n[28] MEMBER: Counsel anything else before we end?\n[29] COUNSEL: No thank you very much.\n[30] MEMBER: I would like to thank you for your testimony this afternoon. Counsel thank you for your work and Mr. Interpreter thank you for your as well. With that, we go off the record and we end it here.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n",

Gayda\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Rodney L Woolf\nCountry: Somalia\nRPD Number: TB8-14586\nAssociated RPD Number(s):\nATIP Number: A-2021-00945\nATIP Pages: 000095-000119\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] [XXX] (hereinafter \u201cthe claimant\u201d) alleges that he is a [XXX] year-old citizen of Somalia and claims refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).[1]\n[2] Claimant\u2019s counsel and minister\u2019s counsel provided written submissions. The claimant provided post hearing documents with respect to the issue of his status in South Africa which I accepted and listed as Exhibit 16 and 17.\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] The claimant\u2019s allegations are set out in full in his Basis of Claim form (BOC)[2]. In summary, the claimant alleges that he was born and lived in [XXX] in the Lower Juba region of Somalia. He alleges to be a citizen of Somalia and no other country and that he is from the Ogaden clan, sub-clan Mohamed Subeer, Reer Isaq. He alleges that he was targeted for recruitment by the insurgent group, Al-Shabaab, in early 2010, and he refused their demands to join them saying as a Sufi Muslim he did not believe in their ideological, religious and political goals.\n[4] The claimant alleges that Al-Shabaab\u2019s insistence on recruiting him culminated in Al-Shabaab threatening him and his brothers with death, prompting the claimant to flee Somalia to Dadaab refugee camp in Kenya at the end of [XXX] 2010. He says that he remained in Kenya for about three months and then made his way to Mozambique and then by [XXX] 2010 to South Africa. In late [XXX] 2010, he made an asylum claim in South Africa. He was granted refugee status in South Africa on [XXX] 2010 and lived there until [XXX] 2014. At that time the claimant was accepted for resettlement to Denmark as a refugee approved by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and he travelled to Copenhagen, Denmark with his then wife, along with his brother, [XXX], who was also accepted, at least in part, on the grounds of a serious medical disability.\n[5] In Denmark the claimant was given temporary resident status as a refugee, that was to last for five years. The claimant received notice in [XXX] 2017 that his temporary status was being revoked as the Danish government took the view that there was a change of country conditions in Somalia, insofar as it would allow the claimant, and many other Somalis in a similar situation, to return to Somalia. The claimant appealed this decision however on [XXX] 2018 his appeal was denied and he was given 30 days to leave Denmark, otherwise he would be deported to Somalia.\n[6] The claimant alleges that he feared being removed to Somalia so he improperly obtained a Danish passport in a different name and left Denmark in late [XXX] 2018, intending to come to Canada. He presented this passport to Canada immigration in London, United Kingdom in transit, and was stopped from completing his journey to Toronto as Canadian officials suspected that his Danish passport was fraudulently obtained as he could not answer questions about that passport or provide other Danish identity documents in that name.\n[7] The claimant then was able to use this same Danish passport to travel to the USA from London, UK. He flew to Chicago, USA, arriving there on [XXX] 2018. The claimant subsequently presented himself at an irregular border crossing at Emerson, Manitoba on [XXX] 2018 and started his claim for refugee protection in Canada.\n[8] The claimant alleges a fear of forced recruitment by Al-Shabaab; he does not agree with their religious or political beliefs or actions, and he does not want to join them. He also alleges to additionally fear Al-Shabaab today because he has resided outside of Somalia for ten years, six of those years in westernized, predominantly Christian countries. The claimant alleges that Al\u00ad Shabaab would perceive him as opposed to them and possibly a spy for the Somali or foreign governments or organization due to this prolonged absence from Somalia and residence in western countries.\nDETERMINATION\n[9] For the reasons that follow, I find that the claimant has established that he would face a serious possibility of persecution in Somalia (section 96 of IRPA). Therefore, I accept his claim.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity and Credibility\n[10] This claim raised two determinative issues: identity and credibility. These issues are interrelated, and as such have been assessed together.\n[11] Section 106 of IRPA, under the sub-heading \u201cClaimant without Identification\u201d, states:\nThe Refugee Protection Division must take into account, with respect to the credibility of a claimant, whether the claimant possesses acceptable documentation establishing identity, and if not, whether they have provided a reasonable explanation for the lack of documentation or have taken reasonable steps to obtain the documentation.[3]\nThe legislation therefore is clear that the Board must consider whether a claimant without acceptable documentation establishing their identity, has provided a reasonable explanation for their lack of documentation and whether they have taken reasonable steps to obtain that documentation, as part of the assessment of credibility.\n[12] Similarly, section 11 of the Refugee Protection Division Rules (the Rules) requires that:\nThe claimant must provide acceptable documents establishing identity and other elements of the claim. A claimant who does not provide acceptable documents must explain why they were not provided and what steps were taken to provide them.[4]\n[13] As held by the Federal Court in Su, \u201c[t]he onus is on the claimant to produce acceptable documentation establishing his or her identity.\u201d[5] (Emphasis added) Furthermore, the Federal Court in Duale held that \u201cit is up to the claimant to establish his identity and he must make a genuine, substantive effort to do so\u201d.[6]\n[14] The documentary evidence in the National Documentation Package (NDP) indicates that there has not been a functioning central government which issues valid and reliable identity documents in Somalia since approximately 1991.[7] While the central government in Somalia is issuing some forms of identification, they are not accepted internationally and do not seem to be widely used in civil life in Somalia.[8] Although it is sometimes possible for Somalis to apply for passports, the process of obtaining such a document is reported to be costly and difficult, and a number of countries do not recognize the Somali passport as a valid travel document due to widespread passport fraud.[9] The federal government in Somalia has not been recognized by the United States or by Canada as a competent civil authority to issue civil identity documents.[10] Moreover, while the documentary evidence indicates that the Somali government has been issuing national identity cards since [XXX] 2013, the evidence also indicates that in practice, the identity card is \u201crarely used to do anything other than [serve] as a precursor to obtaining a passport\u201d.[11]\n[15] I find that the above review of the objective country documentation constitutes a reasonable explanation for why the claimant was not able to present a passport or other type of national identity card issued by the state of Somalia. The claimant testified that he once held a Somali driver\u2019s licence but that this licence was lost while he was in South Africa. The onus rests on the claimant to utilize other reliable, credible means to establish his identity, and to provide reasonable explanations as to what steps he took to obtain documentary evidence to support his identity. This would include reasonable explanations as to why certain documents could not be obtained. Rule 11 of the Rules reinforces section 106 of IRPA and further states that a claimant must not only make reasonable efforts to provide acceptable documents to establish their identity, but also other elements of their claim. When such documents are not provided, these provisions state the Board is to evaluate a claimant\u2019s explanation as to what the efforts and steps he took to try and obtain documents and whether such explanation(s) are reasonable, taking into account the claimant\u2019s particular personal circumstances.\n[16] For the reasons that follow, I find that the claimant has established his personal and national identity, on a balance of probabilities. His testimony was consistent with the testimony from his witness, as well as with his corroborating documents. I do not accept his testimony as credible as it related to his acquisition of a Somali driver\u2019s licence (no longer in the claimant\u2019s possession). I have weighed this negative credibility finding, outlined below, against the rest of his testimony and the testimony of his witness which I found credible, and his supporting documentation concerning his identity. I find that despite that credibility concern, outlined below, several sources of the claimant\u2019s written corroborating evidence as to his identity, the quality of which I have assessed and found to be consistent and reliable, and the credible testimony from his witness, lead to my finding that the claimant has established his personal and national identity, on a balance of probabilities.\nClaimant\u2019s Testimony about family; life in Somalia; residence and travel history\n[17] The claimant\u2019s testimony about his family and life in [XXX], Lower Juba Somalia was spontaneous and generally consistent with his BOC form and other corroborating documentation. He also testified with details and consistently about his travel route out of Somalia and his arrival and time in South Africa, followed by his application for resettlement to the UNHCR that was accepted by Denmark. His testimony was consistent with the testimony of a witness from his clan who had known him in Somalia from 2007-2009. The claimant testified that he had no formal education, having been taught to read and written at home by his mother, and he claimed to have worked only as an animal herder in Somalia. I have evaluated his testimony with this background in mind.\nWitness\u2019s Testimony\n[18] The claimant\u2019s witness, [XXX], a fellow clan member and a permanent resident of Canada, testified credibly about how and when he came to know the claimant and his family in Somalia from 2007-2009 wherein he stayed with them when visiting [XXX] to buy cattle about 6 or 7 times. The witness consistently identified his mother and knew he had six siblings, and testified that he remembered three of them and provided their names. He testified that when he stayed with the claimant at his family\u2019s home in [XXX] in 2007, he knew that his father had been killed and he had heard that the claimant\u2019s father was someone who had been supportive of the government in that region and that he was killed for those reasons. I find that the witness\u2019s testimony did not appear to be a rehearsed memorization, and that his answers were natural and spontaneous, as well as consistent with the claimant\u2019s allegations in his claim and the claimant\u2019s testimony about how he knew the witness.\nCorroborating Documents related to Identity\n[19] Before me were many corroborating documents concerning the claimant\u2019s identity, some of them original identity documents such as his Danish alien passport and his Danish resident card[12] and a copy of this Denmark \u201cLaissez Passer\u201d travel document issued by the Royal Danish Embassy in Pretoria.[13] From South Africa, he provided copies of his South African temporary asylum seeker and refugee recognition documents[14] and his UNCHR Resettlement Registration Form[15], a Traffic Register Certificate[16] and an affidavit from a cousin in South Africa[17]. The claimant provided a letter from his brother in Denmark, accompanied by a copy of his brother\u2019s Danish resident card.[18] The claimant also provided a copy of the 2018 Danish Refugee Appeal Board decision[19], rejecting his appeal and indicating that he would face removal to Somalia, and this decision was consistent with his personal and national identity, including his family and clan background, travel and residence history, as well as consistent with his core allegations of having been targeted for recruitment by Al-Shabaab. The claimant also provided a letter from Midaynta Community Services indicating that they had met with and questioned the claimant and the same identity witness in the Somali language and believed the claimant was a Somali national.[20]\nMinister\u2019s Intervention\n[20] The Minister intervened in person on the issues of identity and credibility. I have considered the Minister\u2019s written submissions alongside the totality of the evidence in the claim, including the claimant\u2019s testimony over multiple sittings and his witness\u2019s testimony, counsel\u2019s written submissions and the written evidence submitted as exhibits by both counsel and the Minister. I address the Minister\u2019s submissions below.\nClaimant\u2019s Name\n[21] The Minister identified purported inconsistencies in the claimant\u2019s testimony with respect to why his name was different than his siblings\u2019 names, and his reason for going by his \u201cofficial\u201d Somali name. I asked the claimant why he did not share the same middle name \u201c[XXX]\u201d as his siblings, including his half-brother in Denmark who provided a letter and a copy of his Danish resident card.\n[22] The claimant testified that in Somalia he was known as [XXX], or the son of [XXX], the son of [XXX]. He testified that his father\u2019s official name was [XXX], that his own grandfather had been named [XXX], and his father\u2019s grandfather had been named [XXX], and that his father also went by the nickname \u201c[XXX]\u201d. The claimant testified that he did not know why the family called his father this nickname. He testified that they also called his father \u201c[XXX]\u201d or \u201c[XXX]\u201d (teacher) because his father was known in their area of Somalia for having read and learned the Koran well and that he had gone to the pilgrimage or Haj.\n[23] The claimant testified that when he went to South Africa he decided to go by his given name ([XXX]), followed by his father\u2019s given name ([XXX]), followed by his grandfather\u2019s name ([XXX]). He explained that his half-brother provided the name \u201c[XXX]\u201d for himself when he arrived in South Africa and also in his UNHCR interview for resettlement in Denmark. His brother entered South Africa at a different point, about three years after the claimant, and the claimant had no control over the more colloquial name given by his brother to the South African and then the UNCHR and Danish authorities. The claimant testified that he did not know his brother\u2019s reasons for doing this.\n[24] I have reviewed the claimant\u2019s testimony over the multiple sittings and I find that his explanation for the difference in his name between his half-brother\u2019s and other siblings names is reasonable given the cultural context of the use of nicknames in Somalia. I accept that it is reasonable that upon arrival in another country (South Africa) where he claimed asylum, he decided to use if his \u201cofficial\u201d name, [XXX], which is indeed his full name and not the more colloquial nickname he was called in Somalia. At the second sitting, the claimant testified that this was also the name that had been on his Somali driver\u2019s licence, so his South African asylum documents referenced this name.\n[25] I note that the claimant\u2019s identity witness in his testimony identified the claimant by his name, [XXX], and was not aware of other nicknames he may have gone by in Somalia. The witness was from the same clan as the claimant but did not live in [XXX]. He said he visited the claimant and his family in [XXX] from his own small village in lower Juba on six or seven occasions between 2007 and 2009. Given that the witness was not a close family member or someone who saw the claimant regularly in Somalia, I do not find it unusual that he was not aware of the claimant\u2019s nickname in Somalia.\n[26] I am mindful of the information before me about Somali naming customs and the common use of nicknames in Somali culture. While Somali naming conventions for their children typically involve a given name + father\u2019s given name + grandfather\u2019s given name[21], further evidence in the NDP suggests:\nA child can be given more than one first name at birth. It is also common to give the child a nickname, such as a family name, a descriptive name or an abbreviation of the given name. It is often the case that these names are mixed together, and sometimes a person would use his\/her nickname in an official context. A large percentage of the Somali population is still illiterate and there is sometimes a lesser focus on formalities. All these factors may often create confusion as to a person\u2019s \u201ccorrect\u201d name and identity.[22][Emphasis added]\n[27] I find that this country evidence provides important cultural context in which the claimant\u2019s explanations and personal circumstances are rooted. I therefore accept his explanation for the difference in his name from his siblings names as reasonable. For the same reason, I also do not find that the claimant\u2019s brother\u2019s letter, dictated to an interpreter who wrote it down in English and provided his own photo identification, can be discounted as not probative or trustworthy simply because he declared in this letter that he was \u201c[XXX]\u201d and his Danish resident permit card lists him as \u201c[XXX]\u201d.[23] Such mixing together of official and colloquial names is, according to the above-noted evidence in the NDP, quite common in Somalia.\nAl-Shabaab\u2019s threats and actions towards the claimant\n[28] The Minister pointed to some purported inconsistencies between the claimant\u2019s testimony and BOC narrative, namely that that the claimant testified that it was only he and his older brother, rather than all his brothers, who were being pressured to join Al-Shabaab and that he testified that the Al-Shabaab fighter\/former homeschool-mate, [XXX], did not threaten him in person, whereas the BOC indicates he did come in person. I have reviewed the claimant\u2019s testimony and I note that when I asked the claimant to tell me about the threats he received in Somalia he indicated that Al-Shabaab asked for him and his brothers and had threatened his mother that if he and his brothers did not join them, Al-Shabaab would kill them. Then in later questioning the claimant indicated that Al-Shabaab was only \u201csending\u201d messages to him and his older brother to join them, which he clarified in his testimony was because it was only his older brother and himself who had cell phones which is why they were the ones receiving the text messages demanding that they join Al-Shabaab. From my review of his testimony, the claimant originally testified that it was him and his brothers who [XXX] was trying to convince to join Al-Shabaab and that it was the claimant and his brothers who were being sought on the day that [XXX] came to their family home in [XXX] 2010 and made threats about their recruitment to their mother. I therefore find that this does not detract from the claimant\u2019s credibility, as I do not find this to be inconsistent.\n[29] The Minister also submits that there was an inconsistency between the claimant\u2019s testimony and his BOC form when he described in his testimony that [XXX] had not threatened him in person, and he testified that if he had been face-to-face with [XXX], he would have taken the claimant. The claimant\u2019s BOC form indicates that [XXX] came several times to him and his brothers trying \u201cto encourage us to join Al-Shabaab with him.\u201d[24] This apparent inconsistency was put to the claimant, and he responded that [XXX] came to him and his brothers in person before he had joined Al-Shabaab, wanting him and his brothers to join Al-Shabaab with him, and it was only after he had joined that he started texting him and his older brother demanding that they join Al-Shabaab, and using threats.\n[30] The Minister submits that this explanation is an attempt to explain away an inconsistency between his testimony and his BOC form. I find that the claimant\u2019s explanation was immediate and is not clearly inconsistent with the information in his BOC form of [XXX] coming to him in person to encourage the claimant and his brothers to join Al-Shabaab with him. Further, the claimant also provided elaborative details in his testimony, such as the fact that when he came to him in person encouraging the claimant to join Al-Shabaab with him, [XXX] did not yet appear to have joined Al-Shabaab, as he was not dressed like Al-Shabaab at that time and he did not appear to have weapons that were typical of Al-Shabaab. The claimant did not appear vague or evasive in responding to my queries. In these circumstances, I decline to draw the negative credibility inference suggested by the Minister, as I find the claimant\u2019s explanation reasonable.\n[31] The Minister also submits that a difference between the Port of Entry (POE) declaration, in a question and answer format, made by the claimant when he entered Canada and his testimony and BOC form, should ground a negative credibility finding. The claimant stated at the POE that Al-Shabaab tried to kidnap him, however in his testimony and BOC form he stated that he was not home when Al-Shabaab came and threatened his mother and brothers, and there is no mention of an attempted kidnapping.\n[32] The claimant explained in his testimony that what he meant at the POE was that Al-Shabaab would have kidnapped him had he been home; their intention was to take him by force. I accept this explanation as reasonable. The questions and answers in a POE interview typically only provide a brief snapshot of a claimant\u2019s reasons for fleeing harm, and they were done through an interpreter over the telephone in this case.[25] There is no indication that the claimant was asked for further details to explain this harm he feared from Al-Shabaab, as the next question from the POE declaration asks about his status in Denmark. Moreover, the Danish refugee appeal decision does not reference any kidnapping attempt, which is consistent with his BOC from and testimony. I therefore decline to draw a negative credibility finding on this issue.\nComparing the Danish Refugee Appeal Board decision with the claimant\u2019s allegations\n[33] The Minister submits that there are inconsistences between the information in the Danish Refugee Appeal Board decision and the information that the claimant has provided in his refugee claim in Canada. Having reviewed the Danish Refugee Appeal Board decision in its entirety, I disagree that the differences described by the Minister between that decision and the claimant\u2019s evidence should sustain a negative credibility finding. The Minister points out that in the Danish Refugee Appeal Board\u2019s summary of the claimant\u2019s evidence, the Board member describes the claimant as having stated he had a \u201cgood life\u201d in South Africa and that he had a job, as well as having described that there were \u201cthieves and gangs in South Africa who terrorized people, but the Appellant [claimant] stayed there because he had a job.\u201d[26] The incident in South Africa of being shot in the arm by thieves at the store where he worked is not mentioned by the Danish Refugee Appeal Board and the Minister submits that this is a \u201cmajor omission\u201d.\n[34] Counsel for the claimant notes that the Appeal Board\u2019s summary of the claimant\u2019s life story concerning South Africa was for the purpose of determining whether he should remain in Denmark or face return to Somalia, and as the claimant did not have citizenship or permanent residence in South Africa, his situation in South Africa was not being assessed by the Appeal Board, so it is not unusual for it not to be a detailed or fulsome account of the problems he encountered there. I agree with this submission and do not find that this is a serious omission from which a negative credibility finding should be drawn.\n[35] I also decline to draw a negative credibility finding from the Minister\u2019s submission with regards to an alleged inconsistency between the Danish Refugee Appeal Board decision and the claimant\u2019s allegations about the nature of Al-Shabaab\u2019s threats towards him. In the Appeal Board decision, it is noted that the claimant alleged to have had two to three phone calls from Al-Shabaab and to have received approximately three text messages from Al-Shabaab who also sent an old school-mate to seek him out to get him to join them. This is consistent with the claimant\u2019s allegations in his BOC form. The Appeal Board also noted that the claimant had alleged that Al-Shabaab had threatened him if he did not cooperate with their recruitment demands he would be killed, and also that he had a fear that as someone now who would be returning to Somalia now with no family remaining there having resided in western countries for several years, he would be particularly vulnerable.[27]\n[36] I find that this description of why the claimant fled Somalia is generally consistent with the claimant\u2019s present allegations. The Appeal Board\u2019s decision in fact appears to be internally contradictory on the point that the Minister mentions, as the decision indicates, more than once on page three, that Al-Shabaab sent a former school-mate to seek him out to get him to join them, and also states that he was never sought out by Al-Shabaab.\n[37] An inconsistency between the Danish Refugee Appeal Board decision and the present claim which I put to the claimant was that in the Appeal Board decision it states that Al-Shabaab did not attempt to recruit anyone else in his family in the same manner, but the claimant knew other people in the same area who had were forcibly recruited. The claimant testified that when he reviewed the Danish Refugee Appeal Board decision, he had seen some errors, and it could have been a problem with interpretation, and he is not certain why they are there. While this is a difference that would not seem to necessarily be the result of poor interpretation, rather it appears that the brothers also being targeted by Al-Shabaab is an omission in the Appeal Board decision, I am mindful that comparing such the Appeal Board decision to the present allegations with a mind to looking only for differences, must be balanced against looking at the decision as whole and considering the aspects of the Appeal Board decision that are in line with what the claimant alleges in the present claim.\n[38] I am satisfied that the Danish Refugee Appeal Board decision when read in its entirety and not microscopically, is consistent with respect to the claimant\u2019s identity and his core allegations of why he fled Somalia to escape forced recruitment to Al-Shabaab; that a former school-mate was approaching him asking him to join, and also sending him text messages on behalf of Al-Shabaab demanding that he join. It is also consistent with his alleged route to Denmark, including having made and been accepted as a refugee in South Africa, who then applied through the UNHCR to come to Denmark with his brother who required surgery to remove a brain tumour. I also note that the Appeal Board decision indicates, consistent with the claimant\u2019s allegations in this claim, that his father was killed in Somalia in 2006 as a result of battles between militant Islamist groups and government forces in their village. I find that the Danish Refugee Appeal Board decision therefore is assistive to the claimant in establishing his core allegations, as well as his identity.\nObtaining the Danish passport used for travel out of Denmark\n[39] The Minister submits that a negative credibility finding is warranted from the fact that the improperly obtained Danish passport used by the claimant for his first attempt to reach Canada and then for his travel to the United States was issued in [XXX] 2018 prior to him having received the final decision on his refugee appeal in Denmark on [XXX] 2018. The claimant testified that he destroyed this passport in the United States. He required a Danish passport for travel since his own \u201calien passport\u201d from Denmark would not have permitted his travel to Canada or the United States. The claimant testified that he believed the Danish passport he used in his journey to the United States was genuine \u201cbecause it worked\u201d and he was told by the agent whom he had paid to procure it, that \u201cyou can travel with that\u201d. The claimant also testified that the passport was altered to include his photograph in it and that he made the arrangement with the agent for the passport after receiving his negative appeal decision orally on [XXX] 2018.\n[40] The Minister asserts the opinion that the it would be \u201cnear impossible\u201d for the claimant\u2019s photograph to have been added to the polymer substrate in the Danish passport to replace another photograph after the passport was issued in [XXX] 2018, and hence if the passport was improperly obtained, then such passport was likely obtained with the claimant\u2019s photograph already in it on its issuance date in [XXX] 2018, prior to the claimant receiving his negative refugee appeal decision. This raises the concern, according to the Minister, that the claimant improperly obtained this passport prior to learning the outcome of his appeal and that he is not being truthful concerning the circumstances under which he obtained this document.\n[41] I note that the Minister did not provide any objective evidence about the manufacture of Danish passports, and the possibility, prevalence or rarity of document tampering of such documents. Further, the Minister\u2019s submission does not address the possibility that the passport could have been created, fraudulently after the claimant requested after [XXX] 2018 and that the information in it may have simply indicated an earlier issuance date. While the claimant referred to it as a \u201cgenuine\u201d document \u201cbecause it worked\u201d and because he was told by the agent that \u201cyou can travel\u201d with the document, this does not necessarily mean it was truly a genuine document, and that it was not fabricated after the claimant requested it. I decline to draw the negative credibility inference suggested by the Minister on this point.\nAn area of credibility concern: How and why claimant obtained his Somali driver\u2019s licence\n[42] I do have a credibility concern with respect to the claimant\u2019s testimony concerning his attainment of his driver\u2019s licence in Somalia. He testified that this document was lost by him at some point in South Africa. I find that the claimant\u2019s testimony on this issue evolved when being questioned about the information that the claimant had provided to the Ontario Ministry of Transportation when applying for an Ontario driver\u2019s licence, and obtained and provided by the Minister in this claim.[28] Moreover, I find that his description of how and why he obtained this Somali driver\u2019s licence in Somalia in 2009 is unreasonable and inconsistent.\n[43] When asked about why he declared five years of driving experience in South Africa on his Ontario application form for a driver\u2019s licence when he had only resided in South Africa for four years, the claimant explained that he had had four years of driving experience in South Africa and he had also driven in Denmark, and so he had included the total number of years of driving experience that he possessed. I asked him how it was that he obtained this driving experience in South Africa when his South African driver\u2019s licence indicates it was issued in 2014, and the claimant left South Africa on [XXX] 2014. The claimant then described that he drove in South Africa on his Somali driver\u2019s licence, which he had obtained in 2009. The claimant provided a copy of his South Africa Traffic Register Number certificate issued on [XXX] 2012[29] and testified that he needed this document along with his Somali driver\u2019s licence when driving in South Africa.\n[44] The claimant testified that he applied for a driver\u2019s licence in 2009 in Somalia in [XXX] and paid a fee of about $[XXX] (US) for it. I asked the claimant why he wanted to expend this kind of money and effort in getting a driver\u2019s licence when he was working herding animals and did not have formal income and given he acknowledged that his family did not own a car and he did not have an occupation that involved driving. His answer was that he wanted to have the chance to drive at some point, so he wanted a licence. He testified that he did not drive much in Somalia. At the second sitting he indicated that at the time he obtained his driver\u2019s licence in Somalia he had plans to get a car in the future.\n[45] At the [XXX] 2019 sitting he testified that there was an office in [XXX] where he got his licence, and there was an area there where one could learn to drive. In the [XXX] 2019 sitting the claimant described how there were no Jubal and government offices in [XXX] in the 2009-2010 timeframe. When asked about the contradiction with his previous testimony- that he had testified that he had obtained his driver\u2019s licence in [XXX] in 2009- the claimant denied that he had obtained the licence had been issued in [XXX] itself and explained that \u201c[XXX] driving school\u201d had given him the driver training and that this driving school in [XXX] got him his licence which would have been issued in Kismayo where they had government offices at the time. He testified that he thought it was the driving school who arranged for the driver\u2019s licence.\n[46] I find that the claimant\u2019s testimony about how he obtained a Somali driver\u2019s licence appears to have evolved to account for inconsistencies, and that his reason for seeking out a driver\u2019s licence at that point in his life in Somalis does not appear plausible in that I question why he would spend the money and time in getting a Somali driver\u2019s licence in 2009 without any concrete reason or ability to use it. I have weighed this credibility concern against the rest of the claimant\u2019s testimony with regards to his identity and his core allegations, the testimony of his witness, and particularly against his corroborating evidence as to his identity.\nSummary on Identity and Credibility\n[47] Ultimately in weighing the totality of the evidence, including the claimant\u2019s corroborating documents as to his identity and residence history, I find that my credibility concern about his testimony pertaining to his Somali driver\u2019s licence does not outweigh the other credible corroborating evidence such that I find that despite this concern, the claimant has established his personal and national identity, on a balance of probabilities. I find that the multiple corroborating documents before me that consistently list his personal and national identity assist in overcoming this credibility concern about why and how he obtained a Somali driver\u2019s licence, as does his witness\u2019s credible testimony.\n[48] This concern also does not outweigh the other credible evidence outlined about his life and experiences in Somalia that lead him to flee that country. As such I find that he has established the core of his allegations, on a balance of probabilities. Those core allegations are that he was targeted by Al-Shabaab for recruitment in 2010 in the [XXX] area of Somalia and if he were returned to Somalia today, he would also be perceived with suspicion and targeted for harm as a possible Somali government or western government spy by Al-Shabaab.\nNo Permanent Status in South Africa\n[49] I am satisfied, after canvassing the issue thoroughly with the claimant and reviewing his corroborating documents, that the claimant, on a balance of probabilities, has established that he does not have citizenship or permanent residence in South Africa. The claimant alleged that he claimed asylum in South Africa and was granted refugee status in that country, and that he had never obtained permanent residence status or citizenship there. He testified that he did not believe he was even eligible to apply for permanent residence in South Africa, given that he had only lived there for four years as a refugee. His testimony about when he arrived in South Africa and what he did in that country was generally consistent with his BOC form and other supporting documentation. He also provided a copy of the Danish laissez-passer document that had been issued to him and stamped with his travel dates in leaving South Africa on [XXX] 2014 to travel to Denmark as a United Nations-accepted refugee.\n[50] I had questions for the claimant about his South African driver\u2019s licence. A copy of this licence was provided in the information that was obtained by the Minister from Ontario\u2019s Ministry of Transportation concerning the claimant\u2019s application for an Ontario driver\u2019s licence. A copy of his South African driver\u2019s licence was provided by the claimant when he applied for his Ontario driver\u2019s licence.[30] The claimant testified that this driver\u2019s licence was genuine. He also testified that he was no longer sure where the original of this licence was, since after he obtained his Ontario driver\u2019s licence, that is what the document he was concerned about. In the third and final sitting, I putto the claimant my concern about the I.D. Number that appeared on his South African driver\u2019s licence, pursuant to the information contained in the South African National Documentation Package, the eleventh digit of this number being \u201c0\u201d, signifies that the holder has South African citizenship.[31]\n[51] The claimant responded in his testimony that this was the first time he had heard about this issue, and that he did not know how this could be, since he was someone in South Africa who only had been granted asylum, and did not possess citizenship. He said that the South African licensing office gave him this card after doing a test, and that he had never noticed this issue with the I.D. Number on the licence.\n[52] At the third sitting the claimant provided a copy of his UNHCR Resettlement Registration Form[32] noting his name, date of birth, nationality as a Somali citizen, his parents\u2019 names with his father being noted as deceased, that he is from the [XXX] area of Somalia, is from the Ogaden clan, and also the particulars of his wife (now ex-wife). It notes an \u201carrival date\u201d to the country of asylum (South Africa) as [XXX] 2010. He explained that he only recently obtained a copy of this document as an acquaintance had gone to Denmark and gotten it for him from his brother\u2019s house. The claimant testified that he had asked her to go there and look for any documents related to him, as he was not even sure what documents he had that remained there. He obtained the copy of this UNHCR document in either late [XXX] or early [XXX] 2019, after the second sitting of his refugee claim. I asked him why he had not had his brother in Denmark send him this document previously and the claimant responded that his brother is not healthy and often not capable of doing these kinds of things, as he spends a lot of his time in hospital having had multiple brain surgeries for a tumour in his brain.\n[53] I note that the information on this UNHCR document is consistent with the claimant\u2019s allegations, testimony and other corroborating documents concerning the issue of his personal and national identity, and his date of arrival in South Africa. Moreover, his testimony about his brother\u2019s health condition is consistent with his previous testimony and the other corroborating documents before me.\n[54] I allowed the claimant an opportunity to provide post-hearing evidence on the issue of his status in South Africa. He provided two documents issued by the Department of Home Affairs of the Republic of South Africa. The first entitled, \u201cFormal Recognition of Refugee Status in the RSA\u201d and the second is entitled, \u201cAsylum Seeker Temporary Permit\u201d.[33] These documents indicate that the claimant applied for refugee protection in Johannesburg, South Africa on [XXX] 2010 and was found to be a refugee by the Department of Home Affairs on [XXX] 2010. On the refugee status document, refugee recognition is noted as being valid until [XXX] 2012. According to the claimant and his Danish travel and other documents he remained in South Africa until [XXX] 2014 as a refugee, and therefore this South African Refugee Status document was likely extended at least once.\n[55] These South African documents are consistent with the information in the NDP for South Africa concerning the types of documents that are issued to asylum seekers and recognized refugees and the process of applying for asylum and being granted refugee protection in South Africa, initially on a two- year basis that is to be renewed.[34]\n[56] While I do find that the I.D. number in the claimant\u2019s South African driver\u2019s licence is a discrepancy in the evidence, I have weighed and assessed this against the multiple other pieces of evidence before me, including now his UNHCR Registration Document and his temporary Refugee Status and Asylum Seeker Temporary Permit issued by the Department of Home Affairs of South Africa,[35] such documents corroborating the claimant\u2019s allegations that he only entered South Africa in 2010 and obtained temporary status there through an asylum claim. I find therefore on a balance of probabilities that the claimant did not obtain citizenship in South Africa, either through birth there, or through arrival to that country at a much earlier time, which would have allowed time for possible naturalized citizenship.\n[57] The information in the South African NDP is clear that the process to obtain permanent residence in South Africa and then naturalized citizenship is a lengthy, inconsistent and often arduous process, that would take at least five years, but most likely much longer, as permanent residency can only be applied for after an individual has resided for five years in South Africa after having been granted refugee status and that citizenship can only be applied for after a person has been a permanent resident for five years.[36] Sources in the NDP also note that a required step, called \u201ccertification\u201d, in the pathway to obtaining permanent residence, from the South African government can be very difficult or next to impossible for refugees to obtain, with some refugees never receiving a decision or waiting up to 20 years for certification.[37] I accept, on a balance of probabilities, based on the claimant\u2019s testimony that is supported by his corroborating documents from South Africa and the UNHCR, that he only lived in South Africa from [XXX] 2010 onwards. And on a balance of probabilities, I find that the claimant left South Africa on [XXX] 2014 arriving in Copenhagen, Denmark the next day, which is corroborated through his Denmark documentation, including the travel stamps on his Danish Laissez-passer travel document issued by the Royal Danish Embassy in Pretoria, South Africa.\nNexus\n[58] This claim is based on imputed political opinion as Al-Shabaab would perceive the claimant\u2019s refusal to join them and his fleeing from their demanded recruitment of him, to be an act of ideological and political defiance against them. As well, I find that the claimant\u2019s residence in a western country augments the perception of the persecutor that the claimant may be a spy for western governments or the Somali government and that he holds political and ideological views to which Al-Shabaab is strongly opposed.\nWell-foundedness of the Claim\nSubjective basis\n[59] I accept the claimant\u2019s allegations, on a balance of probabilities, that he fled Somalia as soon as possible after he came to know that he was being targeted by Al-Shabaab. Upon learning that he faced removal from Denmark to Somalia, he looked for a way to avoid this fate, and obtained a fraudulent or improperly obtained Danish passport in a different name. He attempted to travel to Canada on this passport but was stopped in transit in London, UK by Canadian officials on the suspicion that the passport was fraudulent. He then changed his route to travel to the USA. Four days after arriving in the USA, the claimant made his refugee protection claim at an irregular crossing near Emerson, Manitoba. I accept that the claimant has established that he is subjectively fearful of returning to Somalia.\nObjective basis\n[60] There is an objective basis in the country documentation for the claimant\u2019s risk of persecution. The UNHCR Report, International Protection Considerations for People Fleeing Southern and Central Somalia notes specific risk profiles when considering risk in Somalia and included in this are individuals at risk of being forcibly recruited by Al-Shabaab.[38]\n[61] A March 2017 report from the Danish Immigration Service entitled, South and Central Somalia, Security Situation, al-Shabaab Presence, and Target Groups, states:\nAn independent organisation and an anonymous source concurred that refusing to join al-Shabaab can have serious consequences. Persons, who refuse, can be killed, and the killing can take place as a public execution. The independent organisation considered it to be a part of an overall al-Shabaab strategy in order to install fear in the population and to state examples for future recruits.[39]\n[62] The May 2016 Update from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees Position on Returns to Southern and Central Somalia states that Al-Shabaab is \u201creported to be responsible for a wide range of grave human rights abuses, including extrajudicial killings, abductions and disappearances, rape and other forms of sexual violence, forced recruitment of children, forced marriages to Al-Shabaab members, restrictions on civil liberties and freedom of movement, and restrictions on NGOs and humanitarian assistance.\u201d[40]\n[63] I am satisfied that the claimant\u2019s individualized circumstances are consistent with the objective documentary evidence in that he has a similar risk profile to those who face targeted killing and serious harm from Al-Shabaab. I have considered that Al-Shabaab\u2019s past targeting of the claimant for recruitment took place over ten years ago, and how this impacts his forward\u00ad facing risk of persecution. I find that the claimant\u2019s long-term residence outside of Somalia, particularly in the western countries of Denmark and now Canada, further heightens his risk and makes up for any possible dissipation of Al-Shabaab\u2019s interest or motivation in harming him over the ten years he has been away. Hence, I find that the claimant\u2019s personal circumstances lead to the finding that he would be targeted by Al-Shabaab for interrogation or physical harm upon his return to Somalia. He would be viewed with suspicion by this armed group as a possible government or western collaborator or spy. There is a serious possibility that the claimant\u2019s past resistance to Al-Shabaab\u2019s recruitment demands in the [XXX] area would become known to them and that he would be perceived as an enemy in the eyes of Al-Shabaab due to his profile as a returning westernized person.\n[64] The evidence in the Somalia National Documentation Package states that Al-Shabab has a sophisticated intelligence wing called Amniyat, and that they have an extensive network of sympathizers and collaborators with several sources considering Al-Shabaab to have information\u00ad gathering reach everywhere in south-central Somalia, including in Somali government institutions.[41] In analyzing whether he would face a serious possibility of persecution in the future, I have also considered his personal circumstances, as someone with no remaining family members in Somalia. This heightens his risk.\n[65] The National Documentation Package speaks of Al-Shabaab committing grave human rights abuses against civilians, including public executions, due to accusations of spying, that those questioned at check-points with clothing or items such as smartphones from the West are viewed with suspicion by Al-Shabaab, and that escaping harsh treatment from Al-Shabaab can often depend on having relatives and clan connections who can vouch for a returnee.[42] Other evidence indicates that Al-Shabaab\u2019s targeting for kidnapping and harm of government officials and workers from international organizations is motivated primarily for ideological rather than for-profit reasons.[43] Based on the objective country evidence, I find that as someone who was previously targeted but eluded the recruitment attempts of Al-Shabaab in the [XXX] area, the claimant would be at a heightened risk in attempting to traverse Somali territory as someone who is, and would perceived to be, westernized and who has been away from Somalia for a significant amount of time.\n[66] I therefore find that the claimant has established that his claim for refugee protection is subjectively and objectively well-founded. I find that there is a serious possibility that he would face persecution if returned to Somalia.\nState Protection\n[67] I find that there is no adequate state protection for the claimant in Somalia: there is clear and convincing evidence that state protection would not be reasonably forthcoming to him and the presumption of state protection has been rebutted. The documentary evidence in the Somalia NDP indicates:\nCivilian authorities did not maintain effective control over the security forces and had limited ability to provide human rights protections to society.\n\u2026\nSecurity forces abused civilians and often failed to prevent or respond to societal violence. Although authorities sometimes used military courts to try individuals believed to be responsible for abuse, they generally did not investigate abuse by police, army, or militia members; a culture of impunity was widespread.\n\u2026\nImpunity generally remained the norm. Government authorities took minimal steps to prosecute and punish officials who committed violations, particularly military and police officials accused of committing rape, killings, clan violence, and extortion.\n\u2026\nPolice were generally ineffective and lacked sufficient equipment and training.[44]\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[68] I find that there is no viable internal flight alternative for the claimant. The NDP describes the frequent checkpoints throughout the country run by Al-Shabaab as well as other state and non\u00ad-state agents, inhibiting movement of persons and putting those stopped at risk of looting, extortion, harassment and violence.[45] The humanitarian and security situation in other areas of south and central Somalia would make it unreasonable for the claimant to relocate to another location. With no family or support network in other areas of Somalia, there is no viable internal flight alternative for the claimant. Therefore, the claimant would face a serious possibility of persecution throughout Somalia.\nCONCLUSION\n[69] For the above reasons, I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of IRPA, and I therefore accept his claim\n[1] Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27, as amended.\n[2] Exhibit 2.\n[3] IRPA, section 106\n[4] Refugee Protection Division Rules, SOR\/2012-256, Rule 11\n[5] Su v.

But, unlike the judge in the Unites States, I am not going to reject your claim. So based on the information I have in front of me Sir, I understand that, sorry, Mr. Interpreter, I\u2019m just going to put you on mute so I can\u2019t hear you. That way you could interpret simultaneously without being interrupted by me, ok?\n[2] Interpreter: Ok.\n[3] Member: Leave the marker for me, it\u2019ll matter on that side, ok?\n[4] Interpreter: Ok.\n[5] MEMBER: So Sir, based on the information that I have in front of me, you are a [XXX] year-old male citizen of Eritrea. You are seeking refugee protection pursuant to Sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration Refugee Protection Act. The specific details of your claim are set out in your Basis of Claim form which we entered as Exhibit 2. But if I was going to summarize your claim Sir, you began national service in 2009. In 2013, while you were still serving your national, performing your nat-, national service, you expressed your displeasure with your work situation, your work conditions with your pay, with various aspects of your national service.\n[6] A few months later, in [XXX] 2014, you and a few others who expressed your displeasure were reassigned to an isolated location that housed prisoners and you say the name of that is [XXX] You petitioned against this reassignment and as a result you were sent to prison for approximately 16 months, from [XXX] 2014 until [XXX] 2015. While you were in prison, I understand that you were beaten and tortured. Upon release from prison, you were sent back to your original post to continue your national service, however, while there you were being harassed and intimidated. You were afraid of being sent back to prison so you decided to desert your national service, a-, a military service and flee Eritrea.\n[7] You feared that if you returned to Eritrea today, you would be tortured, you may face a lengthy imprisonment or you could be sentenced to death because you deserted your-, your national service and you also fear the repercussions of leaving Eritrea illegally. So Sir, as I-, as I said a few minutes ago, the Panel determines that you are a Convention refugee pursuant to Section 96 of the Immigration Refugee Protection Act.\n[8] Now with regard to your identity Sir, I have your Eritrean birth certificate, your-, and your Eritrean identity card which you have testified are genuine documents that you obtained legally and personally that these were not fraudulent documents that were given to you by an agent or a smuggler. And, I also have some witness letters that you have provided for me and all these documents can be found in Exhibit 5.\n[9] Now with regard to credibility Sir, and this is where I-, I-, I believe I should command your counsel but I find that you-, when you spoke of your reasons initially, when you s-, sorry, when you spoke of the re-, the judge\u2019s-, let me stop, let me try that all over again. When we were talking about the decision that was made by the immigration judge in the United States, I did not believe or it did not come across as credible when you stated that you were not-, you did not know why the immigration judge denied your claim. You had a lawyer but your lawyer did not explain to you why your claim was rejected. It-,you were not coming across as believable or as credible and that is a-, that is a major issue, especially when we only have two major issues in you claim, identity and credibility.\n[10] Now, before we took a break, I did advise you or-, or encourage you to be very straightforward about your asylum claim in the United States. I assured you that this is a different process in a different country and that the decision of the immigration judge in the United States would not impact my decision here today. I said to you that I understand why you would be hesitant to tell me why that the judge in the United Sates denied your claim, for fear that I would deny your claim for the very same reason. And I encouraged you Sir, to put that aside and just speak frankly with me. I understand on the break that your counsel may have tried to soothe your nerves and encourage you to be forthcoming in these proceedings and when you returned to the room, your counsel actually asked you questions about the immigration judge and the ing-, immigration judge\u2019s decision or the ing-, immigration\u2019s judge\u2019s reasons.\n[11] Now, when your counsel asked you these questions after the break, you said that the immigra-, the immigration judge in the United States, his assessment was that he thought that your claim was about your personal disagreement with your supervisors and that it was not politically based. That makes sense to me. That is very believable to me. I can see how someone reading your story could feel that your difficulties were more about your interpersonal relationship with your supervisor, [XXX] and about the-, the uncomfortable work situation and they could find that it was not-, there\u2019s not enough evidence to show that this is political. I understand that, that makes sense to me and I believe that that\u2019s an honest answer.\n[12] The immigration system in the US is different than immigration system in Canada. We have different definitions, we have different things that we look for to find a person to be a-, a-, Conv-, a refugee or a person in need of protection so that is why I said that the decision of the immigration judge in the United States was not going to affect my decision here today but what did affect my decision today was your ability to come back into this room and be very straightforward with me. So, I\u2019m not going to draw a negative inference from your reluctance to be forthcoming when I first asked you the questions. A reason I\u2019m not going to draw a negative inference is because I understand the difficulty that can be involved in presenting your evidence before a Panel after your claim has been denied based on the same story in front of a different Panel.\n[13] It\u2019s not, it doesn\u2019t justify you not being honest with me in the beginning but I understand it and what\u2019s important to me Sir, is that you were honest with me after you had a pep talk from your counsel. After you had some encouragement from me, you were honest and your explanation for the rejection of your claim in the United States makes sense. So, overall Sir, I don\u2019t have any other or any credibility concerns with regard to your claim.\n[14] So now, to talk about the well-foundedness of your claim or the well-foundedness of your fear Sir, I based my decision on the documentary evidence and the documentary evidence in Exhibit 3, Item 2.1, Section 8, Exhibit 4 which is your disclosure. All of those documents tell me that the Eritrean government enforces mandatory military service of its citizens and in some cases, the duration of military service is indefinite. Those who evade or in your case, desert military service are subjected to cruel and unusual treatment and punishment and they are in danger of torture and they do face persecution and they can even face death.\n[15] So, it is clear Sir, from the documentary evidence that there is a serious possibility that you would face persecution, should you return to Eritrea today and clearly because it is the State, that is the agent of persecution. There would be no state protection available to you and-, and for the same reason there would be no viable internal flight alternative available to you anywhere in Eritrea which is why those weren\u2019t placed on the table as issues at the outset of the hearing. So to conclude Sir, the Panel finds on a balance of probabilities that you have a well-founded fear of persecution in Eritrea based on your perceived political opinion and on your membership in a particular social group which would be military deserters. For that reason, the Panel finds you Sir, to be a Convention refugee pursuant to Section 96 of the Immigration Refugee Protection Act. The Refugee Protection Division accepts your claim.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n",

She fears persecution in India due to the inter-relationship of three factors: She is HIV-positive, she is a single female and she is of the Muslim faith.\nCredibility\n[2] The claimant provided a comprehensive narrative of what had happened to her in India in the form of a sworn affidavit consisting of 81 paragraphs over 15 pages. I find the information contained in this detailed affidavit to be credible and trustworthy evidence, for three main reasons.\n[3] First, the claimant\u2019s testimony was consistent with the affidavit and there were no contradictions, omissions or embellishments.\n[4] Second, I find it very hard to believe that any person would have the perspicacity to conjure up a false story of such length and detail and then be able to memorize same in order to \u2018correctly\u2019 answer questions regarding same.\n[5] Third, I have before me in evidence many items of corroborative documentary evidence. Before me are documents confirming the claimant\u2019s: marriage and divorce;[1] the deaths of the claimant\u2019s parents;[2] the claimant\u2019s miscarriage;[3] the claimant\u2019s acting career;[4] and diagnosis as HIV-positive.[5]\n[6] In view of the foregoing, I find the claimant to have been a credible and trustworthy witness and accept her account of her experiences in India as being the truth.\nWell-founded Fear of Persecution\n[7] In the documentary evidence that is before me, I note the following with respect to persons who are HIV-positive in India:\nThe stigma of AIDS\u2019 might sound like a phrase from another era but in India anyone who is HIV-positive or has AIDS continues to feel the whiplash of contempt and discrimination from the moment their condition is discovered.[6]\nThe latter is a mammoth task as both teachers and parents of the other children often rise up in disgust at the idea of having HIV-positive children in the same classroom. Mohanty says the hostility has not softened much ever since the case of Bency and Benson in Kerala caught the headlines. These two young siblings were left orphaned after their parents died of AIDS in 2000. Their grandparents continued raising them but when other parents heard of their condition, they forced the school to expel them.[7]\nMohanty thinks it will take \u201cdecades and decades\u201d before most Indians treat those with HIV\/AIDS fairly. Attitudes are changing, she concedes but far too slowly. She speaks of the Hyderabad landlord who, unusually, agreed to let the Desire Society rent his building to use as a home for the orphans. After a few years, Desire was able to buy some land and build its own home. It then vacated the building. \u201cThat landlord will curse us every day for the rest of his life. No one has been willing to rent the house since we moved out, just because our HIV-positive children, who have done nothing wrong, lived there,\u201d she said.[8]\nAccording to the plea, the patient had suffered an accident on August 9, 2017 following which he went to Babu Jagjivan Ram Hospital. However, one doctor Rajesh abused him for not revealing his HIV status and also referred him to the OPD department where he was given first aid treatment and his leg was plastered by them leading to formation of blisters and a possibility of development of gangrene. On August 30, 2017, the patient was referred for treatment to LNJP hospital due to non-availability of implants at Babu Jagjivan Ram. However, even LNJP failed to provide any treatment even though the referral slip mentioned the need of immediate surgery and discharged him after giving only first aid treatment and raw plaster. Following this, he got himself treated at a private hospital while refused by several others because of his HIV status.[9]\nOn October 5, a 27-year-old HIV-positive woman hanged herself from a pipe in Hyderabad\u2019s Osmania General Hospital \u2026 In another incident last month, doctors declared a 24-year-old pregnant woman admitted to Tikamgarh district hospital in Madhya Pradesh a \u2018human bomb\u2019 after she tested positive for HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. The confidential pathology report was leaked by the lab technician and within hours, everybody from the doctor to the nurse and the ward boy refused to treat her. She finally delivered twins, who died within 30 minutes of birth, unattended on the ward floor.[10]\nIn Uttar Pradesh\u2019s Bareilly district last year, an HIV-positive woman delivered a stillborn after a hospital in neighbouring Badaun refused to treat her because she didn\u2019t have Rs 2,000 to buy gloves for the hospital staff. Discrimination in both government and private health centres and hospitals is rife across states, say people living with HIV and AIDS (PLHA). \u201cParamedics and nursing staff and in some cases even doctors often refuse to take care of HIV+ patients,\u201d said Swapan Mallick (name changed), who has HIV and works with Bengal Network of PLHAs.[11]\nIndia\u2019s fight against AIDS is being jeopardised by a cut in social spending by Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s government, with health workers being laid off and programmes to prevent the spread of the deadly disease curtailed.[12]\nThe year 2016 marks the 30th anniversary of the first known case of HIV in India. While the number of new HIV infections in India declined by 25 percent from 2005 to 2013, the stigma of the disease remains strong.[13] [emphasis added]\nIn India, the stigma of HIV remains fierce. There are no Indian public figures such as Magic Johnson or Charlie Sheen who have made HIV more acceptable. Small \u201cpocket epidemics\u201d continue to emerge and several states in India have disproportionately high prevalence rates, reaching as high as 30 percent in some communities.[14] [emphasis added]\n[8] With respect to Muslims in India, the following from the documentary evidence is instructive:\nAcross India, students at other universities were organizing similar rallies against the Citizenship Amendment Act \u2014 a key policy of Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s Hindu nationalist government. The law offers amnesty to undocumented migrants from three neighboring Muslim-majority countries \u2014 but only if they are non-Muslim. Critics say that by excluding Muslims, the law establishes a religious test for Indian citizenship, in violation of the secularism enshrined in India\u2019s constitution. On Dec. 15, Renna and hundreds of her classmates were marching and waving protest banners on the campus of Jamia Millia Islamia, a historically Muslim university, when they came under attack by police. They had avoided a barricade and taken another route \u201cbecause we wanted to make it a peaceful kind of thing,\u201d she recalls. \u201cBut what we saw next was complete brutality. Police started chasing the protesters and beating them up.\u201d[15]\nSince mid-December, demonstrations have erupted across India, in communities of all faiths. The biggest police crackdowns have occurred in predominantly Muslim areas and human rights organizations say police have used excessive force.[16]\nThe death toll in the worst religious violence to hit India\u2019s capital in decades has risen to at least 37, health officials said. The violence was triggered after Muslims protesting against a discriminatory citizenship law were attacked by Hindu mobs. More than 200 people have been injured during four days of violence in Muslim-populated areas of northeast Delhi, with police accused of looking the other way as a mob on Sunday went on the rampage, killing people and damaging properties, including mosques.[17]\nThe deadly religious riots that have swept parts of the Indian capital are proving that women and children are often the most vulnerable victims in any conflict, writes the BBC\u2019s Geeta Pandey in Delhi. The violence in north-east Delhi has left more than 40 people dead and the victims include both Hindus and Muslims. For the thousands of Muslim women and children left homeless, the future appears bleak.[18]\nSocietal violence based on religion and caste and by religiously associated groups continued to be a serious concern. Muslims and lower-caste Dalit groups continued to be the most vulnerable.[19]\nThere were reports by nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) that the government sometimes failed to act on mob attacks on religious minorities, marginalized communities and critics of the government. Some senior officials of the Hindu-majority Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) made inflammatory speeches against minority communities. Mob attacks by violent extremist Hindu groups against minority communities, especially Muslims, continued throughout the year amid rumors that victims had traded or killed cows for beef. According to some NGOs, authorities often protected perpetrators from prosecution.[20]\nYet, this history of religious freedom has come under attack in recent years with the growth of exclusionary extremist narratives\u2013including, at times, the government\u2019s allowance and encouragement of mob violence against religious minorities\u2013that have facilitated an egregious and ongoing campaign of violence, intimidation and harassment against non-Hindu and lower-caste Hindu minorities. Both public and private actors have engaged in this campaign.[21]\n[9] With respect to the fact that the claimant is a single woman and a Muslim one who is HIV-positive, the following from the documentary evidence is of relevance:\nFor women living with HIV infection in India, stigma is a pervasive reality and the greatest barrier to accessing treatment, quality of life and survival.[22]\nThree years after religious riots in India, Muslim women who reported being gang raped during the violence are still waiting for their cases to be investigated while facing death threats and harassment for speaking out, Amnesty International said.[23]\nThe police brutality gave further impetus to national protests and quietly, the women of Shaheen Bagh joined in. Today, those women have become the face of the resistance. They are also the face of the uncertainty that women across India have felt since the Modi government began updating the NRC. Their fears are not unfounded. After the implementation of the NRC in Assam, 1.9 million people were found to be lacking papers for citizenship and, according to activists, 69 percent of them were women.[24]\nIndiaSpend [2] reports that single women have to \u201cdepend [on] somebody\u2019s goodwill \u2013 in-laws, parents, brothers and sisters-in-law\u201d in order to provide for them and their children (IndiaSpend 23 June 2018). In an article in the Hindu, an Indian daily newspaper, Sreemoyee Piu Kundu, [a columnist on sexuality and gender (IndiaSpend 23 June 2018)] who interviewed 3,000 single urban women in India, states that single women encounter \u201cserious struggles with basic life issues such as getting a fiat on rent or being taken seriously as a start-up entrepreneur or getting a business loan or even getting an abortion\u201d (The Hindu 29 Jan. 2018).[25]\nIndiaSpend indicates that \u201c[n]obody wants to rent to single women\u201d and that, according to Shikha Makan, an Indian filmmaker who directed a documentary, Bachelor Girls, on the difficulties that single women face when looking for housing in Mumbai, a woman is expected to live with her father or with her spouse (IndiaSpend 23 June 2018). According to The News Minute, \u201ca digital news platform reporting and writing on issues in India,\u201d particularly on southern India (The News Minute n.d.), the same documentary, which tells the stories of \u201cmobile, urban and educated\u201d single women, describes how women may need to visit numerous apartments before securing one and that they may face additional and \u201coften invasive\u201d questioning during the rental process (The News Minute 3 Dec. 2016).[26]\n[10] I am not making a finding that all persons who are HIV-positive necessarily face a serious possibility of persecution in India on that basis alone, nor that all Muslims necessarily face a serious possibility of persecution in India on that basis alone, nor that all single women necessarily face a serious possibility of persecution in India on that basis alone. However, given the documentary evidence, I do find that in the circumstances of this case, involving a woman who is single, a Muslim and HIV-positive, based on the cumulative effect of all three of those factors, this claimant does face a serious possibility of persecution. I further find, again based on the documentary evidence, that there is a failure of state protection.\nSubjective Fear\n[11] The claimant has taken several trips outside of India, prior to her journey to Canada, to countries such as Malaysia, Dubai, Germany and Switzerland. On each occasion, she returned to India without having sought refugee protection.\n[12] In view of my positive credibility assessment, the claimant\u2019s failure to seek protection prior to arrival in Canada has no negative impact on her claim, given the following jurisprudence:\nIt is almost foolhardy in a refugee case, where there is no general issue as to credibility, to make the assertion that the claimants had no subjective element in their fear.[27]\nNowhere did the Board member question the credibility of the applicants. Accordingly, the applicants\u2019 testimony is presumed to be true. The explanations provided during the hearing with regard to the three grounds of concern identified by the Board member should in turn be presumed to be true unless there are clear and specific reasons for disbelieving them. This is particularly true where the Board member has not articulated any reason for rejecting the applicants\u2019 explanations with regard to re-availment, delay in claiming and failure to provide corroborative documents on certain points \u2026 [28]\nThe RPD could not, in the absence of a negative general credibility finding, reasonably determine that the principal Applicant lacks subjective fear.[29]\nCONCLUSION\n[13] In consideration of all of the foregoing, I find that [XXX] is a Convention refugee and her claim is accepted.\n[1] Exhibit 7, items 1 to 3.\n[2] Ibid., items 5 and 6.\n[3] Ibid., item 4.\n[4] Ibid., items 8 to 13.\n[5] Ibid., item 15; and Exhibit 10.\n[6] Exhibit 6, item 1, \u201cIndia Passes HIV\/AIDS Anti-Discrimination Law but Stigma Endures\u201d, The Sunday Morning Herald, 18 April 2017, p.1.\n[7] Ibid., p.3.\n[8] Ibid., p.4.\n[9] Ibid., item 2, \u201cPanel to Look Into \u2018Abuse\u2019 of an HIV+ Patient by 2 Govt Hospitals in Delhi\u201d, Hindustan Times, 10 May 2018, pp. 6 and 7.\n[10] Exhibit 6, item 3, \u201cDenied Rights and Treatment, HIV Patients Still Fight Stigma\u201d, Hindustan Times, 30 October 2017, p.9.\n[11] Ibid., p. 10.\n[12] Exhibit 11, item 2, \u201cIndia\u2019s Fight Against AIDS in Jeopardy After Modi Vots\u2019s Cut in Social Spending\u201d, Huffington Post, 15 July 2017.\n[13] Ibid., item 6, \u201cStigma: The Blindspot of lndia\u2019s HIV Epidemic\u201d, Pulitzer Center, 13 June 2016.\n[14] Ibid.\n[15] Exhibit 12, item 6, \u201cOur Democracy is in Danger: Muslims in India Say Police Target Them With Violence\u201d, National Public Radio, 25 January 2020, p. 21.\n[16] Ibid., p. 23.\n[17] Exhibit 13, item 1, \u201cPeople Leaving Violence Hit-Areas in Delhi: Latest Updates\u201d, Al Jazeera, 26 February 2020, pp. 1 and 2.\n[18] Exhibit 15, \u201cDelhi Riots: Muslim Women Recall Horror of Molotov Cocktails and Arson\u201d, BBC, 29 February 2020.\n[19] Exhibit 3, National Documentation Package: India, 31 January 2020, item 2.1, \u201cCountry Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2018\u201d, United States Department of State, 13 March 2019, section 6.\n[20] Ibid., item 12.1, \u201cInternational Religious Freedom Report 2018\u201d, United States Department of State, 21 June 2019, Executive Summary.\n[21] Exhibit 3, item 12.2, \u201cUnited States Commission on International Religious Freedom 2019 Annual Report\u201d, Commission on International Religious Freedom, April 2019, p. 174.\n[22] Exhibit 11, item 5, \u201cWomen Living with HIV in India: Looking Up from a Place of Stigma, Identifying Nexus Sites for Change\u201d, Insight Medical Publishing Group, 22 May 2017, p. 13.\n[23] Exhibit 12, item 1, \u201cGang Raped Years Ago, Muslim Women in India Face Intimidation, Threats, Waiting for Legal Justice\u201d, Global Citizen, 10 February 2017, p. 2.\n[24] Ibid., item 7, \u201cIndia\u2019s New Laws Hurt Women Most of All\u201d, Foreign Policy, 4 February 2020, p. 31.\n[25] Exhibit 3, National Documentation Package: India, 31 January 2020, item 5.11, Response to Information Request no.

Seevaratnam\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Constance Nakatsu\nCountry: Tibet\nRPD Number: TB7-24959\nAssociated RPD Number(s):\nATIP Number: A-2021-00945\nATIP Pages: 000071-000082\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] The claimant, [XXX], claims to be a national of Tibet, who is claiming protection pursuant to section 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).[1]\nISSUES\n[2] The relevant issues at the hearing were exclusion pursuant to Article 1E of the Convention,[2] identity, nationality, credibility, well-founded fear of persecution, state protection, and internal flight alternative.\n[3] Matters relating to the applicability of Article 1E are referred to herein as \u201cexclusion issues.\u201d Matters relating to whether or not the claimant has a well-founded fear of persecution within the meaning of the Convention refugee definition are referred to herein as \u201cinclusion\u201d issues.\nEXCLUSION PURSUANT TO ARTICLE 1E\n[4] Article 1E of the Convention, which has been appended as a schedule to the IRPA, reads as follow:[3]\nE. This Convention shall not apply to a person who is recognized by the competent authorities of the country in which he has taken residence as having the rights and obligations which are attached to the possession of the nationality of that country.\n[5] In Shamlou, the Federal Court identified four criteria that this Division should look to in considering Article 1E: the right to return; the right to work; the right to study; and full access to social services.[4]\nIndia\n[6] The documentary evidence regarding the residency status afforded to Tibetans born in India is as follows from the Board\u2019s Response to Information Request (RIR):[5]\nUnder Indian law, anyone born between January 26, 1950 and July 1, 1987 on Indian soil or at least should be, according to the letter of the law, \u2026 and as affirmed by the High Court of Delhi, automatically an Indian citizen. This was proved to include Tibetans by a Delhi High Court decision on 22 December 2010. However, there is a large gap between this right, and a person being able to have that right recognized, and to then be able to access the related rights and privileges. Rather than there being a series of simple steps to follow in order to attain citizenship, our research findings show that in practice, Tibetans in India who were born within the correct time period in India are still unable to have their status as citizens officially recognized.\n[7] The RIR further indicates that, in practice, it is very difficult for Tibetans to be able to access Indian citizenship for two reasons:[6]\n1. The Indian authorities continue to treat Tibetans as foreigners, and\n\n2. There is an unwritten policy of the Central Tibetan Administration to not release No Objection Certificates (NOC).\n[8] The claimant\u2019s birthdate removes him from this law since he was born outside of the eligible birthdates and there is no evidence to suggest either of his parents were citizens of India at the time of his birth. Thus, it is not within his control to acquire the citizenship of India.[7]\n[9] In addition, the claimant does not have a birth certificate, a matriculation record since he only completed six school grades, or a driver\u2019s licence \u2013 all of which are documents which may be utilized to obtain Indian nationality. This evidence is corroborated by the documentary evidence.[8]\n[10] A media report from the Tibet Sun corroborates the non-issuance of the NOC. The article states that \u201c[i]n violation of the exile Tibetan charter, the Kashag (Secretariat of the Central Tibetan Administration) has ordered all the Departments under it to stop issuing NOC (no objection certificate) or any letter of support to Tibetans applying for Indian passport.\u201d[9]\n[11] Furthermore, the media report finds the following:[10]\nTibetans applying for Indian passport continue to face various forms of discrimination and harassment, and are left with no choice other than appealing in the courts for relief.\nThe discriminatory practices in processing the applications include imposition of arbitrary rules and ignoring government orders by the Regional Passport Offices (RPOs), and unsubstantiated adverse police verification reports by the local police officers.\n[12] Based on the claimant\u2019s evidence and the documentary evidence, there appear to be \u201csignificant impediments\u201d[11] to Tibetans obtaining Indian nationality. The Federal Court in paragraph 23 of its decision in Pasang stated that factors such as the level of education, employment, and residence within a Tibetan refugee settlement, must be taken into account.[12]\n[13] A Business Standard report from 2018 confirms that \u201cpeople born between January 26, 1950, and July 1, 1987, need to produce any of the 19 documents, including birth certificate \u2026 matriculation certification\u2026 \u201c[13] The article concludes that \u201c[e]ven people in the highest echelons of society and the bureaucracy have not proved their citizenship to the right authority.\u201d[14]\n[14] In Choezom,[15] the Federal Court judge found as follows:\nI find it difficult to accept this conclusion. It is self evident that the Applicant (with respect to the fundamental right of return and the nature of the residence in India) does have the same rights as an Indian citizen. The need for annual RC\u2019s [Registration Certificates], IC\u2019s [Identity Certificates], visas, NORI\u2019s [No Objection for Return to India] and the prohibition to visit certain locations within India are all antithetical to the \u2018basic rights of status as nationals\u2019. All of these rights are not permanent and their renewal is at the discretion of the Indian government. It may be changed at any time for political, geopolitical (i.e. the need for good relations with China) or security reasons. The fact that there is no evidence that the Indian government has so far refused to issue RC\u2019s, IC\u2019s, visas or NORI\u2019s does not mean it has given up the right to do so. The Tibetans\u2019 existence in India is thus at the sufferance of the Indian government. As right to stay at sufferance does not amount to \u2018the same basic rights of status as nationals\u2019 of India enjoy. In my view the Board erred in concluding that the Applicant falls within the exclusion set out in Article 1(E) of the Refugee Convention.\n[15] Having carefully considered the rights afforded to Tibetans in India, the panel finds that the claimant does not fit the criteria established in Shamlou.[16] Therefore, the claimant is not excluded pursuant to Article 1E.[17]\nINCLUSION\nIDENTITY\n[16] The claimant presented a letter from the Samyeling Tibetan Settlement Office (CTA) to establish that he is \u201ca bonafide Tibetan,\u201d[18] who resided at a house within the Samyelling Tibetan Colony in Delhi.[19]\n[17] In addition, the claimant provided a letter from the Regional Tibetan Freedom Movement providing his correct date of birth and his Green Book number.[20] A Green Book is issued by the Central Tibetan Administration (the Tibetan government in exile).\n[18] The panel noted a discrepancy in the date of birth provided by the claimant at the port of entry,[21] his BOC,[22] and by the Tibetan authority. This discrepancy was put to the claimant and he was provided a reasonable opportunity to explain. He testified that when he was asked by an immigration officer for his date of birth he knew he was born in the year [XXX], however, he was not certain of the month and date. He explained that he never celebrated his birthday. The panel is cognizant of the claimant\u2019s level of education and his loss of contact with his biological mother from a young age and his upbringing by his uncle and his wife. The panel accepts the claimant\u2019s explanation. Furthermore, counsel in her submissions indicated that the Tibetan authority at times keeps more accurate records than the Tibetan families.\n[19] The claimant has also provided an affidavit from [XXX], who was his neighbour when they lived within the confines of the Tibetan colony in India.[23] [XXX] was accepted as a Convention refugee and he is a Canadian citizen.[24]\n[20] At the hearing, the claimant provided the original letters issued by the Tibetan authority.\n[21] Throughout the hearing, the claimant testified fluently in the Tibetan language. The claimant spoke of the unique culture and religion practiced by the people from Tibet. He appeared to have a genuine faith in his religious leader, His Holiness the Dalai Lama.\n[22] Accordingly, the panel accepts the claimant\u2019s personal and ethnic identity as a Tibetan.\nNATIONALITY\n[23] The claimant was born in India to parents of Tibetan ethnicity. As discussed under the exclusion section, the claimant has not acquired Indian nationality.\n[24] The claimant testified that he was born in Delhi, India on [XXX],[25] to parents who he believes are Tibetans but he was not certain of their nationality. The claimant testified that he has never met his biological father and he was taken from his biological mother, [XXX],[26] and raised by his uncle, [XXX], since the age of four.[27] He indicated that his uncle did not acquire Indian nationality. He added that his uncle told him that his mother also did not acquire Indian nationality and thus, she remains a Chinese national. The claimant stated that he resided in India throughout his life, until his departure in 2017. The claimant testified that he received education until the sixth grade, where he was taught in the Tibetan and English languages. He believes the school was financed by the Tibetan government in exile. He further stated that he was never a national of India since he was never issued an Indian Resident card or an Indian\nIdentity certificate. The claimant considers himself to be Tibetan. He believes that given the Chinese occupation of Tibet, his life would be at risk and he fears persecution on religious and racial grounds as a Tibetan who worships his Holiness the Dalai Lama.\n[25] According to an official at the Chinese Embassy in Ottawa:[28]\nTibetans who have left Tibet since 1959 and who have not obtained the citizenship of a foreign country are considered to be Chinese citizens. Because China does not recognize dual citizenship, those Tibetans who have acquired a second citizenship are not considered to be Chinese citizens.\nIn general, children acquire the citizenship of their parents. Like their parents, if the foreign-born children of the above-described Tibetans have not obtained the citizenship of a foreign country, they are considered to be Chinese citizens.\nAccording to a representative of Asia Watch in New York, both the PRC [People\u2019s Republic of China] and the international community consider Tibet to be part of China; therefore, Tibetans are considered to be Chinese citizens\u2026 [footnotes omitted]\n[26] Accordingly, on a balance of probabilities, based on the information available on his birth and his parents\u2019 nationality, the panel finds that the claimant is a citizen of China. Thus, this is the only country of reference in this claim.\nCREDIBILITY\n[27] The claimant was a credible and trustworthy witness. His responses were consistent with his level of education. The oral evidence provided by the claimant was consistent with his BOC[29] and is supported by the documentary evidence. The plight of the claimant as a Tibetan is supported by the documentary evidence, which is current and reliable. In addition, the documentary evidence emanates from reputable sources which do not have a vested interest in the merits of this claim.\nWELL-FOUNDED FEAR OF PERSECUTION IN CHINA\n[28] The claimant regards himself as a Tibetan with a different language and culture from the Chinese. The claimant has never been to China and does not speak the languages. He regards his race and nationality as being Tibetan. He sees himself as a member of a social group, namely Tibetans.\nHistorical Context\n[29] There is overwhelming evidence regarding the 1959 Chinese invasion of Tibet and the Tibetan genocide that followed. The documentary evidence has established that human rights have been violated.[30]\nReligions Persecution\n[30] The claimant believes in His Holiness the Dalai Lama as his political leader and religious leader. He fears persecution by the government of China due to his religious beliefs.\n[31] According to the 2019 United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) Report for China:[31]\n\u2026[T]he Chinese government continued to persecute all faiths in an effort to \u201csinicize\u201d religious belief, a campaign that attempts not only to diminish and erase the independent practice of religion, but also the cultural and linguistic heritage of religious and ethnic communities, particularly Tibetan Buddhists and Uighur Muslims\u2026\n[32] The 2019 annual report indicates that \u201c[t]he Chinese government continued to use advanced surveillance technology and other measures to repress Tibetan Buddhists.\u201d[32]\n[33] Further, the USCIRF report states that \u201c[i]n 2018, the Chinese government continued to pursue a strategy of forced assimilation and suppression of Tibetan Buddhists throughout Tibet.\u201d[33] The Chinese government restricts and regulates religious practices in Tibet. Monasteries have been destroyed, monks and nuns have been forced to express their opposition to the Dalai Lama, Tibetans found in possession of banned religious books or prayers have been imprisoned. The report further states that \u201c[t]he Chinese government continued to accuse the Dalai Lama of blasphemy and \u2018splittism,\u2019 and cracked down on anyone suspected of so-called \u2018separatists\u2019 activities.\u201d[34]\n[34] Therefore, the panel finds that freedom of religion is denied to the claimant, as a Tibetan, should he be returned to China.\nSTATE PROTECTION\n[35] There is a presumption that except in situations where the state is in complete breakdown, the state is capable of protecting its citizens. To rebut the presumption of state protection, a claimant must provide clear and convincing evidence of the state\u2019s inability to protect its citizens.[35]\n[36] The claimant testified that his agent of persecution is the government of China.\n[37] According to a November 2016 report by the International Campaign for Tibet and the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH): \u201cOn 1 January 2016, China\u2019s new counter\u00ad terrorism law came into effect, despite serious concerns voiced by human rights groups regarding the potential for this law to be used to repress religious and ethnic groups.\u201d[36]\n[38] This report further states the following:[37]\nThese laws and other measures are essential components of a comprehensive security architecture being established by the Chinese authorities, encompassing military, political and Party propaganda objectives as well as heightened surveillance and media censorship. The dramatic expansion of the powers of military and police in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) \u2013 backed by grass roots propaganda work and electronic surveillance \u2013 comes under the general rubric of \u2018stability work\u2019, which is political language for the elimination of dissent and enforcement of compliance to Chinese Communist Party policies. Under the leadership of the Chinese Party Secretary and President Xi Jinping, the Chinese government is enforcing a comprehensive legal framework which represents an attempt to legitimize through legislation existing repressive measures designed to intensify control by the CCP [Chinese Community Party] and suppress dissent.\n[39] Moreover, \u201cChina\u2019s new counter-terrorism law allows for the conflation of domestic protest, dissent or religious activity with international terrorism thus reducing the pressure for governments to resolve both Tibetans\u2019 and Uyghurs\u2019 genuine grievances.\u201d[38]\n[40] The Tibetan Center for Human Rights and Democracy\u2019s 2018 annual report states the following:[39]\nThe arbitrary arrest and detention of peaceful Tibetan protesters and other human rights activists continued unabated. In particular, extended criminal detention preceding arrest has increased, providing more latitude to law enforcement officers to engage in violent interrogation and torture methods to obtain forced confessions. Other forms of illegal detention such as confinement in \u2018legal education centers\u2019 have increased after the abolition of Re-education Through Labour camps and the acceleration of political re-education campaigns in many parts of Tibet. Tibetans suspected of criminal offences, particularly those pertaining to political matters, are almost always denied the right to fair trial or a hearing. Very few Tibetans, if any, manage to exercise any rights to a fair trial.\nRestrictions on the freedom of peaceful assembly remained severe as Chinese police and paramilitary troops engaged in violent suppression of peaceful protesters calling for the return of the Tibetans\u2019 spiritual leader, His Holiness the Dalai Lama, freedom and human rights.\n[41] The same report notes:[40]\nSimilarly, the right to freedom of religion and belief was subjected to heightened levels of control and restriction, through the enforcement of the revised regulations on religious affairs, the implementation of the campaign against \u2018organised crime\u2019 particularly targeting religious institutions and practitioners, and the issuance of local directives to ban Tibetan schoolchildren from participating in religious activities. The policies known as \u2018adapting religion to socialism with Chinese characteristics\u2019 and \u2018sinicising Tibetan Buddhism\u2019 have led to an increase in compulsory political reeducation campaigns and an erosion of flexibility at the local level to control the religious education of minors, and limitations on informal places of worship.\n[42] The NDP[41] and the documentary evidence submitted by the counsel to the claimant[42] makes clear that the state is complicit in the violence committed against members of the Tibetan community. Accordingly, in these circumstances, it is clear and convincing evidence that the state is unable or unwilling to protect the claimant.\n[43] Thus, the panel finds that the claimant has met his burden of proof, on a balance of probabilities, and that the presumption of state protection has been rebutted.\nINTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE (IFA)\n[44] The Federal Court of Appeal established a two-part test for assessing an IFA in\nRasaratnam and Thirunavukkarasu:\n(1) As per Rasaratnam, \u201cthe Board must be satisfied on a balance of probabilities that there is no serious possibility of the claimant being persecuted in the part of the country to which it finds an IFA exists\u201d[43] and\/or the claimant would not be personally subject to a risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture in the IFA.\n(2) Moreover, the conditions in the part of the country considered to be an IFA must be such that it would not be unreasonable in all the circumstances including those particular to the claimant, for him to seek refuge there.[44]\n[45] The claimant bears the burden of proof to demonstrate that he would be persecuted on a Convention ground, or subject personally, on a balance of probabilities, to a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in all of China.\n[46] The claimant provided credible and consistent sworn viva voce evidence that the agent of persecution is the government of China. The claimant testified that he fears persecution throughout China due to his Tibetan ethnicity.\n[47] The documentary evidence indicates that there are obstacles to the freedom of movement for members of the Tibetan community. The Tibetan Center for Human Rights and Democracy\u2019s 2018 annual report states as follows:[45]\nThe right to freedom of movement includes the right of a person to enter his or her own country. Whether Tibetans are living in other countries as refugees or as citizens of other countries, they have the right to visit or return to Tibet because of the \u201cspecial ties to or claims\u201d in relation to their homeland. But in some areas of Tibet, Chinese authorities were seen implementing an undeclared policy that barred Tibetan refugees from returning to their hometowns. Although temporary permits to visit family and relatives are still issued selectively to some Tibetan refugees living in India, they are not allowed to move back permanently. A visiting Tibetan refugee from India was told by Chinese authorities in Dowa Township in Rebkong County, Malho (Ch: Huangnan) TAP that a new policy enforced since January 2018 no longer allows returning Tibetans to live permanently in their hometowns. There is no known evidence, either in written or oral form, of such policy promulgated by Chinese authorities. It appears to be one of the numerous ad-hoc measures imposed by local authorities as part of the \u2018stability maintenance\u2019 policy. [footnotes omitted]\n[48] Having carefully considered the totality of the evidence, the panel finds that there is a serious risk of persecution throughout China. Thus, in the particular circumstances of the claimant, who is of Tibetan, a viable internal flight alternative is unavailable.\nCONCLUSION\n[49] Having considered the totality of the evidence, the relevant statutory provisions, and jurisprudence, the panel finds that the claimant has demonstrated that there is a reasonable chance he would be persecuted on grounds of race, nationality, and religion, should he be returned to China today. Accordingly, the claimant has a well-founded fear of persecution.\n[50] For the above-mentioned reasons, the panel finds the claimant to be a Convention refugee.\n[1] The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), S.C. 2001, c.27, as amended, sections 96 and 97(1).\n[2] Ibid., Schedule (Subsection 2(1)), Sections E And F Of Article 1 Of The United Nations Convention Relating To The Status Of Refugees, Article 1E.\n[3] Ibid.\n[4] Shamlou, Pasha v.

Tinker\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Ian D. Hamilton\nCountry: Sri Lanka\nRPD Number: TB7-08356\nAssociated RPD Number(s):\nATIP Number: A-2021-00945\nATIP Pages: 000048-000052\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] The claimant, [XXX] is a citizen of Sri Lanka. The claimant claims to have well-founded fear of persecution at the hands of the Sri Lankan police, army as well as paramilitary groups due to his ethnicity as a young Tamil male from the north under sections 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).[1]\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] The claimant alleges that he [XXX] that was televised throughout Sri Lanka and, as a result, came to the attention of the EPDP (Eelan People\u2019s Democratic Party) who wanted him to sing for them at their parties and campaign. The claimant declined but continued to be harassed by the EPDP to the extent of being kidnapped in [XXX] 2013. The claimant agreed to sing for the EPDP and was released and went to Columbo. Due to harassment of his family by the EPDP, the claimant returned home and again was kidnapped and this time beaten by the EPDP members in [XXX] 2013. The claimant stated that he was able to escape during the night and through his family, left Sri Lanka and went to Thailand.\n[3] The claimant claimed for refugee protection through the UNHCR, however, never received an answer. In [XXX] 2015, a new president was elected in Sri Lanka who promised that it was safe for people to return. The claimant returned to Sri Lanka in [XXX] 2015.\n[4] The claimant indicated that the CID (the Criminal Investigation Department) questioned him extensively in [XXX] of 2016 concerning his stay in Thailand and his ties to the Tamil Tigers (the LTTE) as he had two uncles in that organization: one, a Major who was killed and another living in the United Kingdom, who was active on social media concerning the Tigers.\n[5] The claimant and his family again feared for his safety and made arrangements for him to leave the country. The claimant left Sri Lanka in [XXX] 2016 and went to Dubai but was sent back. The claimant, through an agent hid in Sri Lanka until he was able to leave and arrived in Canada on [XXX] 2017 and claimed for refugee protection shortly thereafter.\nDETERMINATION\n[6] I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee for the following reasons.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[7] The claimant\u2019s oral testimony and supporting documents filed[2] establish his identity as a citizen of Sri Lanka.\nCredibility\n[8] I find the claimant to be credible and therefore accept what he alleged in his oral testimony and his Basis of Claim form.[3] This case was very well documented: the claimant provided corroborating documents showing the results of his beating by the EPDP, photos of his uncles with the leader of the Tamil Tigers and proof of winning the singing contest in Sri Lanka.[4]\nNexus\n[9] I find that there is a link between what the claimant fears and one of the five Convention grounds, specifically, ethnicity as a young Tamil male from the northern part of Sri Lanka and therefore, the claim is assessed under section 96.\nPersecution\n[10] The claimant fears that if he were to return to Sri Lanka today, the police, including the CID as well as the EPDP would harm him due to his leaving the country for a considerable amount of time, first to Thailand for two years and then to Canada for three years. The claimant fears that the EPDP may kidnap and harm him again.\n[11] In arriving at my decision, it is necessary to consider the most recent country documentation which makes it clear the nature of the claimant\u2019s jeopardy if he were to return to Sri Lanka today.\n[12] I have reviewed the country documentation, both that was disclosed by counsel[5] as well as information in the most recent National Documentation Package.[6]\n[13] Although the civil war ended in 2009 and there was hope for the Tamils in Sri Lanka with the election of Maithripala Sirisena in January 2015, but all hopes were dashed with the election of Gotabaya Rajapaksa in November 2019. This government\u2019s current objective is \u201cto identify Tamil activists in the diaspora who are working for Tamil separatism and to destabilize the unitary Sri Lankan state.\u201d[7] Furthermore, as counsel pointed out in his submissions, the current government is using the Prevention of Terrorism Act to persecute any criticism of the government as an act of terrorism.[8] Freedom House has also indicated that the human rights situation has deteriorated significantly, especially in Tamil areas since the election of November 2019.[9] This Response to Information Request also states that there are abusive practices by the police and security forces including extrajudicial executions, forced disappearances, rape and torture against the Tamils.\n[14] As a returning young Tamil male, the claimant would also be harassed by the CID due to his family\u2019s prominent connections with the LTTE and the current and continuing presence of his uncle on social media in the United Kingdom. As counsel in his submissions indicated, due to the claimant\u2019s family connection with the LTTE, the Prevention of Terrorism Act could be used against the claimant under this current government and thus, could be subject to torture.\n[15] In summary, I find that due to the current government\u2019s treatment of Tamils in Sri Lanka, there is more than a mere possibility that the claimant would be persecuted if he were to return to Sri Lanka.\nCONCLUSION\n[16] I therefore determine that the claimant is a Convention refugee. The Refugee Protection Division therefore accepts his claim.\n[1] Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c.27, sections 96, 97(1)(a) and 97(1)(b).\n[2] Exhibit 1, Package of information from the referring CBSA\/IRCC; Exhibit 5, Photocopies of birth certificate, National Identity Card.\n[3] Exhibit 2, Basis of Claim (BOC) form, TB7-08356.\n[4] Exhibit 6, Claimant\u2019s Supporting Documents \u2013 Photos of torture, singing contest and uncles, received [XXX], 2017.\n[5] Exhibit 4, Country Conditions documentation.\n[6] Exhibit 3, National Documentation Package (NDP) for Sri Lanka (September 1, 2020).\n[7] Ibid., item 4.11.\n[8] Ibid., item 2.6.\n[9] Ibid., item 13.1.\n\n",

These are the reasons for the decision in the claim of [XXX] who has declared to be a citizen of Yemen and is claiming refugee protection pursuant to Sections 96 and Subsection 97.1 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[2] I should tell you before we proceed any further that this is a positive decision for you.\n[3] You allege the following. You were born in Saudi Arabia. Your parents are Yemini and do not have citizenship in Saudi Arabia. You were living in Saudi Arabia pursuant to your father\u2019s residency permit which was tied to his work as a doctor in Saudi Arabia. You left Saudi Arabia with your family when you were nine years old to live in Yemen where you lived until 2015 and then returned the following year to continue your studies.\n[4] You do not have citizenship in Saudi Arabia and have no right of residency there. You allege that you are at risk of death and detention and serious harm because you oppose the Houthi militias and the Houthi takeover of power in Yemen. You also fear that the Houthi militias will force you to fight for them. You further allege that your family is from Taizz and the Houthis perceive people from that region as being opposed in interest to them.\n[5] Moreover, you allege that the Houthis know that you have spent time in Saudi Arabia and they see you as aligned with Saudi interests. You allege that you were mistreated by the Houthi militia several times because you oppose them and refuse to join them and attend their gatherings. You allege that on [XXX] 2015 you left Yemen for Saudi Arabia with your family. You returned to Yemen after approximately one year because you wanted to continue your university studies after which you intended to return to Saudi Arabia.\n[6] You allege that on [XXX] 2018 you were home alone when approximately twelve armed Houthi militia members arrived in two armored cars and accused you of being aligned with the cause of Saudi Arabia and accused you of having explosives in your car. They broke in, detained you, took your phone, wallet and keys and everything of value in your home. They blindfolded you, called you a traitor, beat you and threatened to kill you.\n[7] They took you to an unknown location and accused you of being a Saudi agent. You were released after three days and left for Saudi Arabia several days later. You only returned to Yemen briefly to renew your Saudi Arabian residency. You left Saudi Arabia for the United States on [XXX] 2019 and came to Canada several days later. And your claim was referred to the Refugee Protection Division shortly thereafter.\nDetermination\n[8] I find that you are a \u201cConvention Refugee\u201d as you have established a serious possibility of persecution on account of your real or imputed political opinion against the Houthi militias and the Houthi takeover in Yemen. And your imputed political opinion in favor of the Saudi Arabian coalition forces. As such I find that you have established a nexus to Section 96 of the Refugee Convention.\nAnalysis\nIdentity\n[9] I find that your identity as a national of Yemen is established on a balance of probabilities by your testimony and the supporting documentation filed including your Yemeni passport.\n[10] Before I proceed any further with the analysis of your claim I would like to deal with the issues of your status in Saudi Arabia. While you were born in Saudi Arabia and lived there until you were nine your status has always been temporary and dependent on the sponsorship of a family member, your father who is employed there.\n[11] According to the objective documentary evidence Saudi Arabia does not grant citizenship to people in your circumstances and does not offer permanent residency status for foreigners. Given your written statements and the documents on file I am satisfied that you had only temporary status there and it cannot be concluded that you have had or could have rights and obligations akin to the possession of nationality in Saudi Arabia.\n[12] I am therefore satisfied that you have no permanent status either residency or citizenship in any other country aside from Yemen at this time. I make this conclusion in reliance on your testimony and the country condition documents found at tabs. 3.1, 3.4, 3.5 and 3.7 of the National Documentation Package for Saudi Arabia, March 29, 2019 version.\nCredibility\n[13] I find you be a creditable witness and therefore I believe what you have alleged in support of your claims. You testified in a straightforward manner although you were nervous. There were no relevant inconsistencies in your testimony or contradictions between your testimony and the other evidence before me which has not been satisfactorily explained.\n[14] In particular, you testified creditably as to your opposition to the Houthis militias and their take over of Yemen. You testified creditably as to your refusal to advocate for their cause and the mistreatment you suffered at the hands of the Houthi militia because of their perception that you are on the side of the Saudi regime.\n[15] I questioned you on your return to Yemen several times after the Houthis started visiting your home and your return to Yemen after you were detained by the Houthis in [XXX] 2018. Particularly your return to Yemen in [XXX] 2019.\n[16] You explained that you returned in 2016 only to complete your university studies and you did not intend to remain and that you tried to stay out of their way. And that before the [XXX] 2018 incident they had only verbally threatened you. You further explained that you returned in [XXX] 2019 only to renew your residency status in Saudi Arabia so that you could continue to live there for the time being.\n[17] I find your explanations in this regard to be reasonable in the circumstances and in consideration of the whole of the evidence including your personal profile and the country conditions evidence as to the current situation in Yemen I do not find that your behavior in that regard impugns your credibility generally or to be a determining factor in this case.\n[18] In addition, I questioned you on your failure to claim asylum in the United States despite having arrived in the United States before coming to Canada. You explained that you did not claim asylum there because of the current Trump administration\u2019s stance on immigration. Considering the current climate around immigration in the United States I find your explanation to be reasonable and I find that your failure to claim in the United States does not impugn your credibility generally.\n[19] I have also considered the documents that you submitted into evidence namely your confirmation of admission to university in Yemen at Exhibit E2, a copy of your father\u2019 s Yemeni passport demonstrating his birth place of Taizz at Exhibit E3, a copy of your birth certificate demonstrating your birth in Saudi Arabia and your parents Yemeni nationalities at Exhibit E4 and your Saudi Arabian residency card at Exhibit E5. You have also submitted several articles on the recent actions of the Houthi movement and militia.\n[20] After reviewing the documents, I have no reason to doubt their authenticity and coupled with my findings as to your creditable testimony I find that these documents corroborate your allegations. In consideration of the above I find that you have established your key allegations on a balance of probabilities and that you have a subjective fear of return to Yemen.\nProspective Risk of Return to Yemen\n[21] A Claimant must demonstrate that they would face a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground if they were to return to their country or that on a balance of probabilities return to their country would subject them personally to a danger of torture or a risk to their life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. You have indicated that if you return to Yemen your life would be at risk. You would be considered an enemy by the Houthis because of your refusal to join them and advocate for them and because of your background as having lived in Saudi Arabia and your family ties there as well as your family\u2019s background in Taizz.\n[22] In considering your prospective risk of return to Egypt I have taken into consideration your personal profiles and your particular situation at the present time. I note that in your case you are a twenty-five-year-old single man. Your parents are from Taizz. You were born in Saudi and spent much of your childhood there. Your parents and most siblings have returned to Saudi Arabia and continue to live there. I have also taken into consideration the objective\n[23] I have taken into consideration the objective documentary evidence as to the current situation in Yemen particularly for those who are perceived as anti-Houthi or anti-militia and those who may be perceived as being in favor of the Saudi led coalition against the Houthi rebel groups.\n[24] The objective evidence clearly demonstrates that Yemen is the sight of an armed conflict that has lasted for several years and continues to this day involving the Houthis Sele rebels primarily from the northern region and forces loyal to the internationally recognized government based in the southern region.\n[25] The civil war began around 2015 when foreign powers led by Saudi Arabia intervened to support the government of President Hadi against the Houthi rebel movement and forces linked to the former president Sele. The conflict involves numerous armed groups or militias and all parties to the conflict have been reported to have committed serious violations of human rights including arbitrary executions, acts of torture, arbitrary detentions and use of weaponry against the civilian population.\n[26] The evidence further indicates that the armed groups engage in forced recruitment including the forced recruitment of child soldiers. The internationally recognized Yemeni government is said to be incapable of securing the whole of the territory. The evidence further indicates that those who are perceived as opponents to the Houthis including those perceived as supportive of the former regime and thus aligned with Saudi Arabia as well as their family members are at risk of violence from the Houthi militias. This includes risks such as death, disappearance, detention and kidnapping for ransom which are clearly persecution.\n[27] In considering this country evidence I refer specifically to Tabs 1.5, 1.7, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5 and 5.1 of the National Documentation Package for Yemen.\n[28] I have also taken into consideration the profile of your agents of persecution, the pro\u00ad Houthi armed groups operating in Yemen. It is clear that armed groups including the Houthis engage in acts of violence against persons that they view as opponents and that this treatment amounts to persecution particularly for those who are perceived as aligned with Saudi Arabia.\n[29] In consideration of the objective documentary evidence and your creditable allegations I find that you have all established that you face a future risk in Yemen to being subjected to serious harm or violence including disappearance, detention and death and also in consideration of your particular profile I find that you have established that you are also at risk of forced recruitment into those armed groups or militias which you are opposed to.\n[30] As such I find that your subjective fear of returning to Yemen is objectively well-founded and that you face a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground, namely that of your real or imputed political opinion if you were to return to Yemen.\nState Protection\n[31] I find that it would be objectively unreasonable for you to seek the protection of the state in light of the current circumstances. I have discussed the objective documentary evidence concerning the current situation in Yemen. I have also discussed the setting of the major civil armed conflict that is going on there. The central state has either collapsed or lost control over large segments of the territory.\n[32] Serious crimes against humanity have been committed by internationally recognized government forces and opposition forces with impunity. Disregard for the rule of law is widespread and impunity is persistent and pervasive throughout the country. The evidence further demonstrates that civilians are disproportionately affected by the hostilities to the extent that thousands of people have been displaced.\n[33] In view of this evidence and in consideration of your personal profile I find that you have rebutted the presumption of state protection with clear and convincing evidence that the state or any other force exerting governing authority in Yemen is unable or unwilling to help you.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[34] Given your profile and the country conditions I find that no viable internal flight alternative exists for you in Yemen. The conflict exists throughout the country with notable divisions between the northern and southern regions. As well as pronounced sectarian divisions throughout the country. The Houthis and other armed groups are present throughout the country and the risks faced by you are not limited to any particular region in the country.\n[35] I also recall the absence of state protection for you throughout Yemen. In consideration of the country documents and your particular circumstances I find that you face a serious possibility of persecution throughout Yemen on the basis of your real or imputed political opinion and that there is no viable internal flight alternative available to you there.\nConclusion\n[36] Based on the analysis above I conclude that you a \u201cConvention Refugees\u201d and accordingly I accept your claim. That concludes our hearing.\n\n",

In hearing and deciding your claim, I apply the Chairperson\u2019s Guidelines 4 on women refugee claimants fearing gender-related persecution.\n[2] And the decision I find that you are a Convention refugee under s. 96 of Canada\u2019s Immigration and Refugee Protection Act as you face a possibility of persecution in Cameroon based on your membership in a particular social group, that being the anglophone minority in Cameroon.\n[3] As far as your allegations, in summary, you submit that you are a member of the minority anglophone community which has been marginalized and discriminated against by the francophone majority in Cameroon.\n[4] You allege that your father was a traditional leader in your hometown of [XXX] who was actively involved in speaking out for the rights of the anglophone minority and that he also supported anglophone separatist fighters.\n[5] On [XXX] the [XXX] 2018, you allege that military personnel came to your house in [XXX] looking for your father. And to escape, you ran into the bush and walked for hours to your aunt\u2019s house in a neighbouring town. You allege that the military returned a few days later and broke into your house. You further allege that your father is still missing and that some of his close friends were killed by the military.\n[6] You departed Cameroon on [XXX] the [XXX], 2018, and arrived in Canada on [XXX] \u2014 sorry, you departed on [XXX] and arrived in Canada [XXX] of 2018. And you filed for your refugee protection claim on [XXX] the [XXX] of 2018.\n[7] (audio cuts out) that you are afraid to return to Cameroon because of the continued harms (ph) perpetrated against anglophones by the government and also that you fear separatist fighters who might target you because they believe you have funds as a result of you living abroad.\n[8] As far as your identity, this was established by certified copy of your Cameroon passport and your birth certificate.\n[9] Regarding credibility, overall, I found you to be a credible witness and believe the allegations in your claim. You testified in a straightforward manner and there were no inconsistencies in your testimony or contradictions between your testimony, your BOC narrative, and the documentary evidence before me.\n[10] To support your claim, you provided documentary evidence, including sworn statements from your mother and two aunties corroborating the events described in your narrative and testimony. You also provided articles about the ongoing conflict and the situation of anglophones in Cameroon.\n[11] You established your identity as a member of the minority anglophone community through your credible testimony and the documentary evidence, including your birth certificate which shows that you and your parents were born in anglophone areas of Cameroon, documents from your elementary, secondary, and tertiary schooling in Cameroon at English institutions, and a sworn statement from your mother corroborating your allegations.\n[12] You testified credibly about the events that occurred in Cameroon causing you to flee your home and your concerns about your father who is still missing and your other family members who have been displaced. You also testified credibly about the ongoing conflict in Cameroon and your fears of the harm that you might face if you were to return.\n[13] Your allegations about the persecution of anglophones in Cameroon were supported by the objective documentary evidence. Reports in the National Documentation Package at tabs 2, 4, and 13 indicate ongoing conflict in the northwest and southwest anglophone regions of Cameroon. There are reports of widespread human rights abuses carried out by government security forces against civilian anglophone populations, including extra judicial killings, torture, arbitrary arrest, sexual violence against women, and massive displacements of civilian populations. The reports also note atrocities being carried out by non-\u00adstate separatist fighters. The documentary evidence highlights the longstanding marginalization of the anglophone population and restrictions on their rights to political expression and freedom of expression with reports of people being arrested and killed for violating these restrictions.\n[14] Overall, considering your testimony and the documentary evidence, I find that you have established on a balance of probabilities that you have a subjective fear of persecution in Cameroon based on your membership in the anglophone minority, which is objectively founded.\n[15] I also considered state protection. The objective evidence supports your allegations that government security forces are the primary agents of persecution. And accordingly, I find that it would be unreasonable for you to seek state protection.\n[16] I also considered whether you have a viable internal flight alternative in Cameroon. Considering that the government is the primary agent of harm here and the objective evidence, which shows that persecution of anglophones across the county, I find that you do not have a viable internal alternative \u2014 sorry, internal flight alternative in Cameroon.\n[17] So, to conclude, having considered ail the documentary evidence and your testimony, I find that you, [XXX], face a serious possibility of persecution under s. 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act due to your membership in a particular social group, the anglophone minority in Cameroon. Accordingly, I find that you are a Convention refugee and I accept your claim for refugee protection.\n[18] COUNSEL: Thank you.\n[19] CLAIMANT: Thank you.\n[20] MEMBER: So, thank you very much for your participation today. And congratulations, and I do wish you all the very best.\n[21] CLAIMANT: Thank you.\n[22] COUNSEL: Thanks very much.\n[23] MEMBER: So, this hearing is now concluded. The time is 10:37 a.m.\n[24] COUNSEL: Thanks.\n[25] MEMBER: Thank you.\n[26] CLAIMANT: Thank you.\n[27] COUNSEL: Okay.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013\n\n",

Being a minor and without legal representation, you were not allowed to speak, got sentenced one year of prison and were flogged 127 times.\n[13] You benefitted from the Prince forgiveness and were allegedly released after 53 days, but not before you were flogged 127 times.\n[14] Upon your release, you were treated at home by your mother and resume school following an agreement with the school direction, allowing you to finish your high school.\n[15] Your family and yourself decided that it would be better for you to pursue your studies abroad considering this incident and you left the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for the USA in 2011.\n[16] You obtained a University degree in [XXX], but during your stay in the USA, you returned only twice for one week each time as you did not like being there.\n[17] Upon your return in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 2017 and after you had experienced religious freedom in the USA, you had more and more problems to comply with religious regulations.\n[18] You had difficulties at Panasonic in Jeddah as you had been challenged on your religious belief or practice when it was time for the compulsory prayer.\n[19] You have also been arrested and detained for a day and a half as a result of your nonconformity appearance, considering that wearing an earring in the Kingdom is not very common.\n[20] Based on your previous arrest, detention and torture, while you were still a minor for simply being with teenagers of your age including boys and girls, you developed [XXX] and [XXX] since your return to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, as you did not feel secure anymore and considering that you could not easily surrender your freedom of conscience.\n[21] On [XXX] 2018, you met [XXX], a childhood friend whom you have not seen for years.\n[22] Your discussion deviated to the lifestyle in the USA compared to the prevailing in the Kingdom and you expressed criticism toward the religion and the government.\n[23] Later on, you saw the same friend in a police uniform when on your way to the gym as you were driving your brother\u2019s car, you were pulled aside and requested to accompany him to the station for further investigation.\n[24] You immediately and spontaneously started running in order to escape and you went to your apartment where you received a call eventually from your brother saying that the police had already come to the family residence.\n[25] Being already in possession of a valid US visa, you called a travel agency and booked the first flight for the USA the next day at 4:00PM.\n[26] The next day, you rushed to the airport, waited for your flight and entered the USA the same day on [XXX] 2018.\n[27] You testified that you simply wanted to leave your country at that time as you knew that with a previous police file, you would be mistreated due to your opinion toward religion and the Kingdom.\n[28] You came to Canada on [XXX] 2018, after being in the USA for two days during which you had done research on the web and you claimed asylum.\n[29] A warrant of arrest was issued against you on [XXX] 2018, while you were in Canada but was made aware of it on [XXX] 2020.\n[30] You are fearful to go back to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia as you will be arrested and detained.\nDECISION\n[31] I find that you are a refugee, pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA, as there exists a serious possibility of persecution, should you return to Saudi Arabia, on account of your: religion, political opinion.\nIdentity\n[32] I find that your identity as a national of Saudi Arabia is established by the documents provided, namely your passport which was seized by the Canadian Border Services Agency and accordingly, you have met your burden.\nCredibility\n[33] I find you to be a credible witness and therefore believe what you alleged in support of your claim.\n[34] You testified in a straightforward manner and there were no relevant inconsistencies in your testimony or contradictions between your testimony and the other evidence before me.\n[35] Initially, the tribunal had to confront you on some interrogations pertaining to your subjective fears (failure to claim asylum in the USA and returns to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia) and the absence of supporting evidence concerning your conviction in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\n[36] The question of subjective fear was raised as I noted that you did not seek asylum in the USA where you studied from 2011 to 2017, and you returned to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia upon completing your University degree in the USA. However, the evidence indicates that you were only seventeen years old when you went to the USA and you testified that you had not made yet this decision to leave for ever your country, especially that you were missing your mother. This explanation seems reasonable in your alleged circumstances, especially the age factor and therefore does not raise significant concerns with respect to subjective fear or credibility\n[37] I further note that Refugee Protection Division (RPD) rule 11 requires you to provide acceptable documents establishing elements of your claim, or a reasonable explanation indicating why they were not produced.\n[38] You were indeed asked why you did not produce your court file and you stated that since you were a minor, your father had all the documents but forbid all discussions as they are still in Saudi Arabia and he is afraid of the repercussion of the family members, since it is of public knowledge that the Kingdom does not hesitate to pressure or persecute the remaining family members present in Saudi Arabia, to pressure the individual abroad to come back or comply with their request, and the claimant added that even his brother in California did not want to get involved and for the same reasons, did not issue any statement.\n[39] Ultimately, the claimant declared that without his father\u2019s collaboration, he simply could not provide any document pertaining to his past arrest and detention as he was a minor unrepresented and all the documents were in the hands of his father who did not want to collaborate as he was extremely fearful of the potential consequences over the security of the family present in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\n[40] Moreover, during that period, a diplomatic crisis was opposing Canada and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the Kingdom spying attempts over their nationals in Canada were observed as it more fully appears from the objective documentary evidence.\n[41] I therefore find the explanation to be reasonable and coherent with the objective evidence.\n[42] Finally, the following evidence establishes your allegations as set out above the warrant of arrest issued by the State (Exhibit 4, item E-19). After reviewing the said document, I have no reasons to doubt its authenticity. Consequently, considering the testimonial evidence and this supporting evidence, the tribunal may easily conclude that shall you return to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, you will be arrested and detained.\nObjective basis\n[43] Given that there are no serious credibility issues with respect to your allegations, coupled with the documentary evidence set out below, I find that you have established a prospective risk of being subjected to the following harm(s): arrest, detention and torture.\n[44] This risk is corroborated by the following documents:\nThe DOS Report for 2019 (Exhibit 3- item 2.1) mentions:\n\u201cThe law also penalizes anyone who challenges, either directly or indirect\/y, the religion or justice of the king or crown prince(\u2026).\u201d\n\u201cStatements that authorities construed as constituting defamation of the king, monarchy, governing system, or Al Saud family resulted in criminal charges for citizens advocating government reform.\u201d\n-and-\nSignificant human rights issues included unlawful killings; executions for nonviolent offences; forced disappearances; torture of prisoners and detainees by government agents; arbitrary arrest and detention; political prisoners; arbitrary interference with privacy; criminalization of libel, censorship, and site blocking; restrictions on freedoms of peaceful assembly, association, and movement; severe restrictions of religious freedom; citizens\u2019 lack of ability and legal means to choose their government through free and fair elections; trafficking in persons; violence and official discrimination against women, although new women\u2019s rights initiatives were implemented; criminalization of consensual same-sex sexual activity; and prohibition of trade unions.\u201d\n[45] The Human Right Watch Report (Exhibit 3, item 2) states that:\n\u201cSurveillance is extensive inside Saudi Arabia, and even Saudis living abroad are vulnerable ta spying. In October, the University of Toronto\u2019s citizen Lab found surveillance software on the phone of Omar Abdulaziz, a Saudi dissident living in Canada who was in regular contact with Khashoggi before this assassination\u201d.\n[46] The Saudi Arabia World Report 2020 Events of 2019 from Human Right Watch (Exhibit 3, items 2-5) corroborated similarly situation for minor under the penal justice in Saudi Arabia in the following terms:\n\u201cSaudi Arabia applies Sharia (Islamic law) as its national law. There is no formal penal code, but the government has passed some laws and regulations that subject certain broadly defined offences ta criminal penalties. In the absence of a written penal code or narrowly-worded regulations, however, judges and prosecutors can convict people on a wide range of offences under broad, catch-all charges such as \u201cbreaking allegiance with the ruler\u201d or \u201ctrying to distort the reputation of the kingdom.\u201d Detainees, including children, commonly face systematic violations of due process and fair trial rights, including arbitrary arrest.\u201d\n[47] Finally, the Report from Saudi Arabia: Freedom of the World from Freedom House 2019 (Exhibit 3, items 2-4), is well describing the socio-political reality of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia:\n\u201cSaudi Arabia\u2019s absolute monarchy restricts almost all political rights and civil liberties. No officials at the national level are elected. The regime relies on extensive surveillance, the criminalization of dissent, appeals to sectarianism and ethnicity, and public spending supported by oil revenues to maintain power. Women and religious minorities face extensive discrimination in law and in practice. Working conditions for the large expatriate labor force are often exploitative.\u201d\n[48] The above stated objective evidence is describing the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia as a theocracy which persecute all forms of dissidence.\nNature of the harm\n[49] I have examined your claim under section 96 of the IRPA, as I conclude that the risk you describe constitutes persecution based on at least one of the grounds prescribed in section 96, specifically your religion and political opinion.\nCONCLUSION\n[50] In light of the preceding, I conclude that you are a refugee, pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA. Accordingly, I accept your claim.\n\n",

They are seeking refugee status pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA). The principal claimant is the designated representative of her two minor children.\nDETERMINATION\n[2] The Panel finds that the claimants are \u201cConvention Refugees\u201d under subsection 96 of the IRPA for the reasons indicated below.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[3] The identity and nationality of the claimants have been established to the satisfaction of the Panel by taking into account the photocopy of their Nigerian passports contained in their respective files.[1]\nALLEGATIONS\n[4] The principal claimant\u2019s Basis of Claim form (BOC), particularly her narrative and amendments, describes the details of her fear to return to Nigeria due to the violence she could face at the hands of her husband and his family, in addition to their insistence that their daughter, the claimant [XXX] be forced to a Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) performed on her. Given some of the content of this claim, which includes sensitive matters such as domestic abuse, the Panel took into consideration the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 4 of the Refugee Protection Division: Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution.[2]\n[5] The principal claimant, accompanied by her counsel, testified via videoconference during the hearing. Given some significant additions and modifications to the narrative, notably that she was the victim of domestic abuse in Nigeria the claimant was asked to explain. The claimant answered that she had provided the modifications and new evidence to her former counsel who did not file these documents to the Refugee Protection Division (RPD).\n[6] In addition, she has recently had considerable personal issues such as a car accident and the recent surgery and hospitalization of her son following a serious cycling accident resulting in a ruptured pancreas, he was hospitalized on [XXX] 2020, and released a few days before the hearing on [XXX] 2020. Given that several documents were not submitted to corroborate these issues as well as the fact that she had just begun the preliminary process to divorce from her agent of persecution, the panel allowed the claimant the opportunity to submit these documents after the hearing. As such, several documents were submitted as evidence and the file was under reserve as of [XXX] 2020.\n[7] This additional evidence provided plausible explanations to explain some of the inconsistencies which were outlined during the hearing.\n[8] Given some of the context of the claim, including the evidence submitted before the hearing as well as Exhibits C-102 to C-106, submitted post-hearing, notably attesting the serious medical issues encountered by the claimants as well as the principles of Guideline 4, despite some contradictions and details regarding some aspects of the claims, the Panel concludes that the claimant\u2019s fears appear to be genuine, on a balance of probabilities, as such the Panel will extend the benefit of the doubt and conclude that it is possible that she has been subject to years of violent domestic abuse as described during her testimony, in addition that her daughter could be subject to a forced FGM procedure.\n[9] Sadly, as the Panel can notice throughout the National Documentation Package (NDP) regarding Nigeria, staggering levels of violence towards women are unfortunately a frequent occurrence in that country. Notably page 30 of tab 2.1 of the NDP shows that \u201cThe law criminalizes rape, but it remained widespread. In March, UNICEF released a report noting that about one in four girls and one in ten boys were victims of sexual violence prior to their 18th birthday.\u201d[3]\n[10] Furthermore, page 34 from tab 1.4 of the NDP states that \u201cRape is common and widespread; societal stigma reduces the likelihood of victims reporting it or of perpetrators being prosecuted or punished.\u201d[4]\n[11] The Panel also took into consideration some of the other elements submitted as evidence. Notably, at pages 6 to 34 from the objective country evidence submitted by the claimants in Exhibits C-3 to C-12 regarding the ongoing practise of FGM, which demonstrates that despite some efforts, it is still unfortunately widespread across Nigeria.\nState Protection\n[12] Given, the above findings, the Panel must examine state protection. The leading jurisprudence, notably in Ward Canada (Attorney General) v. Ward, 1993 CanLII 105 (SCC), [1993] 2 SCR 689, teaches us that States are presumed to be capable of protecting their citizens except in situations of a complete breakdown. In addition, the presumption that a state is capable of protecting its citizens underscores the principal that international protection comes into play only when a refugee claimant has no other recourse available. To rebut the presumption of state protection claimants must provide clear and convincing evidence of the State\u2019s inability to protect its citizens.\n[13] In the present case, the claimant tried to obtain State protection. In addition, the claimant fears the repercussions from corrupt police.\n[14] In such cases, the panel is often guided by findings contained in objective evidence in order to ascertain the plausibility of the absence of state protection.\n[15] The claimant did submit some objective evidence in Exhibits C-30 and C-31 detailing the current state of widespread violence and corruption. The Panel also found similar findings in the NDP, particularly related to the state protection apparatus, notably at exhibits 2.1 and 1.4, respectively:\nThere were several reports that the government or its agents committed arbitrary, unlawful, or extrajudicial killings. The national police, army, and other security services sometimes used lethal and excessive force to disperse protesters and apprehend criminals and suspects.\u201d[5]\nAuthorities did not always hold police, military, or other security force personnel accountable for the use of excessive or deadly force or for the deaths of persons in custody.\u201d[6]\nPolice remained susceptible to corruption, committed human rights violations, and operated with widespread impunity in the apprehension, illegal detention, and torture of suspects.\u201d\nAccording to US DoS, the judiciary in Nigeria was affected by understaffing, underfunding, inefficiency, political interference, bribery, lacking equipment and training. As a result, the judiciary could not function adequately. Freedom House drew similar conclusions in its report for 2016.[7]\nThe Nigerian Police force has been criticized for corruption and human rights abuses by researchers and organizations over the years. In a recent study, the relationship between the police and the public in Nigeria was called perhaps the most troublesome in sub-Saharan Africa. Another source notes that the Nigerian Police Force is widely perceived by the public as the most corrupt violent institution in Nigeria.\nIn 2010 Human Rights Watch (HRW) concluded that the police was not only extorting money of ordinary civilians, but also that criminal suspects with money could simply bribe the police to find their own way out. HRW also reported that at least 100 000 police officers were hired as personal guards by the wealthy, at the expense of the majority.[8]\n[16] By considering the evidence in its entirety, the Panel finds that on a balance of probabilities, an individual with the profile of the claimant and the specific circumstances of this case has rebutted the presumption of state protection.\nINTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE (IFA)\n[17] Several cities were suggested. However, by considering the profile of the principal claimant, who was abused by her husband for several years, this abuse was unfortunately not limited to her but to her son as well. In addition, her daughter fears to be forced to undergo an FGM and by taking into account the conclusion regarding state protection, finding a safe IFA is not a viable option per the Panel. Given the family link with the agent of persecution and the claimants it would be very possible that he can retrieve them and continue with his violent ways towards them. Furthermore, by considering some of the objective evidence from the NDP on page 16, from tab 1.4 as well as page 37 from tab 2.1, we see that despite its vast size and population, it is not simple or in many cases feasible to relocate, of course, depending on an individual\u2019s profile:\n\u201cNigeria is a large and complex country, with much internal variation, but the main divide that is brought up by Nigerians and foreign commentators alike, is the divide between the country\u2019s south and north. This divide is based on historical, environmental, economic, cultural, linguistic, religious and political differences between these two parts.\u201d[9]\n\u201cThe country\u2019s ethnically diverse population consisted of more than 250 groups speaking 395 different languages. Many were concentrated geographically. Three major groups\u2013 the Hausa, Igbo, and Yoruba\u2013 together constituted approximately one half the population. Members of all ethnic groups practised ethnic discrimination, particularly in the private sector hiring patterns and the segregation of urban neighbourhoods. A long history of tension existed among some ethnic groups.\u201d[10]\n[18] After considering the evidence in its entirety, the Panel finds that on a balance of probabilities, an individual with the profile of the claimant and the specific circumstances of this case could not find a viable IFA in Nigeria.\nCONCLUSION\n[19] For all these reasons, the Panel concludes that the claimants [XXX] and [XXX] are \u201cConvention Refugees\u201d and therefore accepts their refugee claims.\n[1] Document 1 \u2014 Package of information from the referring Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) or Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC): Copy of passports.\n[2] Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 4 of the Refugee Protection Division: Guideline issued by the Chairperson pursuant to Section 65(3) of the Immigration Act: Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution.

He is seeking asylum under section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).\nDECISION\n[2] The Panel concludes that the Claimant has established that he faces a serious possibility of persecution in Haiti, on the basis of his membership in a particular social group, namely Haitian men who are HIV-positive.\n[3] The Panel therefore finds that he is a \u201cConvention refugee\u201d pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA and accepts his claim.\nSUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS\n[4] The Claimant\u2019s detailed allegations are contained in his Basis of Claim form (BOC).[1]\n[5] In summary, the Claimant fears for his life if he were to return to Haiti, as he is HIV- positive and the legal and socio-cultural environment of Haiti is hostile and even violent towards individuals with HIV, such that they may be attacked or discriminated against, may be denied medicine, food and shelter, and will not receive police protection.\n[6] The Claimant left Haiti around 1999 due to threats against him related to a family dispute and threats from his girlfriend\u2019s brother, and went to the Dominican Republic, where he remained for 12 years under temporary residence visas that he kept renewing.\n[7] He then met an American woman of Haitian origin and they married, before moving to the United States (U.S.) together in [XXX] 2012. The Claimant had the status of a conditional resident of the U.S., which was based on his marriage to a U.S. citizen. This status allowed him to receive a U.S. permanent resident card in [XXX] 2012 that was valid until [XXX] 2014.\n[8] The relationship deteriorated, as the Claimant alleges that he was the victim of abuse by his wife and her adult son. His wife kicked him out of the house, and he found himself homeless.\n[9] In 2014, the Claimant became ill and went to a hospital, where he was diagnosed with HIV.\n[10] The Claimant applied for the renewal of his U.S. conditional resident status on its expiry. He then applied to remove the conditions of his residential status in 2016, by submitting various documentation to the U.S. authorities in an attempt to demonstrate that he had been in a good-faith marriage that had ended due to abuse, including a personal statement to explain his situation, a police report regarding an incident with his wife\u2019s son, a letter from a [XXX], three affidavits in support of his application, and the marriage certificate.\n[11] The Claimant received a notice in [XXX] 2017 from the U.S. authorities that required him to submit additional documentation in support of his application, including proof of children of the marriage, proof that he and his wife had a common residence, a joint bank account statement with his wife and any joint financial planning arrangements. As the Claimant had no children with his wife, had been kicked out of the house, was in fact homeless and did not have a joint bank account with his wife, he had no additional documentation to provide.\n[12] The notice informed the Claimant that he must provide the additional documentation by [XXX] 2017 and that if he failed to do so, his application could be denied. As the Claimant did not believe that he could obtain any further documentation to satisfy the request, fearing deportation, he left for Canada in [XXX] 2017.\n[13] The Claimant claimed asylum here in [XXX] 2017.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[14] The personal and national identity of the Claimant is established, on a balance of probabilities, by the documentary evidence on file, specifically his Haitian passport[2].\nExclusion 1E: Status in the United States\nIntervention by Minister\n[15] The Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (the Minister) intervened in writing and in person at the hearing, regarding a possible exclusion under section 1E of the Convention[3].\n[16] The Minister submitted that the Claimant should be excluded under section 1E due to his conditional resident status in the U.S., which they submit is a status with rights similar to that of nationals in the U.S., because he had left the country before receiving a confirmation as to whether or not that status had been revoked, after having taken appropriate action to remove the conditions associated with his conditional resident status.\n[17] The Minister\u2019s position is that because the Claimant did not wait to receive a conclusive response regarding his status and did not return to the U.S., he should be considered to have voluntarily abandoned his conditional resident status in the U.S.\n[18] The Minister also submitted that the Claimant showed an absence of subjective fear that undermined his credibility, due to his decision to leave the U.S. and not return.\nStatus of the Claimant in the United States\n[19] The Claimant lived in the U.S. from [XXX] 2012 to [XXX] 2017. He was granted conditional resident status there in [XXX] 2012, which had been set to expire in 2014, but was then renewed and extended in [XXX] 2016 for another year.\n[20] According to the national documentation package for the United States, conditional residents have the right to work without restrictions, to study, to access social services, to leave and return without requiring a visa.[4] This information was also reflected in the exhibits of the Minister relevant to this issue.[5]\n[21] The Panel finds that the Claimant, as a conditional resident in the U.S., had rights that were substantially similar to those of nationals of that country.\nClaimant\u2019s Lass of Status in the United States\n[22] The Claimant\u2019s conditional resident status had been extended until [XXX] 2017,[6] prior to him receiving a notice in [XXX] 2017.[7]\n[23] The [XXX] 2017 notice indicated to the Claimant that if he did not provide additional documentation in support of his application to remove the conditional status of his residence, his \u201ccase may be denied.\u201d\n[24] The Claimant left the U.S. in [XXX] 2017.\n[25] Conditional residents who travel abroad for an extended period of time may apply for a re- entry permit prior to leaving the United States, which the Claimant did not do.\n[26] Conditional residents who fail to apply for a re-entry permit and who have lived outside the U.S. for more than two years may apply for a returning visa outside the country, but are not guaranteed admission into the U.S.\n[27] Given that the Claimant had left the country in [XXX] 2017 and given that his conditional resident status had only been extended to [XXX] 2017; given that the Claimant had applied to remove the conditions of his status, but had been told to provide further documentation that he then did not provide, failure to do so was advised that his application could be denied; given that the Claimant did not apply for a re-entry permit before leaving the U.S.; given that the Claimant did not apply for a re-entry permit after leaving the U.S., and more than two years have passed; the Panel finds that, on the balance of probabilities, the Claimant had lost his conditional resident status on the day of the hearing.\nZeng Analysis\n[28] The Panel must therefore examine the factors set out in Zeng[8], and consider the reason for the Claimant\u2019s loss of status (voluntary or involuntary) in the United States; whether he could return to the country, the risk that he would face in his home country of Haiti, Canada\u2019s international obligations, and any other relevant facts.\n[29] The Claimant alleges that he left the U.S. after trying to stabilize his status there, by submitting an application and supporting documentation in order to remove the conditions of his residence there.\n[30] The Claimant had submitted the following documents in support of his application: a personal statement; a police report; psychotherapy and counselling letters; three affidavits; a document indicating his residence; a budget letter; medical records; photographs; and his marriage certificate.\n[31] The Panel considers that the efforts put in by the Claimant to regularize his status in the\nU.S. by renewing his conditional resident status, then by applying to remove the conditions on his residence, were reasonable. He prepared the necessary paperwork and provided numerous documents in support of his application.\n[32] The Panel considers that the decision of the Claimant to leave the United States, in the face of being advised that his application could be refused for not providing additional documentation, was reasonable due to his inability to provide the additional documentation requested by the authorities: he and his wife did not have children, so he could not provide any documents in that regard; he had been kicked out of the matrimonial home and did not have any documents that indicated his name was associated with the matrimonial home, as he had testified that the home was leased in his wife\u2019s name; the Claimant did not have a joint bank account with the wife; and finally, the Claimant and his estranged wife had not made any joint financial arrangements.\n[33] It is therefore entirely reasonable that the Claimant would consider that he did not have the required documentation in order to finalize his claim for status in the U.S. The Panel finds that his decision to leave was based on his understanding that, on the balance of probabilities, his claim would be denied due to a failure to provide the additional documents. His failure to apply to re\u00ad enter the U.S. is also found to be reasonable when looking at the facts through this spectre.\n[34] The Panel finds that the departure of the Claimant can therefore be deemed involuntary, as he believed that his failure to provide further documentation to the U.S. authorities would lead to his status being denied and his deportation back to Haiti. The Panel finds that in the context that the Claimant believed himself, on the balance of probabilities, to face deportation from the U.S. for the reasons just described, it is reasonable to believe that the Claimant believed that he had no choice but to leave.\n[35] The Panel finds that the Claimant is credible with respect to his allegations of fear of return to Haiti as an individual who is HIV-positive. The Claimant\u2019s testimony regarding his reaction to finding out that he had HIV and his resulting alienation from family members in Haiti, including his sister who stopped talking to him after learning that he was HIV-positive, was credible and consistent with the socio-cultural environment in Haiti for HIV-positive individuals, as indicated in the national documentation package for Haiti.\n[36] When considering Canada\u2019s international obligations, the Panel finds that the Claimant would face the serious possibility of persecution in Haiti based on his HIV status, as discussed more fully below, and that this engenders refugee protection.\n[37] The Panel therefore considers that Canada would be respecting its international obligations under the Convention by granting the Claimant asylum due to his credible allegations regarding his loss of status in the U.S. and his fear of return to Haiti.\nConclusion regarding Exclusion\n[38] The Panel therefore concludes that the Claimant is not excluded under section 1E of the\nConvention.\nNexus to the Convention\n[39] The allegations of the Claimant establish a nexus to the Convention. He faces persecution based on his membership in a particular social group, which is HIV-positive Haitian men.\n[40] His claim, therefore, has been analyzed pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA.\nCredibility\n[41] The Panel will only discuss the Claimant\u2019s credibility with respect to his allegations regarding his HIV status, as this status is sufficient to meet the requirements of the IRPA. It is therefore not necessary to analyze the other allegations for the purpose of his claim.\n[42] The Panel finds that the Claimant is credible for the following reasons:\n[43] Testimony provided under oath is presumed to be truthful unless there is a reason for doubting its truthfulness.[9] In this claim, the Panel has no such reason.\n[44] The Claimant provided detailed testimony regarding the circumstances under which he discovered himself to be HIV-positive, as well as producing documentary evidence.[10] He also testified in a straightforward fashion about the impact this status had on his relationship with his family members in Haiti, as well as the treatment that he would expect should he return to Haiti, including violence, due to widespread cultural prejudices against those with HIV.\n[45] The national documentation corroborates the testimony of the Claimant. One source indicates that there are \u201cwell-documented cases of people living with HIV\/AIDS who experience stigma and discrimination and who are denied services because of their HIV status in the workplace, in education and health care, and even in communities where there are people living with HIV\u201d.[11] Furthermore, the objective documentary evidence indicates that the rights of those with HIV are violated in other areas as well, including with respect to non-discrimination, housing, care, social security, assistance and well-being.[12]\n[46] The country conditions are such that there is no legal protection in Haiti against discrimination based on HIV-positive status.[13]\n[47] Prejudice against people living with HIV is prevalent in Haiti, as indicated by a 2012 survey that indicates 57.7 percent of adults would not buy vegetables from a shopkeeper or vendor if they knew that the person had HIV.[14] 61 percent of women and 55 percent of men reported discriminatory attitudes towards people living with HIV.[15]\n[48] The attitudes and treatment of people in Haiti living with HIV are connected to the overall prejudice in that country against those perceived to be homosexual, which is why those who seek treatment for HIV also face the danger of violence based on that perception of their sexual orientation: \u201ceven the mere suspicion of homosexuality may trigger violence\u201d.[16]\n[49] Furthermore, beyond the absence of a law that prohibits discrimination against those with HIV, there is a lack of police protection for those perceived to be engaging in same-sex acts: \u201cHaitian authorities do not generally respond when faced with violent acts against individuals who are sexual minorities.\u201d[17]\n[50] The objective documentary evidence indicates at length that anyone perceived as homosexual faces violence not only by other civilians but by police as well.[18] The country conditions are replete with examples of people who seek police protection in Haiti for acts directed at them because of their perceived sexual orientation and are often ridiculed by police, who may either refuse to file a report or may even further victimize and humiliate them, including with physical assaults.[19]\n[51] The country evidence therefore demonstrates that the Claimant faces a serious possibility of persecution in Haiti, based on his membership in a particular social group, specifically HIV\u00ad positive Haitian men.\n[52] For all of these reasons, the Panel finds that the Claimant\u2019s allegations are credible.\n[53] The Panel, therefore, finds that the Claimant has established, on a balance of probabilities, that he faces the serious possibility of persecution if he returns to Haiti, based on his membership in a particular social group, that of HIV-positive Haitian men. The Panel finds that the Claimant has established, on a balance of probabilities, that he is HIV-positive, which he discovered when he went to a hospital in the U.S. after falling ill in 2014.\n[54] The Panel concludes that the Claimant faces a forward-looking serious possibility of persecution based on the aforementioned findings.\nState Protection\n[55] Considering the evidence previously stated that discrimination against people with HIV is not legally prohibited in Haiti, in addition to the objective documentary evidence as discussed regarding the tendency of the police to tum a blind eye to violence against those perceived to be a sexual minority in Haiti, or even sometimes themselves be the perpetrators of violence against those perceived to be a sexual minority in Haiti, the Panel finds that state protection would not be available to the Claimant, if he were to approach the state for protection.\n[56] The Panel concludes that the Claimant has provided clear and convincing evidence that has rebutted the presumption of adequate state protection.\nInternal flight alternative\n[57] The Panel finds that the Claimant faces a serious possibility of persecution throughout Haiti.\n[58] The country evidence before the Panel is that violent and hostile attitudes towards HIV\u00ad positive individuals are prevalent throughout the country. The Panel finds that there is nowhere in Haiti the Claimant could relocate that would be safe and reasonable, due to his HIV status.\n[59] There is, therefore, no viable internal flight alternative for the Claimant anywhere in Haiti.\nCONCLUSION\n[60] For all of these reasons, the Panel finds that the Claimant has established a subjective fear of return to Haiti that is objectively well-founded.\n[61] The Panel concludes that the Claimant has established that he faces a serious possibility of persecution in Haiti in accordance with section 96 of the IRPA.\n[62] The Panel, therefore, finds that he is a \u201cConvention refugee\u201d pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA and accepts his claim.\n[1] Document 2 \u2014 Basis of Claim Form (BOC).\n[2] Document 1 \u2014 Package of information from the referring Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) or Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC): Passport.\n[3] Document 6 \u2014 Minister\u2019s Notice of Intervention and Exhibits M-1 to M-6.\n[4] Document 5 \u2014 National Documentation Package, United States, 31 January 2020 (NDP USA), tab 3.2: The Immigrant Visa Process, United States, Department of State;\nDocument 5 \u2014 NDP USA, tab 3.4: Report on Citizenship Law: United States of America, European University Institute, European University Democracy Observatory on Citizenship, Peter J.

He was also attacked by the Taliban in [XXX] 2013, in Ghazni Province, and he was shot at in Kabul in [XXX] 2019.\n[5] These threats and assaults all took place in Ghazni province, the claimant\u2019s family\u2019s place of origin in Afghanistan, with the exception of the attack in Kabul in [XXX] 2019.\n[6] The claimant knows persons in his situation and\/or with his profile who have been killed by the Taliban. He identifies them in his narrative.\n[7] The claimant left Afghanistan and traveled to Canada on a visitor visa in [XXX] 2019.\n[8] The claimant is afraid that he will be killed or harmed by AGEs because of his employment and profession.\nDETERMINATION\n[9] I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee as he has established a serious possibility of persecution on account of his race, religion and political opinion for the following reasons.\nANALYSIS\n[10] The determinative issue in this case is credibility.\nIdentity\n[11] I find that the claimant\u2019s identity as a national of Afghanistan is established by the documents provided: passport; national identity card.[2]\nCredibility\n[12] The claimant testified in a straightforward manner and there were no material contradictions, inconsistencies, or omissions in his testimony. He provided detailed and spontaneous testimony about his employment history as a [XXX] for [XXX].\n[13] Based on the documents in the file, I have noted no serious credibility issues. In particular, the following evidence helps to establish the allegations as set out above: employment agreements and contracts; copies of employment identification cards; education documents. After reviewing the documents, I have no reason to doubt their authenticity.\n[14] I do not draw any significant negative inference from the fact that the claimant failed to claim asylum in [XXX] or Canada in 2018, or [XXX] in 2019, and the fact that he did not leave Afghanistan until [XXX] 2019 notwithstanding his valid Canadian visitor visa. Firstly, I accept the claimant\u2019s testimony that he believed that he was relatively safe in Kabul from the threats in his home province, providing he took basic precautions, which I accept that he did. He realized that this assumption was erroneous when he was attacked in Kabul in 2019. He did not delay in leaving Afghanistan after this incident. Secondly, the claimant was motivated to return to Afghanistan despite some level of risk, after completing his Master\u2019s degree in [XXX] which he believed would increase his capacity to help his country. Thirdly, his trip to [XXX] took place before the attack in Kabul, and its purpose was to seek medical treatment for family members. Overall, I find that these considerations do not undermine the claimant\u2019s credibility or his subjective fear of persecution in Afghanistan.\nWell-founded fear of persecution\n[15] The available country evidence in the National Documentation Package (NDP)[3] establishes that there is an objective basis for the claimant\u2019s fear, and that he falls under numerous intersecting risk profiles, contributing to his overall situation of risk.\n[16] According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Eligibility Guidelines for Afghanistan,\n[17] AGEs [anti-government elements] are reported to systematically target civilians who are associated with, or who are perceived to be supporting the Afghan Government, pro\u00ad-Government armed groups, Afghan civil society and the international community in Afghanistan, including the international military forces and international humanitarian and development actors. The (perceived) association with any of these actors may arise for example through current or former employment or family ties. Civilians who have been targeted include district and provincial governors, judicial and prosecution staff, former and off-duty police officers, tribal elders, religious scholars and leaders, women in the public sphere, teachers and other civilian government workers, civilians perceived to oppose AGE values, human rights activists, and humanitarian and development aid workers. Between 1 January and 31 December 2017, UNAMA attributed 570 targeted killings to AGEs, which caused 1,032 civilian casualties (650 deaths and 382 injured) and accounted for 10 percent of all civilian casualties during the year. The number of such incidents perpetrated by AGEs increased from 483 in 2016 to 570 in 2017, and the number of civilians killed in such incidents increased by 13 per cent.[4]\n[18] According to the EASO report on \u201cAfghanistan Individuals targeted by armed actors in the conflict\u201d.\n[19] In 2016, UNAMA recorded 481 incidents targeting government officials, including judges, prosecutors and judicial staff but not including ANSF, resulting in 521 casualties. For example, in 2016 in Kandahar City, there was a continued spree of execution style killings of civilians working for or perceived as having connections with, the local authorities\u2026 [However] [t]argeting by the Taliban is not limited to those who are government employees, but also to those who are accused of being a supporter of the government. In 2013, UNAMA documented 246 attacks against civilians who had no official affiliation to government, NGOs or recognised civilian institutions (i.e. medical, education, elections, development programming). These attacks against civilians resulted in 532 civilian casualties\u2026 Through their parallel judicial system, the Taliban also punished those they accused of being a spy, and passing on information on the Taliban to the government. According to Giustozzi, spying for the government is considered a crime per se, without the possibility to repent.[5]\nThe UNHCR also reports that,\nThere are reports of individuals who returned from Western countries having been threatened, tortured or killed by AGEs on the grounds that they were perceived to have adopted values associated with these countries, or they had become \u201cforeigners\u201d or that they were spies for or supported a Western country. Returnees are reportedly often treated with suspicion by the local community as well as by State officials, leading to discrimination and isolation. Individuals who fall under other profiles, such as profile 1.e (humanitarian workers and development workers) and profile 1.e (women in the public sphere) may similarly be accused by AGEs for having adopted values and\/or appearances associated with Western countries, and may be targeted for that reason.[6]\n[20] The claimant is also a member of a minority ethnic or religious group in Afghanistan, having self-identified his ethnicity as Hazara. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Guidelines, ethnicity and religion in Afghanistan are inextricably linked, especially in the case of Hazaras.[7] The objective evidence shows that Hazaras suffer discrimination and are victims of violent attacks by AGEs. A Response to Information Request (RIR) from the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB) states that \u201cthe position of Hazaras as an overwhelmingly Shiite non-Pushtun minority makes them an easy target for the overwhelmingly-Pushtun Taliban seeking to rebuild support from Sunni Pushtun groups\u2026\u201d[8]\n[21] On a balance of probabilities, I accept that the claimant worked as a [XXX] for [XXX] in Afghanistan; that this information came to the attention of the Taliban, initially in Ghazni province; and that he is a member of a minority ethnic or religious group in Afghanistan, that is targeted by AGEs merely on the basis of race or religion. The country evidence establishes that the claimant faces a well-founded fear of persecution.\nState Protection\n[22] While states are presumed to be capable of protecting their nationals, it was open to the claimant, according to the law, to rebut the presumption of protection with \u201cclear and convincing\u201d evidence.[9]\n[23] The evidence in the National Documentation Package shows that while state authorities in Kabul and other cities controlled by the government may be willing to offer protection, in general that protection is unlikely to be effective or adequate.\n[24] Additionally, according to the U.S. Department of State, corruption in the police and justice system is pervasive.\n[25] I find, on the evidence, that the claimant has rebutted the presumption of state protection.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[26] I have considered whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for the claimant. On the evidence before me, I find that there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout Afghanistan.\n[27] The available country information establishes that with respect to state protection, the central government is generally strongest in Kabul and possibly a few other big cities such as\nHerat and Mazar-i-Sharif.[10]\n[28] However, the preceding analysis has shown that even in Kabul and Mazar-i-Sharif, state protection is ineffective and inadequate for persons in the claimants\u2019 situation.\n[29] Additionally, there is evidence that the Taliban are able to find a person who relocates to a different area, particularly when targeting their \u201cwell known or well positioned opponents.\u201d\n[ 30] Also, the Taliban generally has the capability to track individuals, through the use of \u201cformal and informal communication\u201d networks to obtain information about a person\u2019s whereabouts. While it is more difficult to track people who have moved into urban environments, even there the Taliban have spies and members who can gather considerable\ninformation.[11]\nCONCLUSION\n[31] Based on the analysis above, I conclude that the claimant is a Convention refugee. Accordingly, I accept his claim.\n[1] Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n[2] Exhibit 1.\n[3] Exhibit 3.\n[4] Exhibit 3, National Documentation Package, Afghanistan, 31 March 2020, tab 1.5: UNHCR Eligibility Guidelines for Assessing the International Protection Needs of Asylum-Seekers from Afghanistan.

Khan\nCountry: Kenya\nRPD Number: VB9-09240\nAssociated RPD Number(s):\nATIP Number: A-2021-00800\nATIP Pages: 000186-000191\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: Okay, welcome back, we\u2019re now on the record again. Okay, good news, I am going to accept your claim, okay? And I\u2019m going to give you my decision and reasons for doing so today, okay?\n[2] All right, so it\u2019s the beginning of the next chapter, I\u2019ll give you the decision and reasons now.\n[3] This is the decision of the Refugee Protection Division in the claim of [XXX], a citizen of Kenya, who is claiming refugee protection pursuant to Section 96 and Subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. Your identity has been established on a balance of probabilities by a copy of your Kenyan passport found at Exhibit 2.\nALLEGATIONS:\n[4] You fear return to Kenya because you fear persecution, including death threats and imprisonment because of your sexual orientation as a gay man. You left in [XXX] of 2019 and travelled directly to Canada. You provided significant details in your Basis of Claim form. Your passport is at Exhibit 1, and your Basis of Claim form is at Exhibit 2. I will highlight some of your details of your narrative and testimony today in this decision. I have also reviewed and applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline Nine, Proceedings Before the IRB Involving Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression. And in particular I am mindful of the socio-cultural context of a sexual minority who has lived in a country where same sex activities are criminalized, and societal violence continues today against sexual minorities in Kenya.\nDETERMINATION:\n[5] I find that you have established that you are a Convention refugee pursuant to Section 96 of the Act for the reasons that follow.\nANALYSIS:\nCredibility\n[6] You testified in a straightforward and consistent manner today, and I find that you are a credible witness.\nWell-founded Fear of Persecution and Nexus\n[7] As I\u2019ve indicated, you\u2019ve testified in a straightforward manner today. You provided details with respect to your sexual orientation in particular. You gave details about your relationship with [XXX], which was a long-term relationship of approximately 11 years. You testified that you met [XXX] while you were both working for [XXX]. You testified that you and [XXX] kept this relationship secret because it\u2019s illegal to be in an open gay relationship in Kenya. You testified that you would do weekend trips together, go watch rugby games together. You testified that your wife, [XXX], did not know about this. You testified that you married [XXX] in 2018, but you had known her and been with her since 2007, and your son with [XXX] was born in [XXX]. You testified that your understanding is that [XXX] did not, although she had suspicions, she did not fully know that you were gay until after you had already arrived in Canada when she understood why you had left Kenya.\n[8] You testified that your career was going well and that you had a good life in Kenya. But as a result of threats, extortion, blackmail, from your former boyfriend, [XXX], that the threats became so significant up until before you left in 2019, that you feared for your life.\n[9] You also testified that one of the threats that you returned by text was a photo of your son and an indication that the texter (ph) knew that \u2013 where your son went to school. And at that point you testified you understood that these threats were very serious. And you testified that the relationship ended with [XXX] in 2011, and subsequent to that [XXX] would ask you for money, as you testified he considered that you should look after him, paying rent, buying things for him, or he would threaten to out you or tell others that you were gay. And so out of fear you continued to financially support [XXX] over the years.\n[10] You testified that you later learned that [XXX] was part of a larger group that was involved in extortion and threats against sexual minorities in terms of outing them if they did not pay rent according to the demand.\n[11] You also provided genuine testimony today regarding your life experience as a gay man in Kenya, and the fears that you had in terms of making sure that no one ever knew about your sexual orientation. You testified about the struggles that you had in coming to Canada. You testified that you were homeless and had nothing when you first arrived in Canada and it was through the Mennonite Church and the Sunshine House where you felt welcome as a gay man and you were able to get on your feet and get a home.\n[12] You testified that you\u2019ve been able to open up about things that have happened to you and about your sexual orientation for the first time in your life here in Canada where you\u2019ve been free. You\u2019ve testified that you have issues because of the trauma because of this relationship with [XXX], and so you\u2019ve testified that you have trust issues and you\u2019re not ready for another relationship. You also testified that you spoke to your wife about a month ago and you testified that you have no idea where that relationship is at or whether she has any interest in the relationship with you. You testified that she was in disbelief and shock and not a positive response to coming to grips with the fact that you are a gay man, from your wife\u2019s perspective, as you testified.\n[13] Based on the totality of the evidence before me, I find that you have established a nexus to a Convention ground, membership in a particular social group due to your sexual orientation as a gay man. You also provided corroborative documents at Exhibit 4, including the letter from the Sunshine House with respect to your sexual orientation. As well as some of your employment documents, education documents, as well as identity documents including your marriage certificate to [XXX]. And this is found at Exhibit 4.\n[14] The objective evidence supports your fear of return to Kenya as a gay man, and at the National Documentation Package, item 2.1, which is a U.S. Department of State Report it indicates that there is criminalization of homosexuality in Kenya. The National Documentation Package, item 6.1, which is a report from an international association supporting sexual minorities, and it specifically outlines section 162 of the Penal Code which criminalizes same-sex activities. It further gives more details regarding the persecution of sexual minorities in Kenya, including by the police officers. It indicates that police officers will do forced anal examinations with respect to finding proof that an individual is a sexual minority.\n[15] It also indicates that there are reports of mob violence and beatings against sexual minorities throughout Kenya, and the police will then arrest the victim, the person who is a member of a sexual minority after the mob has beaten them. The penalty for same-sex activities in Kenya continues to be 14 years in prison. The National Documentation Package, item 2.2 which is a Human Rights Watch Report, also indicates that the human rights abuses in Kenya are perpetrated by security forces and the police. There continue to be extrajudicial killings and disappearances. And it also indicates that the High Court in Kenya upheld the laws against same-sex activities in Kenya. So, unfortunately, today the situation for sexual minorities in Kenya is very dire indeed.\n[16] With respect to State protection and internal flight alternative. Given the objective evidence that the State is an agent of harm against sexual minorities, such as yourself as a gay man, I find that there is no State protection available to you as they are the perpetrator of the human rights abuses that you would face in Kenya.\n[17] Further, given that the laws against sexual minorities cover all of Kenya, I find that it would be neither safe nor objectively reasonable in all of the circumstances, including your particular circumstances as a gay man, to try to relocate anywhere in Kenya to be safe. Accordingly, I find that there is no Internal Flight Alternative available to you.\nCONCLUSION:\n[18] For the foregoing reasons, I determine that you are a Convention refugee pursuant to Section 96 of the Act and the Board, therefore, accepts your claim.\n[19] Okay. Thank you, Counsel, and, sir, I wish you all the best in all of your future endeavours, okay?\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n",

Since there is no birthright citizenship in Kuwait, he does not have any status there. He and his family moved back to Jordan in 1990. After finishing university in 1999, the principal claimant took a job in the United Arab Emirates and has lived there ever since.\n[3] The associated claimant is a [XXX]-year-old stateless Palestinian who was born in a refugee camp in Syria. Her family moved to the UAE when she was two months old because her father was politically active and faced arrest by the Syrian government. She has lived in the UAE ever since then. In 2004, the associated claimant married the principal claimant.\n[4] In [XXX] 2011, the associated claimant travelled to Syria for a visit. During this visit, the war broke out and she was detained along with other family members because authorities were seeking her uncle. They beat her and questioned her about the political activities of her father\nand uncle. After this event, the associated claimant returned home to the UAE.\n[5] In [XXX] 2017, the principal claimant visited Jordan. He had been having a dispute with his cousins concerning inheritance from their grandfather and wanted to resolve it. When it could not be resolved, his cousins resorted to threats to have the principal claimant jailed or killed. The principal claimant\u2019s cousins contrived a plan to harm him by provoking an honour crime. During university, he had a relationship with a woman and proposed marriage to her. The proposal was refused by her family. The principal claimant ran into the woman on this trip to Jordan and so they decided to meet up again. His cousins photographed these encounters and provided the pictures to the woman\u2019s husband. The cousins convinced the woman\u2019s husband that the principal claimant was having an affair with her. The husband and his wife\u2019s family vowed to kill the principal claimant to restore their honour. When the principal claimant complained to the police, they refused to take a report. That same day, he was attacked by three armed men who vowed to kill him. As a result, the principal claimant fled Jordan and returned home to the UAE.\n[6] When the principal claimant lost his job in 2019, it cancelled the claimants\u2019 residency status in the UAE. Not wanting to return to Jordan or Syria, the claimants came to Canada. They fear that if they return to Jordan or Syria, they will face persecution and other risks.\nDETERMINATION\n[7] I find that, pursuant to section 97(1) of the Act, the principal claimant is a person in need of protection as he faces a risk to his life or of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in Jordan, on a balance of probabilities.\n[8] I find that the minor claimant is not a Convention refugee as she does not have a well- founded fear of persecution related to a Convention ground in Jordan. I also find that the associated claimant is not a person in need of protection, in that her removal to Jordan would not subject her personally to a risk to life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. There are also no substantial grounds to believe that her removal to Jordan would subject her personally to a danger of torture.\n[9] I find that the associated claimant is not a Convention refugee as she does not have a well-founded fear of persecution related to a Convention ground in the UAE. I also find that the associated claimant is not a person in need of protection, in that her removal to the UAE would not subject her personally to a risk to life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. There are also no substantial grounds to believe that her removal to the UAE would subject her personally to a danger of torture.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[10] The principal and minor claimants\u2019 identities as nationals of Jordan are established by testimony and their passports in evidence.[2] The associated claimant\u2019s identity is substantiated by her Syrian travel document for Palestinians in evidence.[3] I am satisfied of the claimants\u2019 identities by these documents.\nCountry of Former Habitual Residence\n[11] I have considered the test for stateless claimants as set out by the Federal Court of Appeal in Thabet:\nIn order to be found to be a Convention refugee, a stateless person must show that, on a balance of probabilities he or she would suffer persecution in any country of former habitual residence, and that he or she cannot return to any of his or her other countries of former habitual residence.[4]\nA country of former habitual residence refers to \u201ca situation where a stateless person was admitted to a given country with a view to continuing residence of some duration, without necessitating a minimum period of residence,\u201d and where there is a \u201csufficient period of de facto residence.\u201d[5]\n[12] The associated claimant is stateless. She was born in the Yarmouk refugee camp in Syria to stateless parents. Palestinians in Syria, even if they were born there, are not granted Syrian citizenship \u201cin order to preserve their original nationality.\u201d[6] Her travel document is not a passport and does not entitle her to the rights of a citizen, residency, or even a right of entry to Syria.[7] Although the associated claimant only made allegations against Syria, and it was submitted that Syria is her only country of habitual residence, no explanation for why this is the case was provided. I disagree that Syria is the associated claimant\u2019s country of former habitual residence. She only resided there for the first two months of her life. Her father was the first in the family to leave Syria before the rest of the family joined him shortly after she was born. This indicates that there was likely no view to continuing residence once the associated claimant was born because she and her other family members joined her father after her birth. Also, two months out of the associated claimant\u2019s [XXX] years does not constitute a sufficient period of de facto residence in my view. Although she visited Syria since her birth, she never lived there again.\n[13] It was argued that the UAE is not a country of former habitual residence in the associated claimant\u2019s case, but the only argument presented in support of this is that she has no status there. I note that she does not have status in Syria either, yet it was argued that Syria is a country of former habitual residence. In any case, the fact that a claimant has no status in a country is not relevant to the issue of whether or not it is a country of former habitual residence. The test for determining habitual residence has been stated above. Since the associated claimant resided in the UAE for a significant period of time \u2013 [XXX] years \u2013 with a view to continuing residency, including going to school and working, I find that the UAE is her only country of former habitual residence.\nCredibility\n[14] At the hearing, both claimants gave testimony that was generally clear and direct. The principal claimant provided a number of details to flesh out information in his narrative, which gave weight to his allegations. He also clarified a few issues, including that he does not know if his former girlfriend has been killed; this was speculation on his cousin\u2019s part. There were no material inconsistencies or contradictions within the claimants\u2019 evidence that were not reasonably explained or that undermined their credibility in respect of their central allegations.\n[15] The claimants submitted evidence to corroborate some of their allegations. This includes 11 statements from his family, relatives, neighbors, a friend and a colleague.[8] Together, they substantiate the principal claimant\u2019s past relationship in university, his cousins\u2019 plan to make it look like he was having an affair, his assault, and that people continue to seek his whereabouts. The associated claimant also submitted seven statements from her family members, though they all relate to her risk in Syria, which I have found is not a country of reference. Based on the presumption of truthfulness, the claimants\u2019 consistent testimony and the corroborative evidence, I accept the claimants\u2019 allegations as credible.\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution & Risk of Harm\nPrincipal Claimant \u2013 Jordan\n[16] In this case, I do not find that the principal claimant\u2019s allegations form a nexus to the Convention. That is to say, he does not fear his former girlfriend\u2019s family on the basis of his race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular social group. Rather, he fears them because they mistakenly believe he had an affair that violated their honour. As such, this claim must be assessed under section 97(1) of the Act.\n[17] I find that the principal claimant faces a risk to his life or of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment on a balance of probabilities. His cousins led his former girlfriend\u2019s family to believe that he was having an affair with her by showing them pictures of the pair meeting up. In fact, the principal claimant had not seen her in about 20 years when he ran into her and they were simply catching up on each other\u2019s lives. Nonetheless, the principal claimant received information from a cousin he is on good terms with that other cousins had concocted the plan and the woman\u2019s family vowed to kill him. The principal claimant was so fearful of the threat, that he pre-emptively reported that he was a potential victim of an honour crime to police. He was then beaten by three armed men who vowed to kill him to restore their honour, until bystanders intervened. After he left the country, individuals have persistently sought his whereabouts from his family.\n[18] The country condition evidence on Jordan is replete with information about the serious problem of so called \u201chonour\u201d crimes. However, all of the same sources indicate that women are generally the victims of these crimes. Whether it is labelled an honour crime when committed against a man or not, the fact is, the woman\u2019s husband and family are furious; they assaulted him and vowed to kill him. They are also still interested in locating him. Based on the death threats against the principal claimant, his assault, the ongoing interest of the perpetrators, and the fact that Jordan has a culture of honour crime, I find that the principal claimant faces a likely risk of section 97 harm.\nMinor Claimant \u2013 Jordan\n[19] The principal claimant testified that he fears that if his daughter returns to Jordan, his agents of harm might kill her. I do not find sufficient evidence that this is so. There is no indication that the woman\u2019s family has threatened to harm his family members in order to punish him. Were this the case, his family members who have been approached for the principal claimant\u2019s whereabouts would have accordingly been harmed. But, there is no evidence that this was the case. In addition, there is no evidence to indicate that perpetrators of honour crimes harm family members of the person who dishonoured them. Thus, the evidence is insufficient to demonstrate that the minor claimant faces a serious possibility of persecution or risk of harm on this basis.\n[20] Although the adult claimants did not raise any gender-based fears for their daughter if she returns to Jordan, I have nonetheless considered it in accordance with the Chairperson\u2019s gender guidelines. I find that women in Jordan experience discrimination in a number of areas such as inheritance, divorce, child custody, citizenship, pension, social security benefits, the workplace, and, in certain circumstances, the value of their testimony in Sharia court.[9] While there is discrimination against women in Jordan, even when taken together, I do not find sufficient evidence to demonstrate that it rises to the level of persecution or poses section 97 risks in the minor claimant\u2019s particular case.\n[21] Overall, I find that there is insufficient evidence that the minor claimant would face a serious possibility of persecution or likely risk of harm if she returns to Jordan. As such, there is no need to assess state protection or an Internal Flight Alternative (IFA) in her case.\nAssociated Claimant \u2013 UAE\n[22] I find that the associated claimant does not have a well-founded fear of persecution or a risk of section 97 harm on a balance of probabilities in the UAE. She did not make any allegations against the UAE in her Basis of Claim form. At the hearing, she was asked whether she has any fear of returning to the UAE, notwithstanding the fact that she no longer holds valid residency there. She testified that she has no fear and would still be living there if her husband had not lost his job. His employment was tied to their residency because \u201cwork sponsorship is an essential pre-requisite for becoming a legal resident\u201d and the loss of employment would result in a loss of status in the country.[10] She was also asked if she faced any kind of problems in the UAE. Again, she replied that she did not and that she was able to go to school, attend university, and work for 12 years. She had to stop working because employers give preference to citizens over foreign nationals. She was also asked about any obstacles she faced in her life. She only referred to delays in getting passports and residency permits. I do not find that any of this treatment rises to the level of persecution or section 97 risks. A requirement for non-citizens to have sponsored employment to maintain residency is unrelated to a Convention ground.[11] A state is entitled to enact and enforce its own citizenship and residency laws. While I acknowledge that the associated claimant no longer has valid residency in the UAE and would likely be denied entry, the Convention is only applicable to her circumstances if the refusal of entry is based on a Convention ground, and not related to immigration laws of general application,[12] as in the case here.\n[23] Despite the fact that the associated claimant did not make allegations against the UAE on the basis of her gender, I nonetheless considered this in accordance with the Chairperson\u2019s guideline on gender. The evidence reveals that the penal code allows men to use physical violence against female family members; that domestic violence is a serious problem; and that domestic violence laws are not enforced.[13] But, there is no evidence of violence by anyone with whom the associated claimant has had a domestic relationship. The evidence also indicates that there is gender discrimination in the law and practice with, for example, family law.[14] While there is discrimination against women in the UAE, even when taken together, I do not find sufficient evidence to demonstrate that it rises to the level of persecution or poses section 97 risks in the associated claimant\u2019s particular case.\n[24] Overall, the associated claimant has not adequately established that she would face a serious possibility of treatment amounting to persecution based on a Convention ground. Similarly, the evidence is not indicative of a likely risk to life, cruel and unusually treatment or punishment or torture. There is no need to assess state protection or IFA in her case either.\nState Protection\nPrincipal Claimant\n[25] In this case, there is insufficient evidence to indicate that the principal claimant is likely to obtain adequate state protection. He attempted to report the threat against him to the police, but they rejected it arguing that as an honour issue, it was a private matter. The officer also questioned the claimant about trying to complain against such a venerable tribe. When asked why he did not report his assault, the principal claimant testified that given the response he\nreceived earlier, he did not believe police would assist him. He also testified that the Bani Hassan tribe is an extremely large tribe \u2013 often known as the tribe of a million people \u2013 widely known to hold positions in security and government and to be well-connected with each other. As such, he believes the police would not assist him, particularly since he is Palestinian and because the issue relates to honour.\n[26] The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) notes that Palestinians face some discrimination in Jordan, and relatively few are in the public sector.[15] It states that individuals and groups have disproportionate access to power and influence, which in Jordan and the broader Arab world, is referred to as \u2018wasta.\u2019 Wasta can affect business, bureaucratic, political and social dealings. According to DFAT, most Palestinians in Jordan have little wasta when dealing with government bureaucracy. The public service is largely made up of tribes with a great deal of wasta. In DFAT\u2019s assessment, wasta is not evidence in and of itself of official or societal discrimination against Palestinians, but a central component to understanding how Jordanian society operates. It goes on to state that:\nDespite being a numerical minority, the majority of the security forces, including the police, are East Bankers. DFAT assesses that there is no official policy for security forces to make life more difficult for Palestinians. However, personality\u00ad-driven discrimination by individual officers against Palestinians and others can and does occur. It is unlikely that any complaints made by Palestinians of abuse by law enforcement agencies would result in legal redress. As is the case in much of Jordan, the individual\u2019s wasta would likely determine the quality of redress.\n[27] This evidence confirms the principal claimant\u2019s testimony indicating that because he is Palestinian, he is unlikely to obtain adequate state protection, particularly against a large and powerful tribe that occupies positions in government and police. It should be noted that according to the Department of State, although citizens may complain against police abuse and corruption, it is \u201crarely investigated\u201d in Jordan.[16] It states that officials engage in corrupt practices with impunity and the use of family, business, and other personal connections to advance personal interests is widespread. Based on the principal claimant\u2019s failed attempt to obtain protection, the profile of the agents of persecution, the low wasta of Palestinians, and widespread corruption with impunity, I find that there is no state protection\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[28] I also do not find that the principal claimant could live safely elsewhere in the country. Jordan is an exceptionally small country in size and population. Given the corruption in Jordan and that the claimants\u2019 agents of harm belong to a tribe that is heavily represented in public service, they are likely to have access to government information that would reveal the principal claimant\u2019s whereabouts. For example, they have been able to locate a number of the principal claimant\u2019s family members to demand his whereabouts. Based on these factors, I find that there is no IFA in this case.\nCONCLUSION\n[29] Having considered all of the evidence, I find that the principal claimant is a person in need of protection as set out in section 97(1) of the Act. His claim is therefore accepted.\n[30] I find that the minor and associated claimants are neither Convention refugees as set out in section 96, nor persons in need of protection within the meaning of subsection 97(1) of the Act. Their claims are therefore denied.\n[1] Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n[2] Exhibit 1.\n[3] Exhibit 1.\n[4] Thabet v.

The principal claimant, the associate adult claimant and the minor male claimant are citizens of Niz- Nigeria. The minor female claimant is a citizen of USA. They are claiming refugee protection pursuant to Section 96 and Subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[2] [XXX] was appointed as the designated representative for [XXX] and [XXX] In deciding these claims, the Panel has taken into consideration the following: Guideline 3 which deals with Child Refugee Claimants, Guideline 4 that deals with Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution, and Guideline 9 which deals with Proceedings Before the Immigration and Refugee Board involving Sexual Orientation and Gender-Identity and Expression, also known as SOGIE.\nAllegations\n[3] The principal claimant is bisexual and fears persecution at the hands of society and state authorities in Nigeria. The associate adult claimant fears persecution at the hands of the state authorities, the society in general and his family, due to the sexual orientation of his wife. The following is a brief synopsis of the allegations put forth by the principal claimant and the adult associate claimant in their Basis of Claim forms, in Exhibit 2.\n[4] The principal claimant started discovering about her bisexuality at the age of [XXX], in 1997. She had her first sexual experience with a female when her cousin came to stay with them in the year 2000. Their relationship continued until 2003 and was kept hidden from family and friends. She dated her first boyfriend in 2004. At this time, the principal claimant also started a relationship with a woman and dated both her boyfriend and her girlfriend at the same time. She ended both relationships in 2006, as she wanted to remain single because she thought she will not be able to find anyone who would understand and accept her bisexuality. The principal claimant fully embraced her bisexual orientation at this time. She succumbed to her mother\u2019s pressure and got married to the associate adult claimant in [XXX] 2015. The associate adult claimant discovered the principal claimant and one of her girlfriends in a compromising position on [XXX] 2007, when he came home early from a business trip. He was furious and reported the principal claimant and her friend to the police. The principal claimant then fled to he brother\u2019s house and told her family about her sexual orientation. The associate adult claimant eventually accepted the principal claimant\u2019s bisexuality but informed her that the police is now looking for them. On [XXX] 2017, the principal claimant\u2019s in-laws came to know about her bisexuality and started pressuring the associate adult claimant to divorce her. When he refused to do so, they beat him up and followed that up with a threat over the phone to the principal claimant, that she will be reported to the police for her bisexuality as it is a punishable crime in Nigeria. Fearing for their lives, the claimants reached USA on [XXX] 2018 and then travelled to Canada on [XXX] 2019; where they filed for protection. The principal claimant did not advance any allegations against USA in the claim of the minor female claimant.\nAnalysis\nIdentity\n[5] The identities of the principal claimant, the associate adult claimant and the minor male claimant, as citizens of Nigeria are established on a balance of probabilities based on the certified copies of their Nigerian passports in Exhibit 1.\n[6] The identity of the minor female claimant as a citizen of USA is established by way of the certified copy of her US passport on file.\nCredibility\n[7] At an RPD hearing, the presumption before the Panel is that a claimant\u2019s testimony is true, however, this can be rebutted in appropriate circumstances, such as inconsistencies, contradictions, omissions and undetailed testimony. However, this was not the case here. In this case, the principal claimant was straightforward and forthcoming in her testimony. There were no relevant inconsistencies or contradictions between her testimony and other evidence before the Panel. She did not appear to embellish her description of events and actions. The principal claimant provided testimony of past relationships with women in detail, as well as testimony of the circumstances and experiences which she went through when her bisexuality came out in the open. She described that she studied in an all female school and was attracted to one of her friends physically. Both of them became very close and had an intimate physical relationship. The principal claimant was able to explain how she did not feel normal and felt out of place because of her sexual orientation. When asked what that meant, she explained that she could not express herself openly for the fear of being seen as a person with low moral character. She stated that people in Nigeria view sexual minority as someone who should be punished with death. The Panel canvassed with the principal claimant why she got married, if she had decided in 2006 that she will remain single. She explained that single women in Nigeria are viewed as prostitutes and she succumbed to her mother\u2019s pressure due to this reason. The principal claimant also stated that she, too, believes that a woman\u2019s pride is in being in a married relationship, as this is how she was raised. She was honest in saying that she hid her bisexuality from the associate adult claimant because he was disgusted with the idea. When she was discovered by her husband in and intimate way, in [XXX] 2017, she was terrified over her marriage coming to an end, which is why she begged and pleaded with the associate adult claimant to forgive her. He has now come to accept her sexual orientation.\n[8] The associate adult claimant was also straightforward in his testimony. He was honest in stating that he was disgusted and shocked at this, discovering the principal claimant with her friend in a compromising position. Out of impulse, he went to the police station and asked the authorities to arrest the principal claimant\u2019s friend but not her. He explained that he loves the principal claimant and accepts who she is. He believes that one is born the way they are regarding their sexual orientation and it is not an abnormality that people make it out to be. The associate adult claimant categori-, categorically stated that he accepts his wife\u2019s bisexuality and will defend her in any way he can. This is the reason he stood,\n[9] MINOR CLAIMANT: [crying]\n[10] COUNSEL: Sorry to interrupt.\n[11] MEMBER: Yeah.\n[12] COUNSEL: I\u2019m not sure where those noises are coming from but it might be Toronto. Is it possible for you to moot, mute Toronto?\n[13] MEMBER: Yes, it could be. I will try to see if I can disconnect from Toronto. Just bear with me for a moment, please.\n[14] COUNSEL: Or, if you feel comfortable, we can just listen to the decision and, and that can just be in the background, it\u2019s fine. We\u2019ll, we\u2019ll be getting a, the written copy.\n[15] MEMBER: Okay. Yeah, so let\u2019s just continue.\n[16] COUNSEL: Thank you.\n[17] This is the reason he stood up for her against his family and clan, when they went to see his family in [XXX] 2017. He was physically assaulted and sus- and sustained injuries in that attack. The principal claimant was threatened by the associate adult claimant\u2019s family and clan, that she will be reported by them to the police and pressured the associate adult claimant to divorce her, as she is not fit to be a wife and mother. He stated that the police continued to pursue him, as they wanted him to report his wife\u2019s and her friend\u2019s whereabouts because they had committed a crime and he was privy to that information. The police also inquired from his employer about him, due to which he resigned from his job in [XXX] 2018. The associate adult claimant stated that his clan continued to pressure him to divorce the principal claimant and has ostracized him. He has been threatened by his clan that they will take away the minor male claimant and raise him on their own.\n[18] The Panel canvassed with the claimants why they did not seek protection in USA. The principal claimant testified that they were afraid of being separated from their children, as that is what was happening with the refugee claimants in that country. They waited for things to improve in the US, but decided to seek protection in Canada, as the political rhetoric against immigrants and refugees was deteriorating day by day. The Panel accepts the principal claimant\u2019s explanation as reasonable given the political scenario in the US in 2018 and 2019 with refugee families. As such, the Panel does not draw any negative inference in the claimant\u2019s failure to seek protection in USA. Based on their straightforward and frank testimonies, the Panel finds the principal claimant and adult associate claimant to be credible witnesses and accepts their allegations to be true.\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution and Risk of Harm\n[19] The persecution that the principal claimant faces has a Nexus to one of the five Convention grounds, which is membership in a particular social group; that is her sexual orientation and, therefore, this claim is assessed under Section 96. The Panel finds that the principal claimant and associate adult claimant have established that they have a well-founded fear of persecution due to her bisexuality, which is supported by objective evidence. The documentary evidence shows a high level of societal homophobia in Nigeria, and also that same-sex relationships are illegal in that country. The country documentation is consiten- consistent with the principal claimant\u2019s past experiences and confirms her forward-looking fear of returning to Nigeria, which is as follows. Homosexuality and bisexuality are against the law in Nigeria. The United States Department of State report on Nigeria discusses some of the relatively recent developments in that country. According to the National Documentation Package, NDP Item 2.1, the 2014 Same-Sex Marriage Prohibition Act, which is referred to as the SSMPA, effectively renders all forms of activity illegal which is supporting or promoting lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or intersex rights. According to the SSMPA, anyone convicted of entering into a same-sex marriage or civil union may be sentenced up to 14 years imprisonment. A Response to Information Request of the Immigration and Refugee Board, which is as per ne- NDP Item 6.1, discusses the societal treatment and perceptions of homosexuals. According to the report, LGBTQ people are treated with disdain and disregard for their fundamental human rights. LGBTQ face being ostracized from the community and being subjected to acts of violence, stigma and reproach. The Response to Information Request also discusses the discrimination faced by sexual minorities in employment, accessing housing and accessing healthcare services. According to Section 214 of the Nigeria Criminal Code Act, and this is as per NDP Item 6.2, any person who has carnal knowledge of any person against the order of nature, is guilty of a felony, and is liable to imprisonment for 14 years. In this case, the associate adult claimant is aware of and is fully accepting of the principal claimant\u2019s bisexuality, and is also privy to her friend\u2019s sexual orientation, who he found being intimate with his wife in [XXX] 2017. As such, he would be liable for persecution at the hands of the government of Nigeria, according to Section 214, especially since the police in Nigeria expects the associate adult claimant to repay the whe-, to report the whereabouts his wife and her friend, so that they can be tried under the criminal law. Therefore, the Panel finds that he faces more than a mere possibility of persecution in Nigeria, if he were to return to his country. Especially since his family has threatened to go to the police against his wife\u2019s bisexuality and he, himself, has initiated a move to file a police report at one point, against the principal claimant and her friend. The Panel also finds that the minor male claimant faces more than a mere possibility of persecution at the hands of state and non-state actors in Nigeria, by way of his membership in a particular social group; namely the child of parents facing persecution related to a Convention ground. Based on all the evidence before it, the Panel finds that the principal claimant, the adult associate claimant, and the minor male claimant, would face a serious possibility of persecution by both state and non-state actors if they were to return to Nigeria. The Panel finds that the minor female claimant does not face any risk to life or a possibility of punishment or cruel treatment, or torture in USA.\nState Protection and Internal Flight Alternative\n[20] The Panel finds that state protection would not be rea- reasonably forthcoming to the claimants as one of the agents of persecution is the state. The laws prohibiting homosexuality apply throughout the country and so do the laws that fail to protect homosexuals from discrimination and persecution. Therefore, the Panel finds that the presumption of state protection has been rebutted. The country condition documents indicate that the high level of discrimination against homosexuals exists throughout the country, as such, the Panel finds that there is no viable IFA available to the principle claimant, adult associate claimant and the minor male claimant in this case, in Nigeria.\nDetermination and Conclusion\n[21] The Panel finds that the principal claimant, adult associate claimant, and the minor male claimant are Convention refugees as per Section 96 of the Act, and accepts each of their claims. The Panel also finds that the minor female claimant is neither a Convention refugee, nor a person in need of protection according to the provisions of the Act, and therefore rejects her claim. And that\u2019s the end of the decision.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n",

The claimants are citizens of Iran who are claiming refugee protection pursuant to Section 96 and Subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[2] In rendering these reasons, I considered and applied Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 4 on Female Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Based Persecution and Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 3 on Child Refugee Claimants Procedural and Evidentiary Issues. At the outset of the hearing, I maintained the designation of the principal claimant as the designated representative for her minor daughter, [XXX] Her son [XXX] turned [XXX] years old in [XXX] 2019 and so does not require a designated representative.\nAllegations\n[3] The principal claimant fears gender-based persecution on the basis of her objection to strict gender-based roles for women in Iran. She is a painter and a poet who has used her art to decry what she has described as the tyranny of the Islamic regime against women. She says she endured two loveless arranged marriages which left her both broke and broken.\n[4] She also fears persecution on the basis of her religious beliefs and her imputed political opinion. The associated claimant [XXX] fears persecution due to his religious beliefs and his political beliefs. He says he believes in God but does not follow a particular religion. He rejects the mandatory Islamic, the mandatory imposition of Islamic beliefs on Iranian citizens. And fears persecution due to his repudiation of a theocratic government in favor of a secular model.\n[5] The minor claimant [XXX] fears persecution on the basis of her gender. She objects to the strictures imposed on women in Iran, including the mandatory dress code. She also rejects the mandatory imposition of Islamic values on Iranian citizens. And says that she does not adhere to a particular religion.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[6] I\u2019m backing up here.\nDetermination\n[7] The Panel finds that the three claimants have established a serious risk of persecution in Iran based on their religious beliefs and in the case of the two female claimants, on the basis of their gender.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[8] The claimants\u2019 identities are confirmed by the testimony of the principal claimant and by their passports, certified true copies of which are on file.\nCredibility\n[9] In refugee determine case, determination cases there is a presumption that claimants and their allegations are truthful. I found the three claimants to be credible witnesses. They each endeavored to answer questions accurately and to elaborate on their answers when asked to do so. There were no material inconsistencies or contradution-, contradictions within or between their respective testimonies. The principal claimant submitted a number of documents which corroborate her allegations. These includes a subpoena issued in [XXX] 2018 requiring her to attend a preliminary inquiry into whether she insulted the san-, sanctity of Islam. This is found in Exhibit 4 at page 21.\n[10] She also submitted photocopies of her paintings and translations of her poetry which are collectively a heart-rending lament against the oppression of wislam-, oppression of women by the theocratic regime. In one poem she writes, I was a beautiful blossom., they shed all my pet-, petals before I bloom, not giving me a chance to see the spring. Another poem refers to the \u201cbeastly religious rules, those demons\u201d. And another says \u201creligion is the lie of frauds.\u201d\n[11] The principal claimant also filed a card attesting to her father\u2019s membership in the Rastakhiz, R-A-S-T-A\u00adK-H-I-Z Party and a death certificate which confirms her father\u2019s death in [XXX] 1983. In her BOC, she said that her father was effectively assassinated because of his political beliefs.\n[12] The objective country evidence in the Immigration and Refugee Board\u2019s National Documentation Package substantiate the claimant\u2019s allegations concerning the lack of freedom of religious belief and the treatment of women. Based on the presumption of truthfulness and the corroborative evidence, I accept the allegations as set out in the princi-, principal claimant\u2019s BOC and updated narrative as credible.\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution\n[13] I find that the principal claimant has established a well-founded fear of persecution based on her status as a woman and on her rejection of Islamic strictures on the people of Iran.\nProfile of the Principal Claimant\n[14] The principal claimant\u2019s profile is as follows. She says that her extended family has long opposed the regime. Her father was pursued by clerics in the early days of the revolution and eventually killed in a staged car accident. Her mother who is fearful for the safety of her outspoken and headstrong daughter, arranged for the principal claimant to marry an older man who worked for the regime when she, the principal claimant, was only [XXX] years old. When she was married, she was expelled by the school. After some incidents of abuse, the [XXX] bride fled her home and marriage. Her husband subsequently divorced her and she was allowed to complete high school.\n[15] Following the breakdown of this marriage, the principal claimant\u2019s brother chaperoned her closely. She felt she was living in a prison of his creation. When she was [XXX], she married a 30-year-old man to escape the prison fashioned by her brother. The principal claimant and her husband have two children who are the associated claimants in this hearing. That marriage broke down when the principal claimant was in her early [XXX] and she again found herself marginalized as a divorced woman.\n[16] She began to teach art out of her home. The classes became a center for discussion about various social issues. She wanted to take these ideas beyond her home, so registered at a university. However, her outspoken views created ongoing problems at the university and she had to drop out after three terms. She opened an art school but the ongoing pressure by Sepah, S-E-P-A-H and the Basij, B-A-S-I-J forced her to cut the male instructors from her school. She had to repeatedly write promissory letters to comply with the Iranian regime\u2019s requirements. And eventually, had to close the school altogether. She continued to pour her hopes, her anger and her pain into her poetry and her art.\n[17] In [XXX] 2018, she visited her sister in Canada. She was astounded to see a country in which women are treated with respect. She returned to Iran only because her children were still there. Upon her return to Iran, the authorities continued their surveillance of her activities. On [XXX] 2018, they forced her over in her car. When the officers started to humiliate and disrep-, disrespect her, she erupted in rage against Islam and its laws. She was arrested and released the following day upon posting a bond.\n[18] On [XXX] 2018 she received a subpoena ordering her to attend an inquiry on [XXX] the [XXX], 2018. A cousin informed her that she was not yet on a no-exit list, so she and her children flew to Turkey on [XXX] the [XXX] 2018. The claimants were only allowed to stay in Turkey for three months. The principal claimant reluctant-, reluctantly agreed to pay [XXX] to an agent so that she could get visas for her children to get to Canada.\n[19] The principal claimant returned to Iran in [XXX] 2018 to finalize her affairs and grant power of attorney to her brother. She did not return to her home and took precautions to remain undetected. Nonetheless, despite these precautions, she received a call saying that she was being followed and that she faced being killed. On [XXX] she learned that a second subpoena had been delivered to her home and she immediately returned to Turkey. The three claimants flew to Canada on [XXX], 2018.\n[20] The associated claimant, [XXX] who is [XXX] years old, testified about his religious and political beliefs. As noted above, he says he does not adhere to any religion. And refuses to participate in the religious rituals and practices which are demanded in many parts of Iranian life. He noted that he now faces the mandatory military service in Iran as a soldier. If he refuses to pray or to fast during Ramadan he faces flogging and other punishments including the extension of his military service. His mother testified that [XXX] is rebellious by nature. And she fears that his free-spirited actions will quickly bring him to the attention of the authorities.\n[21] The minor claimant, [XXX] is [XXX] years of age. She testified about her objection to the strictures imposed on women in Iran in the name of Islam, in the name of Islam. Including the mandatory wearing of the hijab. The principal claimant testified that [XXX] hated having to wear the hijab in Iran. She recalled that when [XXX] was approximately [XXX] or [XXX] years old, the principal claimant picked her up from school by car on a hot day. Once in the car, [XXX] pulled her headscarf off. The religious police saw this and detained the principal claimant and [XXX] for a day. [XXX] was incensed by this and remains so to this day. [XXX] testified that she is not a practicing Muslim and that she does not believe in any religion.\nNexus\n[22] I find that the fears of the principal claimant and [XXX] are refle-, are connected to the refugee Convention grounds of religion, membership in a particular social group, namely gender. And actual or imputed political beliefs. The fears of the associated claimant [XXX] are connected to the Convention ground of religion and political belief. I therefore assess their claims under Section 96 of the Act.\nSubjective Basis\n[23] The principal claimant has described her fears of persecution persuasively and in detail. Her decision to return to Iran in [XXX] 2018 raises a question about whether she may have reavailed herself of the protection of her country. I find that her description about the precautions she took to remain undetected and her immediate flight back to Turkey when the second subpoena arrived have satisfied me that she had a sub-, has a subjective fear of persecution in Iran. And that her short-term return to the country in [XXX] 2018 does not undercut that subjective fear.\n[24] The associated claimant and minor claimant also established a subjective fear of persecution throughout their eloquent and pervasive testimony.\nObjective Evidence\n[25] The objective evidence supports the fears of the three claimants. Reports in the National Documentation Package confirm that the Iranian State authorities continue to impose harsh restrictions on the rights of women. To arrest wome-, women rights activists, prohibit dissemination of information the government deems damaging and that the government maintains control on art and censors art production that is deemed to promote secularism or non-Islamic ideas about women\u2019s rights and behaviors. And for this I, I\u2019m referring to the information in the U.S. Department of State report found at Tab 2.1 of the NDP. Iran is a theocracy where ultimate power rests with the supreme leader and unelected institutions under his control.\n[26] The gender policies among the ideological pillars of the Islamic Republic and therefore, patriarchy is enforced by the State itself.\n[27] Legislation in Iran is based on Sharia law which generally regus-, reduce a woman as having only half the value of a man. The 2017 Global Gender Gap ranks Iran at 140 out of 144 countries. And for this, I refer to the report at Tab 5.1 at the NDP. Amnesty International states that violence against women and girls including domestic violence and early enforced marriage are widespread and committed with impunity as gender-based violence is not criminalized.\n[28] According to the Finnish Immigration Service sexual harassment is widespread and violence against women is commonplace in Iran. More than 50% of women have suffered psychological abuse. And more than 1 in 3 had suffered acts of physical abuse. Almost 1 in 3 of the surveyed women reported having experienced restrictions included, including limitations on contacts with friends and family. And limitations on their ability to pursue employment, education or participation in public affairs. The report also states that women feel compel-, compelled to tolerate violence inflicted not only by their husbands, but also by other family members for fear of shame, being ostracized or divorced. And because there are a lack of alternatives to the abusive environments. And for that, I refer to Tab 5.3 of the NDP.\n[29] Restrictions on women govern all aspects of their lives. Women cannot ride bicycles, enter stadiums, travel alone or choose their clothes. Female athletes have traditionally been barred from competing in international tournaments. All women, irrespective of religion, are required to cover their hair, skin above the wrist or ankle and below the neck and the contours of their body in public. And this last proposition is found in the Response to Information Request at Tab 5.4.\n[30] The law provides that a woman who appears in public without appropriate attire such as, such as a hijab over the head or a long jacket, manteau, M-A-N-T-E-A-U or a full-length cloth covering, chador, may be sentenced to flogging and fined. And this is the U.S. Department of State report at Tab 2.1. These laws are enforced with vigor. Approximately 730,000 women a year are arrested for failing to comply with the billing requirement. And this is Tab 5.1 of the NDP. However, there\u2019s no consensus on what constitutes a proper hijab which leaves women vulnerable to the interpretation or whims of the enforcing officer.\n[31] According to the Austrian Centre for Country of Origin and Asylum Research and Documentation, cultural figures including musicians are targeted by the regime, regardless of whether they live in Iran as their work is deemed to be immoral. And this is found in NDP Item 2.6. Solo female artists are prohibited from performing in front of audiences. And musicians are constan-, consistently banned, imprisoned and harassed by authorities.\n[32] And I find on a balance of probabilities that the restrictions or harassment that are imposed on musicians are likely to be equally applied to other forms of art, including painting or poetry, such as the work that the principal claimant has done. The country reports also indicate that the Iranian authorities demands strict adherence to Sharia laws and criminalize dissent.\n[33] The U.S. Department of International Religious Freedom report states that Iran\u2019s constitution defines the country as an Islamic Republic and all laws and regulations must be based on Islamic criteria. Conversion from Islam to another faith is punishable by death. An IRB Response to Information Request on the treatment of atheists in Iran found at Tab 12.14 of the NDP quotes sources as saying that atheism is not recognized in Iran. And under Iran\u2019s Sharia law any Muslim who abandons his or her faith may face the death penalty for apostasy.\n[34] With the respect to the ability to freely express one\u2019s opinion, the USDOS report at Tab 2.1 states that the law provides for the prosecution of persons accused of instigating crimes against the State or national security or insulting Islam. The government severely restricted freedom of speech and of the press and use the law to intimidate or prosecute persons who directly criticize the government or raised human rights problems. As well as to bring ordinary citizens into compliance with the government\u2019s moral code. The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom 2018 annual report found at Tab 12.2 indicates that the government of Iran discriminates against its citizens on the basis of religion or belief. As all laws and regulations are based on the unique Ja\u2019fari Shia Islamic criteria.\n[35] Under Iran\u2019s Penal Code, mohareh-, moharebeh vaguely defined and often used for political purposes and Sabul-Nabi, S-A-B-U-L \u2013 N-A-B-I, insulting the prophet, are capital crimes. The same document notes that the Iranian government exercises strict control over expression of religious ideas and dissent online as part of its broader censorship and targeted use of technology.\n[36] Upon reviewing the credib-, the claimants\u2019 credible testimony and the country reports on Iran, I find that they have collectively and individually established that they face a serious risk of persecution in Iran on the basis of their religious beliefs. And in the case of the two female claimants, on the basis of their gender. Given my finding that the claimants face a risk of persecution because of their religious beliefs, I\u2019ve not assessed the risk they may face on the basis of their political opinions.\nState Protection\n[37] Given that the State is the agent of harm, I find there\u2019s no state protection available to them. Furthermore, given the State\u2019s capacity and censorship laws and their laws against apostasy and blasphemy which extend throughout the country, I find they face a serious possibility of persecution throughout the country.\n[38] It is therefore, not possible for them to relocate to another location in Iran. There is no in-, viable internal flight alternative available to them.\nCONCLUSION\n[39] For the foregoing reasons, I find that the claimants have established that they are Convention refugees pursuant to Section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. I therefore accept your claims.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n",

Based on the claimant\u2019s testimony, supporting documents and the country condition documents the panel finds that he has a well-founded fear of persecution for the following reasons.\n[7] The panel finds the claimant to be a credible witness therefore believes what he has alleged. The claimant testified in straightforward and forthcoming manner and there were no relevant inconsistencies in his testimony or contradictions between his testimony and the other evidence before the panel. The claimant was able to spontaneously provided a detailed history of his involvement in the UKPMP both in his country and since coming to Canada. He was also able to provide detailed reasons as to why his involvement in this party is important to him and his values.\n[8] The panel finds that the claimant has established the following on a balance of probabilities:\nThe claimant became involved in, PKNSF a student group that promoted Kashmiri independence in college and he received threats and beatings from pro-Pakistan groups because of this involvement; The claimant became an active member in the UKPNP in 2009 and he spoke to audiences and led protests in support of Kashmiri independence in Pakistan; During protests in 2009, 2013 and 2014 the claimant and others in his group were attacked with iron rods, sticks and stones by the police and workers of pro-Pakistan groups. The claimant was beaten on a number of occasions and on one occasion, the claimant was arrested and was held in solitary confinement, tortured, and threatened with death if he did not stop his political activities against Pakistan; The claimant reported the attacks on him to the security forces in Pakistan but was told that they would not help him; The claimant left Pakistan on [XXX] 2014 and spent a year working in Brazil. After being unable to extend his work visa in Brazil the claimant went to the US where he was detained and requested refugee protection with a hearing date set in [XXX] of 2021; On [XXX] 2019 the claimant came to Canada and made a claim for refugee protection; The claimant has remained an active member of the UKPNP since coming to Canada; If the claimant were to return to his country he would continue with his active involvement in political activities for the UKPNP party promoting Kashmiri independence in Pakistan; Individuals who promote Kashmiri independence in Pakistan are subject to illegal detention and punishment for their political opinion.[9] The claimant provided documentary evidence such as letters of support from members of the UKPNP, documentation confirming his membership in the UKPNP, and photos of him in attendance at various conferences, meetings and other events for the UKPNP both in Pakistan and in Canada. The claimant also provided various country condition evidence pertaining to the treatment of individuals who are similarly situated to the claimant to support his allegations. The panel finds that these documents are relevant and serve to corroborate his allegations and therefore places significant weight on them.\n[10] The panel finds that the claimant has established that he has a subjective fear of persecution by Pakistani authorities and other pro-Pakistan groups.\n[11] The country condition evidence, as outlined in the National Documentation Package at item 4.8[2] supports the claimant\u2019s allegations as follows:\nIn Jammu and Kashmir, Pakistan has been engaged in ongoing conflict with India and separatist insurgency groups since partition in 1947.Pakistan generally forbids individuals or political parties from taking part in activities that are prejudicial to the government of Pakistan and this is particularly the case in Kashmir.Anti-government demonstrations are routinely oppressed, often violently and Pakistani security forces generally view pro-independence groups with suspicion. The Pakistan Intelligence Agency engages in extensive surveillance of pro-independence groups and those who do not support the Pakistani government. These people are subject to surveillance, harassment, imprisonment and torture by security forces.Pro-independence activists, including members of the UKPNP are often detained without being given a reason for their arrest. They are punished, interrogated and frequently tortured in detention.[12] Therefore, based on the totality of evidence the panel finds that the claimant has established that he would face a serious possibility of persecution in Pakistan because of his membership in the UKPNP and his political activism which he continues today.\nState protection and Internal Flight Alternative (IFA)\n[13] Except in situations where the state is in complete breakdown, states must be presumed capable of protecting its citizens. However, since the agent of persecution in this case is the state, the panel finds that state protection would not be reasonably forthcoming and that the claimant has rebutted the presumption of state protection.\n[14] In this case, given that the state is the agent of harm, is in control of all of its territories and has demonstrated the capacity and motivation to harm the claimant in the past, the panel finds that the claimant would face a serious possibility of persecution throughout Pakistan. The panel therefore finds that there is no internal flight alternative available to the claimant.\nCONCLUSION\n[15] The panel finds that the claimant is a Convention refugee as he has established a serious possibility of persecution on account of his political opinion. The panel therefore accepts his claim.\n[1] Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n[2] Exhibit 3, National Documentation Package, Pakistan, 29 March 2019, tab 4.8: Treatment by state and non-state agents of individuals and political factions that support or advocate for Kashmiri independence.

        "unofficial_text":"2020 RLLR 83\n\nCitation: 2020 RLLR 83\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: January 15, 2020\nPanel: Alexandra Mann\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Bjorna Shkurti\nCountry: Nicaragua\nRPD Number: VB9-02810\nAssociated RPD Number(s): VB9-02811, VB9-02812\nATIP Number: A-2021-00800\nATIP Pages: 000144-000156\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] This is the decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) in the claims of [XXX] (the \u201cprincipal claimant\u201d), his spouse [XXX] (the \u201cassociate claimant\u201d) as citizens of Nicaragua who are claiming refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (the \u201cAct\u201c).[1] The principal claimant and associate claimant\u2019s daughter, [XXX] (the \u201cminor claimant\u201d), a citizen of Panama, is also claiming protection.\n[2] The principal claimant was appointed the designated representative for the minor claimant.\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] The principal claimant\u2019s employer, a Nicaraguan company, transferred him to their office in Panama for the period of [XXX] 2013 to [XXX] 2019. The associate claimant resided with her husband in Panama during this period, and the minor claimant was born in Panama in [XXX]. During their time in Panama, the adult claimants volunteered for their church to raise money for Nicaraguan political refugees. In early 2019, the claimants attended a demonstration in Panama against the Nicaraguan government. The claimants also have several family members who participated in anti-government demonstrations in Nicaragua.\n[4] In [XXX] 2019, the principal claimant\u2019s employment contract in Panama came to an end and his employer transferred him back to their office in Nicaragua. On [XXX] 2019, the principal claimant was walking down the street when four armed and hooded men pulled him into a van. The men assaulted the principal claimant and threatened him saying that they knew he was supporting \u201cGolpistas\u201d (a pejorative term for people opposed to the Nicaraguan government) in Panama because they had \u201cpeople\u201d there. The men also made threats against the principal claimant\u2019s wife and daughter, and then threw him out of the van saying that if they saw him again, they would kill him.\nDETERMINATION\n[5] I find that the principal claimant and associate claimant are Convention refugees as they have a well-founded fear of persecution in Nicaragua on account of their political opinion.\n[6] I find that the minor claimant is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection as there is insufficient evidence for me to find that she would face persecution or a s. 97 risk in Panama.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[7] I find that the adult claimants\u2019 identities as Nicaraguan nationals are established on a balance of probabilities by their testimony and the copies of their Nicaraguan passports.[2]\n[8] I find that the minor claimant\u2019s identity as a citizen of Panama is established by the testimony of her designated representative \u2013 the principal claimant \u2013 and the copy of her Panamanian passport.[3]\nArticle 1E of the Refugee Convention\n[10] The first question for me to consider is whether the adult claimants are excluded from refugee protection on account of having status, or access to status, in Panama that is substantially similar to the status of a Panamanian national. Pursuant to section 98 of the Act, a person referred to in section E of Article 1 of the Refugee Convention is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection. Article 1E provides that the Refugee Convention \u201cshall not apply to a person who is recognized by the competent authorities of the country in which he has taken residence as having the rights and obligations which are attached to the possession of the nationality of that country.\u201d\n[11] In Canada v. Zeng, the Federal Court of Appeal set out the following two-part test for assessing exclusion under Article 1E:\nConsidering all relevant factors to the date of the hearing, does the claimant have status, substantially similar to that of its nationals, in the third country? If the answer is \u201cyes\u201d, the claimant is excluded.If the answer to the first question is \u201cno\u201d, did the claimant previously have status in the third country, substantially similar to that of its nationals, and lost it, or had access to such status and failed to acquire it? If \u201cno\u201d, the claimant is not excluded. If \u201cyes\u201d, the Panel must determine whether the claimant should be excluded by balancing the reason for the loss of status (whether it was voluntary or involuntary), whether the claimant could return to the country, the risk the claimant would face in their country of nationality, Canada\u2019s international obligations and any other relevant factors.[4]With respect to the first part of the Zeng test, in order to assess whether the claimant\u2019s status in the third country is \u201csubstantially similar\u201d to that of a national, the Panel must consider the following criteria:\nthe right to return to the country of residence;the right to work freely without restrictions;the right to study; andfull access to social services in the country of residence.[5][12] In the present case, the claimants disclosed a copy of a document from the Panamanian authorities, dated [XXX] 2017, confirming that the claimants had been granted a \u201cpermanent resident permit.\u201d The principal claimant testified that he and the associate claimant both held \u201cpermanent resident status,\u201d but that this status did not confer the right to work. He testified that in order to work in Panama, he was required to obtain a work permit, which 1) was contingent on his employment, 2) only permitted him to work for one employer, and 3) had to be renewed on an annual basis. He further testified that the associate claimant did not have authorization to work in Panama as she did not have a qualified job offer.\n[13] The principal claimant\u2019s testimony is consistent with a Response to Information Request (RIR), which appears at item 3.4 of the National Documentation Package (NDP) for Panama. According to this RIR, \u201cevery permanent resident who is eligible to work according to their category of permanent residence, must obtain a work permit to be employed, and this must be renewed every year.\u201d[6] The RIR further states that it is only after 10 years of permanent residence and work permit renewals that a permanent resident can apply for an indefinite work permit.\n[14] Considering this evidence, it is clear that the adult claimants\u2019 status in Panama did not grant them rights \u201csubstantially similar\u201d Panamanian nationals. Most notably, the claimants\u2019 status in Panama did not grant them the right to work freely without restrictions. The principal claimant was required to renew his work permit on an annual basis, and his authorization to work expired as soon as his employer ended his contract in Panama and reassigned him to their office in Nicaragua. The associate claimant was not permitted to work at all.\n[15] I therefore find that the claimants have never held status in Panama that is substantially similar to that of a national. Furthermore, as neither of the claimants had held permanent resident status and work permits in Panama for a period of 10 years, they were not eligible to apply for a status that would allow them to work freely without restrictions. Accordingly, I find that the adult claimants are not excluded under Article 1E.\nNexus to the Refugee Convention\n[16] The claimants allege that they will be targeted by the Nicaraguan government and\/or pro- government actors \u2013 in Nicaragua and Panama \u2013 due to their opposition to the Nicaraguan government. I find that there is a nexus between the claimants\u2019 allegations and the Convention ground of political opinion. I have therefore assessed these claims under s. 96 of the Act. I have also assessed whether the minor claimant faces a s. 97 risk in Panama.\nCredibility\n[17] A refugee claimant\u2019s testimony is presumed to be true unless there is reason to doubt its truthfulness. In this case, the claimants testified in a spontaneous and straightforward manner, and there were no material inconsistencies. They also disclosed documentary evidence which corroborates their allegations, including:\nPhotographs of the injuries the principal claimant sustained when he was kidnapped on [XXX] 2019;Photographs of the claimants attending a demonstration in Panama against the Nicaraguan government;Photographs and letters of support confirming the claimants\u2019 family members participation in anti-government demonstrations in Nicaragua;A letter of support from the principal claimant\u2019s parents confirming that their house has been marked by pro-government forces as a sign that they have been labeled \u201cGolpistas\u201d, as well as a photograph of the mark on their house.[18] Additionally, as will be explained in more detail below, I find that the claimants\u2019 allegations regarding the risks they face in Nicaragua are consistent with the independent country condition evidence before me.\n[19] Given the documentary evidence and the principal claimant\u2019s testimony at the hearing, I find the principal claimant to be credible and I accept that he has been targeted by pro\u00ad government forces in Nicaragua due to his opposition to the Nicaraguan government as well as his family members\u2019 participation in anti-government demonstrations. I further accept that the pro-government agents who kidnapped and assaulted the principal claimant have threatened to harm the associate claimant and minor claimant as well.\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution and Risk of Harm\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution in Nicaragua\n[20] According to the country condition evidence, individuals opposed to the ruling government in Nicaragua face widespread persecution. The Freedom House report at item 2.3 of the NDP states that;\n\u201c(t)he election of Sandinista leader Daniel Ortega in 2006 began a period of democratic deterioration marked by the consolidation of all branches of government under his party\u2019s control, the limitation of fundamental freedoms, and unchecked corruption in government. In 2018, state forces, with the aid of informally allied armed groups, responded to a mass antigovernment movement with violence and repression. The rule of law collapsed as the government moved to put down the movement, with rights monitors reporting the deaths of over 300 people, extrajudicial detentions, disappearances, and torture.\u201d[7]\n[21] The United States (U.S.) Department of State report at item 2.1 of the NDP reports that the Nicaraguan government\u2019s crackdown on political dissidents escalated in 2018 when the President \u201cinstituted a policy of \u201cexile, jail, or death\u201d for anyone perceived as opposition.\u201d This report further states that in April 2018, the government \u201cordered police and parapolice forces to put down with violence peaceful protests that began over discontent with a government decision to reduce social security benefits.\u201d Government and pro-government forces targeted protesters with live ammunition and snipers. Protesters responded by building barricades and confronting authorities with rocks and homemade mortars. This in turn led to further violent suppression from the government. There are even reports that the government has killed police officers for refusing to follow orders to violently suppress the protests.[8]\n[22] According to a 2018 Amnesty International report at item 2.5 of the NDP, the government\u2019s strategy of lethal use of force against protesters was widespread and, in many cases, indiscriminate. After dismantling the protesters\u2019 blockades, the government \u201cincreased its strategy of persecution and carried out mass arbitrary detentions of people identified as having participated in the protests at some point in the preceding months.\u201d In doing so, the government has cast an incredibly wide net. Even carrying a Nicaraguan flag \u2013 which has become a symbol associated with the anti-government protests \u2013 is considered grounds for arrest. The Amnesty report states that \u201c(s)ince June 2018, the government has adopted a strategy of indiscriminate repression with intent to kill not only in order to completely smash the protests, but also to punish those who participated in them.\u201d[9]\n[23] As of November 2018, the \u201cconflict left at least 325 persons dead, more than 2,000 injured, hundreds illegally detained and tortured, and more than 52,000 exiled in neighboring countries.\u201d The protesters, and other government opponents, who have been arrested have faced \u201charsh and life-threatening prison conditions,\u201d torture and even extrajudicial killings. There are some reports of the bodies of detainees being subsequently found in the morgue or strewn about city streets.[10]\n[24] There are also reports that the Nicaraguan authorities and pro-state actors have targeted the family members of those who participated in the anti-government protests. Observers list demonstrators, student leaders, human rights defenders and the family members of the victims among those who are targeted. According to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, the family members of those who have been targeted for their opposition to the government are among those at \u201cserious risk.\u201d[11]\n[25] As stated previously, I believe that the claimants, as well as several members of their family, have participated in demonstrations against the Nicaraguan government, and that the principal claimant was consequently kidnapped, assaulted and threatened by pro-government forces. I also believe that the attackers have threatened to kill the associate claimant and minor claimant as well. In light of the country condition evidence that government and pro-state forces in Nicaragua target anti-government protesters and their family members, I find that the claimants\u2019 fear of persecution in Nicaragua on account of their political opinion is well-founded. I therefore accept that the claimants face a serious possibility of persecution if returned to Nicaragua.\n[26] For clarity, according to the information on file, the minor claimant holds citizenship in Panama and no other country. In the event that the minor claimant does hold citizenship, or a right to citizenship, in Nicaragua, I find that she has a well-founded fear of persecution in this country on account of her membership in the particular social group of the family. The objective evidence shows that the family members of anti-government protesters are at risk of being targeted by state or pro-state actors in Nicaragua. Moreover, the men who attacked the principal claimant specifically threatened to harm the minor claimant. I therefore find that all three claimants would face a serious possibility of persecution if returned to Nicaragua.\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution in Panama\n[27] Panama is not a country of reference for the adult claimants as they do not hold Panamanian citizenship. However, as the minor claimant is a citizen of Panama, I must consider the claimants\u2019 allegations with respect to Panama in order to assess the minor claimant\u2019s claim for protection. Based on the claimants\u2019 evidence and the country condition evidence, there is insufficient evidence for me to find that the minor claimant has a well-founded fear of persecution or faces a s. 97 risk in Panama.\n[28] The claimants allege that they are at risk of being killed in Panama by the Nicaraguan authorities or supporters of the Nicaraguan government. The principal claimant believes that these actors have reach throughout Panama because the men who attacked him in Nicaragua on [XXX] 2019, told him that they were aware that he was living in Panama as \u201cwe have people there too.\u201d[12]\n[29] When I asked whether the claimants had had any problems in Panama, the principal claimant described a conversation he had with a Nicaraguan priest, named [XXX], at a community event in Panama. [XXX] told the principal claimant that another priest, named [XXX], had been threatened with death in Nicaragua for raising awareness of the Nicaraguan government\u2019s human rights abuses. [XXX] told the principal claimant that there was a plan to bring [XXX] to Panama through Honduras. A man overheard this and asked why [XXX] did not come to Panama directly. The principal claimant testified that [XXX] did not respond to this question, but from his expression it was apparent that he was very afraid. Based on this interaction, the principal claimant concluded that the man who overheard their conversation was an informer for the Nicaraguan government.\n[30] When I asked the principal claimant whether he was aware of any cases of people being targeted in Panama by the Nicaraguan authorities or supporters of the Nicaraguan government, he referred to a news article in disclosure regarding a homicide in eastern Panama. This article reports that subjects entered through the window of a residence and killed a Nicaraguan citizen, and that the motive was unknown since there were no indications of theft.[13] The principal claimant testified that a pro-Nicaraguan newspaper described the victim in this incident as a \u201cNicaraguan with a dark past.\u201d Based on this report, the principal claimant concluded that the victim had been murdered by supporters of the Nicaraguan government due to his perceived opposition to the state.\n[31] I find that the principal claimants\u2019 reasons for believing that the Nicaraguan authorities or pro-state actors have reach throughout Panama are speculative. I accept the principal claimant\u2019s testimony that the men who attacked him in Nicaragua knew that he had been living in Panama. However, there is insufficient evidence for me to find that these agents of persecution would have the means or motivation to target the claimants in Panama. While the claimant\u2019s testimony supports a finding that there are Nicaraguan agents monitoring Nicaraguans in Panama, there is insufficient evidence that they are doing anything more than monitoring. I was unable to find any reports in the NDP of Nicaraguan actors targeting people in Panama due to their opposition to the Nicaraguan government. As the article provided by the claimants does not specify the culprit\u2019s motive, I cannot accept this article as evidence of a Nicaraguan citizen being targeted in Panama for political reasons. The comment in the Nicaraguan media that the victim was a \u201cNicaraguan with a dark past\u201d is insufficient for me to make such a finding.\n[32] With respect to the principal claimant\u2019s belief that the man who overheard his conversation with [XXX] was an informer for the Nicaraguan government, I find that there is insufficient evidence for me to accept this as a sufficiently established fact. The principal claimant alleges that the man asked [XXX] why [XXX] did not travel directly to Panama, which caused [XXX] to have a fearful expression on his face. This is not enough for me to find that the man was an informer for the Nicaraguan government, on a balance of probabilities.\n[33] For these reasons, I find that there is insufficient evidence that the Nicaraguan government and\/or pro-government actors have the means or motivation to target anti-government protesters in Panama. I therefore find that the minor claimant does not have a well\u00ad founded fear of persecution in Panama under s. 96.\nSection 97 Risk in Panama\n[34] Similar to the reasons given with respect to s. 96, I find that there is insufficient evidence to support a finding that the minor claimant faces as. 97 risk in Panama. The Federal Court has held that the range of harms which may constitute persecution is wider, or of similar scope, than the range of harms that may constitute a s. 97 risk. In addition, the legal test for s. 96 \u2014 serious possibility \u2014 is lower than the legal test for s. 97 \u2014 balance of probabilities.[14] As the claimants were unable to establish that the minor claimant faces a serious possibility of persecution in Panama, I also find that they have not established \u2014 on the higher threshold of a balance of probabilities \u2014 that the minor claimant would be subjected personally to a risk of harm in Panama contemplated by s. 97, which is narrower than the scope of persecution.\nState Protection\nNicaragua\n[35] For the claims against Nicaragua, as one of the agents of persecution is the Nicaraguan state, I find that the presumption of state protection has been rebutted.\nPanama\n[36] With respect to the minor claimant\u2019s claim against Panama, as I have found that she does not face a well-founded fear of persecution or as. 97 risk in Panama, it is not necessary to consider the availability of state protection in this country.\nInternal Flight Alternative\nNicaragua\n[37] Regarding the viability of an internal flight alternative in Nicaragua, as the Federal government is one of the agents of persecution and is in effective control of its territory, I find that the claimants would face a serious possibility of persecution throughout Nicaragua. I therefore find that there is no viable internal flight alternative for the claimants within Nicaragua.\nPanama\n[38] With respect to the minor claimant\u2019s claim against Panama, as I have found that she does not face a well-founded fear of persecution or a s. 97 risk in Panama, it is not necessary to consider the availability of an internal flight alternative in this country.\nCONCLUSION\n[39] For these reasons, I find that the principal claimant and associate adult claimants are Convention refugees and I accept their claims.\n[40] With respect to the minor claimant, as I find that she does not have a well-founded fear of persecution or face a s. 97 risk in Panama, her claim is therefore denied.\n[1] Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n[2] Exhibit 1.\n[3] Exhibit 1.\n[4] Canada v.

I\u2019m sorry to have kept everybody waiting for me but counsel I don\u2019t need to hear questions from you if that\u2019s okay.\n[2] COUNSEL: That\u2019s okay.\n[3] MEMBER: I am ready to make a decision, okay?\n[4] CLAIMANT: Okay.\n[5] MEMBER: This is the decision for [XXX], File number TC0-03000. I\u2019ve considered your testimony and the other evidence in your case and I\u2019m ready to render a decision orally.\n[6] You claim to be a citizen of Kenya; you are claiming refugee protection pursuant to Sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection act. In coming to a decision in your claim I have taken into consideration the chair person\u2019s Guideline 4 for women refugee claimants fearing gender related persecution in assessing the harm for feared by the claimant.\nDETERMINATION:\n[7] For the reasons that follow I find that you are a Convention refugee on the grounds of membership in a particular social group as a young woman facing gender based violence.\nALLEGATIONS:\n[8] Your allegations are found in your Basis of Claim Form at Exhibit 2. To summarize you allege that you face persecution at the hands of your father\u2019s family and your Kalenjin community due to your gender and age and specifically that you face the prospect of female genital mutilation and forced marriage against your wishes.\nIDENTITY:\n[9] I find that your identity has been established on a balance of probabilities by your testimony and the certified copy of your Kenyan passport at Exhibit 1.\nNEXUS:\n[10] I find there is a clear nexus between your fear and the convention ground of membership in a particular social group as a young woman facing gender based violence from your family and community. Therefore I have considered your claim under Section 96.\nCREDIBILITY:\n[11] When a claimant swears that certain facts are true, this creates a presumption that they are truthful unless there is reason to believe otherwise. Overall I find you to be a credible witness and I therefore accept your testimony and the statements you have made in your Basis of Claim.\n[12] You testified in a straightforward and detailed manner. I find that there are no serious reasons to reject your testimony on the basis of credibility. During the hearing you were responsive to questions that were asked and you did not appear to embellish your evidence.\n[13] You testified to be [XXX] years old. Shortly after [XXX] and before your [XXX] birthday, you testified that you were summoned to a meeting at a community eiders house in [XXX] 2018 where you were informed that [XXX](ph) was selected to be as a husband for you and was ready to pay a Dowry for you.\n[14] You knew [XXX] as an older rich white man from the community, sorry older rich man, I apologize. You were told of your upcoming circumcision in preparation for the wedding. You testified that you became upset at this and tried to educate those at the meeting about the negative effects of circumcision.\n[15] You testified about the dismissive reaction of your opposition, to your opposition and how your mother remained quiet at that meeting. You testified that things between yourself and your father were very tense for the next several months but that your mother told you about her true feelings on the issue, that she herself was circumcised and did not want you to go through that.\n[16] You testified that after your cousin\u2019s funeral in [XXX] you were beaten by your father and uncles because you would not agree to the cultural rituals of FGM. You testified that you ran away from your cousin\u2019s house and went to the police but that they were no help.\n[17] You testified that you were told by the police to turn to your community eiders for support. You testified about staying with various friends in Nakuru Nairobi and Mombasa and about being located by strange men.\n[18] When you were in Nakuru a man came to your house with a warning for you about \u201cgoing against your community\u201d. When you were in Nairobi you believed you were being followed and got a phone call where in the caller threatened to kill you.\n[19] When you were in hiding in Mombasa you were attacked by two men who attempted to kidnap you and \u201ctake you home\u201d. You did not know how they found you but believed all of these incidents were connected to your rejection of the marriage and the FGM.\n[20] All throughout you testified you were in contact with your mother, who was trying to help you. At her suggestion you applied for a passport and with her help you applied for a visa to Canada and fled Kenya.\n[21] Your allegations were internally coherent and consistent with the narrative and the affidavits you provided from [XXX] (ph), [XXX] (ph) I apologize if I mispronounced that, and [XXX](ph). Your claim is plausibly based on the documentary evidence. I discern not contradictions or omissions when comparing your testimony to the information on file.\n[22] You were able to testify credibly about the allegations and you provided corroboration to those allegations. I find you established your allegations on a balance of probabilities, therefore I find you\u2019ve established that you face mistreatment at the hands of your father, his family and your tribal community based on your circumstances of being a young female who refuses to undergo FGM and being forced into marriage on a balance of probabilities.\nOBJECTIVE BASIS:\n[23] I find that your fear of persecution has an objective basis. In that I found you to be credible and your claim is supported by the country condition documentation. The national documentation package for Kenya at Section 5 speaks extensively of the difficulties faced by women in Kenya.\n[24] According to the documentary evidence forced marriage and FGM continue to occur in Kenya. Though it does appear that the practises are starting to fall out of favor, FGM and forced marriage reportedly occur in higher frequencies in rural areas as compared to urban areas. You testified that your family comes from such a rural area where your father tends to cattle.\n[25] In Item 5.3 of the NDP, titled FGM in Kenya Country Profile Update 2016, the item identifies that FGM rates correlates strongly with educational levels and location. The report notes that in your ethnic group, the Kalenjin, girls tend to undergo FGM at a later age with the majority being cut after the age of ten, which coincides with your testimony about it being proposed at the age of eighteen in preparation for marriage. 27.9 percent of Kalenjin women have undergone FGM according to a 2014 study which is cited in that same report.\n[26] You also provide articles as part of your personal disclosure at Exhibit 4 which speaks to some of the Kalenjin traditions relating to forced marriage and FGM. In providing a cultural context for your allegations, the documentary evidence establishes and objective basis for your claim. I conclude that your fear of persecution as a member of a particular social group is well founded.\nSTATE PROTECTION:\n[27] The relevant case law establishes the presumption that the state is capable of protecting and providing adequate protection to its citizens. In your case there is clear and convincing evidence which demonstrates that adequate state protection is not available to you.\n[28] You testified that on two occasions you attempted to turn to the police, in both cases the police were unhelpful and dismissive of your allegations.\n[29] Item 2.1 of the NDP notes human rights issues in Kenya including the lack of accountability in many cases involving violence against women, include rape and FGM. Although legislation has been passed forbidding the practise of FGM in Kenya, issues relating to FGM continue.\n[30] Item 2.1 notes that authorities are reticent to get involved in matters seen as being of a domestic nature and are known to accept bribes. Authorities continue to cite domestic violence as a leading cause of preventable and non accidental death for women during the year except in cases of death police officers generally refrain from investigating domestic violence, which they consider to be a private family matter.\n[31] The law makes it illegal to practise FGM per cured the services of someone who practises FGM or send a person out of the country to undergo this procedure. The law also makes it illegal to make derogatory remarks about women who have not undergone FGM, government officials often practises being in public awareness programs to prevent the practise.\n[32] Nevertheless, individuals continue to practise FGM widely. Mixed support for the practise remains deep-rooted in some local cultures as well. Several reports cite that approximately twenty one percent of all adult women had undergone the procedure at some point in their lives in Kenya but that the practise has had, was heavily concentrated in a minority of communities.\n[33] For these reasons, I find that there is convincing evidence that adequate state protection would not be available to you.\n[34] I conclude that the presumption of state protection for you, in your particular noted circumstances has been refuted.\nINTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE:\n[35] Claimants must establish that they face persecution throughout their country of nationality. Nevertheless, I find that a viable internal flight alternative does not exist for you in Kenya. You are a young woman of limited means with a [XXX] education. You have attempted to find suitable alternatives in various cities noted above and have even spent some time sleeping outside out of fear of being found.\n[36] Item 5.5 of the NDP makes clear that there is not very much assistance given to single women looking for housing or employment either from the government or from NGO\u2019s in many parts of Kenya.\n[37] You also testified about trying to find safety in both Nairobi and Mombasa. In all of the locations mentioned you were located and threatened. On several occasions you testified about barely escaping abduction. Although you have no evidence that it directly connects to your father, based on the information you\u2019ve provided you believe it to be connected to your community and your refusal to undergo FGM.\n[38] I find sufficient grounds to conclude that relocating within Kenya would be unreasonable in your situation and I conclude that a viable internal flight alternative is not open to you in your country of origin.\nCONCLUSION:\n[39] Based on the totality of the evidence I find you\u2019ve established a well founded fear of persecution as a member of a particular social group and that you are a Convention refugee under Section 96 of the act. Your claim for refugee protection is granted.\n[40] Thank you.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n",

For the following reasons, the Panel finds that the claimant is a Convention refugee and this claim is accepted.\n[2] This claim was based on the following allegations. The claimant fears the severe conditions in Syria which have been caused by the civil war. As an elderly woman she is fearful of living alone and what will happen to her. The claimant obtained a Canadian visa on [XXX] 2018, she travelled to Canada on [XXX] 2019, and she signed her Basis of Claim on [XXX] 2019.\n[3] The Panel took into consideration the Chairpersons Guidelines on women refugee claimants when considering the process of the hearing and assessing the facts of this case.\n[4] The identity of the claimant was established on the basis of her Syrian passport, the original of which was seized by the Minister.\n[5] The Panel had no significant credibility concerns about this claim. The Panel had no significant credibility concerns about-, excuse me as the claimant explained she did not leave Syria earlier because her husband was elderly and sick so she could not leave him. He died in 2016 so the claimant started thinking about leaving then. Once she had her visa in [XXX] 2018, she continued to be fearful for her daughter who also would have been left alone so she did not leave until [XXX] 2019 when the claimant\u2019s daughter told her to leave and not worry about her. The claimant was clear and straightforward, there were no inconsistencies in her evidence or any attempts to embellish this claim. Any concerns that the Panel had were reasonably explained or otherwise did not outweigh the significant evidence in support of this claim.\n[6] In that respect the objective country conditions as reported in the NDP for Syria are unequivocal about the dire humanitarian situation in the country. It is well known that Syria has been in the midst of a horrific civil war for nine years which has seen incredible human rights atrocities committed on all sides of the conflict. The IRB has designated Syria as a country which is eligible for determination on a paper review basis, such is the severity of the conditions there, and to be perfectly honest the Panel felt this was one such claim which wo-, should have been flagged for paper review. The most recent source in the NDP for Syria is the March 2020 U.S. Department of State report and this source makes clear that the civil war and dire humanitarian situation continues unabated to this time. Quoting the UNHCR, the USDOS report notes that it is not safe, and it does not promote the return of refugees at this time. Further, the USDOS report notes that refugee returnees are often looked upon with suspicion for suspected support of the opposition. The country conditions evidence also supports that women face a significantly elevated risk of violence because of these conditions. The Panel is satisfied therefore that the claimant fits the profile of a person at high risk upon return to Syria and the claimant does have a Convention Nexus on the basis of her gender.\n[7] Given the country conditions in Syria, the claimant has rebutted the presumption that state protection would be adequate and forthcoming as the state of war exists throughout the country, there is no location in Syria the claimant could go where she would not face a serious possibility of persecution. For all these reasons the Panel finds that this claim is credible, the claimant\u2019s fear is well-founded, the claimant faces a serious possibility of persecution on account of her membership in a particular social group in Syria. The claimant is a Convention refugee and this claim is accepted.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n",

This decision is being rendered from the bench.\nDetermination:\n[2] I find that you are a Convention refugee based on imputed political opinion as a Falun Gong practitioner.\n[3] To summarize your allegations, you began practicing Falun Gong in [XXX] 2018. A fellow practitioner was arrested and you were warned to stop practicing Falun Gong. You were detained by authorities in [XXX] of 2019, forced to attend re-education classes and forced to sign a document repudiating Falun Gong.\n[4] Authorities also stopped paying your pension, and you left China as you feared further detention and ill-treatment from authorities.\nIdentity:\n[5] Your identity as a Chinese national is established by your passport.\nCredibility:\n[6] I did find you to be a credible witness. I note that you provided great details about your understanding of Falun Gong philosophy and about the purpose of the exercises, and I \u2026 I believe you have demonstrated a sol id understanding and commitment to the Falun Gong philosophy based on detailed answers that you gave to my Falun Gong questions.\n[7] I did find credible that your testimony that you were detained and threatened by authorities owing to your practice, as I find you gave spontaneous details about that including the documents that they gave you when they released you from detention.\n[8] I did have a credibility issue with the summons that you provided. I noted to you the hearing that it \u2026 it doesn\u2019t look like the summons that I have examples of, and I don\u2019t find credible that you wanted for arrest when you left China because I \u2026 I find, given the extensive surveillance Chinese authorities have that if you were indeed a fugitive from justice that you would not have been permitted to exit China.\n[9] I do find however credible that you are a genuine Falun Gong practitioner. I note also your activities in Canada. I find you have a sur place claim.\n[10] Also, I note the photograph that\u2019s published by a Canadian newspaper that you are \u2026 you\u2019re in that obviously in the newspaper, and the article shows Falun Gong practitioners in Toronto. And I do find that increases a risk from authorities in China, given that they could be aware of your Falun Gong activities in Canada, given that your \u2026 those activities are published in a publication available everywhere.\n[11] Concerning State protection, it is the State that has outlawed the practice of Falun Gong, so I find it objectively unreasonable for you to seek their protection.\n[12] There are many documents before me, those given by your counsel and those found at Exhibit 3 confirming that authorities have pursued sanctions against practitioners since 1999, and those discovered to be practitioners face re-education camps, harassment, removal of benefits, imprisonment, and torture.\n[13] I do find, based on the evidence that you provided as well as the country documents, that your fear of persecution is objectively well-founded.\n[14] As the agent of persecution is the State and Falun Gong is banned throughout the country, I find there is not an internal flight alternative for you.\n[15] I conclude that you are a Convention refugee and I accept your claim.\n[16] Ma\u2019am, I thank you for your testimony today. Counsel, thank you. Madam Interpreter, I can\u2019t say enough. Thank you so much. Excellent interpretation.

        "unofficial_text":"2020 RLLR 79\n\nCitation: 2020 RLLR 79\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: January 10, 2020\nPanel: D. Simonian\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Esther Lexchin\nCountry: Turkey\nRPD Number: TB9-16173\nAssociated RPD Number(s):\nATIP Number: A-2021-00800\nATIP Pages: 000128-000131\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: I have considered your testimony and the other evidence before me and I\u2019m ready to render my decision orally. You will receive an unedited copy of this decision in the mail. Your counsel will also get a copy. This is the decision in the claim for refugee protection made by [XXX], file number TB9-16173. You alleged that you are a citizen of Turkey and you are claiming refugee protection pursuant to Sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[2] I find that you are a Convention refugee because you have established that you face a serious possibility of persecution in Turkey due to your Kurdish ethnicity and your pro-Kurdish political activity as a supporter of the People\u2019s Democratic Party here and after HDP. I accept your claim.\n[3] The details of your claim are set out in your Basis of Claim form dated October 11th, 2018, found at Exhibit 2 and in your amended Basis of Claim form narratives, found at Exhibits 2.1 and 8.\n[4] In summary, you alleged that you are Kurdish, that you support the HDP and that you are involved in activities critical of the current Turkish government. You fear the Turkish government, Turkish Nationalists as well as certain anti-Kurdish bureaucrats who have infiltrated the military, education and health care sectors. You alleged that you have participated in a number of protests, that you helped mobilize students and other fellow citizens and that you have been politically outspoken on social media. You also allege that you have been arbitrarily detained by police on a number of occasions and that you sustained a permanent injury to your hand as a result of being beaten by police.\n[5] With respect to nexus, I find there is a link between what you fear and one of the five Convention grounds, specifically, political opinion. I have therefore assessed your refugee claim under Section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. You allege that you are a citizen of Turkey and that you are not a citizen or permanent resident of any other country. You provided your genuine Turkish passport and Turkish identity card to CBSA, copies of which are found at Exhibit 1. Based on that evidence, I find that you have established your identity as required under Section 106 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act and rule 11 of the Refugee Protection Division rules. I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that you are who you say you are.\n[6] The determinative issue in this claim is credibility. For the reasons I will outline shortly, I find you to be credible on a balance of probabilities. You provided evidence, both in your personal documents and in your testimony that you are Kurdish and that you have engaged in anti-government activities. In your Basis of Claim form and in your testimony, you explained your ethnic background and your experience growing up as a Kurdish person in Turkey. You further explained your involvement in the HDP, including how their goals align with your political ideology. You also explained your role in certain protests, how you were detained on several occasions and how you were attacked by police following a fight that broke out at your University.\n[7] As part of the exhz-, as part of Exhibits 5 and 8, you provided corroborating evidence, including, the record of your complaints statements, a letter from your University dormmate, photos of you participating in protests, a photo of you after you were injured by police, a Facebook post related to a protest that you attended, a text message exchange with [XXX], the [XXX], a letter from the Kurdish community centre in Canada and YouTube clips of you participating in a protest in [XXX]. Your personal documents were consistent in content and chronology with the account you gave in your Basis of Claim form and in your testimony regarding the circumstances that caused you to fear persecution in Turkey as a politically active Kurd.\n[8] I therefore find on a balance of probabilities that your documents are credible and trustworthy. Your testimony was straight-forward and responsive to my questions. There were no material inconsistencies or contradictions, you spoke passionately about your beliefs, your nation and your political goals. You provided many details with spontaneity and without embellishment. I therefore accept what you allege in your testimony and in your Basis of Claim form and I find on a balance of probabilities that you have established your profile as a politically active Kurd.\n[9] I find there is an objective basis for your fear of persecution in Turkey. In other words, the objective evidence is consistent with your allegation that because of your ethnicity and your political activism, you would face a serious risk of persecution in Turkey. In reaching my conclusion, I consider the documents in the National Documentation Package for Turkey, dated March 29, 2019, the index of which is found at Exhibit 3. I also consider the documents that counsel submitted on your behalf which are at Exhibit 6 and 7. In particular, the NDP states that since the 2016 attempted coup d\u2019\u00e9tat, the situation for Kurds in Turkey has worsened.\n[10] NDP Item 13.1 indicates that \u201cThe situation has worsened in Turkey for Kurds\u201d. Under the state of emergency, the executive orders make it easy to arrest Kurds and put them in jail without due process. The prosecutors can keep arrested people up to a month without a lawyer. Furthermore, the current permissive political environment increased tolerance against Kurds in the country. The executive orders targeted Kurds, hundreds of academics, public employees were fired from their works. Some of them have nothing to do with the HDP. As for society, the rise of anti-Kurdish attitudes is on the rise. The government again adopted a strong nationalist conservative discourse which alienated secular political opposition. Those who speak the Kurdish language are not tolerated and deemed as potential terrorists in Turkey. Communal violence against her-, Kurds is on the rise after the coup attempt but mainstream media are also hesitant to make news about these incidents\u201d.\n[11] Under the guise of the emergency decrees and anti-terrorism laws, the Turkish government disproportionately subjects Kurds and those critical of the government to various human rights violations. While Turkey is no longer under a state of emergency, the emergency decrees granting abusive powers remain in force. Despite the public declaration of a repeal of the state of emergency, there is no change in the treatment of Kurds and those persons who are or perceived to be critical of the government. Based on the objective country documentary evidence, I find on a balance of probabilities that your fear of persecution is well-founded.\n[12] There is a presumption that States are capable of protecting their citizens, however, a claimant can rebut the presumption of state protection and demonstrate that they would not receive such protection by providing clear and convincing evidence of the unwillingness or inability of the State to protect them. You testified that rather than protecting you, Turkish police forces were often the source of violence, attacks and oppression. Based on your personal circumstances as well as the objective country documentation, I find that you have rebutted the presumption of state protection. In other words, adequate state protection would not be available to you if you were to seek it in Turkey.\n[13] In considering whether an internal flight alternative exists for you, I find that you face a serious possibility of persecution throughout Turkey. The objective documentary evidence indicates that the government and authorities operate similarly throughout the country. In other words, there is nowhere that you could live safely in Turkey. I therefore find that there is no internal flight available to you in that country.\n[14] In conclusion, after assessing all of the evidence, I find that you would face a serious possibility of persecution pursuant to Section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act should you return to Turkey. Accordingly, I find that you are a Convention refugee and I accept your claim.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n",

The allegations are fully set out in the Basis of Claim form, principal claimant alleges a fear of persecution at the hands of the Iranian government because of his political opinion and anti-regime activities. The associate claimant and minor claimant also have a fear of persecution because of their imputed political opinion and association with the principal claimant, they have also been directly threatened by Iranian authorities.\nDETERMINATION\n[2] The Panel finds that the principal claimant has established a serious possibility of persecution because of his political opinion and his anti-regime activity and that therefore he is a Convention refugee pursuant to Section 96 of IRPA. The associate claimant and minor claimant also face a serious possibility of persecution on a-, because of their imputed political opinion and they have been threatened Iranian authorities as well. So, they are also Convention refugees pursuant to Section 96 of IRPA.\nIDENTITY\n[3] On a balance of probabilities, the claimants\u2019 established that they are citizens of Iran based on certified true copies of their passports.\nCREDIBILITY\n[4] On a balance of probabilities, the Panel finds the following facts to be true or following allegations to be true. The principal claimant worked in a [XXX] or [XXX] that had been taken over to be run by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard. Worker\u2019s wages were not paid over an extended period of time and the principal claimant joined in protests, without any income he managed with family resources and support during this period.\n[5] Specifically, on [XXX] 2017, he joined a large gathering on Labour Day, the principal claimant was detained and released after signing something said he would not protest again. In [XXX] 2017, however he did join a nationwide protest against inflation, unemployment, injustice and so forth. There were undercover police hitting protestors with batons, principal claimant was hit but he evaded detention at that time.\n[6] In [XXX] 2018, the principal claimant and his wife went to Turkey to get fingerprinted at the Canadian Embassy in order to get a temporary resident visa to go and visit the principal claimant\u2019s brother here in Canada. At that time, he had no intention yet of leaving permanently. Upon their return from Turkey they were contacted by their town\u2019s local intelligence services, so town of [XXX]. And they were taken into interrogation from 9 AM to 9 PM, when they were asked about why they went to Turkey and basically accused of being in Turkey to assist opposition to the Iranian regime. They did not say anything about getting their TRV\u2019s, if they had they might have had exit interdiction slapped on them.\n[7] When they were released, they were told that they would be contacted by the intelligent services of Ramadan which is the capital city. Both were very concerned. On [XXX] 2018 the claimant was taken into custody, he was mistreated and tortured. Panel finds his testimony very compelling and authentic. He was told that his wife and child were hurt, fortunately this was not true and he was released on [XXX] 2018. Panel notes that the associate panel-, associate claimant\u2019s testimony in this, in this regard was also very compelling about trying to figure out where he was in the period, during his period in detention and so forth. At that point, the family decided they had to leave Canada and use the TRV\u2019s and came here in [XXX] 2018. The claimants claimed refugee protection about four months later, once they had satisfied themselves that there was no hope of being safe if they returned.\n[8] The Panel accepts on a balance of probabilities that the principal and associate claimants have provided credible evidence to support their subjective fear of persecution by Iranian authorities and of detention and a risk to their lives as a result of the principal\u2019s claimant\u2019s political activities should they return to Iran. Overall, the Panels finds the claimants\u2019 evidence was consistent, plausible, and not contradicted by documentary evidence on country conditions in Iran. The allegations were supported by personal documents that were credible, there were no contradictions or omissions that go to the core of the claim. The Panel, therefore, accepts the evidence as establishing the claimants\u2019 subjective fear of persecution because of political opinion or imputed political opinion.\n[9] On just a few words on an objective basis. The objective basis for the claim and documentary evidence, the Panel finds that the claimants\u2019 subjective fear is based on the document-, objective documentary evidence before the panel and is therefore well-founded. So, just looking for example at the US Department of State report for 2018, which is in the National Documentation Package for Iran. It notes that the Iranian regime engages in politically motiva-, motivated violence and repression to suppress dissenting political opinions, subjecting people to arbitrary arrest and detention, as well as unfair judicial processes.\n[10] The government\u2019s human rights record remains extremely poor and worsened in several key areas, it goes on to give some examples. I also note that Pa-, that counsel submitted some articles that are specifically focused on persons that were detained after protesting labour protests in Iran around the same time that the claimant was on the streets as well. Panel finds on a balance of probabilities that the objective country documentary evidence supports the claimants\u2019 allegations. And the claimants have a well-founded fear of detention and risk to their lives and torture in Iran by reason of political opinion and anti-regime activities.\nSTATE PROTECTION\n[11] As the agent of persecution is the government of Iran, in this case, the Panel finds it would be objectively unreasonable for the claimants the seek the protection of the Iranian State. Panel finds the claimants have rebutted the presumption of state protection with clear and convincing evidence.\nINTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE\n[12] The Panel finds that the objective country evidence establishes the authorities operate similarly throughout Iran and the claimants face a serious possibility of persecution throughout Iran because of their political opinion, or imputed political opinion. Therefore, a viable internal flight alternatives are not available to the claimants.\nCONCLUSION\n[13] Based on the foregoing analysis, the Panel concludes that the claimants are Convention refugees and their claims are accepted.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n",

Ruthven\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Constance Nakatsu\nCountry: Venezuela\nRPD Number: TB8-30661\nAssociated RPD Number(s): TB8-30706, TB8-30822, TB8-30660\nATIP Number: A-2021-00800\nATIP Pages: 000110-000123\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] These reasons and decision are in regards to the claims for protection made by [XXX] (principal claimant), [XXX] (youngest female claimant), [XXX] (male claimant), and [XXX] (eldest female claimant).\n[2] Each is claiming protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.[1] The panel heard the claims jointly, pursuant to Refugee Protection Division Rule 55.[2]\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] The principal claimant\u2019s full allegations are set out in her Basis of Claim Form and related narrative,[3] including the narrative amendments.[4] The claims of the male claimant, the eldest female claimant, and the youngest female claimant each rely on the narrative of the principal claimant. In summary, the claimants fear persecution in Venezuela due to the anti-government political opinion of the three eldest claimants.\n[4] The principal claimant and the male claimant each joined the Primero Justicia political party in 2010. The eldest female claimant subsequently joined Primero Justicia in 2011. Their participation included distributing flyers in their respective neighbourhoods, and attending weekly meetings. The principal claimant and the male claimant loaned out sound equipment from their business for use by Primero Justicia at rallies and marches.\n[5] The principal claimant and the male claimant were assaulted and threatened on three occasions related to the 2012 presidential campaign. In [XXX] 2012, just prior to the official campaign start, the principal claimant and the male claimant were threatened by three chavistas on motorcycles. The principal claimant was threatened as she was pushed against a wall, and told to stop supporting Henrique Capriles Radonski. On [XXX] 2012, chavistas again attacked the principal claimant and the male claimant in Puerto Cabello. The male claimant was injured with a stick, and he required hospital treatment for an abdominal injury. Finally, the principal claimant was threatened on [XXX] 2012 at a march in Barinitas.\n[6] The principal claimant, the male claimant, and the eldest female claimant were threatened by men on motorcycles in Carabobo State on [XXX] 2013, as they were setting up sound equipment for a Henrique Capriles Radonski rally. The men physically assaulted the eldest female claimant, and they showed the principal claimant a threatening gesture.\n[7] The physical attacks escalated to include specific mention of claimant names by the attackers. On [XXX] 2013, the eldest female claimant organized an opposition rally in her neighbourhood, to coincide with International Workers\u2019 Day. Men on motorcycles approached the eldest female claimant, and threw a tear gas canister at her while calling her name, and referencing the principal claimant. The eldest female claimant was treated for gas inhalation.\n[8] The adult male was physically assaulted on [XXX] 2014 at a march in support of Leopoldo Lopez and other opposition figures. The adult male fell to the ground unconscious. During the subsequent hospital treatment, the adult male was diagnosed with [XXX]. He was affected by the medicine shortages in Venezuela, but he was able to access [XXX] in Carabobo State.\n[9] In [XXX] 2017, national protests began to escalate. The National Guard invaded the San Diego neighbourhood where the four claimants were residing at the time. The son of the principal claimant was arrested, but his release was later secured by the principal claimant\u2019s intervention. Her son fled to the United States of America in [XXX] 2017. In [XXX] 2018, the eldest female claimant was assaulted by colectivos, as she stood in line to buy food.\n[10] The members of the colectivos specifically asked about the principal claimant. The principal claimant was herself subsequently refused food sales in [XXX] 2018, as the principal claimant did not possess a card which showed her chavista support.\n[11] On [XXX] 2018, the eldest female claimant and the youngest female claimant departed Venezuela, and they entered the United States of America. On [XXX] 2018, the principal claimant and the male claimant departed Venezuela, and they entered the United States of America. The claimants crossed the land border into Canada on [XXX] 2018, and they each made their claims for protection.\nDETERMINATION\n[12] The panel finds that the principal claimant, the male claimant, and the eldest female claimant are each Convention refugees, pursuant to section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, based on their anti-government political opinion.\n[13] The panel also finds that the youngest female claimant is a Convention refugee, pursuant to section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, based on her imputed political opinion.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[14] The panel finds that each of the claimants has established their identity as a national of Venezuela, based on a balance of probabilities. Each claimant presented their Venezuela passport.[5] The panel finds no reason to doubt the authenticity of any of these four documents.\nCredibility\n[15] The panel found the principal claimant and the eldest female claimant to be credible witnesses. Both the principal claimant and the eldest female claimant testified in straightforward manners, and there were no relevant inconsistencies in their oral testimony or contradictions between their oral testimony and the written submissions.\n[16] The panel finds that the principal claimant coherently explained the involvement of herself, her husband, and her mother in the campaigns of opposition candidates, as well as the campaigns of Primero Justicia, since approximately 2010. Similarly, the panel finds that the eldest female claimant provided detailed and spontaneous testimony about her motivation to join Primero Justicia.\n[17] The panel found that neither the principal claimant nor the eldest female claimant exaggerated or embellished their testimony, and they each provided spontaneous details about their own personal involvement in the anti-government rallies and marches in Venezuela.\n[18] Despite the above, the panel finds that there were allegations presented for these claims that were not supported by the oral and written evidence. These allegations relate specifically to the male claimant being targeted in his medical care, namely having a [XXX] refused based on his anti-government involvement in Venezuela. The panel accepts that the male claimant has suffered long-term [XXX] (now diagnosed as end-stage [XXX]), and that these [XXX] challenges require regular and ongoing [XXX] and prescription treatments. Other diagnosed medical problems for the male claimant include [XXX] and [XXX].[6]\n[19] Although the panel finds that there was sufficient medical evidence presented to support the ongoing and long-term medical challenges for the male claimant, the panel notes that limited evidence was adduced to support that the male claimant faces a risk of harm in Venezuela, related to the authorities denying him any medical treatment that is available to other citizens of Venezuela.\n[20] The male claimant testified that he attempted to obtain a [XXX] in both Italy and Venezuela. He was not successful in either country. The claimant further testified that he travelled to Caracas every two months, but that around 2015 or 2016, he was told that there was a general crisis in the health care industry, and that a [XXX] would not be available to him, due to lack of resources. The male claimant clarified in his testimony that he never received a phone call regarding the availability of a [XXX] to be [XXX] his body.\n[21] This testimony from the male claimant is in contrast to the Basis of Claim Form narrative statements provided by the principal claimant regarding an urgent trip to Caracas by the male claimant and the eldest female claimant on [XXX] 2017. The narrative statements also indicated that there was a [XXX] available for [XXX] for the male claimant, but that the [XXX] was subsequently denied to him at the Caracas hospital.[7]\n[22] The panel carefully reviewed the presented post-hearing documentation related to possible side effects of four prescriptions taken by the male claimant,[8] and the panel notes that for the past six months, family members of the male claimants have approached [XXX] of Hamilton, Ontario regarding declining [XXX] functioning, as well as increased [XXX], and increased [XXX] on the part of the male claimant.\n[23] Based on the objective medical evidence presented the panel accepts that, on a balance of probabilities, the male claimant faced [XXX] challenges during his testimony at the hearing. The medical documentation in support of these [XXX] difficulties was not presented to the panel until after the date of the hearing, so the panel is left to balance the differences in the evidence presented, namely between the Basis of Claim Form narrative statements and the testimony of the male claimant.\n[24] The panel finds insufficient reliable evidence was adduced to corroborate a specific targeting of the male claimant in Venezuela, based on his health conditions.\n[25] Despite this negative credibility inference, the panel finds that the credible testimony of the principal claimant, in conjunction with the credible testimony of the eldest female claimant, and in consideration of the supporting documents presented, have cumulatively provided sufficient evidence that the principal claimant, the male claimant, and the eldest female claimant were each long-term members of the Primera Justicia political party, and that they actively and publicly participated in anti-government rallies and marches in support of high-profile opposition candidates over the past ten years.\n[26] The credible evidence of the political participation overcomes the sole negative credibility inference.\nSupporting Documents\n[27] The claimants presented fifteen photographs regarding the involvement of the principal claimant, the male claimant, and the eldest female claimant in opposition rallies and marches in Venezuela.[9] The panel finds that the principal claimant\u2019s testimony provided spontaneous details about the background of these photographs, and as such added to the credibility of the claims made by the three eldest claimants.\n[28] In support of their claims for protection, the claimants also presented copies of their Primera Justicia membership certificates,[10] business registration documents for [XXX],[11] and medical documentation related to serious injuries sustained at protest marches and rallies in Venezuela between [XXX] 2013 and [XXX] 2018.[12] The panel finds no reason to doubt the authenticity of any of these documents. As such, they were assigned high probative value, based on their relevance to the allegations put forth by the claimants.\nSubjective Fear Considerations\n[29] The panel putto the claimants at the hearing some possible subjective fear considerations, namely their failure to claim asylum during their time in the United States of America, as well as the return of the principal claimant and the male claimant to Venezuela in the two years that lead up to their decision to depart Venezuela permanently.\n[30] The male claimant testified that he travelled to Italy in [XXX] 2017, as he wanted to seek out the possibility of a [XXX] in that country. When it became obvious that to the male claimant that he would not receive a [XXX] in Italy, the male claimant returned to Venezuela.\n[31] Although the panel assigned the male claimant\u2019s testimony reduced probative value in relation to the cognitive impairments that he has faced over the past six months (as documented by medical professionals in Canada), the panel notes that this portion of the testimony is supported by passport entry stamps and exit stamps. In conjunction with the presented medical documentation regarding [XXX], the panel accepts the male claimant\u2019s explanation regarding his trip to Italy as being reasonable, under the circumstances.\n[32] The principal claimant provided Basis of Claim Form narrative statements which indicated that her visit to the United States of America in [XXX] 2018 was to care for her son, [XXX] as he was facing [XXX] health issues.[13] The panel acknowledges that the principal claimant returned to Venezuela before her status in the United States of America expired.\n[33] The principal claimant also testified that her son was a resident of the state of Wisconsin in [XXX] 2018. She was aware that [XXX] had made a claim for asylum one-and-a-half years prior to their arrival in [XXX] 2018, but her son had not received any response from the authorities of the United States of America, up until that point. The principal claimant further testified that she had a cousin in Canada, and that she preferred to make a claim for protection in Canada, based on what she had heard about the policies of the administration in the United States of America, especially as it related to Latin Americans (as immigrants). The panel finds these explanations to be reasonable, under the circumstances.\n[34] As such, the panel did not draw any negative inferences from the failure to claim in the United States of America, or the returns to Venezuela by the principal claimant and the male claimant in the two years before their final departure from Venezuela.\nObjective Basis of the Claim\n[35] The panel finds that the overall objective evidence supports the claims for Convention refugee protection for the principal claimant, the male claimant, and the eldest female claimant, based on their anti-government political opinion. Separately, the panel also finds that the overall objective evidence supports the claim for Convention refugee protection for the youngest female claimant, based on her imputed political opinion.\nPolitical Profile of the Three Eldest Claimants in Venezuela\n[36] The panel considered whether there was a serious risk of persecution for the principal claimant, the male claimant, and the eldest female claimant in Venezuela, particularly based on their respective political profiles, pursuant to section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[37] The panel finds that the totality of the corroborating evidence enumerated above, in addition to the testimony of the principal claimant and the eldest female claimant, has provided sufficient evidence to support that the principal claimant, the male claimant, and the eldest female claimant have each been prominently involved in the opposition movement of Venezuela since at least 2010 (in the case of the principal claimant and the male claimant) and at least 2011 (in the case of the eldest female claimant).\n[38] The panel further finds that, on a balance of probabilities, these prominent roles would reasonably lead to the principal claimant, the male claimant, and the eldest female claimant being associated with the opposition in Venezuela, in the eyes of government groups, and government operatives and agents. The panel accepts the testimony of the principal claimant and the eldest female claimant regarding the motivation of the persons threatening them (at political rallies and in line for food) as being directly related to their support of opposition candidates, and their support for the Primero Justicia political party.\nImputed Political Opinion of the Youngest Female Claimant\n[39] Although the panel finds that the political profile of the youngest female claimant was not in itself enough to draw the attention of the authorities of Venezuela, the panel examined a possible imputed political profile for the youngest female claimant, as it related to her family relationships. The panel notes that the youngest female claimant is the adult daughter of the principal claimant and the male claimant, as well as the granddaughter of the eldest female claimant, and the younger sister of [XXX].[14]\n[40] The principal claimant testified that the youngest female claimant would be targeted upon a return to Venezuela, as the authorities specifically target family members of those individuals who are deemed to be against the government.\n[41] Although [XXX] was not present at the hearing to provide testimony in support of any of the claims for protection, the panel finds that relevant portions of his Basis of Claim Form narrative[15] were supported by the testimony of the principal claimant. The panel notes the authorities of Venezuela have previously attended the residence of the four claimants (including the youngest female claimant), in search of [XXX]. Should the youngest female claimant return to Venezuela, the panel accepts the testimony that she would be sought after in relation to her older brother, her parents, and her grandmother.\nRecent Abuses at the Hands of the Security Forces and their Allies\n[42] Abuses have increased in Venezuela, as security forces and allied armed civilian militias, also known as colectivos have been deployed to violently quash protests in February 2019, the Venezuelan Human Rights group Faro Penal documented seven deaths, 107 arbitrary detentions, and 58 bullet injuries that resulted from the use of force by state security forces and colectivos that blocked aid from entering the country.[16]\n[43] The most significant human rights issues in Venezuela included extrajudicial killings by security forces, including colectivos, torture by security forces, harsh and life-threatening prison conditions; and political prisoners. The government of Venezuela took no effective action to investigate officials who committed human rights abuses, and there was impunity for such abuses.[17]\n[44] The regime in Venezuela aggressively seeks to define national identity according to its own ideology. The opposition and anyone critical of the government are denied the status of citizen. The National Electoral Council is by no means impartial, and there are reasonable doubts as to whether the published results reflect voters\u2019 preferences. After President Madura\u2019s razor\u00ad thin victory, the opposition presented over two hundred substantiated allegations of electoral rule violations. There is evidence of pressure on public employees to attend campaign rallies, and freedom of association and assembly is severely restricted in practice. The vast majority of judges hold provisional or temporary office, and the autonomy and impartiality of public prosecutors is seriously affected by improper interference by political actors.[18]\nRisk of Harm for All Four Claimants\n[45] The panel finds that the claimants presented sufficient evidence in the written submissions and testimony to establish that the principal claimant, the male claimant, and the eldest female claimant were each specifically targeted by the actions of the chavistas, and later by the colectivos. The criminal acts included property damage, physical assaults, and threats to their lives. The panel also finds that the preponderance of the evidence points to the youngest female claimant, now an adult, would similarly be targeted based on a perceived anti-government political opinion (in relation to her parents, her older brother, and her maternal grandmother).\n[46] The panel finds that all four claimants have established an objective basis for their respective claims, and that their fears are well-founded.\nState Protection\n[47] The claimants sought police protection in relation to the physical assault against the eldest female claimant, the threatening gesture, and the property damage that occurred in Carabobo State on [XXX] 2013. The principal claimant indicated in her Basis of Claim Form narrative that she was told by the police that it was best for her to leave things as they were, and that the police were only able to provide assistance to them if the motorcycle make, and the licence plate numbers, were known to her as a declarant.[19]\n[48] The panel finds that the lack of further attempts to seek redress with the authorities of Venezuela was reasonable, under the circumstances.\n[49] Based on the venues and timings of the various threats from chavistas and colectivos on motorcycles, the panel accepts the threats of harm were directed at the principal claimant, the male claimant, and the eldest female claimant because they were actively supporting the opposition to the government of Venezuela.\n[50] For more than a decade, political power has been concentrated in a single party with an increasingly authoritarian executive exercising significant control over the legislative, judicial, citizens\u2019 power, including the prosecutor general and ombudsman, and electoral branches of government.[20]\n[51] There were continued reports of excessive use of force by security forces in Venezuela, particularly in the repression of protests over the lack of food and medicine. There were also reports from the Attorney General\u2019s Office that groups of armed people with the support or acquiescence of the government carried out violent actions against demonstrators.[21]\n[52] Although the vast majority of colectivos are peaceful neighbourhood groups, the opposition accuses some of being violent paramilitary wings of the ruling Socialist Party, especially in urban areas. Motorized bands have less structure, but still receive full government support.[22]\n[53] In light of the above, the panel finds that those associated with the opposition in Venezuela are at risk of harm, and as such, it would be objectively unreasonable for any of the four claimants, in their particular set of circumstances, to seek redress or protection from the authorities in Venezuela. The documentary evidence in the National Documentation Package for Venezuela is both clear and convincing, and that it rebuts the presumption of adequate state protection for the four claimants in Venezuela.\nInternal Flight Alternatives\n[54] The panel considered possible internal flight alternatives for each of the four claimants in Venezuela. The state and their operatives are the agents of persecution for the four claimants. Given that the government controls the entire territory of Venezuela, and given that the colectivos operate across Venezuela, the panel finds that there is a serious possibility of persecution for each claimant throughout Venezuela, and therefore no viable internal flight alternatives exist for any of the four claimants in any part of Venezuela.\nCONCLUSION\n[55] For the foregoing reasons, the panel finds that there is a serious possibility that each of the four claimants face persecution in Venezuela, pursuant to section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[56] The panel concludes that the principal claimant, the male claimant, and the eldest female claimant are each Convention refugees based on their political opinion. In addition, the panel finds that the youngest female claimant is a Convention refugee based on her imputed political opinion.\n[57] The panel therefore accepts all four claims.\n[1] X\n[2] X\n[3] X\n[4] X\n[5] Exhibit 1.\n[6] Exhibit 21 (post-hearing).\n[7] Exhibit 2.\n[8] Exhibit 20 (post-hearing).\n[9] Exhibit 17.\n[10] Exhibit 16.\n[11] Exhibit 16.\n[12] Exhibit 15.\n[13] Exhibit 2 and Exhibit 18.\n[14] Exhibit 2, Exhibit 3, Exhibit 4, and Exhibit 6.\n[15] Exhibit 6.\n[16] Exhibit 7, NDP for Venezuela (30 August 2019), item 1.4.\n[17] Exhibit 7, NDP for Venezuela (30 August 2019), item 2.1.\n[18] Exhibit 7, NDP for Venezuela (30 August 2019), item 4.12.\n[19] Exhibit 2 and Exhibit 18.\n[20] Exhibit 7, NDP for Venezuela (30 August 2019), item 2.1.\n[21] Exhibit 7, NDP for Venezuela (30 August 2019), item 2.2.\n[22] Exhibit 7, NDP for Venezuela (30 August 2019), item 4.12.\n\n",

Bonhomme\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Robin Edoh\nCountry: Jamaica\nRPD Number: TB8-28318\nAssociated RPD Number(s):\nATIP Number: A-2021-00800\nATIP Pages: 000105-000109\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: Alright good morning we are back on the record after a break. I see that your witness is present would you like her to remain for the duration of the hearing? Okay.\n[2] I have considered your testimony and the other evidence in the case and I am ready to render my decision orally. This is the decision for [XXX]. You are claiming to be a citizen of Jamaica and you are claiming refugee protection pursuant to Sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[3] Given the nature of this claim I have taken into consideration the chair person\u2019s guideline for proceedings before the Immigration and Refugee Board involving sexual orientation and gender identity and expression.\n[4] You will receive an unedited transcript of this oral decision in the mail in approximately three weeks. Your counsel will also receive a copy and can answer any related questions you may have at that time.\nDETERMINATION:\n[5] Your claim is accepted. I find that you are a Convention refugee on the grounds of membership in a particular social group namely bisexual woman for the following reasons.\nALLEGATIONS:\n[6] You allege that you are a citizen of Jamaica and that you are a bisexual woman who is believed to be a lesbian by your family and community in St. Catherine\u2019s. You were pressured into entering into relationships with men in Jamaica including a marriage which did not last very long.\n[7] You have been mistreated by family members and subject to threats and abusive language by the community as well as attempts on your life due to your perceived sexual orientation.\n[8] You allege that if you return you will be harmed or killed. You allege that there is no state protection for you or an internal flight alternative.\nIDENTITY:\n[9] Your personal identity as a citizen of Jamaica has been established by your testimony and the supporting documents filed in the exhibits, particularly the certified true copy of your Jamaican passport and Canadian visa. I find that on a balance of probabilities you are who you say you are and that the country of reference is Jamaica.\nNEXUS:\n[10] I find that there is a link between what you fear and one of the five convention grounds namely membership in a particular social group, bisexual women and therefore I have only assessed the claim under Section 96.\nCREDIBILITY:\n[11] In terms of your general credibility I found you to be a credible witness and I therefore believe what you have alleged in your testimony and in your basis of claim form.\n[12] You answered all questions put to in a forthright manner, without hesitation or embellishment. When you did not know the answer to a question you said so. You displayed what appeared to be genuine emotion regarding difficult experiences in your life related to your sexual orientation.\n[13] For the most part your testimony was consistent with the allegations in your basis of claim form. I do find that there were some embellishment in your basis of claim form, for example when you described there to be many attempts on your life yet you were only able to describe two incidents in your testimony.\n[14] Although there were also some inconsistencies between the forms, your basis of claim form and your testimony, I accept your explanation that they were mistakes and likely owing to your emotional state.\n[15] You have provided the following documents to support your claim. Support letters from sister and mother confirming being aware of your sexual orientation and in the case of your mother of your mistreatment in Jamaica due to your perceived sexual orientation, a letter from the 519 centre in Toronto confirming your active involvement with the LGBTQ community in Toronto and the spousal sponsorship application made by your former same sex partner which was requested by the board and immediately forthcoming from you.\n[16] Your current same sex partner [XXX](ph) attended the hearing today and testified as a witness at the request of the panel. For the most part you were both consistent with relevant details of your relationship. Although there were some discrepancies adequate explanations were provided.\n[17] Based on of the above I believe on a balance of probabilities that you are a bisexual woman. believe that you have been in relationships with at least two women in Canada and that you were too fearful to act on your interest in women while in Jamaica.\n[18] I believe that you were subject to harassment and threats in your community in Jamaica as a result of your suspected sexual orientation. I believe that you are fearful to return to Jamaica because you may be harmed or killed due to your sexual orientation.\n[19] I therefore find that your subjective fear is established by your credible testimony, your witness\u2019s credible testimony and by your corroborating documentation and I believe what you have alleged on a balance of probabilities.\n[20] I also find based on a review of the national documentation package that your fear is objectively well founded.\n[21] The documents including Item 6.1 through to 6.5 state that homosexual acts between males are criminalized in Jamaica, while the laws are not enforced and do not speak to acts between women the existence of these laws creates a climate that sanctions violence and discrimination against sexual minorities including lesbians.\n[22] Some types of Jamaican music propagate homophobia and politicians and church leaders have made negative statements towards sexual minorities.\n[23] Several sources including Articles submitted by your counsel report that sexual minorities are the target of violence including mob violence in Jamaica. Women believed to be lesbians are specifically targeted for corrective rape.\n[24] Sources also report that police often fail to take action regarding incidents of violence directed at sexual minorities. In some cases police are the perpetrators. Sexual minorities are often reluctant to report incidents for fear of their well being and for fear they may be extorted based on their sexual identity. I find that you have a well founded fear of persecution in Jamaica.\nSTATE PROTECTION:\n[25] States are presumed to be capable of protecting their own citizens except in situations where the state is in a state of complete breakdown. I find the objective documentary evidence I have already referred to, to be clear and convincing evidence to rebut the presumption of state protection.\n[26] Not only do police often fail to take action regarding incidents of violence directed at sexual minorities but in some cases police are the perpetrators.\nINTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE:\n[27] I have also considered whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for you. I find that there is no viable internal flight alternative available to you as the evidence indicates that there is a serious possibility of the persecution throughout the country. The climate of homophobia and violence exists throughout Jamaica.\nCONCLUSION:\n[28] Based on the totality of the evidence I find you to be a Convention refugee and I accept your claim. The hearing is now concluded.\n[29] CLAIMANT: Thank you very much ma\u2019am.\n[30] MEMBER: Thank you for coming this morning and sharing your story, thank you ma\u2019am for attending today and testifying as well. Counsel thank you for assistance. I am just returning the original documents to you right now. Thanks.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n",

She had [XXX] in Bogot\u00e1, and she had a number of [XXX] belonging to her, her husband, and her daughter. Because of her profile, her office was contacted by the ELN guerrillas \u2014\n[7] INTERPRETER: By \u2014\n[8] MEMBER: By ELN guerrillas, asking for contribution to support their cause. Initially, the claimant did not provide any money to them, but after being targeted several times and fearing death, on one occasion she paid them [XXX] pesos. After the payment, she felt that ELN would stop the extortion, but the ELN did not. They continued extorting her, and finally they even targeted her daughter, who was abused physically and sexually by the ELN. And when the claimant returned to Bogot\u00e1, she was almost killed by them. Her driver was able to swing his car and was able to save her. She left Colombia despite her parents needing her, despite all the [XXX] she had, despite all the [XXX] she had, to come to Canada to seek protection.\nIdentity\n[9] The claimant\u2019s identity has been established to the satisfaction of the panel. In that the panel refers to Exhibit 1, where the panel sees the claimants\u2019 passport copies, which indicate that all the claimants are citizens of Colombia. And the claimant testified that they do not have any status anywhere else. On a balance of probabilities, the panel finds that the claimants in this case are all citizens of Colombia.\n[10] The determinative issues in this case are credibility and subjective fear. On that subject, the panel incorporates Counsel\u2019s submissions in its decision regarding subjective fear. The claimant and her daughter were very emotional. Their demeanour clearly indicated their fear of the ELN guerrillas.\n[11] Based on the evidence, which is supported by documentary evidence in Exhibit 4, the panel finds that the claimant and her husband were reasonably [XXX] people. The claimant had [XXX] of [XXX], while her husband had one, which he [XXX] prior to coming to Canada. They have several [XXX] and [XXX]. The claimant testified that she created an [XXX] for her family. She loved her country. Her parents are vulnerable \u2014 they\u2019re still there \u2014 but her daughter has been stigmatized by what happened to her. The claimant indicated on several occasions that it was a big mistake on her part to have not left Colombia earlier, and had returned, after coming to Canada, back to Colombia. She testified that she had apologized to her family for doing what she did. And while she was in Colombia, she had a bodyguard.\n[12] INTERPRETER: She had \u2014\n[13] MEMBER: Bodyguard, and a bulletproof vehicle for safety of her whole family. Her bodyguard was an [XXX], who finally told her to flee from Colombia if she wanted to save her life and lives of her family. On one occasion, the claimant testified that she had to return to Colombia because of the [XXX] situation of her son, and she provided documentary evidence to support that.\n[14] Therefore, based on the evidence provided by the claimant as well as Counsel, the panel is satisfied that the claimant had to return to Colombia, but despite of all the [XXX] she had, she could not get any police protection. She went to Fiscal\u00eda on more than one occasion. Even after her laptop was stolen \u2014 and Counsel showed the panel the little video of that stealing \u2014 the Fiscal\u00eda could not do anything for her, and she testified she had no other alternative but to come to Canada to seek protection.\n[15] The panel finds, based on what Counsel submitted and the claimant testified, that the claimant\u2019s explanation about subjective fear is satisfactory. In this case, the agents of persecution are the ELN guerrillas. Given the amount of [XXX] she had, it is plausible that the ELN would be motivated to seek extortion from her.\n[16] Insofar as credibility is concerned, the claimant was reasonably credible witness. There were some minor credibility issues, which were explained by the claimant, her daughter, and Counsel in his submissions to the satisfaction of the panel. The panel gives the benefit of doubt in this case to the claimants and accepts their story in support of the claim. This is a well-documented claim, in that it contains support documents for everything the claimant indicated, including [XXX] that she [XXX], the visits to Fiscal\u00eda, and not obtaining protection from the authorities.\n[17] In regards to IFA, because ELN is present everywhere, the panel does not find that the claimants would have a viable internal flight alternative in Cartagena.\n[18] And the claimant\u2019s testimony is supported by the documentary evidence before the panel, and the panel is referring to the country conditions provided by Counsel as well as the IRB. The DOS report indicates that the most significant human rights issues included extrajudicial and unlawful killings. Reports \u2014\n[19] INTERPRETER: Extrajudicial and \u2014\n[20] MEMBER: Extrajudicial killings. The reports of torture and arbitrary detention, corruption, rape, and abuse of women and children by illegal armed groups. The panel will refer to other documentary evidence the details, that is Response to Information Request COL-106085.E. I think they know what I\u2019m saying. And the document indicates that ELN is a leftist armed group. The ELN was involved in peace negotiations with the government, but because the ELN continued attacks, those peace negotiations were terminated, and because ELN was involved with the government in peace negotiations, and the claimant\u2019s non-payment of Vacuna (ph) \u2014\n[21] INTERPRETER: And the claimant\u2019s \u2013\u00ad\n[22] MEMBER: Of Vacuna.\n[23] COUNSEL: Vacuna, extortion.\n[24] MEMBER: Extortion.\n[25] INTERPRETER: Okay, okay.\n[26] MEMBER: Made them an enemy of the ELN. The ELN felt that they had an opinion against the ELN for not supporting their cause, and because ELN participated in peace talks with the government of Colombia, it is regarded as a component of state machinery, and an opinion against the component of the state machinery amounts to imputed political opinion against the state machinery. And therefore, the claimants have established a nexus to the Convention ground today. The report indicates that there were 2,500 combatants in the ELN force, and the ELN operates using columns, which were called war fronts. The same document indicates that ELN retains an active presence in the country. Insofar as the activities are concerned, the same document indicates that ELN is involved in kidnapping, launching bomb attacks against police officers, attacking government targets \u2014\n[27] INTERPRETER: Attacking \u2014\n[28] MEMBER: Government targets, attacking economic infrastructure, recruiting children, using antipersonnel land mines, displacing civilians, and killing them. The same document indicates that there\u2019s a strong incursion of the ELN in many, many areas around the country. In the first ten months of 2017, the ELN was responsible for 45 percent of the total mass displacement of people. ELN is amongst the organized armed groups that are taking advantage of the weakness of the state\u2019s presence in the areas where the former FARC had influence. At this time, ELN has expanded its role in the drug trade after the demobilization of the FARC guerrillas. The same document indicates that it is possible that the ELN can monitor or target across Colombia.\n[29] In regards to protection, the same document indicates that state protection available to victims of ELN was scarce, that the protection measures for people who are victims of ELN are very limited. For victims who, given their positions or their activities, may be subjected to extraordinary or extreme risk, the DOS indicates that the ELN is involved in unlawful killings, political killings, extortion, kidnapping, et cetera. [inaudible] of the evidence that is before the panel, the panel finds that the ELN is a strong leftist guerrilla group operating all over Colombia. In this case, the claimant being a wealthy person \u2014\n[30] INTERPRETER: In this case \u2014\n[31] MEMBER: A [XXX] person, did not support their cause. She became the enemy of the ELN. They targeted to kill her at one point, but she was able to escape because her driver was able to escape from the scene. They targeted her daughter \u2014\n[32] INTERPRETER: They \u2014\n[33] MEMBER: Targeted her daughter. They not only beat her up, they raped her. She testified that they had ruined her life.\n[34] INTERPRETER: That they had \u2014\n[35] MEMBER: Ruined her life. Based on the totality of the evidence adduced and the country conditions, and the documentary evidence claimant provided to support her claim, panel finds that there is a serious possibility that the claimant and her children would be targeted and seriously harmed for not supporting ELN cause. And therefore, for all above reasons, the Refugee Protection Division determines that [XXX] is a Convention refugee. Because her husband\u2019s and her children\u2019s claims are based on her claim, their claims must succeed, too. As a result, the Refugee Protection Division determines that [XXX] and [XXX] are also Convention refugees.\n[36] Signed by Shams Alidina, Member of Refugee Protection Division, on 16th March 2020.\n[37] I wish to thank madam, your husband, and your children for coming today. I wish to thank Counsel for coming, and I wish to thank Counsel for providing a lot of documentary evidence. I wish to thank the interpreter for doing a fantastic job.\n[38] The hearing is over.\n[39] Now, madam \u2014 sorry, Counsel, I had to [inaudible]\n[40] COUNSEL: [inaudible]\n[41] MEMBER: I say that most of the times to Colombians.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-REASONS CONCLUDED\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n",

In summary, the principal claimant alleges a fear of persecution in Nepal because of his political membership and active support of the Nepali Congress (NC) party. The associate, adult and minor claimants allege a fear of persecution because of their imputed political opinion as members of the particular social group of family.\n[3] The principal and associate claimants are spouses. The adult and minor claimants are their children.\nDETERMINATION\n[4] I find that the claimants are Convention refugees pursuant to section 96 of the Act.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[5] The claimants\u2019 personal and national identities as citizens of Nepal have been established on a balance of probabilities by true copies of their passports[3], marriage certificate and Nepali citizenship certificates for the principal and associate claimants, birth certificates for the adult and minor claimants, a relationship certificate for all claimants[4] and oral testimony.\nCredibility\n[6] When a claimant swears that certain facts are true, this creates a presumption of truth unless there is valid reason to doubt their veracity.\nThe principal claimant was an active member of the Nepali Congress (NC) party\n[7] The principal claimant testified that he has been involved with the Nepali Congress (NC) party since 1990.\n[8] He correctly identified the date when the NC party was founded and accurately described its ideology as embracing nationalism, federalism and socialism. The principal claimant also testified about his political activities in the NC party. He identified the current NC party leader as Sher Bahadur Deuba and said he was politically active since his childhood and was against the previous Panchayat System. He testified that the party leader had been detained for eight years for his political beliefs and was tortured including through electric shock on his tongue which has resulted in a speech impediment. The principal claimant said he was inspired by the party leader and wanted to advocate for democracy in Nepal.\n[9] The principal claimant testified that he distributed pamphlets door to door in [XXX] 2008 to promote the NC party and also organized public meetings to further disseminate information about the party and its quest for democracy. He testified that he supported a candidate in the [XXX] 2017 election, invited media to speeches and also expressed his political views about the need for peace and prosperity which could be accomplished by electing an NC government and could not be accomplished through a communist regime.\n[10] I find, on a balance of probabilities that the principal claimant is an active member of the NC party. His testimony was detailed and spontaneous and he provided additional details in a natural manner and without hesitation when asked to elaborate about his responses. In support of his testimony he submitted a membership letter and a letter from the NC party Chief Secretary attesting to his membership and providing details about his political activities which are consistent with the principal claimant\u2019s other evidence[5].\nThe principal claimant was harassed and assaulted by members of the Biplav Maoists\n[11] I find that the principal claimant was harassed and threatened by Biplav Maoists in late [XXX] 2017. The principal claimant testified that after he expressed his views against the communist regime, in late [XXX] 2017 Biplav Maoist cadres came to his place of business demanding that he stop campaigning for the NC party and asked him to pay a donation of [XXX] rupees as a penalty for his actions. He said he told them he did not have that amount of money but had [XXX] rupees on the premises which he said they accepted. The principal claimant said he reported this incident to the police but was told that this was a political issue and the police could not help him. The principal claimant\u2019s testimony was detailed, without embellishment and materially consistent with his narrative.\n[12] I find that the principal claimant was harassed by Biplav Maoist supporters and cadres in [XXX] 2018. He testified that he owned farmland in the Nawalparasi district and visited the property as he was planning to launch a farming project. The principal claimant testified that when he arrived he found people occupying the land who informed him that the Biplav Maoists gave the land to them and they refused to leave. The principal claimant said he reported the incident to the local police who told him that this was a political matter. When he returned to Kathmandu, he said he contacted his minister of parliament who directed him to report the occupation of his farmland to the police in Kathmandu and also told him that he would escalate the issue. The principal claimant testified that Biplav Maoist cadres came to his office later in [XXX] 2018 and harassed him about his anti-communist actions and said they believed he was a [XXX] and therefore should be able to pay [XXX] rupees as a donation. The principal claimant said that the told the cadres he needed a week to pay such a [XXX] amount. He said that the police then contacted him to identify two Biplav Maoist cadres who they had arrested based on the principal claimant\u2019s complaint. The principal claimant testified that the cadres who had been arrested were subsequently released. The principal claimant\u2019s testimony was materially consistent with his narrative however there was a minor discrepancy with some of the dates. It was apparent that the principal claimant was nervous and he was able to clarify the discrepancy in a spontaneous and natural manner. Therefore this minor inconsistency did not impugn his credibility. The principal claimant also submitted a police report to corroborate his testimony[6].\n[13] I find that the principal claimant was kidnapped and assaulted on [XXX] 2018 by Biplav Maoists. The principal claimant testified that on [XXX] 2018 at 6:30 p.m. he was alone in his office as the staff had already gone home. He said that Biplav Maoists cadres came to his office and under threat of gunpoint took him to an isolated house where he was threatened by the group leader. He said he was told that the Biplav Maoists kill those who do not comply with their directions and they demanded [XXX] rupees as a donation. The principal claimant said he was very scared and panicked and was allowed to call his wife to obtain part of the payment for his release. He said his wife was able to gather the money and he signed a document and was released at a different location. The associate claimant testified that she was able to gather [XXX] rupees from relatives and from a recent [XXX] transaction. She testified that she went to the location for the exchange by motorbike and picked up her husband there and took him to the doctor for medical treatment as he was injured. The principal claimant\u2019s testimony was detailed and consistent with his narrative. He provided additional details about the kidnapping and assault in a spontaneous manner and without embellishment. The associate claimant\u2019s testimony was also detailed and she provided additional details in an unhesitating manner. The principal claimant submitted a donation receipt for [XXX] rupees and a medical report regarding injuries he sustained to corroborate his testimony.\nSubjective fear: Moved to a relative\u2019s house, did not return to business\n[14] The principal claimant testified that the minor claimant, his youngest daughter said she did not want to attend school. He said she told him she was being followed. The principal claimant testified that the family relocated to a relative\u2019 s home about 25 minutes away because he had heard the Biplav Maoists abduct children to extort donations. He also testified that since the [XXX] assault he did not return to his place of business and closed it down. The claimants also left Nepal on [XXX] 2018.\n[15] I find that the conduct of the claimants is consistent with subjective fear. The principal claimant closed down his business after the [XXX] 2018 assault and kidnapping and the family relocated on [XXX] 2018 after the minor claimant was followed. The claimants also left Nepal promptly about a week after the kidnapping.\nObjective Basis\n[16] The objective evidence is consistent with the claimants\u2019 account of fearing persecution because of their actual and imputed political opinion[7].\n[17] Item 2.1[8] of the objective documents indicates that while elections were generally well conducted, there were reports of violent incidents including individuals being killed by the police and reports of interparty clashes and assaults. According to item 4.4[9], political incidents were the primary driver of violent incidents and made up the majority of the non-violent incidents. This report also notes activities by the CPN-Chand Maoists to attempt to disrupt the election process.\n[18] Item 1.6[10] indicates that a diverse array of political parties operate in Nepal although the system has faced considerable instability in recent years. This report also states that political opponents of the Maoists do not generally face violence because Maoists have the potential to control the national agenda without resorting to violence. However this report does not specify whether this applies to the CPN Maoists or Biplav Maoists who are a splinter group from the Nepal Communist Party currently in power.\n[19] As well, the claimant\u2019s counsel provided numerous articles about the wide reach and violent activities perpetrated by the Biplav Maoists including extortion similar to the kind the principal claimant describes in his BOC[11].\n[20] I find that the claimants\u2019 fear of persecution because of their actual and imputed political opinion has an objective basis and is well-founded.\nState Protection\n[21] A state, unless in a condition of complete breakdown, is presumed to be capable of protecting its citizens. To rebut the presumption of state protection, a claimant must provide clear and convincing evidence of the state\u2019s inability to protect its citizens.\n[22] The objective documents indicate that historical claims of abuses by the Maoists remain unsolved and there is a prevailing climate of impunity in part because senior government officials have the potential to shield leaders of major political parties from prosecution and investigation. This report further states that police effectiveness is limited by lack of resources, corruption, nepotism and a culture of impunity especially among low level officers[12].\n[23] Based on the personal circumstances of the claimants as well as the objective country documentation, I find that they have rebutted the presumption of state protection and state protection would not be reasonably available to them in their particular circumstances. The principal claimant sought the assistance of the police on multiple occasions without any reasonable protection being made available to him.\nInternal Flight Alternative (IFA)\n[24] The test to be applied in determining whether there is a viable IFA is two-pronged, and both prongs must be satisfied for a finding that a claimant has a viable IFA. First, I must find on a balance of probabilities that there is no serious possibility that the claimants would be persecuted in the part of the country in which I find an IFA exists. Secondly, conditions in the part of the country considered to be an IFA must be such that it would not be unreasonable, in all the circumstances, including those particular to the claimants for them to seek refuge there.\n[25] The objective evidence indicates that the Biplav Maoists (CPN) have a presence in all 77 districts of Nepal and have mobilized across the country. Further there is a nationwide crackdown by the government against this group[13] as well as reports of violence perpetrated by the Biplav Maoists in the IFA locations proposed.\n[26] Therefore I find there a serious possibility of persecution in the country and there is no IFA available to the claimants in Nepal as the Biplav Maoists are present throughout the country and would be motivated to find them. The evidence demonstrates that the Biplav Maoists sought the claimant in Kathmandu where his primary business was located, followed his younger daughter (minor claimant) and knew about the principal claimant\u2019s activities in Nawalparisi, some distance away from his home.\nCONCLUSION\n[27] Having considered all of the evidence, I find that there is a serious possibility that the claimants would face persecution in Nepal. I find that the claimants are Convention refugees and I accept their claims.\n[1] Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27, as amended, sections 96 and 97(1).\n[2] Exhibits 2, 3, 4 and 5\n[3] Exhibit 1\n[4] Exhibit 11\n[5] Exhibit 11\n[6] Exhibit 11\n[7] Exhibit 3\n[8] Exhibit 8, Item 2.1\n[9] Exhibit 6, Item 4.4\n[10] Exhibit 6\n[11] Exhibit 8\n[12] Exhibit 6, Items 1.6 and 4.7\n[13] Exhibit 8, page 46\n\n",

Vega\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Mary E Boyce\nCountry: Antigua and Barbuda\nRPD Number: TB8-16407\nAssociated RPD Number(s):\nATIP Number: A-2021-00800\nATIP Pages: 000087-000091\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: Okay, this is the decision with respect to the claimant [XXX], this is File number TB5-16407 and the claimant is\u2026 I\u2019m rendering this decision now orally to you having heard all the evidence today [XXX].\n[2] You claim to be a citizen of Antigua and Barbuda and you have claimed refugee protection pursuant to Section 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[3] In assessing this claim I have considered and I have kept in mind the chair person\u2019s guideline Number 9 which is entitled, which is titled proceedings before the Immigration and Refugee Board involving sexual orientation and gender identity and expression or we call it SOGI as well.\n[4] I find [XXX] that you are a Convention refugee for the following reasons. The allegations are found in your basis of claim form.\n[5] I won\u2019t repeat them all but just to summarize your basis of claim form; you knew from the age of approximately [XXX] that you were a lesbian, you felt that you were one and you come from a strict Christian family where your mother is a Pentecostal [XXX] and the life in the Christian church at your mother\u2019 s church was very important to your family and it was significantly dominated, your life was dominated by the church you felt.\n[6] You father was not as harsh as your mother but both your parents because of their sermons you were aware of how they felt about homosexuality and that how they perceive it to be wrong.\n[7] During school you dated men and you were, you also dated [XXX](ph) who you later married. You dated him for three years and then you married him in 2008. You subsequently divorced [XXX](ph) in [XXX] of 2012.\n[8] You did not come out to him as being a lesbian woman, however he was aware of what you had told him about when you and your, you and your cousin as a [XXX] year olds you experimented a bit with each other sexually and stimulated each other over two years.\n[9] He was aware of this and you felt that this was sort of might be a phase in your life, so you had told him the story thinking it might bring you closer together and he later would use that to hurt you and remind you that if you were to, often out with your girlfriends and he would ask you if you repeating your childish behaviour and you knew what that meant.\n[10] You also, you were keeping your sexual orientation secret while you were living in Antigua and Barbuda after you had divorced him. You did have some relationships and or a casual relationship but you had a more meaningful one. However this ended not very well and the result was the threat that she would contact your family and inform them and that would be detrimental to your mother\u2019s [XXX] within the church.\n[11] Her reputation as [XXX], as a Christian [XXX] as well as to, given that Antigua is so small and how gossip goes there, it would be detrimental to your entire family as well as to yourself. So shortly after that threat you decided to leave the island and come to Canada and then you came to Canada in [XXX] of 2018.\n[12] While in Canada you have felt freedom and as able to express yourself as a lesbian woman you later met your current partner [XXX] and you\u2019ve had a relationship since. You\u2019ve met her family and you stayed with her family, travelled with her family and had vacations with them and you feel very welcomed by them.\n[13] So that brings us to this hearing and first of all I would like start by, with the issue of your identity. This issue I\u2019ve considered and the material that I have in Exhibit 1 which is a certified true copy of your passport from Antigua and Barbuda. It\u2019s clear to me on a balance of probabilities that you are a citizen of that country therefore I find that your national identity has been established.\n[14] With respect to your sexual identity as this is a sexual orientation claim. I find that that has been established by your testimony, by all the evidence here today.\n[15] In that regard you have answered an abundance of questions that I have asked and you have indicated that you identify as a lesbian woman and despite you did have a relationship with a man to whom you were married and at the time, you at the time felt that you might be bisexual. However that is not how you identified today.\n[16] From your answers I found you to be, that you answered in a very straightforward manner. You were very willing to answer all questions that I asked.\n[17] You were spontaneous in your answers and therefore I found you to be a credible witness and because I find that you are a credible witness I can accept your allegations and therefore I believe that you are a lesbian woman and in an exclusive relationship with [XXX](ph).\n[18] So with respect to the issue of the nexus in this case is membership in a particular social group under sexual orientation and that you are a bisexual woman okay?\n[19] Now the country documents, the preponderance of them in my package of Exhibit 3 clearly indicates to me that the, that there would be problems for you if you were to return to Antigua and Barbuda.\n[20] While there wasn\u2019t at the present time from your testimony you\u2019ve indicated that you do not believe [XXX](ph) has ousted you to your family. If you were to live there and the test I apply is a forward looking one so it looks at if you were to go not what has happened to you in the past but more so in the future if you were to go there.\n[21] With the current laws the way they are there I find that you would not be able to live your life as you have been expressing yourself sexually or as a lesbian woman and feel the way you have because you would have to be worried.\n[22] Exhibits 3 Item 6.1 indicates that in and this is a response to information request, counsel as you \u2018re aware 6.1 is the response to information request ATG104715.E and it states there that several sources indicate that sexual acts between same sex couples are illegal for both men and women in Antigua and Barbuda and the section that would likely apply would be under Article 15 which is considered under serious indecency.\n[23] So there could be under serious indecency there could be jail terms and therefore even though the material does indicate that these laws are not actively implemented despite that I\u2019d like to from the guidelines under 8.6.4 it states there the existence of laws criminalizing non conforming sexual orientations, sexual behaviours or gender identities or expressions and the enforcement of these laws by the state may be evidence that state protection is inadequate.\n[24] Even if irregularly enforced the criminalization of the existence or behaviours of individuals with diverse SOGI may create a climate of impunity for perpetrators of violence and normalize acts of blackmail, sexual abuse, violence and extortion by state and non state actors.\n[25] So and the documentary material the same Item 6.1 does indicate that the situation is getting better. Nonetheless it still is not sufficient at the present time in my opinion.\n[26] There\u2026 an LGBT rights group which is called Meeting Emotional and Social Needs Holistically or MESH it\u2019s called, who is and this person spoke to the research director he\u2019s a representative of the Antigua based group and he\u2019s also an openly gay police officer.\n[27] He said that although the laws are generally not pursued LGBT people who are caught engaging in sexual activity in a public place are sometimes detained for a couple of days and he\u2019s provided a lot of useful information but he also says he notes that with respect to the protection by the state that their organization encourages individuals to report cases of threats and violence against LGBT people to the police.\n[28] However he also noted that many LGBT people do not report violence to the police for multiple reasons such as fear of revealing their sexual orientation, fear of stigma and discrimination or a fear due to past experience with police or hearing of experiences of other LGBT people.\n[29] The materials also go on to speak about one case in which a police officer physically assaulted an LGBT person, however when this person went to report and that officer was, somebody reported him and he lost his job.\n[30] Nevertheless there is plenty of material that indicates that the people are do fear for violence and therefore they do not report to the police because then sometimes it\u2019s not always the police who are the perpetrators but the police can be or they can discriminate against the person.\n[31] There was also a case where an Antiguan media source called Carrie Barenna(ph) quoted someone who said their LGBT friend was chased out of a police station when trying to report an incident to the police. So the MESH representative said that treatment depends on the police officer at the desk and he noted that there is still a lot of stigma and discrimination towards LGBT people by the police.\n[32] So this is a little too much that in my opinion, given the evidence I do not believe there\u2019s adequate state protection for you should you if you wanted to come out, if you were living there and if you needed help by the police if anyone were to in anyway threaten you or harm you or try to because I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s adequate state protection for you because the police in this case your fearful of the law because it is illegal to openly be in or demonstrate openly that you are in a relationship or\u2026\n[33] So then there\u2019s also the issue of internal flight alternative that we have to look at and I didn\u2019t raise it as an issue because it\u2019s too small an island and it\u2019s the same law throughout the entire country. So or even Barbuda it\u2019s still too small ninety five thousand people.\n[34] It\u2019s a small location so I do not find that there would be a viable internal flight alternative available to you if you were to try to hide in another part of the island should you be found out either by, the community where you were living.\n[35] So there\u2019s let me just\u2026therefore I find that you have discharged the burden of the presumption of state protection in your particular case with your evidence and therefore I feel that you would face a serious possibility of persecution because of your sexual orientation as a lesbian woman throughout the entire of Antigua and Barbuda and therefore I conclude on all the evidence in this case that [XXX] that you are a Convention refugee and I therefore accept your claim. Do you understand?\n[36] CLAIMANT: Thank you I do.\n[37] MEMBER: You\u2019re very welcome and this hearing is now concluded and good day to everyone thanks.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n",

The claimant claims to have a well-founded fear of persecution at the hands of the splinter Maoists, a group called the Biplav in Nepal under sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act[1] (IRPA).\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] The claimant alleges that he and his family have been involved in Nepali politics, namely the Nepali Congress, one of the oldest political parties in Nepal for many years. The claimant joined the youth wing of the Nepali Congress while a student. The claimant first had trouble with the then Maoist party while he was a [XXX] in [XXX] 2003 as he was kidnapped and told to teach what the Maoists believed in. The claimant left the country and went to work on an [XXX] in Iraq for a number of years. The claimant returned to Nepal in 2010 since the Maoists had ended their war. The claimant rejoined the Nepali Congress party and commenced [XXX] again. Eventually, the claimant rose through the ranks and ended up in [XXX] 2017 of becoming a [XXX] to [XXX]the number of [XXX] who were abducted, tortured and killed by the Maoists. However, as a result of his involvement with this [XXX] and which had been publicized in Nepali newspapers, the claimant started to receiving threatening telephone calls from a splinter group of the Communist Maoists, the Biplavs. The claimant then received letters from the Biplavs demanding money and for him to join their party. The claimant went to the police as a result of the threats but nothing was done. On [XXX] 2017, the claimant was beaten which required hospitalization and again threatened by the Biplavs. Again, the police were contacted by nothing was done. The claimant had applied for a Canadian visitor\u2019s visa in [XXX] 2017 but was rejected. The claimant then hired an agent who secured a visitor\u2019s visa to France and Italy with the intent of then proceeding to Canada. The claimant went to the aforementioned countries on [XXX] 2017 and unable to secure a Canadian visitor\u2019s visa at that time, returned to Nepal on [XXX] 2017. The agent was then able to secure a Canadian visitor\u2019s visa and the claimant arrived in Canada on [XXX] 2017 and filed for refugee protection in [XXX] 2018.\nDETERMINATION\n[3] I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee for the following reasons.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[4] The claimant\u2019s oral testimony and the supporting documentation[2] establish that he is a citizen of Nepal.\nCredibility\n[5] I find that the claimant to be a credible witness and therefore accept what he has alleged in his oral testimony and in his Basis of Claim form.[3] I find that the claimant\u2019s testimony was straightforward and in keeping with his Basis of Claim form with a very detailed narrative and I noted no contradictions, inconsistencies or omissions in his testimony.\n[6] The claimant provided extensive documentation[4] including documents pertaining to his membership in the Nepali Congress party, employment as a [XXX] medical and police reports as well as newspaper articles confirming his job as a [XXX] the disappearance and killings of [XXX] by the Maoists.\n[7] I therefore find that the claimant was a member of the Nepali Congress political party, that he was [XXX] the disappearances and killings of [XXX] by the Maoists in Nepal and as a result, was targeted by the Biplav faction of the Maoists was threatened and physically assaulted by them.\n[8] This claim is therefore being assessed under section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nObjective Country Documentation on Persecution\n[9] The claimant had indicated in his testimony that he had contacted the police on three occasions concerning the threats made by the Biplav Maoists with no response.\n[10] The National Documentation Package for Nepal[5] states that state protection for victims of extortion is largely incapable and increasingly so in the aftermath of the earthquakes. This same document states that the Biplav Maoists are involved in extortion, kidnapping and capturing land from opponents. In the documentation provided by counsel,[6] numerous newspaper articles from 2015 into the early 2018 confirm many aspects of the claimant\u2019s testimony. These articles state that the Biplavs have taken responsibility for many bombs, killing government officials and business leaders in Nepal as well as attacking candidates from other political parties with basically impunity. The Biplavs maintain that they want to seize power in Nepal and will do whatever to obtain it.\nState Protection and Internal Flight Alternative (IFA)\n[11] I therefore find that state protection and an internal flight alternative is not available to the claimant as a member of the Nepali Congress and an [XXX] into the killings of [XXX] by the Biplav Maoists. The claimant and his family did move from their home to Kathmandu and were contacted by the Biplavs on more than one occasion. The claimant indicated that his wife is still being harassed by the Biplavs although she has moved to a different location in Kathmandu.\nCONCLUSION\n[12] I therefore determine that the claimant is a Convention refugee. The Refugee Protection Division therefore accepts his\n[1] The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), S.C. 2001, c.27, as amended, sections 96 and 97(1).\n[2] Exhibit M-1, Photocopy of claimant\u2019s Nepalese passport; Exhibit C-7 Academic certificates.\n[3] Exhibit C-2, Basis of Claim form\n[4] Exhibit C-7, Membership card of Nepali Congress party, employment documents, medical and police reports, newspaper articles.\n[5] Exhibit R-3, NDP for Nepal (April 30, 2019), item 4.7.\n[6] Exhibit C-6 Counsel\u2019s country documentation.\n\n",

Bonhomme\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Hagan Turan\nCountry: Azerbaijan\nRPD Number: TB8-07131\nAssociated RPD Number(s): TB8-07141, TB8-07149, TB8-07150\nATIP Number: A-2021-00800\nATIP Pages: 000075-000081\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] The claimants, [XXX] aka [XXX] aka [XXX] and [XXX] are seeking refugee protection from Azerbaijan pursuant to ss. 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (\u201cIRPA\u201d).[1]\n[2] [XXX] is the principal claimant and he is married to [XXX], the associate claimant. Their children are [XXX] and [XXX], the minor claimants. The principal claimant was appointed as the designated representative of the minor claimants.\nDetermination\n[3] The panel finds the claimants to be Convention refugees; in the case of the principal claimant, on the grounds of his political opinion and in the case of the associate and minor claimants, on the grounds of their imputed political opinion.\nAllegations\n[4] The details of the claimants\u2019 allegations are more fully set out in the principal claimant\u2019s Basis of Claim Form (\u201cBOC\u201d).[2] In short, the principal claimant is a member of Musavat, an opposition political party in Azerbaijan. The principal claimant has always been a supporter of democratic parties in Azerbaijan and was initially active in the Azerbaijan National Front Party. The principal claimant joined the Musavat party in 2012 and has been active in rallies and protests as both a participant and an organizer. He has been detained on three occasions over the course of his political activity and treated abusively by the police. Following the principal claimant\u2019 s last release from detention in [XXX] 2018, the police continued to threaten him and his family and make demands for money. As a result, the claimants left Azerbaijan to Canada.\n[5] The claimants are fearful of returning to Azerbaijan as they fear detention and mistreatment by the authorities.\nAnalysis\nIdentity\n[6] The claimants\u2019 personal identities as citizens of Azerbaijan have been established by the principal claimant\u2019s testimony and the certified true copies of their Azerbaijani passports and Canadian visas on file.[3]\n[7] The panel finds on a balance of probabilities that the claimants are who they say they are and that the country of reference for them is Azerbaijan.\nCredibility\n[8] The determinative issue in this claim is credibility. In making this assessment, the panel has considered all the evidence, including the oral testimony and documentary evidence entered as exhibits as well as counsel\u2019s submissions and post-hearing disclosure.\n[9] The principal claimant testified and was generally a credible witness. His evidence was consistent with the allegations in his BOC. The principal claimant provided spontaneous and detailed testimony in response to extensive questioning from the panel. He did not attempt to embellish his answers and admitted when a detail was unknown to him.\n[10] At the hearing, the principal claimant explained when and why he developed his political views and how they progressed to political activity, first with the Azerbaijan National Front Party and then with the Musavat party. He admitted there were periods of time when he was a passive member or not involved at all after the Azerbaijan National Front Party split into factions. The principal claimant convincingly described his political views and how they aligned with each party. In particular, he was able to describe the economic policies of the Musavat party and the proposed plan to address its economic vision. The principal claimant provided details of his own activities and identified various members of the party, including the circumstances surrounding a high-profile member\u2019s prolonged wrongful detention. The principal claimant testified that he continues to pay membership dues to the party and to participate in rallies in Toronto in support of freeing political prisoners in Azerbaijan.\n[11] The claimants submitted the principal claimant\u2019s membership cards from both the Azerbaijani Popular Front Party and the Musavat (Equality) Party.[4] As well, the claimants submitted a letter from the Vice-Chairman of the Musavat Party dated [XXX] 2018 confirming the principal claimant\u2019s active participation in the party as an organizer and his resulting detention on two occasions.[5] The panel has no reason to doubt the veracity of these documents.\n[12] In response to questioning from his counsel, the principal claimant testified about his detention by the police and the circumstances surrounding each detention. He was able to adequately explain to the panel why he remained in Azerbaijan after the second detention where he was tortured and how he was able to leave days after his last release from detention. The claimants submitted several letters from family members who had first-hand knowledge of the principal claimant\u2019s detentions by the police resulting from his political activities.[6] The claimants also submitted a progress report from the [XXX] the principal claimant has been seeing in Canada for treatment for his [XXX] related to the trauma he experienced in Azerbaijan.[7]\n[13] The panel finds that, on a balance of probabilities, the principal claimant is an active member of the Musavat party and that the principal claimant\u2019s political activities are known to the authorities. Further, there is a serious possibility that the entire family may face detention and mistreatment by the authorities if they were to return to Azerbaijan.\n[14] Given the credible testimony by the claimant on issues going to the core of the claim, and the corroborating documentary evidence, the panel believes what the claimants have alleged in support of their claim and finds that their subjective fear of persecution on the basis of the principal claimant\u2019s political opinion and the associate and minor claimants\u2019 imputed political opinion is established, on a balance of probabilities.\nObjective Basis\n[15] Multiple sources in the National Documentation Package for Azerbaijan report numerous instances of state sanctioned violence and repression of dissenting political opinion.\n[16] According to the United States Department of State Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for Azerbaijan for 2019:\nSignificant human rights issues included: unlawful or arbitrary killing; torture; arbitrary detention; harsh and sometimes life-threatening prison conditions; political prisoners; arbitrary interference with privacy; pervasive problems with the independence of the judiciary; heavy restrictions on free expression, the press, and the internet, including violence against journalists, the criminalization of libel, harassment and incarceration of journalists on questionable charges, and blocking of websites; substantial interference with the rights of peaceful assembly and freedom of association; restrictions on freedom of movement; refoulement of refugees to a country where they would face a threat to their life or freedom; severe restrictions on political participation; systemic government corruption; police detention and torture of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex individuals; and the worst forms of child labor, which the government made minimal efforts to eliminate.\nThe government did not prosecute or punish most officials who committed human rights abuses; impunity remained a problem.[8]\n[17] According to this same source, police summoned more than one hundred members of the Musavat Party around the country to police stations and warned them not to participate in a planned unsanctioned picket scheduled for November 12. On November 12, police prevented the picket from taking place, including by deploying large numbers of officers blocking roads and detaining dozens of party members who attempted to assemble. The government released those who had tried to gather after several hours, with the exception of one organizer who was sentenced to fifteen days of administrative detention.\n[18] This was consistent with reports that many administrative detentions are politically motivated, and authorities ignore provisions in the law for fair trials. The case of a Musavat activist, Azad Hasan, is cited as an example of a trial unjustifiably delayed as judges were purportedly waiting for instructions from the Presidential Administration for months after evidence was submitted before ruling.[9]\n[19] Police are reported to have intimidated, harassed, and sometimes arrested family members of political opposition members. Authorities fired individuals from their jobs or had individuals fired in retaliation for the political or civic activities of family members inside or outside the country.[10]\n[20] Based on the country conditions disclosed in the National Documentation Package, the panel finds the claimants\u2019 fear of return to Azerbaijan to have an objective basis. The claimants have established a well-founded fear of persecution in Azerbaijan.\nState protection and internal flight alternative\n[21] States are presumed to be capable of protecting their own citizens, except in situations where the state is in a state of complete breakdown. To rebut the presumption of state protection, a claimant has to provide clear and convincing evidence of the state\u2019s inability or unwillingness to protect its citizens.\n[22] The panel finds that in this case, the state is the agent of persecution and therefore there is no state protection or viable internal flight alternative available to the claimants. The country information is clear and convincing evidence that rebuts the presumption that adequate state protection is available to the claimants in Azerbaijan.\nConclusion\n[23] Based on the totality of the evidence, the panel finds the claimants to be Convention Refugees and therefore their claim is accepted.\n[1] Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c.27, as amended.\n[2] Exhibit 2: Basis of Claim Form (BOC) TB8-07131.\n[3] Exhibit 1: Package of information from the referring CBSA\/CIC.\n[4] Exhibit 7: Claimants\u2019 disclosure (personal documents) received December 4, 2018.\n[5] Ibid.\n[6] Ibid.\n[7] Exhibit 8: Claimants\u2019 disclosure (personal document) received August 18, 2020.\n[8] Exhibit 3: Index of national document package for Azerbaijan \u2014 June 30, 2020 version, Item 2.1.\n[9] Ibid.\n[10] Ibid.\n\n",

        "unofficial_text":"2020 RLLR 70\n\nCitation: 2020 RLLR 70\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: February 19, 2020\nPanel: Dominique Setton\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): El-Farouk Khaki\nCountry: Uganda\nRPD Number: TB7-23049\nAssociated RPD Number(s):\nATIP Number: A-2021-00800\nATIP Pages: 000069-000074\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] These are the reasons for the decision in the claim of [XXX], who claims to be a citizen of Uganda, and is claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).[1]\n[2] In rendering my reasons, I have considered and applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 4: Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution.[2]\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] You allege the following. The details of your life are contained in your Basis of Claim Form (BOC) provided in evidence.[3] You allege domestic violence by your father, and your husband. Your father forced you to marry a man who was 24 years older than you, whom you did not want to marry. The marriage occurred on [XXX] 2015. Following the marriage, you had to endure violence and mistreatment at the hands of your husband. He did not allow you to eat, or provide you with food. He raped you and was violent with you on numerous occasions, causing bodily injury, which required medical treatment.\nDETERMINATION\n[4] I find that you are a Convention refugee as you have established a serious possibility of persecution on account of your member of a particular social group. You are a woman who is the victim of domestic violent, both as a child and in your forced marriage.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[5] I find that your identity as a national of Uganda is established by your testimony and the supporting documentation filed, including your passport.[4]\nCredibility\n[6] Unless specifically noted in the analysis below, I accept your evidence about the events you encountered in Uganda as being generally credible.\n[7] You have provided documents which support your allegations of domestic violence, which are contained in the evidence, such as confirmation of your birth and marriage, medical reports or records, which include photos of your injuries.[5] You also submitted letters of support from your mother, as well as a letter to you from your mother, a letter from your sister, who had been forced into marriage herself by their father, a friend of hers who helped her to escape and hide out from both her father and her husband.[6]\nObjective basis of future risk\n[8] You fear that if you return to your country, your husband will find you, kill you, or maim you, as he has threatened, because of your escape. In addition, you fear continued rape and violence from your husband and your father.\n[9] The documentary evidence in our National Documentation Package (NDP), specifically the United Nations Development Programme\u2019s Uganda Country Gender Assessment, corroborates your allegations:\n[t]here is a disconnect between Uganda\u2019s very positive legal framework and the lack of effective implementation or enforcement of gender-positive laws. This means that women\u2019s legal status is precarious, their capacity as economic agents is limited, and their rights are not effectively guaranteed.[7]\n[10] It also states that the country suffers from persistent high level of sexual and gender-based violence. This is also corroborated by the United States Department of State (DOS) report, which confirms that that there are three serious human rights problems in Uganda, which are respect for individual integrity, restrictions on civil liberties, and violence and discrimination against marginalized groups, such as women and children,[8] which is precisely what you have alleged in your BOC narrative and in your sworn testimony.\n[11] Based on the credibility of your allegations, and the documentary evidence set out below, I find that you have established a future risk that you will be subjected to the following harm: risk of personal harm to yourself, violence, mistreatment, and death.\n[12] The fact that you face this risk is corroborated by the following documents from the Board\u2019s June 28, 2019 NDP for Uganda: the US DOS report, and the Uganda Country Gender Assessment, both noted above, as well as a recent Response to Information Request regarding forced marriages.[9]\nNature of the harm\n[13] This harm clearly amounts to persecution.\nState protection\n[14] I find that there is clear and convincing evidence before me that the state is unable or unwilling to provide you with adequate protection. You alleged in your BOC, and provided detailed testimony regarding the efforts you made at obtaining help from the police on several occasions. You also submitted a letter, dated [XXX] 2015, showing that you went to the police to try to obtain their protection. You testified that the police told you to go home to your husband, and did not provide effective assistance. This is is corroborated by numerous additional, current articles you submitted as evidence.[10] The first article from Africa Renewal of December 20, 2107 exposes the problems that a female member of parliament has experienced in 2017 despite her rise in politics.[11] The victim and elected representative describes men who are current members of parliament who harass her, by overt physical methods and by hounding her. She is frustrated by this and says that \u201charassment is commonplace in Parliament\u201d, where even there it goes unreported \u201cbecause we fear the consequences.\u201d[12] The article summarizes the efforts that Uganda has made by passing laws against violence towards women, but how violence is on the rise, despite the laws and policies. In the second report regarding the ineffectiveness of state protection which you provided in evidence, from the University of Sheffield, from April 2018, Uganda \u2013 Gender Based Violence Police Briefing, it states that:\nLifetime prevalence of GBV in Uganda is estimated at 51%\u2026 suggesting that violence against women is rampant in the country. This statistic is well above the average in Africa and worldwide, making Uganda one of the most dangerous places in the world for women.[13]\n[15] Based on the analysis above, I find, on a balance of probabilities, that adequate state protection is not available to you.\nInternal flight alternative\n[16] I have considered whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for you in Kampala, a large city centre where you may be able to support yourself, and live independently. On the first prong of the test,[14] you have testified that your husband and your father continue to search for you. You provided an email message from your friend dated [XXX] 2019, which confirms that they are looking for you, and that your husband threatened her for any information about you.[15] In addition, your sister has advised you in email messages that two men forcefully searched your mother\u2019s home in Kampala, looking for you, and she believes that they have been sent by your husband.[16] You have also received threatening email messages from your husband, which included one dated [XXX] 2018.[17]\n[17] Your friend, [XXX] advises you not to telephone her, as her cellular phone may be tapped. On the evidence before me, I find that there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout Uganda. You alleged that your father and or husband could easily find you wherever you go in Uganda, because your cell phone\u2019s SIM card is registered. You have provided evidence of this in the article entitled, Uganda Telecom Operators to Obtain Users Biometrics and Photos which confirms that the National Identity Registration Authority (NIRA) requires that cell phones be registered for security reasons.[18] The result is that the service operators have all biometric and personal information. You fear that you could easily be tracked because of this, as these service providers are also not secure as the information that they have has been breached. This article states that other Ugandans who had had their phones hacked sought help from the Uganda Communication Commission (UCC), but the UCC were unable to assist the victims due to a lack of \u201ctechnical capacity to prevent data breaches.\u201d[19] The article confirms that there is continued exposure of the public to data breaches, obtained illegally. As a result, I find that your father or your husband could access the information, and track you through your cellular phone wherever you attempt to go, in Uganda, including Kampala.\nCONCLUSION\n[18] Based on the analysis above, I conclude that you are a Convention refugee. Accordingly, I accept your claim.\n[1] The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c.27, as amended, sections 96 and 97(1).\n[2] Guideline 4: Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution: Update, Guideline Issued by the Chairperson Pursuant to Section 65(3) of the Immigration Act, IRB, Ottawa, November 25, 1996, as continued in effect by the Chairperson on June 28, 2002, under the authority found in section 159(1)(h) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[3] Exhibit 2, Basis of Claim Form (BOC).\n[4] Exhibit 1, Package of lnformation from the Referring CBSA\/CIC, Certified True Copy of Passport.\n[5] Exhibit 7, Personal Disclosure received December 6, 2019, at pp. 1-2, 8-10, and 34-35.\n[6] Ibid., at pp. 37-48.\n[7] Exhibit 3, National Documentation Package (NDP) for Uganda (June 28, 2019), item 5.5.\n[8] Ibid., item 2.1.\n[9] Ibid., item 2.1, and 5.5-5.6.\n[10] Exhibit 8, Country Conditions # 1, at pp. 1-6 and 13-16.\n[11] Ibid., at pp. 1-6.\n[12] Ibid., at p. 1.\n[13] Ibid., at p. 14.\n[14] Rasaratnam, Sivaganthan v.

I did not have the opportunity to review the original identity documents. I note however, that Canadian officials who have access to your original documents[2] and have not raised any concerns about your identity. Therefore, I find, on a balance of probabilities, that you are both nationals of the Ukraine.\n[4] I have considered your testimony, the testimony of the witness [XXX] who founded the [XXX] in 1977, country conditions documents provided by your counsel[3] and National Documentation Package (NDP) for the Ukraine.[4] I find that the you have established that there is a serious risk of persecution due to your ethnicity that being Roma, should you and your son return to the Ukraine today.\nALLEGATIONS\n[5] Here is a short summary of the allegations;\n[6] That you are a Roma of Servitka clan. You and your family were always victims of harassment and discrimination in the Ukraine. You describe a lifetime of discrimination living in the Ukraine as Roma.\n[7] You state that since the 2014 Revolution, things have become much worse for the Roma and the Roma are being becoming victims of serious persecution.\n[8] You faced illegal searches at your home by undercover Ukrainian police. The police illegally searched your house and took any valuables they found. If you objected or complained, you were arrested and physically abused.\n[9] You cite several such events when you were abused, thrown off train because you were easily recognized as a Roma wearing your traditional garments. Your minor son was also a victim of abuse at his school by both the students and teachers alike.\n[10] You arrived in Canada in [XXX] 2017 with the minor and your husband. Your husband left you and you are not aware of his whereabouts. Your claim was referred to the Board in [XXX] 2017.\n[11] You fear returning to the Ukraine today because you believe that discrimination and persecution for the Roma in the Ukraine is being encouraged by politicians and that the police is also the agent of persecution.\nDETERMINATION\n[12] For the reasons that follow, I find that the claimants would face a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground and, on a balance of probabilities, would personally be subjected to a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or a danger of torture upon their return to the Ukraine, today.\nTherefore, I find that the claimants are Convention refugee and that they do have a well-founded fear of persecution or harm should they return to the Ukraine.\nANALYSIS\nIdentities\n[13] In all refugee claims, the first thing a decision maker must decide is identity. I find that your identity as a citizen of the Ukraine is established by your testimony and copies of your passports in Exhibit 1. I did not have the opportunity to see your original passports but note that officials who have seen your originals, have not raised any concerns.\n[14] Your identity as Roma was established your testimony supported by your witness [XXX]. You were able to speak in Romani language and testified that you taught Romani to your son as well. In addition, I have two documents from the Roma Community Centre[5] in Toronto in support of your identity as a Roma.\n[15] Next, I considered credibility and find you to be a credible witness. Your testimony is consistent with your narrative. I note that you did not attempt to embellish your claim. Your story is believable and supported by objective documentary evidence.\n[16] Documentary evidence indicates that Roma in the Ukraine continue to face societal and institutional discrimination, and that Roma are denied basic human dignity. They experience significant barriers to education, housing, healthcare, social service, and employment.\n[17] Roma are reported to be the most discriminated against ethnic group in the Ukraine, Item\n13.1 in the NDP states \u201cRoma are widely regarded as one of Europe\u2019s most marginalised communities. They experience discrimination and rights deprivations in various forms, including police brutality, school segregation and denial of the right to work.\u201d[6]\n[18] Item 2.1 gives example of police failing to protect victims from harassment or violence from a group of violent nationalists from the National Druzhina organization \u2013 established with support from the National Corps. They attacked and destroyed a Romani camp in Kyiv after its residents failed to respond to their ultimatum to leave the area within 24 hours. Police were present but made no arrests, and they were recorded making casual conversation with the nationalists following the attack. This was not an isolated event, as there were numerous reports of societal violence against Roma during the year, often perpetrated by known members of violent nationalist hate groups. This report adds that Roma continued to face governmental and societal discrimination.\n[19] Item 13.7 in the NDP states that \u201cdiscrimination against Roma is at every level of society, including among police, prosecutors, and officials.\u201d[7] This report adds that \u201cthroughout 2018, in the absence of any official protection, temporary settlements of Roma in Kyiv and Lviv became an easy target for right-wing violence \u2026 attacks on settlements have frequently been preceded by anti-Roma hate speech in the media or opportunistic statements from politicians.[8]\n[20] Justice La Forest in a landmark decision, Ward, in 1993 endorsed the concept of persecution as meaning \u201csustained or systematic violation of basic human rights demonstrative of a failure of state protection.\u201d[9] That appears to be the case here. In your case the cumulatively impact of life long discrimination and humiliation amounts to persecution.\nMore importantly, I find that if you were to return to the Ukraine today, there is a serious chance that you will continue to face discrimination and persecution.\nINTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE and STATE PROTECTION\n[21] Documentary evidence shows that the state agents are complicit in acts of discrimination and persecution, and police stand by and do not intervene to stop violence, against Roma. Moreover, police enter your homes illegally and rob you of your possessions. Unlawful acts by the police even if reported go unpunished. Therefore, I find that you have rebutted the presumption of state protection in your particular circumstances. I also find, on a balance of probabilities, that there is no internal flight alternative available for you in the Ukraine.\nCONCLUSION\n[22] Having considered all of the evidence, I find that there is a serious possibility of persecution should you return to the Ukraine today due to your ethnicity as Roma.\n[23] Therefore, I find you to be Convention refugees and accept your claims.\n[1] Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27 as amended, sections 96 and 97(1).\n[2] Exhibit 1, Package of information from the referring CBSA\/CIC.\n[3] Exhibit 6, Counsel Disclosure, received September 22, 2020; Exhibit 7, Country Conditions and Claimants\u2019 Personal Disclosure, received September 22, 2020.\n[4] Exhibit 3, National Document Package (NDP) for Ukraine (June 30, 2020).\n[5] Exhibit 7, Country Conditions and Claimants\u2019 Personal Disclosure.\n[6] Exhibit 4, NDP for Ukraine (June 30, 2020), item 13.1, s. 2.2.\n[7] Ibid., item 13.7, s.

I have considered your testimony and the other evidence presented in this case. Now, I am ready to render my decision.\n[2] This is the decision from the Refugee Protection Division under claim for refugee protection of the claimants [XXX], file number is MC0-08298, and their minor child, [XXX], MC0-08299.\n[3] The principal claimant is a citizen of Guinea while her child is a citizen of the United States of America. You are making refugee claims pursuant to s. 96 and 97(1)(8) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[4] You have been appointed as the designated representative for your daughter. I have considered and applied the chairperson guideline number 3 for children refugee claimant as well as the guideline number 4 for women claimants who fear gender-based persecution.\n[5] I would like to add that when reasons are issued, a written form of the reason may be edited for spelling, syntax, and grammar, and references to the applicable case law and documentary evidence may also be included.\nDetermination\n[6] I find that you, the principal claimant, is a Convention refugee for the following reasons as a member of a social group, women who are subjected to forced marriage. I found that your child is not a refugee or a person in need of protection because of fear to return to the United States has not been established.\nAllegation\n[7] You alleged the following. You were the subject of a forced marriage by your father while in Guinea. You were beaten and abused by your husband. You left the country in [XXX] 2009, a few months after your wedding, with the help of your mother. You went to the United States of America where you had your child.\n[8] You alleged that if you return to Guinea, you would be killed or beaten by your ex-husband or by your father because you dishonoured your family and also because you had a child out of wedlock. You alleged that there\u2019s no state protection for you or an internal flight alternative.\nIdentity\n[9] Your personal identity as a citizen of Guinea has been established by your testimony and your passport on file. The identity of your child has been established by her birth certificate and passport from the United States. I therefore find that on a balance of probabilities the identity and countries of reference have been established.\nWell-Founded Fear in Guinea, Credibility\n[10] In terms of your general credibility, I have found you to be a credible witness and therefore I accept what you have alleged in your overall testimony and in your Basis of Claim form. In support of your claim, you have provided documents confirming your allegation such as a marriage certificate and a written and also the oral testimony from your mother.\n[11] Your testimony was straightforward and was in keeping with your Basis of Claim form and there was no significant inconsistencies or omissions. You gave details about the wedding, the discussion you had with the people around you, the abuse you went through while married, and how your father imposed his decision on you and the rest of the family.\n[12] The testimony of your mother also confirmed your allegations. I addressed contradiction regarding your education in your forms, but I find that this contradiction is minor and does not affect the heart of your claim. Plus, you explained that you were really stressed when you filled the forms at your arrival in Canada.\n[13] I also asked questions about birth certificate that was requested by your father in 2019 according to its own content, you said that there was no way that your father requested that document for you. Your mother confirmed that she requested the document. All of that does not explain the content of the document. It is not enough to overturn your credibility in general.\n[14] I therefore find the following allegations to be credible. You were a subject of a forced marriage. Your mother helped you leave Guinea because of that marriage and the ill treatment and abuse you went through while living with your husband. Your father considered your decision to leave as a humiliation and wants to punish you for that.\nNexus with the Convention\n[15] I find that there\u2019s a link between what you fear and one of the Convention grounds specifically the social group. Therefore, this claim has been assessed under 96.\nState Protection and Objective Evidence\n[16] I find that the adequate state protection will not be available to you in Guinea. The objective documentary evidence at Tab 5.1.7 of the NDP indicated that forced marriage is a practice that persists in Guinea and is common. The prevalence of early marriage is among the highest in sub-Saharan Africa. The UN agency states that forced marriage is particularly common among the Fulani and the Malinke.\n[17] You have testified that you have attempt to seek protection, which your mother confirms. The police told you that they would not intervene in the family matter. The objective evidence indicates that the civil could protect from forced marriage and it is a punishable offence, but it seems like the disposition of the law are not adequately implemented because of the prevalence of forced marriage in Guinea.\n[18] The UN agency indicates that it is generally very difficult to refuse forced marriage in Guinea. Although some forces indicate that women with education have a higher chance to be able to refuse marriage, they will still face rejection by society because of their decision. Fleeing marriage is considered humiliation for the family.\n[19] The objective evidence confirms that forced marriage is seen as a family matter by the authorities. There is a limited access to help because of the Jack of resources. In light of the objective country documentation, I find that the claimant has refuted the presumption of state protection. Based on your personal circumstances as well as the objective country documentation, I find that the adequate state protection will not be available to you in Guinea.\nIFA\n[20] I have also considered whether viable internal flight alternatives exist for you. I have identified [XXX] as a possible IFA. You mentioned that your father has family there although you were not able to explain exactly how he will find you, it is clear that a single young mother without high education would be under unreasonable difficulties in a small city without family support. The only person who could help you in Guinea is your mother and she lives in Conakry where you would be exposed to your agent of persecution.\n[21] The documentary evidence indicates that \u2014 and that is at Tab 5.1.11 \u2014 that a representative of the department family states that, \u201cIn many cases single woman can find housing only if they are accompanied by a family member who is also required to provide proof of the familial relationship. The situation where it is easy for her to get housing without any condition attached, she might be subjected to harassment from either the landlord or the person who helped her obtain the housing.\u201d\n[22] He also states that, \u201cIt is often difficult for women to move around on their own and to settle elsewhere alone. They often need support from the family or from a man. Women are also strongly advised against travelling or relocating to a new community alone. There is in fact cause to fear for their safety. However, age and the presence of a dependent children can be mitigating factors.\u201d\n[23] Taking into consideration profile of the claimant and their personal situation, [XXX] would not be a reasonable IFA for her as a single woman with no support. I mentioned the credibility, but I just want to add regarding the subjective fear that I also consider that fact that you did not claim for refugee protection in the United States but since I do believe that you would face persecution if you had to go back to Guinea, I think that it is not something that is central to the decision.\n[24] Therefore, I did not take that \u2014 the fact that you didn\u2019t claim for protection in the United States \u2014 as something that affected my decision.\nWell-Founded Fear in the United States for the Child\n[25] As for your child, considering that your lawyer mentioned that you did not have any specific fear for her in the United States, considering that there\u2019s no fear of persecution or any threat under 97 for your child there, I find that you did not establish a well-founded fear for her in the United States.\nConclusion\n[26] Based on the totality of the evidence, I find that the principal claimant is a Convention refugee. Your claim is therefore accepted. As for your child, you have not established a serious possibility of persecution or the risk under 97. Therefore, I find that she\u2019s not a refugee or a person in need of protection. Her claim is rejected.\n[27] So, that concludes my decision. I really want to thank you for your testimony today and also, I want to thank Counsel for his support and I really wish you the best.\n[28] CLAIMANT: Thank you so much.\n[29] MEMBER: No problem.\n[30] COUNSEL: Thank you, Madam Board Member.\n[31] MEMBER: I just \u2014\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-REASONS CONCLUDED\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n",

For this, persons at her [XXX] threatened to denounce her to Iranian authorities where she would be suspected of non-Islamic behaviour and for being a non\u00adbeliever and disproportionately punished.\nDETERMINATION\n[5] The claimant is a Convention refugee. She established a serious possibility of persecution for religion and imputed political opinion.\nANALYSIS\nCredibility\n[6] She was credible regarding key elements of her claim.\n[7] There were numerous credibility concerns. They were not determinative.\n[8] The National Documentation Package (NDP) for Iran, dated 29 March 2019, Iran refers to severe corporal or other punishment for apostasy, un-Islamic behavior or behavior not consistent with state-prescribed morals consistent with Shia religious practice or behaviour (NDP, tabs 9.8 and 11.1). The NDP mentions that political dissidents are accused by state authorities of serious capital crimes either against Islam or against national security and subject lengthy arbitrary detention and mistreatment in detention (NDP, tab 1.14, p. 10; tab 2.1, pp. 4 and 16).\n[9] Given the above, I conclude that the claimant would face a serious possibility of persecution for religion in Iran for her non-Islamic view.\nState protection\n[10] I find that there is clear and convincing evidence before me that the state is unable or unwilling to provide you with adequate protection, for reasons mentioned above.\nInternal flight alternative\n[11] On the evidence before me, I find that there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout Iran for the claimant, for reasons mentioned above.\nCONCLUSION\n[12] The claimant is a Convention refugee.\n[13] I accept her claim.\n\n",

He is seeking asylum under s. 96 and s. 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nDecision\n[2] The panel concludes that the claimant has established that he faces a serious possibility of persecution in India on the basis of religion. The panel therefore finds that he is a Convention refugee pursuant to s. 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act and accepts his claim.\nSummary of Allegations\n[3] The claimant\u2019s detailed allegations are contained in his basis of claim form. The claimant fears for his life, if he were to return to India, due to his faith as a member of the Muslim minority religion in India. As a result of his religion, he has been targeted by members of an extremist Hindu group for his faith. He has been personally targeted and threatened on several occasions by a group of extremists.\n[4] On one occasion, he was pulled out of his car and threatened with a gun when he was on the way home from work in Pune (ph.). And then he had relocated to Mumbai and he was again threatened that at any time the orders could be sent for him to be killed.\n[5] The claimant has also observed similarly situated individuals being beaten and killed, and he has seen numerous videos, unfortunately, of this happening to members of the Muslim minority, in videos that have been uploaded from numerous locations throughout India, and, unfortunately, the people not being brought to justice.\n[6] So, the claimant has established that he faces the serious possibility of persecution based on his religion.\n[7] The claimant had relocated several times within India for the safety of himself and his family; and yet, he continued to receive threats. He lived for a while at a college residence and he lived at various hotels. He obtained a visa to the United States. He travelled to the United States several times to look into various opportunities, including possibly claiming refugee status, and he was told that it would be a process of eight to ten years where he would not be able to see his family and that there was a low chance of success. He also looked into possibly getting a job there, being sponsored by a possible employer, and that didn\u2019t work out. He had also looked into coming to Canada based on points, coming as a permanent resident. He looked into many different options and he was \u2013 at a certain point, he had \u2013 his US visa had been cancelled and he went to try to find out why and he was unable to obtain an answer from the authorities. He also obtained a Canadian visa. And after looking into many different possibilities that he testified to, he had finally come to Canada in [XXX] 2019. And the following month, in [XXX] 2019, he had claimed asylum here.\nAnalysis\nIdentity\n[8] The claimant\u2019s personal and national identity as a citizen of India is established, on a balance of probabilities, by the documentary evidence on file, specifically his Indian passport.\nNexus to the Convention\n[9] The claimant\u2019s allegations establish a nexus to the Convention. He faces persecution, based on his religious beliefs as a member of the Muslim minority faith in India. His claim, therefore, has been analysed under s. 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nCredibility\n[10] The panel finds that the claimant is credible for the following reasons.\n[11] Testimony provided under oath is presumed to be truthful, unless there is a reason for doubting its truthfulness. In this claim, the panel has no such reason.\n[12] The claimant testified in a sincere detailed manner. He provided clear and compelling answers regarding the situations he faced, in which he repeatedly over the years was made to feel fearful as a Muslim living in India. For example, he had been willing to pay extra money considered a personal tax to a rickshaw driver because of his faith. He was forced to participate in prayers of the Hindu faith at his office, even though it wasn\u2019t his personal belief, as he was pressured to do so in order to keep his job, in order not to face persecution at work. And several years ago, he stopped wearing his traditional prayer outfit that would normally be worn on Fridays because of fear of being persecuted for his Muslim faith. These are just some of the examples that he provided. But perhaps the most compelling example was when he stated that just speaking to his wife on the phone in a taxi, he had made, as he had said, the mistake of greeting her in a traditional way of his faith, and that this mistake had led to his life being threatened by the taxi driver on another occasion. And just the very fact that the claimant would consider it to be a mistake to greet his own family with a traditional greeting demonstrates the level of fear that he was subjected to.\n[13] The claimant also provided testimony regarding him having personally observed videos that had been uploaded by Hindu extremist groups, killing without fear of repercussions, beating and killing members of the Muslim minority faith, and how he had seen (inaudible) similarly situated individuals being persecuted and there not being an legal repercussions.\n[14] So, the panel found that all of his testimony added to the credibility of his claim and demonstrated that he had actually experienced these things, and that he had not only a subjective fear but also an objective basis for this fear throughout his life, being raised to sort of hide his religion and then, more recently, over the years, that the atmosphere was becoming increasingly hostile towards members of his faith, and that this was being encouraged by the current r\u00e9gime.\n[15] So, the panel did have concerns about \u2013 well, one concern about the fact that there were some contradictions regarding the dates. And so, the claimant had repeatedly said that he is bad with dates, that he has trouble remembering exact dates when things happened. However, when the panel weighs this against the quality of his testimony and all the information he provided, including the order in which the events occurred, he provided lots of details of the events and who was present and his thought process and what was said to him and what was done. And so, all of these details outweigh the concern that the panel would have about the claimant not remembering certain dates. They were far outweighed by the quality of his testimony and also by the documentary evidence that he provided and the objective documentary evidence that\u2019s in the National Documentation Package.\n[16] The claimant provided a considerable amount of documentary evidence in support of his allegations and some of the most relevant evidence includes:\nExhibit C-1, the pages from the letter of his job at [XXX] (ph.);\nExhibit C-2, a payslip from his job, when he returned to Mumbai at the [XXX] (ph.);\nExhibit C-3, a letter and piece of identification from a co-worker who had observed him being followed and people asking about him, and who personally was told by the claimant about his situation;\nExhibit C-4, a letter and piece of identification from the claimant\u2019s wife, explaining in detail and in a very compelling and emotional fashion in the letter about the situation that the whole family has been subjected to.\nExhibit C-5 shows some text messages with the person at the college hostel who had helped him to arrange the claimant to stay there briefly;\nExhibit C-6 shows hotel booking when he was also trying to stay away from his home to protect his family and also to not be tracked by the agents of persecution.\n[17] The claimant also provided documentary evidence in the form of newspaper articles regarding the situation in India and the current r\u00e9gime and how, unfortunately, there is an encouragement of violence against Muslims in India. And these are Exhibits C-7, C-8, C-9, C-10 and 11, which document beatings and killing of members of the Muslim minority faith in India in regions all around the country, to show the widespread nature of this persecution.\n[18] So, I will indicate some of the national documentary evidence that corroborates the testimony of the claimant of the persecution that he would face if he were to return to India, and that corroborates his experience when he was in India.\n[19] Tab 2.3 details the government\u2019s failure to prevent attacks on Muslims and the encouragement of the r\u00e9gime of anti-Muslim activity. And this was also mentioned by the counsel.\n[20] Now, Tab 12.1 indicates that authorities are not prosecuting the harming of non-Hindu individuals, which was also mentioned by counsel.\n[21] There\u2019s Tab 12.5 that discusses the current r\u00e9gime\u2019s complicity in violence against minority religions.\n[22] Tab 10.7 \u2013 also Tab 12.9. That talks about the killing of Muslims that have been accused of either eating or selling beef. And the claimant had talked about the seriousness of being accused of eating beef could lead to someone being killed and learning that even in certain districts mutton is not even allowed to be eaten.\n[23] So, there is also discussion in Tabs 12.10 and 12.14 about the persecution of Muslims throughout India.\n[24] So, these are just some examples, particular examples, in the National Documentation Package that detail the persecution of Muslims in India and the current r\u00e9gime\u2019s complicity, and even encouragement, in these attacks.\n[25] So, the panel finds that there were no relevant inconsistencies, contradictions or omissions between the claimant\u2019s basis of claim form, his testimony at the hearing and the documentary evidence on file that were not reasonably explained.\n[26] So, for all these reasons, the panel finds that the claimant\u2019s allegations are credible.\n[27] The panel finds that the claimant has established, on a balance of probabilities, that he is of the Muslim faith; that, as a result of his faith, he has been threatened on multiple occasions in India, including at gunpoint and including being told that at any point he could be just killed. And he has observed similarly situated individuals being persecuted, based on their membership in the minority Muslim religion. And so, he has established that he faces a serious possibility of persecution if he were to return to India.\nState Protection\n[28] The panel finds that the claimant has rebutted the presumption of State protection with clear and convincing evidence that the authorities in India would be unable or unwilling to provide him with adequate protection.\n[29] The claimant provided credible testimony about the killing of, unfortunately, people of the Muslim faith \u2013 being killed, or beaten and then killed, and shown on videos without legal repercussions. And this was like common knowledge throughout India, unfortunately. And that \u2013 this is also reflected, this lack of adequate State protection, in the documentary evidence., Tab 10.7 and Tab 10.10. So, Tab 10.7, as is referred to by counsel, talks about the perception of the Muslim community, and how police target and victimise Muslims based on their identity and that there is a distinct bias, and that there\u2019s actions that indicate bias against the Muslim community in India, and this is on a systemic scale. And this is something that was referred to by counsel and also discussed by the claimant as being fearful of the authorities. And specific examples \u2013 in Tab 10.10 of the National Documentation Package, it discusses human rights abuses being committed by police that are reported to be widespread and conducted with impunity. Persons from marginalised minority communities are particularly affected and excessive force by security forces are reported, including extra-judicial killing. As well in Tab 10.10, it also states that judicial corruption is widespread and that justice is often delayed or denied. There\u2019s also mention in Tab 10.10 how lower levels of the judiciary in particular have been rife with corruption and most citizens have great difficulty securing justice through the courts. And research by the Canadian Immigration and Refugee Board\u2019s Research Directorate indicted corruption within the Indian judicial system at different levels that affects the effectiveness of the courts. So, this is in addition to the other \u2013 to the credible testimony of the claimant and the documentary evidence put forth by counsel and discussed by counsel that demonstrates that there is a lack of adequate protection.\n[30] And so, the panel finds that if the claimant were to approach the authorities for protection in India, adequate protection would not be forthcoming to him.\n[31] Claimants are not required to risk their lives seeking inadequate protection, merely to demonstrate its ineffectiveness.\n[32] So, for all these reasons, the claimant has rebutted the presumption of State protection.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[33] For the reasons just described regarding the lack of State protection \u2013 as well as the fact that the national documentation that was produced by counsel, and also that\u2019s in the National Documentation Package, shows that there are, unfortunately, attacks and killings of Muslims by extremists groups throughout India, in many regions throughout India, such that the panel finds that the claimant would face a serious possibility of persecution throughout India \u2013 the panel finds that there is nowhere in India that the claimant could relocate that could be safe and reasonable. And in particular, due to the current r\u00e9gime\u2019s complicity, and even encouragement, of attacks on Muslims.\n[34] So, for these reasons, the panel finds that the agents of persecution have, on a balance of probabilities, both the means and motivation to harm and find the claimant throughout India.\n[35] So, the panel concludes that there is no viable internal flight alternative for the claimant in India.\nConclusion\nFor all of these reasons, the panel finds that the claimant has established a subjective fear of return to India that is objectively well-founded.\nThe panel concludes that the claimant has established that he faces a serious possibility of persecution in India, in accordance with s. 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nAnd the panel therefore finds that he is a Convention refugee, pursuant to s. 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act and accepts his claim.\n\u2014 Decision concluded\n\n",

Their passports prove that they are citizens of Russia.\n[2] I have appointed [XXX] as designated representative for her minor child, [XXX].\n[3] In rendering my reasons, I have considered and applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guidelines on Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution (Guideline 4) and the Chairperson\u2019s Guidelines on Proceedings Before the IRB Involving Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression (Guideline 9).\nALLEGATIONS\n[4] The claimants all lived in [XXX], Russia. [XXX] and [XXX] are a lesbian common-law couple. [XXX] is [XXX] and lives with them.\n[5] The principal claimant was harassed and threatened with violence in her youth when she revealed that she was lesbian. She hid her sexual orientation for her safety. She was lonely and decided to have a child. She met a man who assisted her but he did not want to be an active parent to the child.\n[6] [XXX] was born in [XXX]. The principal claimant raised the child. The principal claimant\u2019s mother helped a lot with raising the child.\n[7] The principal claimant met the co-claimant, [XXX], on an Internet dating site in 2014. They started living together in 2015.\n[8] The parents of other children suspected that principal claimant and [XXX] were lesbians and said that [XXX] was not to play with the other children because she was not normal. The two adult claimants became the subject of aggressive messages and vandalism for being lesbians.\n[9] The claimants all moved residence, but the insults from neighbours continued. The claimants moved again. The pattern of insults and threats continued when the adult claimants\u2019 vehicles or other property was vandalized for the adult claimants\u2019 lesbianism. The principal claimant feared for the safety and well-being of her daughter.\n[10] In 2017, after the adult claimants returned from a trip to Turkey, their landlord yelled and insulted [XXX] who was playing in the yard and later said to [XXX] that the claimants should be killed.\n[11] They moved again to a temporary residence while they attempted to obtain Canadian visas to leave Russia. The principal claimant and her daughter obtained the visas, but [XXX] was refused.\n[12] The principal claimant and [XXX] left Russia for Canada in [XXX] 2018 and then made a refugee claim.\n[13] [XXX] was the victim of a physical assault and other violence due to being lesbian in Russia. She obtained a US visa and left Russia in [XXX] 2019 and then came to Canada to make a refugee claim.\nDETERMINATION\n[14] I find that adult claimants are \u201cConvention refugees\u201d. They established a serious possibility of persecution as members of a particular social group (lesbians \u2013 sexual orientation).\n[15] I find that for the child claimant, it has not been established that there is a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground, or that, on a balance of probabilities, that the child claimant would personally be subjected to a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or a danger of torture upon return to her country.\nANALYSIS\n[16] The determinative issues in this case are credibility and the alleged risk of harm to the child claimant not amounting to persecution.\nCredibility\n[17] The adult claimants were credible witnesses regarding their personal circumstances as adult lesbians. Their testimony and other evidence support their claim regarding the risk of future persecution in Russia.\n[18] There were inconsistencies in testimony and the other evidence regarding how the child claimant was treated in Russia and how she would be treated in Russia on her return to Russia. These inconsistencies or credibility issues were not adequately explained and the Guidelines 4 and 9 regarding trauma or shame related to crimes against or mistreatment of women or sexual minorities do not adequately explain the inconsistencies or credibility issues regarding the child claimant.\n[19] When asked what would happen to her daughter upon return to Russia, the principal claimant testified in the hearing that it would be difficult for her because she has been out of school and lose up to two years \u2013 she would double. Later in the hearing, when asked what would happen to her (the principal claimant) upon her own return to Russia, she responded that her daughter now knows in Canada that the adult claimants are in a lesbian relationship and they explained that it is not bad or shameful.\n[20] Later again in the hearing, the claimants\u2019 own counsel asked what the principal claimant\u2019s concerns were for her daughter, the principal claimant responded that she was concerned that her daughter would be humiliated as the child of a lesbian and be treated as not normal. Asked by her counsel if all the principal claimant was worried about was name calling, the principal claimant responded that she did not know what would happen to her daughter, what impact that there would be directly or if she would be beaten, but that people are wicked and kids are mean.\n[21] Later again, the principal claimant testified that her daughter, who now knows about the sexual orientation of her mother would not be able to keep silent about the principal claimant\u2019s sexual orientation and therefore would expose herself to insults and humiliation.\n[22] Asked why she would not have mentioned this possible harm to [XXX] when first asked in the hearing about what would happen to [XXX] upon her return to Russia. She responded that she did not understand the extent of the question the first time.\n[23] The principal claimant\u2019s testimony on behalf of her daughter has not shown that the daughter would likely reveal to others in Russia that her mother is a lesbian. Her testimony was vague and varying on the subject of what would happen to her daughter upon return to Russia, mostly responded that she does not know what would happen to her daughter. Consequently, I draw a negative inference regarding the principal claimant\u2019s allegation that her daughter would face a serious harm in Russia, if the daughter returned there.\n[24] While the principal claimant mentioned that her landlord had said to [XXX] that he wished the claimants, including the child, dead, I interpret this not be a threat of death to the child, but rather a hateful statement. The claimants have not submitted probative evidence that the child would likely face an aggression of violence, based on past events or based on the particular circumstances of the child looking forward, if she were to return to Russia alone.\n[25] The principal claimant testified that her own mother was an important caregiver to the child claimant, including during the adult claimants\u2019 trip to Turkey in 2018. I note that according to the Canadian visa application (document #6), that the principal claimant testified was true and correct, except for the mention of a male friend as being her common-law spouse, that the child\u2019s maternal grandmother lived in the same city as the claimants. The principal claimant testified her own mother is a teacher on pension but still teaches violin and that if the child claimant was alone in Russia, this grandmother, would take care of the child.\n[26] Asked if there would be any problem if her mother took care of the child claimant, the principal claimant responded that the child should live with her (the principal claimant, the child\u2019s mother).\n[27] The claimants have not shown with probative evidence that the child\u2019s grandmother could not continue to care for the child claimant, if she were to return to Russia.\n[28] The National Documentation Packages for Russia (NDP), dated 29 March 2019, indicates that while homosexuality has been decriminalized, there is still serious discrimination against gay and lesbian people in law (anti-propaganda law) and custom, where there are reports of violent crimes against LGBT persons with inadequate state protection (NDP, tab 6.1). The NDP mentions that in Russia\u2019s Chechen Republic, families of gay persons were shamed and insulted official as being responsible for homosexuality (NDP, tab 6.5, p. 27), but there is not a report of such treatment of families in the rest of Russia. However, given the above-described social atmosphere in Russia against sexual minorities, it would not be implausible that such treatment occurred elsewhere in Russia.\n[29] The claimants\u2019 own submitted evidence (E-9 to E-20) on the treatment of sexual minorities in Russia is not probative evidence showing that the family members, and in particular, children, are exposed to serious harm due to their association to homosexual members of their families. In particular, E-16 describes how LGBT parents in same-sex relations feared the removal of their children by social services in Russia, but that no legal mechanism for such an action currently exists in Russia. Most of the articles and reports (E-9 to E-20) refer to discrimination, threats and violence to openly LGBT persons and forced silence of these persons to avoid that trouble.\n[30] The claimants have not submitted sufficient probative evidence that the child claimant understands the lesbian relationship of her mother, that the child claimant would discuss it openly in Russia or would be exposed to a serious danger there.\n[31] Furthermore, if the child claimant did understand the lesbian relationship of her mother and the child felt compelled to keep this information secret for her own protection, this would not be a hardship amounting to persecution for a refugee ground or a cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\nRisk of harm\n[32] To be considered persecution, the prospective risk of harm must be sufficiently serious, either individually or cumulatively, to constitute persecution or a risk to life or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. Risks the child claimant may face in Russia, I do not consider that this would amount to persecution, even if taken cumulatively, for the reasons already stated above.\n[33] Due to the insufficiency of evidence regarding a future danger or harm for the child claimant in Russia, State protection and internal flight alternative (IFA) are not directly relevant to the child claimant in her particular circumstances. Since the child claimant has already been in the care of the grandmother or resided with the grandmother who resides in the same city where the claimants last resided in Russia, I do not consider living with this grandmother to be an IFA for the child claimant.\n[34] Whether the principal claimant, if accepted as a refugee in Canada, would make a successful application for permanent residence in Canada and include the child claimant in that application, therefore precluding the forced return of the child to Russia, is beyond the scope of the present refugee decision.\nState protection\n[35] I find that there is clear and convincing evidence before me that the state (Russia) is unable or unwilling to provide the adult claimants with adequate protection, for the reasons already mentioned.\nInternal flight alternative\n[36] On the evidence before me, I find that there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout Russia for the adult claimants, for the reasons already mentioned.\nCONCLUSION\n[37] The adult claimants are \u201cConvention refugees\u201d. I accept their claims.\n[38] The child claimant is not a \u201cConvention refugee\u201d under section 96 of IRPA or a person in need of protection within the meaning of section 97 (1)(a) or (b) of IRPA. Her claim is rejected.\n\n",

They are claiming refugee protection in Canada under section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).\n[2] The panel appointed the principal claimant as the designated representative of his minor child, [XXX].\n[3] The wife and minor child are basing their refugee protection claims on the principal claimant\u2019s written account in the Basis of Claim Form (BOC Form).[1]\nALLEGATIONS\n[4] The principal claimant alleges that he fears his deceased father\u2019s third wife, named [XXX], as well as his police officer half-brother, named [XXX], born from that relationship, who threatened to kill the male claimant and go after his family after he refused to give them the major share of the inheritance from his father.\n[5] According to the will, the inheritance was to be divided equally between all the children of the male claimant\u2019s father, and [XXX] request was very poorly received by the other heirs. Following their refusal, [XXX] threatened to kill the claimant and his brothers and sisters.\n[6] The male claimant also alleges that two of his brothers were killed after receiving death threats from [XXX]. According to the male claimant, it was [XXX] who ensured that her threats were carried out. She was questioned by the police after the death of the male claimant\u2019s brothers because people had witnessed her uttering threats. However, the investigation quickly ended as her son [XXX], a [XXX], intervened to have her released. The male claimant alleges that [XXX] has many influential contacts among the Nigerian authorities and that he is involved in shady dealings.\n[7] Consequently, the male claimant fears that he will be the next victim of violence at the hands of [XXX] and her son owing to this conflict, especially since the issue of the inheritance has not yet been resolved and the other heirs do not want to agree to an unequal split.\nDETERMINATION\n[8] The panel concludes that the refugee protection claimants are \u201cpersons in need of protection\u201d for the reasons set out below.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[9] The panel is satisfied as to the refugee protection claimants\u2019 identity, which was established, on a balance of probabilities, by means of the testimony of the adult claimants and by the submission on the record of the certified true copy of their respective Nigerian passports.[2]\nAnalysis under paragraph 97(1)(b)\n[10] In his BOC Form and during the hearing, the principal claimant stated that he feared being mistreated or even killed because of the conflict with his father\u2019s wife and with his half-brother [XXX], a conflict involving the estate of his deceased father. He also feared that his agents of harm could go after members of his nuclear family, as the threats targeted them as well. Refugee protection claims involving a physical risk from family members in Nigeria because of an inheritance fall under subsection 97(1) of the IRPA since there is no nexus to the Convention.[3]\n[11] It is also clear that, in relation to the claimants\u2019 fears toward Nigeria, this refugee protection claim does not involve any danger of the claimants\u2019 being subjected to a danger of torture within the meaning of paragraph 97(1)(a) of the IRPA.\n[12] The panel has therefore analyzed this refugee protection claim under paragraph 97(1)(b) of the IRPA, that is, whether the claimants would be personally subjected to a risk to their lives or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if they were to return to Nigeria.\nCredibility\n[13] The male claimant gave frank and sincere testimony before the panel about the conflict between [XXX] his half-brother [XXX], and himself, regarding the inheritance left by his deceased father.\n[14] First, the male claimant provided detailed information about the way the inheritance was split between his father\u2019s three wives. Subsequently, he explained the reasons that led [XXX] to insist on an unequal split\u2013according to her, she was his father\u2019s favourite wife\u2013and stated that she had demonstrated her desire to appropriate the largest share of the inheritance by not hesitating to threaten the other heirs. The male claimant provided details on relationship dynamics within his family and the difficulty he had getting along with his half-brothers on his father\u2019s side.\n[15] The male claimant explained how the threats had escalated over time, with the murder of his two brothers. The male claimant also described the various means he had used to try to resolve the conflict. He testified that he had asked the police to intervene following the murder of his brothers, but said that the investigation had been sabotaged by the intervention of his half-brother, the [XXX]. The male claimant also asked the other heirs to agree to [XXX] demands in order to end the conflict, but they refused. The male claimant indicated that he had finally left the inheritance under the management of a company. This implies not only that it became more difficult for [XXX] and the claimant\u2019s half-brother to appropriate the inheritance, but also that their desire for revenge grew.\n[16] The male claimant testified that, on [XXX] 2017, he moved with his wife and child to the home of an uncle in Ogun State, as he felt that his life was in danger in Lagos. Nevertheless, he was found by men sent by [XXX] and his half-brother [XXX]. On [XXX] 2017, the claimants were informed by neighbours that some men had been asking about them, and it was because of this suspicious visit that the claimants decided to leave Nigeria for good.\n[17] The principal claimant spontaneously answered every question he was asked. His answers were consistent not only with his written account but also with the various affidavits submitted in support of his claim.[4]\n[18] In addition to his credible testimony, the principal claimant provided several pieces of evidence to corroborate his allegations. He submitted into evidence his father\u2019s will,[5] his brothers\u2019 death certificates[6] and posters announcing their funerals,[7] the contract stipulating that the inheritance is being managed by a management company,[8] as well as evidence that his half-brother [XXX] is a [XXX].[9] The male claimant\u2019s attempts to obtain protection from the Nigerian authorities following the murder of his brothers are corroborated by a police report.[10]\n[19] The panel notes that the claimants arrived in the United States on [XXX] 2017. They finally left that country on [XXX] 2018. The principal claimant specified that he did not claim asylum because of the hostile climate toward asylum seekers in the United States. The panel considers this an unreasonable explanation for the failure to claim asylum. Nevertheless, as the claimants had valid status and given the duration of their stay, which lasted a few months, the panel is of the opinion that this behaviour is not determinative to undermine the credibility of the alleged facts taken as a whole.\nObjective basis of the fear\n[20] The objective documentation on Nigeria reports that violence related to inheritance issues is common. Indeed, in a European Union report, the Director of the Initiative for Equal Rights in Nigeria states that this is a major problem in Nigeria and that quarrels can happen between several family members; the violence that follows can go as far as killing.[11]\nState protection\n[21] Objective documentation indicates that the Nigeria Police Force is perceived as corrupt and ineffective.[12] The reports also highlight problems in the judicial system, which is reported to be short-staffed, underfunded, ineffective, subject to political intervention, corrupt, and lacking training and resources.[13]\n[22] The panel also notes that the male claimant testified that he reported some of the incidents to the police. He submitted a police report[14] into evidence and testified about the time he went to file a complaint. He explained that the police officers questioned [XXX] but that they quickly released her. The male claimant thinks that [XXX] son, [XXX], himself a [XXX], may have bribed the police. The male claimant explained that he knew about his half-brother\u2019s illegal trafficking in cars. The half-brother told the male claimant about his activities and influence within the police when he threatened him.\n[23] For all these reasons, the panel is of the opinion that the male claimant has established, through clear and convincing evidence, that he would not have access to adequate state protection.\nInternal flight alternative\n[24] The panel considered the Jurisprudential Guide dealing with the various internal flight alternatives in major cities in southern and central Nigeria for claimants fleeing non-state actors.[15] Having considered the profile of the male claimant\u2019s agents of harm, the analysis in the Guide is not applicable in this case.\n[25] The panel questioned the male claimant about the possibility of relocating to Port Harcourt in order to escape [XXX] and his half-brother [XXX]. Asked to explain why [XXX] and his half-brother would want to find him in the proposed IFA, the male claimant stated that they are motivated by their desire for revenge as well as by the fact that the male claimant is the last male heir standing in the way of management of the inheritance passing into the hands of his half-brother [XXX]. Asked about the ability of [XXX] and his half-brother to find him in Port Harcourt, the male claimant answered that, regardless of where he went in Nigeria, his agents of harm would be able to find him because of his half-brother\u2019s duties as a [XXX] and his access to personal information banks. The male claimant\u2019s agents of harm found him when he moved to his uncle\u2019s home with his family, which demonstrates a strong and sustained interest in him. The principal claimant added that his agents of harm are capable of committing very violent acts, as they have demonstrated with the murder of his brothers.\n[26] The panel takes note of the male claimant\u2019s testimony regarding the means at the disposal of his agents of harm. The panel has also taken into account their potential interest in finding the claimant with a view to eliminating him from the line of inheritance and taking revenge on him for standing in the way of their demands as well as for having filed a complaint with the police against [XXX] regarding the murder of his brothers.\n[27] Consequently, the panel is of the opinion that, on a balance of probabilities, the claimants face a risk to their lives or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment throughout Nigeria.\n[28] In light of the above and taking all the evidence into account, the panel is of the opinion that the claimants have established that, should they return to Nigeria, they would be personally subjected to a risk to their lives or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment within the meaning of subsection 97(1) of the IRPA.\nCONCLUSION\n[29] For all these reasons, the panel concludes that the refugee protection claimants are \u201cpersons in need of protection\u201d and allows their refugee protection claim under paragraph 97(1)(b) of the IRPA.\n[1] Document 1 \u2014 Basis of Claim Form.\n[2] Document 1 \u2014 Information package provided by the Canada Border Services Agency and\/or Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada, formerly Citizenship and Immigration Canada.\n[3] Njeru v.

Chauhan\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Juliette Ukpabi\nCountry: Uganda\nRPD Number: VC0-02644\nAssociated RPD Number(s):\nATIP Number: A-2021-00800\nATIP Pages: 000020-000029\nREASONS FOR DECISION\nINTRODUCTION\n[1] These are the reasons for the decision in the claim of [XXX] (the \u201cclaimant\u201d), who is a citizen of Uganda, and is claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (the \u201cAct\u201d).[1]\n[2] In rendering it\u2019s reasons, the panel has considered the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline on Proceedings Before the IRB Involving Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression (SOGIE).\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] The following is a brief synopsis put forth by the claimant in her Basis of Claim (BOC) form.[2]\n[4] She fears persecution at the hands of the society, her husband, and the government of Uganda due to her sexual orientation.\n[5] The claimant is a bisexual woman. She first had a same-sex relationship at the age of 17 in 1996. Her mother suspected her of being a lesbian, hence the claimant was enrolled in a religious school. In 2002, she joined [XXX] University and met her girlfriend, [XXX]. They began a serious relationship, which continues to date. The claimant and [XXX] were suspended from university in the final year after being caught in sexual activities on the campus.\n[6] The claimant married her husband on [XXX], 2009 due to family and societal pressure. She gave birth to her daughter in 2013. However, her husband mistreated her and used to sexually abuse her. She tried to leave him many times but every time he would find her and compel her to come back. In the meantime, the claimant continued her relationship with [XXX].\n[7] On [XXX], 2017, the claimant\u2019s husband caught her in an intimate position with [XXX] and beat her up. The neighbours came to know about the claimant\u2019s sexual orientation and told her husband that they do not want her living in that neighbourhood as she will be a bad influence on their children. The next day, on [XXX], 2017, the claimant\u2019s husband took all the evidence about the claimant\u2019s sexual activities from her phone and presented it to the village elders. She was locked up in prison. However, the claimant\u2019s brother-in-law, who is a [XXX], helped her escape the prison on [XXX], 2017.\n[8] The claimant went into hiding with the assistance of her sister and [XXX]. The claimant\u2019s husband and her community members, meanwhile, continued to search for her.\n[9] The claimant was able to escape Uganda with the help of an agent on [XXX], 2019. She reached Canada on [XXX], 2019 and filed for refugee protection.\nDETERMINATION\n[10] The panel finds that the claimant is a Convention refugee as she has established a serious possibility of persecution on account of her membership in a particular social group for the following reasons.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[11] The claimant did not have a passport on her when she reached Toronto on [XXX], 2019. The panel asked the claimant if she had a passport issued to her by any country. She stated that she has her original Ugandan passport with her at the hearing. A copy of this passport is marked Exhibit 5. She was asked if she travelled from Uganda to Canada using this passport. The claimant explained that she travelled from Uganda to [XXX] using this passport. When she reached [XXX], the agent who was assisting her in her escape, then took her passport from her and gave her another passport with her picture but with a different name and date of birth on it. That passport had a visa to Canada on it. When they reached Toronto, the agent took all the documents from her and left her alone at the airport.\n[12] The claimant was then asked how she has her passport on her if the agent took her passport from her. She stated that he returned to Uganda and handed her original passport to her sister. Her sister then couriered the passport to her (claimant) in Canada. The claimant showed the delivery receipt and envelope used to mail the passport using the DHL courier service to the panel.\n[13] Based on the claimant\u2019s reasonable explanation, as well as the documentary evidence produced at the hearing, the panel is satisfied with the claimant\u2019s identity as a Ugandan national and accepts that she is who she says she is. Specifically, the panel finds that the claimant\u2019s identity as a national of Uganda has been established, on a balance of probabilities,\nbased on her sworn statement and copies of her Ugandan National Identification Card[3] and Ugandan passport on file.\nCredibility\n[14] At a Refugee Protection Division (RPD) hearing, the presumption before the panel is that a claimant\u2019s testimony is true; however, this can be rebutted in appropriate circumstances such as inconsistencies, contradictions, omissions and undetailed testimony. However, this was not the case here. The claimant testified in a straightforward manner and there were no relevant inconsistencies in her testimony or contradictions between her testimony and the other evidence before the panel. She did not appear to embellish her testimony at any point.\n[15] The claimant explained that she has always been attracted to men and women alike, and this is how she was born. It is natural for her to feel attracted to both men and women. She stated she will feel suffocated if her ability to express herself sexually is taken away from her. When she started her relationship with [XXX], she felt completely satisfied in that relationship, which is why it has lasted this long and is still going strong.\n[16] The panel canvassed her about her relationship with her husband. The claimant explained that she was born into a Muslim family and that her father is a very religious person. When her parents discovered her bisexuality, they forced her to marry her husband, even though she did not want to marry him. Her father then locked her up in a garage for a week until the claimant relented and agreed to marry her husband. However, she has never felt attracted to him because he has been abusing her since they got married. When her husband discovered her in an intimate position with [XXX] on [XXX], 2017, he beat her up and took her to the village elders, who then put her in jail after registering a case of homosexuality against her. She has been separated from him since then and has no plans to ever live with him again because he is a heartless man and is still looking for her so that he could put her in jail. When asked how she knows that her husband is still looking for her, the claimant stated that her sister gives her updates whenever she talks to her. The claimant stated that the police is also on the lookout for her since there is a case pending against her and because she escaped from jail.\n[17] The claimant was asked where she had lived after escaping jail in Uganda. She stated that she went into hiding in different villages and towns with the help of her sister and her partner, [XXX]. They were the ones who would provide her with everything she needed while in hiding, including taking care of her children. [XXX] and her sister arranged for a travel agent to help her escape from Uganda.\n[18] The claimant has provided documentary evidence to support her claim. The panel has no reason to doubt the genuineness of these documents, which form Exhibit 4, and accepts them as genuine. In doing so, the panel finds that this evidence corroborates her claim as a bisexual woman. The documentary evidence contains the following:\nLetter of support from claimant\u2019s former roommate at the university;Letter of support from claimant\u2019s brother-in-law, who is a [XXX] and helped her escape from prison;Affidavit from claimant\u2019s sister, affirming the events faced by the claimant;Affidavit from [XXX], affirming her relationship with the claimant and the events faced by them in Uganda;Claimant\u2019s marriage certificate;Claimant\u2019s proof of enrollment at the [XXX] University;Letter of support from Centre for Newcomers\u2019 in Canada, supporting the claimant as a member of the LGBTQ community;Letter from [XXX] Church in Canada affirming claimant\u2019s sexual orientation;Claimant\u2019s pictures with [XXX]; andClaimant\u2019s text messages with [XXX].[19] Based on the claimant\u2019s straight-forward and frank testimony, as well as the corroborative evidence discussed above, the panel finds her to be a credible witness and accepts her allegations to be true on a balance of probabilities. In particular, on a balance of probabilities, the panel accepts that she is a bisexual woman, that the police arrested her on [XXX], 2017 following the complaint by her husband to the village elders regarding her sexual activities; that the claimant\u2019s brother-in-law helped her escape from jail; that she went into hiding with the help of [XXX] and her sister, and that the police and her husband are now looking for her. The panel also accepts that the claimant has a subjective fear of returning to Uganda on account of her sexual orientation.\nWell-founded fear of persecution and Risk of harm\n[20] The persecution that the claimant faces has a nexus to one of the five Convention grounds, that of membership in a particular social group, i.e. her sexual orientation as a bisexual, and therefore this claim is assessed under section 96 of the Act.\n[21] The panel finds that the claimant has established that she has a well-founded fear of persecution due to her bisexuality, which is supported by objective evidence. The documentary evidence shows a high level of societal homophobia in Uganda and also that same-sex relationships are illegal in that country. The country documentation is consistent with the claimant\u2019s past experiences and confirms her forward-looking fear of returning to Uganda as discussed below.\nThe objective evidence shows that homosexuality is a crime in Uganda.[4] Section 145 and 146 of the Ugandan Penal Code specify that any person acting against the order of nature and committing unnatural offences shall be imprisoned from seven years to life. Section 148 regarding indecent practices states that:\n[22] Any person who, whether in public or in private, commits any act of gross indecency with another person or procures another person to commit any act of gross indecency with him or her or attempts to procure the commission of any such act by any person with himself or herself or with another person, whether in public or in private, commits an offence and is liable to imprisonment for seven years.[5]\n[23] Uganda\u2019s openly hostile rhetoric has aggravated discrimination and violence against members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) community. Several cases of people subjected to forced anal examinations to prove engagement in proscribed\nconsensual same-sex acts have been documented.[6]\nStatements by Ugandan officials have further fueled the sentiment of the public and authorities against the LGBTI community.[7]\nUganda\u2019s President, Yoweri Museveni, 2017: \u201cAfricans here, we know a few people who are \u2018rumoured\u2019 to be homosexuals, even in history we had some few being rumoured, but you cannot stand up here and say \u201cI am a homosexual.\u201d People will not like it. So whenever we talk to our partners in other parts of the world [we say]: \u201cplease that\u2019s a private matter, you leave it\u201d. But no, they want to impose it on you\u2026 that I should stand up and say, \u2018oh yeah, homosexuals, oh yeah.\u2019\u201d\nMinister of Health for General Duties Sarah Opendi, 2017: \u201cHomosexuality remains an illegally activity, according to our laws and, therefore [\u2026] we cannot be seen doing the opposite [\u2026] the Global Fund money is supposed to help in the fight against malaria and other diseases not buying lubricants for homosexuals.\u201d\nMinister of Ethics and Integrity, Simon Lokodo, 2017 (variously): \u201cHomosexuality is not allowed and completely unacceptable in Uganda. [\u2026] We don\u2019t and can\u2019t allow it. LGBT activities are already banned and criminalised in this country. So popularising it is only committing a crime\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s true I ordered the police to stop and shut down all the gay pride events. No gay gathering and promotion can be allowed in Uganda. We can\u2019t tolerate it at all. [\u2026] We know they are trying to recroit and promote homosexuality secretly. But it\u2019s worse to attempt to stand and exhibit it in public arena. This is totally unacceptable. Never in Uganda.\u201d[8]\nAmnesty International, in its Human Rights Review of 2019 in Uganda noted that:\nIn May, police acting on orders from the Minister of Ethics and Integrity raided and stopped an event organized by NGOs, Chapter Four Uganda and Sexual Minorities Uganda, to commemorate the International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia. Between July and October four LGBTI people were killed in the wake of heightened anti-LGBTI sentiments being expressed by political leaders. Those killed included Brian Wassa, a gay paralegal who died on 5 October of a brain hemorrhage as a result of head injuries from an attack by unknown assailants the previous day at his home in Jinja town in the Eastern region. Uganda investigative authorities have not publicly commented on the killing. A transwoman from Gomba district, and a gay man from Kayunga district (both in the Central region) were also killed in attacks by unidentified assailants. In October, the police arrested 16 LGBTI activists and subjected them to forced anal examinations after the Ethics and Integrity Minister announced plans to introduce the death penalty for consensual same-sex sexual activity which is already punishable by life imprisonment. In November, the police charged 67 out of 125 people, arrested at a bar popular with LGBTI people, with \u201ccommon nuisance\u201d, punishable by imprisonment of up to one year. Their court case was ongoing at the end of the year, and they were required to report to the police each week for their bail conditions to be reviewed.[9]\n[24] Human Rights Awareness and Promotion Forum (HRAPF),[10] in its report on human rights abuses and violations against the LGBTI community, notes that:\nUganda\u2019s laws and policies do not specifically protect LGBT persons against violations within the criminal justice system,There is a trend towards human rights-based detention and imprisonment practices embraced by both the police and the prisons,LGBT persons in police detention suffer violations attributable mainly to their sexual orientation, andLGBT persons in prison face discrimination and abuse of their dignity.[25] Therefore, based on all the evidence before it, the panel finds that the claimant faces more than a mere possibility of persecution at the hands of state and non-state actors in Uganda by way of her membership in a particular social group, namely a bisexual person. Her fears of persecution in her country are indeed well-founded.\nState protection and Internal flight alternative (IFA)\n[26] The panel finds that state protection would not be reasonably forthcoming to the claimant as one of the agents of persecution is the state. The laws prohibiting homosexuality apply throughout the country and so do the laws that fail to protect homosexuals from discrimination and persecution. Therefore, the panel finds that the presumption of state protection has been rebutted.\n[27] The country condition documents indicate that the high level of discrimination against homosexuals exists throughout the country. As such, the panel finds that there is no viable IFA available to the claimant in this case in Uganda\nCONCLUSION\n[28] Based on the analysis above, the panel concludes that the claimant is a Convention refugee as per section 96 of the Act. Accordingly, her claim is accepted.\n[1] Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n[2] Exhibit 2.\n[3] Exhibit 4.\n[4] Exhibit 3, National Documentation Package (NDP), Uganda, September 30, 2020, Item 6.2.\n[5] Exhibit 3, NDP, Item 6.2.\n[6] Ibid.\n[7] Ibid.\n[8] Ibid.\n[9] Exhibit 3, NDP, Item 2.2.\n[10] Exhibit 3, NDP, Item 6.5.\n\n",

The Minister declined to intervene. The claimant could be excluded under either Article 1F(a) or Article 1F(c) if he committed crimes of terrorism or was complicit in crimes of terrorism.\n[3] The claimant provided an Egyptian government court decree and orders, issued December 10, 2017 and April 26, 2018, in which the Muslim Brotherhood (MB) is listed as a terrorist organization and he is listed, among many other people, by name as a terrorist (Exhibit 4). While there are many allegations made by the government against the people named on this list, including references to terrorist schemes, there is no evidence to support the conclusion of the court on whatever evidence it may have collected.\n[4] I considered the claimants credibility, discussed later in my analysis, and found him to be a credible witness. He denied any involvement with the MB or any other terrorist organization. He testified that \u201cI wasn\u2019t a member of any of the MB nor any other organization, however, I was happy with the change\u201d and explained that he supported people who he believed were good candidates. The claimant testified that he did not contribute financially either to the revolution or to the MB.\n[5] The claimant also stated that anybody who supported the revolution was considered a terrorist by the current government. Objective country documentary evidence supports his statement. According to National Documentation Package (NDP) 2.7[2] the government has repressed a \u201cwide range of Egyptians whose complicity in terrorist activities is highly questionable\u201d. The state\u2019s war on terror has \u201clargely been a pretext to legitimize the ousting of the Muslim Brotherhood\u2019s former hold on the reins of government and to solidify the position of the post-coup leadership by purging real and imagined followers of the organization\u201d.\n[6] There is no evidence before me that the claimant ever committed crimes of terrorism, that he was a member of the MB or any other alleged terrorist organization, or that he was complicit in any alleged crimes of terrorism. Therefore, I am satisfied that the issue of exclusion under either 1F(a) or 1F(c) does not apply in this case.\nALLEGATIONS\n[7] The claimant\u2019s allegations are set out in his Basis of Claim Form and in his testimony. The following is a brief summary;\n[8] The claimant fears persecution by the Egyptian government on the basis of his real and imputed political opinion opposing the current regime.\nDETERMINATION\n[9] I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee as he has established a well-founded fear of persecution based on a Convention ground, namely, real and imputed political opinion.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[10] I find that the claimant\u2019s identity as a national of Egypt is established by his testimony and supporting documentation filed including a certified true copy of his passport in Exhibit 1.\nCredibility\n[11] The presumption before me is that the claimant\u2019s testimony is true; however; this can be rebutted in appropriate circumstances, such as inconsistencies, contradictions, omissions and undetailed testimony.\n[12] The claimant provided detailed testimony with respect to his background, the origins of his political opinion and support for civilian as opposed to military governments dating to the revolution of 1952, when he was seven years old. He dearly and consistently stated that he believes in civilian run, democratic governments that support human rights.\n[13] There were no relevant inconsistencies in the claimant\u2019s testimony or contradictions between his testimony and the other evidence before me. He did not appear to embellish his description of events and actions, even when it might have appeared favourable to his claim. I found the claimant to be a credible witness and therefore believe what he alleged in support of his claim.\nNexus (96)\/grounds (97(1))\n[14] I find that the persecution the claimant faces has a nexus to one of the five convention grounds, that of political opinion, both real and imputed, and therefore this claim will be assessed under S 96.\nWeil founded fear\n[15] In order to be considered a Convention Refugee a claimant must demonstrate that they have a well-founded fear of persecution which includes both a subjective fear and an objective basis for that fear.\n[16] Based on the claimant\u2019s testimony and supporting documents and the country condition documents I find that that he has a well-founded fear of persecution for the following reasons:\nSubjective Fear\n[17] The claimant is an [XXX], and he founded his [XXX] in his hometown in 1986. He supported the 2011 revolution in Egypt, which he stated arose when people opposed police brutality, corruption, and the lack of freedom and human rights.\n[18] The claimant described his support for civilian rule, and the hope that he had after the 2011 revolution and subsequent democratic election in June of 2012 that installed Dr. Morsi as\nleader. Although he was not an activist, as the [XXX] of a [XXX] in his hometown, he was a\nrespected [XXX] who shared his opinion freely with others.\n[19] The claimant said that the former government continued to interfere with the Morsi government and in June of 2013 it staged a military coup. Under the new regime anyone suspected of supporting the 2011 revolution and elections of 2012 came under scrutiny. The claimant\u2019s [XXX] was targeted and forcibly taken over by the new regime in 2014. On [XXX] 2015, fearing for his safety and hoping that over time things would calm down so that he could return, he left Egypt to live with various family members around the world.\n[20] Tired, and running out of funds he returned to Egypt after [XXX] months on [XXX], 2017. However, on [XXX], 2017 he learned that he was being accused of being a terrorist in a court decree. He left Egypt the next day and never returned.\n[21] The claimant stayed with various family members on visitor\u2019s visas in Malaysia, Saudi Arabia and the USA. He was living with his son in the USA in 2019 when he attempted to renew his Egyptian passport which was due to expire in [XXX] 2020. He paid the fee and submitted his application and waited four months only to be informed by Egyptian authorities that his passport would not be renewed. Fearing he was soon to be abroad with an expired passport and that his life was in danger if he was returned to Egypt, he decided to claim asylum. Having read President Trump\u2019s tweets in support of Al Sisi, he feared claiming asylum in the USA. He had a daughter in Canada, and after discussion with his family he crossed into Canada in [XXX] of 2019 to claim asylum.\n[22] I find that through his actions, his testimony, and in light of the country condition documents discussed below, the claimant has adduced sufficient credible evidence to establish that he has a subjective fear of persecution in Egypt\nObjective Basis\n[23] The US Department of State reports that there are significant human rights issues in Egypt including unlawful or arbitrary killings, forced disappearances, torture, harsh and life\u00ad threatening prison conditions, political prisoners, the worst forms of restrictions on free expression, as well as substantial inference with peaceful assembly and freedom of association, among other human rights issues. Furthermore, the government\u2019s lack of support for the investigation and prosecution of human rights abuses contributed to a culture of impunity.[3]\n[24] The Egyptian government targets those they perceive as opponents. Since the overthrow of Morsi, hundreds of MB members and supporters have been put on trial and given harsh sentences. Human Rights Watch has repeatedly criticized the lack of fair trials. As of 2016, as many as 40,000 people were detained for political reasons, most of them for real or suspected links to the MB.[4]\n[25] The country documents show that this mistreatment of real as well as perceived opposition supporters has continued. NDP 2.2 states that the authorities resorted to a range of repressive measures against protesters and perceived dissidents, including enforced disappearance, mass arrests, torture and other ill-treatment, excessive use of force and severe probation measures, particularly after protests against the President on 20 September [2019]. Constitutional amendments expanded the role of military courts in prosecuting civilians and undermined the independence of the judiciary.[5]\n[26] The mistreatment that both real and perceived opponents to the regime risk rises, in my opinion, to the level of persecution.\n[27] I am satisfied that the claimant, who clearly and repeatedly expressed his support for democracy and human rights and condemned the military coup, holds a genuine political opinion against the current regime. I am satisfied that the authorities perceive him as having a political opinion in opposition to them, and that this is reflected in their inclusion of the claimant on a list of terrorists in the court documents in Exhibit 4.\n[28] Based on all of the evidence before me, I find that the claimant would face a serious possibility of persecution by the state if he were to return to Egypt.\nState Protection\n[29] Except in situations where the state is in complete breakdown, states must be presumed capable of protecting their citizens.\n[30] In this case, the agent of persecution is the state, and the persecution the claimant would face if returned to Egypt is at the hands of the authorities. Accordingly, I find there is no state protection available to the claimant.\nInternal flight alternative (IFA)\n[31] Internal flight alternative arises when a claimant, who otherwise meets all the elements of the definition of a Convention refugee in his or her home area of the country, nevertheless is not a Convention refugee person in need of protection because the person can live safely elsewhere in that country.\n[32] The test for a viable IFA is two-pronged:\n[33] The Board must be satisfied on a balance of probabilities that\nThe claimants would not face a serious possibility of persecution (section 96) or be subjected personally to a danger of torture, or a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment (section 97) in the part of the country to which the panel finds an IFA exists, andConditions in the part of the country considered to be an IFA must be such that it would not be unreasonable, in all the circumstances, including those particular to the claimant, for him or her to seek refuge there.[6]First prong\n[34] The state of Egypt is the agent of harm, and it is in control of all its territories. Therefore, I find that the claimant faces a serious possibility of persecution throughout the entire country. I find there is no IFA for the claimant in Egypt\nCONCLUSION\n[35] I find that there is a serious possibility that the claimant would be persecuted upon his return to Egypt due to his real and imputed political opinion.\n[36] Based on the totality of the evidence, I conclude that the claimant is a convention refugee. Accordingly, I accept his claim.\n[1] Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n[2] Exhibit 3, National Documentation Package, Egypt, 30 October 2020, tab 2.7: Egypt\u2019s failing \u201cWar on Terror\u201d.\nHeinrich-Boll-Stiftung.

Jackson\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Tina Hlimi\nCountry: Haiti\nRPD Number: TB8-25759\nAssociated RPD Number(s):\nATIP Number: A-2021-00800\nATIP Pages: 000008-000010\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: So, I am just going to read you your Decision now. It is a positive decision. So, if everybody could just mute their microphone, I am going to read it to you, okay?\n[2] I have considered your testimony and the other evidence in the case, and I am ready to render my Decision orally. These are the reasons for the Decision in the claim of [XXX], who claims to be a Citizen of Haiti and is claiming refugee protection pursuant to 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act or IRPA or the Act.\n[3] You alleged that in your role in the [XXX] you made some enemies. There were two individuals who were for revenge upon you. One of them wishes to personally harm you, and the other has hired a gang to kill you. You fear you will be killed should you return to Haiti. I find on a balance of probabilities that you would be subjected personally to a risk to your life should you return to Haiti for the following reasons:\n[4] I find that your identity as the national of Haiti is established by the documents provided, including copies of your passport and birth certificate.\n[5] To establish your status as a Convention Refugee or as a person in need of protection, you had to show that there was a serious possibility that you will be persecuted or that you will be subjected on a balance of probabilities to a risk to life or of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or danger of torture if you move to Haiti. You stated that you fear being killed because of the vendetta that (inaudible spot \u2013 00:02:12) have against you because of (inaudible spot \u2013 00:02:15) arrest and suspension among other matters of internal church politics.\n[6] Refugee protection claims involving vendettas usually follow under subsection 97(1) of the Act, and since there is no nexus that I can mention. I therefore analyzed your Refugee Protection Claim under Section 97(1)(b) of the Act, and that is whether you would be personally subjected to a risk to your life or a cruel and unusual treatment or punishment should you return to Haiti.\n[7] I find that the evidence presented in support of your allegations does establish a likelihood on a balance of probabilities of a risk to your life. I find you to be a credible witness and therefore believe what you have alleged in support of your claim. You testified in a straightforward manner, and you were able to spontaneously provide consistent testimony, as well as details of the many events in your narrative. You also provided evidence from credible sources which corroborates your allegations regarding what happened to you in Haiti. Your claim was very well documented. There is objective support for your allegations. Item 7.1 of the National Documentation Package describes the security situation in Haiti as bad, worrisome, precarious and unpredictable. Organized crime exists throughout the country, and there is a high level of crime and murder, kidnappings for ransom money or (inaudible spot \u2013 00:03:44). Violent crime is primarily perpetrated by gangs in Haiti as well. I find that there is clear and convincing evidence before me that the state is unable to provide you with adequate protection. Section 4.2 of the National Documentation Package states that democracy is precarious in the country. 2.1 states that the perception of widespread impunity discourages some witnesses from testifying at trials. These factors will impact your ability to receive any protection from the state. Item 7.1 states that the police force does not have sufficient capacity to carry out its missions, on the other hands it is also reported that the forces demonstrated an increased capacity in the planning and execution of complex operations including the securing of elections and crowd control while simultaneously performing routine tasks in combatting crime and more effectively maintaining the public order. Nevertheless, sources report that Haiti\u2019s police force is too small given the crime rate.\n[8] Sources also reports that the police force lacks resources and means and doubts have repeatedly been raised as to whether the National Police Force is able to guarantee the security needed to protect Citizens, enforce the law and promote political stability. Haiti\u2019s judicial system is also under resourced and inefficient and is burdened by a large backlog of cases. Bribery is common at all levels of the judicial system. So, taking all of that into consideration I do not find that there is going to be a reasonable state protection for you and there is prior convincing evidence that the state is unable to provide you with adequate protection in your particular circumstances from the people who are after you.\n[9] I have considered whether a viable Internal Flight Alternative exists for you, and I find that there are no other parts of the country where you would not face a risk to your life. Haiti is a very small country, and you have been located more than once when you attempted to relocate within the country.\n[10] Based on this analysis, I conclude that you are a person in need of protection, and accordingly I accept your claim.\n[11] So that is the end of your hearing. Do you have any questions?\n[12] You have to unmute if you have a question.\n[13] CLAIMANT: I don\u2019t have question.\n[14] MEMBER: Okay. Well that\u2019s it then.\n[15] COUNSEL: Okay. Thank you.\n[16] MEMBER: Thanks everybody. Thank you, Mr. Interpreter.\n[17] INTERPRETER: Okay. Thank you, Madam Member.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n",

The following is a brief synopsis of the allegations put forth by the claimant in his Basis of Claim form in Exhibit 2. He opposed changes to the Constitution in 2018 through consultations conducted by the local neighborhood CDR, which is the Commi-, Committee for Defense of Revolution. The claimant was confronted in his home by the CDR executives in [XXX] 2018 and accused of being anti-government. After a few days, he along with his family was questioned by two officers of the DSC which is the Department of Security. He felt he was being scrutinized and watched closely by his neighbors and was scared of being persecuted. The claimant traveled to Canada on a business trip in [XXX] 2019 and filed for protection.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[3] The claimant\u2019s identity as a national of Cuba is established by way a certified copy of his Cuban passport on file in Exhibit 1.\nNexus\n[4] In rendering this decision, the Panel has considered the claimant\u2019s testimony and documentary evidental-, evidence on file. For a claimant to be considered a Convention refugee, the well-founded fear of persecution must be by reason one or more of the five grounds which are race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. In this case, the evidence before the Panel is that the claimant is wanted by the Cuban authorities due to his opposition to some of the Constitutional changes affected in his country. The Panel finds, in this case, that the claimant has established a Nexus to a Convention ground, political opinion. Accordingly, the Panel has assessed this claim under Section 96 of the Act and not under Section 97.\nCredibility\n[5] When a claimant swears to the truthfulness of certain facts, there is a presumption that what he or she is saying is true unless there are reasons to doubt it. Secondly, when assessing credibility, the Panel is entitled to rely on rationality and common sense. The determination as to whether a claimant\u2019s evidence is credible is to be made on a balance of probabilities. At the hearing, the claimant\u2019s testimony was direct, thoughtful, and earnest. He testified in a very detailed and forthright manner, there were no inconsistencies in his testimony, and he clearly identified the agent of harm as being the government of Cuba. The claimant made no attempts at embellishment. He explained the provisions of Articles 31 and 135 of the Cuban Constitution and why he opposed them. Article 31 deals with issues related to workers and their remuneration and Article 135 deals with the election of state officials such as governors. He asked for [XXX] and did not agree with how [XXX]. The claimant stated that when he-, when the changes were opposed and everyone was told that-, sorry-, the claimant stated when the changes were proposed and everyone was told that consultations were being held to seek citizens\u2019 opinions, he thought that the government was being earnest in bringing about positive change in his country. However, when he was confronted by the executives of the CDR and then visited by DSC officers, who threatened him with being against the government of Cuba, he started to fear for his life. He was excluded from any further CDR meetings and his children were excluded from participating in sports and extracurricular activities at the school.\n[6] The claimant stated that he will be immediately arrested upon his return to Cuba for two reasons. His political opinion and abandonment of his training in Canada since he is an employee of the government of Cuba. He quoted Article 135 of the Cuban Constitution which states that any employee who abandons his mission in a foreign country and does not return to Cuba incurs a penalty of deprivation of liberty for three to eight years. The claimant provided an uncertified translated copy of this provision to the Panel during the hearing, which was then translated on record from Spanish to English. The Panel accepts this document and claimant\u2019s argument as credible. The claimant has also provided testimonies from his family and a friend as to the events he faced prior to leaving Cuba. Based on the claimant\u2019s consistent and forthright testimony and the corroborative evidence, the Panel finds him to be a credible witness and accepts his allegations to be true on a balance of probabilities.\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution and Risk of Harm\n[7] The United States Department of State as per NDP Item 2.1 states that Cuba is an authoritarian State. Human rights issues included reports of unlawful and ar-, arbitrary killing by police, torture of political dissents, detainees and prisoners by security forces, harsh and life-threatening prison conditions, arbitrary arrest and detention, holding of political prisoners, and arbitrary or unlawful interference with privacy. The law allows the maximum four-year preventative detention of individuals not charged with an actual crime with a subjective determination of pre-criminal dangerousness, defined as the special proclivity of a person to commit crimes, demonstrated by conduct in many first contradiction of so-, so-, of societal norms. Mostly used as a tool to control anti-social behaviors such as substance abuse or prostitution, authorities also used such a detention to silent peaceful political opponents. Multiple domestic human rights organizations published lists of persons they considered political prisoners. Individuals appearing on these lists remained imprisoned under the pre-criminal dangerousness provision of the law. The Ministry of Interior employed a system of informants and neighborhood committees, known as CDRs, to monitor government opponents and report on their activities.\n[8] Human Rights Watch as per NDP Item 2.4 states that the Cuban government continues to employ arbitrary detention to harass and intimidate critics, independent activists, political opponents, and others. Detention is often used pre-emptively to prevent people from participating in peaceful marches or meetings to discuss politics. Detainees are often beaten, threatened and held incommunicado for hours or days. Cubans who criticize the government continued to face the threat of criminal prosecution. They do not benefit from due process guarantees such as the right to fair and public hearings by a competent and impartial tribunal. In practice, codes are subordinate to the executive and legislative branches denying meaningful judicial independence. Freedom House, as per NDP Item 2.6, also reports that political parties other than the PCC are illegal in Cuba. Political defense is-, dis-, sorry-, political dissent is a punishable offense and dissidents are systematically harassed, detained, physically assaulted, and frequently imprisoned for minor infractions. As noted, the claimant has been questioned by the State authorities in Cuba due to his political disagreement over constitutional changes. He and his family were under watch by the neighbors through the neighborhood CDR. This was followed by questioning by executives of the CDR and officials of the DSC. He is now being constantly sought after in his country, the claimant fears persecution due to his political opinion. Based on the objective evidence as discussed, the Panel agrees that his fear of returning to Cuba is indeed well-founded.\nState Protection and Internal Flight Alternative\n[9] State protection would not be forthcoming in this particular case as it is the State of Cuba that seeks to target the claimant. He has been threatened and questioned by the executive\u2019s office CDR and the DSC officers. His family is being harassed and questioned about his whereabouts. The Panel finds that it would be objectively unreasonable in these circumstances for the claimant to have or to seek the protection of the very authorities that seek to persecute him. Since adequate state protection is not available to the claimant, the Panel finds that there is no internal flight alternative available to him, as the Cuban authorities are in control of the entire territory of the country.\nDetermination and Conclusion\n[10] For the foregoing reasons, the Panel finds that the claimant is a Convention refugee as per Section 97-, 96 of the Act and accepts his claim.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n",

        "unofficial_text":"2020 RLLR 59\n\nCitation: 2020 RLLR 59\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: October 1, 2020\nPanel: Kevin Wiener\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Denis Onek Olwedo\nCountry: Uganda\nRPD Number: TB8-20429\nAssociated RPD Number(s):\nATIP Number: A-2021-00800\nATIP Pages: 000001-000003\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: This is the decision in the claim for refugee protection of [XXX]. Sir, you are claiming to be a citizen of Uganda and your claiming refugee protection in Canada pursuant to sub-Sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[2] I considered your testimony today and I\u2019ve considered the other evidence you provided, and I am ready to render a decision, I\u2019ve decided to accept your claim. In making my decision I have considered the Chairpersons Guideline on persons with diverse sexual orientation and gender identity and expression. As I said, my determination today is that you are a Convention refugee on the grounds of your sexual orientation, that is that you are a gay male.\n[3] In your claim you\u2019ve alleged the following, that you are a citizen of Uganda, and that you are being stalked by the Ugandan police after your partner\u2019 s wife discovered the two of you together. You allege that if you return to Uganda you will face arrest and social persecution because of your sexual orientation.\n[4] Now there is a number of things I have to look at in your claim but first there\u2019s your identity, who you are and what your country you\u2019re a citizen of. In this case I find your identity has been established, your passport is seized by the Canada Border Services Agency and a copy of that passport was provided into evidence. In addition, you\u2019ve also provided other documents, including your national ID card and your birth certificate. I find these documents establish on the balance of probabilities who you are and that you are a citizen of Uganda.\n[5] The next issue in a claim is Nexus, that is whether the harm you fear falls into one of the five categories under refugee Convention. In this case the applicable category is one called particular social group and that is because you are a gay man and that something integral to your identity and it\u2019s out of your control. That makes you a member of a particular social group and therefore any persecution you may face because of your membership in that group falls under Section 96 of the Act.\n[6] The next issue is credibility. In any claim I have to determine whether the person making the claim is telling the truth. In this case I found that you are a credible witness and I believe what was in your oral testimony and your Basis of Claim form. Now in any claim when a claimant swears they\u2019re telling the truth that starts a presumption that they are telling the truth and that can only be rebutted if there are inconsistencies in their testimony or other things that make me believe that what they are saying is not the truth. In this case I have no reason to believe that you are telling me anything other than the truth, your testimony today was consistent with what was in the Basis of your Claim. But I also find that you were able to go into a number of details outside of your Basis of Claim, including about your relationship with [XXX], your relationship with [XXX] what things were like at school. I found particularly compelling your testimony about your conversation with your mother at the hospital and how she said that you had brought shame to her and how that made you feel. You know that was the detail in your Basis of Claim, but you were able to answer that question very spontaneously, and I found that your testimony in that regard was credible. There was only one significant inconsistency in the hearing today and that was as I mentioned in the hearing when you were interviewed by Dr. [XXX], you gave dates for when you first realized you were gay and your first experience of sexual-, of consensual sex that were different than the dates in your testimony and your Basis of Claim. When I asked you about that you said that, that interview was shortly after you came to Canada and you were under a lot of stress and that\u2019s why you got that answer wrong when that interview with Mr\u00ad-, Dr. [XXX]. However, I note your testimony in this area was consistent between your Basis of Claim and your testimony today and ultimately, I don \u2018t think this one inconsistency is signif-, is sufficient to show that you are not a credible witness. So, I find that presumption that you\u2019re telling the truth is still in place.\n[7] Your testimony was not the only evidence you provided, you also provided supporting affidavits from three individuals who confirmed various parts of your testimony. I have no credibility concerns about those affidavits, and I find they further prove the same allegations. So ultimately, I accept on the balance of probabilities what you testified to, that you are a gay man and that you are being sought by the Ugandan police and that you fear returning to Uganda because of those facts.\n[8] I also have to determine whether your claim is objectively well-founded. That is there\u2019s objective evidence showing that you are actually at risk in Uganda and there\u2019s a National Documentation Package that forms parts of every decision and that package has documents that are very clear that sexual minorities, including gay men face severe persecution in Uganda. For example, the United States Department of State has issued a human rights report which is Item 2.1 of the National Documentation Package. That report notes that homosexuality is illegal in Uganda and that both society and the authorities routinely perpetrate violence against the LGBT community. I also draw on Item 6.1 which is a report from ORAM, and it talks about the anti-homosexuality laws in Uganda, that while the more restricted anti-homosexuality law was struck down by the courts, homosexuality remains illegal under Uganda\u2019s Penal Code. But the fact that less than a decade ago Uganda was putting in place harsher penalties against homosexuality is to me a strong signal that homosexuality remains widely unacceptable in that country and subject to persecution. That report from ORAM says that no one has yet been convicted for violating the law against homosexuality but that police frequently charge people for violating it. And for me just the fact that you may be arrested and charged for violating this law is itself a form of persecution even if you don\u2019t face a risk of conviction. ln addition, I\u2019ve accepted your personal testimony that you are personally being sought by the Ugandan police and that you personally have been arrested by the Ugandan police. So, when looking at this I have to look forward at your risk if returned to Uganda and the question is, is there a serious possibility that you will face persecution if you return to Uganda. And because I\u2019ve accepted that you are gay and that you were sought by the police, I do find that there is a serious possibility that you will face persecution in Uganda and the reason for that persecution is your sexual orientation.\n[9] There\u2019s two other things that we have to look at in the claim, the first is state protection, whether the government can protect you from any harm. That doesn\u2019t apply to this case because the agent of persecution is itself the State, because of that no state protection can be available to you. The next question is what\u2019s called an internal flight alternative. In order to make a refugee claim, you either have to show that you face persecution everywhere in Uganda or if you face persecution only in some parts that it would be unreasonable to move somewhere else in Uganda. In this case again, the agent of persecution is the government of Uganda, they control the entire country and therefore I find you face a serious possibility of persecution everywhere in Uganda.\n[10] So, in conclusion, when I look at the totality of the evidence, your testimony, the documents in the National Documentation Package, I find that you face a serious possibility of persecution everywhere in Uganda and the State cannot protect you from that persecution; therefore you meet the definition of a Convention refugee under Section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. I therefore accept your claim today sir.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n",

        "unofficial_text":"2020 RLLR 58\n\nCitation: 2020 RLLR 58\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: November 27, 2020\nPanel: Selena Eng\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Richard Addinall\nCountry: Peru\nRPD Number: TB8-18682\nATIP Number: A-2021-00655\nATIP Pages: 000194-000198\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: This is the decision of the claim of the principal claimant [XXX] in file number TB8-l8682. The claimant is a citizen of Peru and is claiming refugee protection pursuant to Section 96 and 97 and the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[2] The facts and evidence alleged in support of the claim are set out in the claimant\u2019s respective Basis of Claim form. In summary, the claimant fears harm in Peru from his ex-partner on the basis of his sexual orientation as a gay man. I have determined that the claimant is a Convention refuge or a person in need of protection pursuant to Section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the IRPA.\n[3] In making this assessment, I have considered all the evidence, including the oral testimonies, the documentary evidence, and counsel\u2019s submissions, and the documentary evidence.\n[4] The claimant arrived in Canada with a fraudulent [XXX] passport. The claimant testified that he paid a [XXX] smuggler for the documents to come to Canada, as it was easier to go through [XXX] than to apply for a [inaudible]. The claimant provided a Peru issued national identification card to verify his Peruvian identity when he entered Canada. I find the claimant\u2019s testimony regarding his identity and how he was able to come to Canada to be credible. I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant\u2019s identity was established by the certified true copy of his Peru issued national identification card and accepts that the claimant is a citizen of Peru.\n[5] Regarding credibility, in the assessment of this claim, I have taken into consideration the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline that deals with the assessment of claims from persons who are members of the LGBTQI community. They are also referred to as the SOGIE Guidelines. I find that the claimant testified in a straightforward fashion with regards to the central elements of the claim. I find that the claimant\u2019s overall testimony was credible.\n[6] The claimant testified about identifying and living as a gay man in Peru. The claimant testified about meeting his ex-partner in [XXX] 2017, moving in together in [XXX] 2017, and about his partner becoming increasingly jealous, possessive and accusing him with being with other men, as well as beating him, especially when he was drunk. I also heard testimony regarding the partner\u2019s harassment of the claimant at his workplace [XXX], and that a restraining order was obtained, that did not deter the ex\u00ad partner from finding him at the [XXX].\n[7] The claimant testified about an incident on [XXX] 2018, when his ex-partner threw a stone at his head, opening up his skin, along with breaking a bottle over the head and also kicking and punching the claimant while threatening his life. The claimant testified about going to the hospital and obtaining treatment. He also filed a police report at the station and indicated the police made fun of him for deciding to become gay and told him to go back to his husband and cook for him. The claimant testified about the police telling him that they would investigate, but the claimant did not hear back from police despite following up a week later. The claimant testified about forcing his ex-partner to leave his apartment for good, around [XXX] 2018. The claimant testified about an incident where he was waiting at a bus stop on [XXX] 2018, when he was kidnapped by four men, including his ex-partner. The claimant was beaten, cut, and raped by his ex-partner and the men. The claimant testified that he woke up in a hospital and was advised that- by a nurse -that a lady had found him and brought him there. The claimant remained in hospital for two days, and did not return to his place of rental or his apartment unit when he left and, instead, he went to the home of the [XXX], where he worked, for help.\n[8] The claimant also testified about his ex-partner having many friends in the police force and being afraid to go to police.\n[9] The claimant testified that he was estranged from father and other family members, and that is the reason why he went to the couple that [XXX] for help. The claimant testified they assisted him with obtaining money and helping him to go to [XXX] to come to Canada, where he was told by his other gay friends that he could obtain protection.\n[10] The claimant went to [XXX] to obtain his travel documents before arriving in Canada to make a refugee claim.\n[11] Regarding the claimant\u2019s supporting documents, he has provided several of them that are on file. A police report dated [XXX] 2018, noted that the claimant filed a corn plaint against his ex-partner, attacking him when he attempted to terminate their relationship due to the increase psychological and physical abuse. The report states that the claimant had punches to the face and kicks, a bottle being broken over his head, as well as threats from the ex-partner that he was going to kill him. The report noted that the claimant was brought to the hospital by ambulance. There was also a medical report indicating that the claimant was treated in an emergency unit for a [XXX], on [XXX] 2018. Another medical report notes that the claimant was treated on [XXX] 2018, for [XXX]. The claimant also provided letters from friends in Peru who attested to witnessing verbal and physical abuse against the claimant by his ex-partner. I find that the reports corroborate the claimant\u2019s testimony regarding the threats and attacks by his ex-partner, and the medical treatment he received. I find that the claimant was attacked on more than one occasion and required medical treatment. I find that the claimant\u2019s concerns were not addressed by police, and that the claimant has established his subjective fear of persecution in Peru.\n[12] Regarding the claimant\u2019s identity as a gay man, I note that he had a daughter with a woman in Peru. The claimant testified he was very young when he had sex with woman one time, when they were both drinking and celebrating the end of school. The claimant testified he did not find out about his daughter until she was one-years old and has not had any contact with them since his daughter was four. The claimant testified about being attracted to men and only in relationships with men. The claimant provided a [XXX] report from a hospital, dated [XXX] 2018, which indicates he was experiencing [XXX], and [XXX] to his sexual orientation. The report notes that the claimant was receiving [XXX]. The claimant also provided letters from friends from Peru and Canada that speak to his sexual orientation as a gay man. The claimant also had newcomer orientation training record, dated [XXX] 2018, for the 519 Organization in Toronto, dedicated to advocacy inclusion for the LGBTQ communities in Toronto. I find that the claimant testified in a credible and straightforward manner, and accepts the claimant\u2019s explanation as to why he had sexual relations with a woman which resulted in the birth of a daughter, despite identifying as a gay man and being attracted to men. I find that the claimant has established on a balance of probabilities that he is a gay man and that he has a subjective fear from his ex-partner in Peru.\n[13] Regarding the claimant\u2019 s failure to claim refugee status in [XXX], the claimant was asked why he didn\u2019t want to apply for refugee or more permanent status there. The claimant testified that it was his goal to come to Canada because he heard it was more friendly to the LGBTQI community, and that he only entered [XXX] to obtain the documents to come to Canada. Based on the evidence before me, I find that the claimant did not have permanent status in [XXX] and was only present in [XXX] as a transit to Canada. I do not find that the claimant\u2019 s lack of applying for refugee status in [XXX] undermines the credibility of his claim. Regarding the objective basis and country conditions in Peru, I find that there is general, widespread corruption within the police and judiciary in Peru. The 2020 Freedom in the World report for Peru indicates that government corruption remains a critical problem in the country. The law enforcement authorities frequently investigate and persecute corruption allegations. On the issue of the application of the rule of law, the report found that the judiciary is perceived as one of the most corrupt institutions in the country. The report also found that constitutional guarantees of due process are also unevenly upheld.\n[14] With regards to country condition for LGBTI, or lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex individuals, the United States Department of State\u2019s Country Report on Human Rights Practices for 2019 for Peru, or the D-O-S report, DOS report, indicates that the law in Peru recognizes the right of individuals to file legal claims of discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender-identity. However, the DOS report noted that the government officials, non-government organizations, or NGOs, journalists and civil society leaders, reported widespread official and societal discrimination against the LGBTI persons in employment, housing, education and healthcare, based on sexual orientation or gender-identity. NGOs also reported an increase in forced or coerced conversion therapy in Peru.\n[15] Increasing LGBTI rights in Peru is also moving slowly. In the National Report 2017 submitted to the Human Rights Council for Peru, it was noted that the National Human Rights Plan for 2017 to 2021 was to include special protections to be included for LGBTI persons. It was noted that the national human rights coordinator that ail mention of protection on the grounds of sexual orientation and gender-identity have been removed from Peru\u2019s National Plan for 2014 to 2016, despite LGBTI groups having participated in its preparation. The document notes that the new National Human Rights Plan for 2017 to 2020 was under consultation and there continued to be challenges with the coordination, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of plans.\n[16] The US DOS report also further indicates that NGOs continue to report that law enforcement authorities repeatedly fail to protect and often even violated the rights of LGBTI citizens. The United Nations Human Rights Council Compilation on Peru further cited concerns at reports of harassment and violent attacks, some of which had resulted in death against the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community, by members of the national police, armed forces, municipal security patrols and prison officials. I find that there is objective basis for the claimant\u2019s fear of his ex-partner as an individual belonging to the LGBTI community, and that he has a well-founded fear of persecution in Peru.\n[17] Regarding state protection, there is a presumption that countries are capable of protecting their citizens. The claimant bears a legal burden of rebutting the presumption that adequate state protection exists by educing clear and convincing evidence which satisfies on a balance of probabilities. I\u2019ve reviewed the country conditions set out in the National Documentation Package and find that the claimant has rebutted the presumption of state protection with the evidence provided.\n[18] I find that, in the claimant\u2019s circumstances, the state has not been willing or able to protect him. I find that the claimant\u2019s ex-partner attacked the claimant causing injury that required hospital care. Despite the attack, I heard evidence that police did not take the claimant\u2019 s complaint seriously, instead making fun of the claimant for being gay. I find that the police in this case had the information of the identity of the perpetrator, but nothing was done, even after the claimant followed up with police. The claimant\u2019s ex-partner was not arrested or charged for the attack or the death threats against the claimant. I also heard evidence of the claimant\u2019s ex-partner being able to continue to move freely in Peru. Subsequently, the claimant was attacked, threatened, and raped by his ex-partner and other men. I find that, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant\u2019s ex-partner has continued interest in the claimant and would continue to seek him out, should the claimant return to Peru. Based on the documentary evidence, there has been a Jack of effective implementation of protection for LGBTI individuals in Peru. I find that the documentation does not indicate protections to be adequate at the operational level for LGBTI individuals. I do not find the claimant\u2019s return to Peru would allow him to obtain justice against his ex-partner, or the claimant would receive further protections or assistance from police, should he continue to face threats or attacks. The assumption that the claimant will be able to receive meaningful protection in Peru from the state is contradicted by the country conditions evidence. I am satisfied that the claimant has rebutted the presumption of state protection.\n[19] Regarding internal flight alternative, the question of whether an internal flight alternative exists is an integral part of the Convention refugee definition. It arises when a claimant, who otherwise meets all elements of the Convention refugee definition in his or her home area of the country, nevertheless, is not a Convention refugee because a person has an IFA elsewhere in that country. I find that the claimant\u2019s ex\u00ad partner is a violent person who has demonstrated continued interest in the claimant after their breakup, going so far as to kidnap him with additional friends to attack him, after they broke up. I also find the claimant testimony regarding his ex-partner\u2019s ability to continue moving freely and threatening him in Peru, to be credible and supported by the evidence provided. I find that the claimant, as a gay man, would be vulnerable to persecution throughout Peru where homosexuality is condemned by society and the police. I also heard evidence of the claimant\u2019s ex-partner has friends in the police force, and he would be able to pay bribes to locate the claimant wherever he went in Peru. I find that the issues with receiving protection from the state for LGBTI individuals, who are [inaudible] by police, appears to be present throughout Peru. As the claimant has rebutted the presumption of state protection and because the agent of persecution has shown motivation to continue to track the claimant, I do not find the claimant has a viable internal flight alternative in Peru.\n[20] In conclusion. I find that the claimant has established a serious possibility of persecution in Peru from his ex-partner and based on a Convention ground, namely his sexual orientation as a gay man, and I accept the claim.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n",

        "unofficial_text":"2020 RLLR 57\n\nCitation: 2020 RLLR 57\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: February 24, 2020\nPanel: Deborah Coyne\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Denis Onek Olwedo\nCountry: Kenya\nRPD Number: TB8-17416\nATIP Number: A-2021-00655\nATIP Pages: 000189-000193\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: These are the reasons in decision, for decision in the claim of [XXX] who claims to be a citizen of Kenya and is claiming refugee protection pursuant to Sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. The claimant fears persecution due to her gender and her membership in a particular social group, as a woman facing risk of female genital mut-, mutilation and gender violence.\n[2] The Panel applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 4 Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution in assessing the harm feared by the claimant.\nAllegations\n[3] In her written and oral testimony, the claimant provided a very detailed account of entering into a forced marriage, enduring serious domestic violence, resisting her husband\u2019s insistence that she undergo FGM and ultimately escaping from him and the va-, vigilantes he hired to ensure she complied but not before she was raped and violently assaulted. The police were of no assistance on at least three occasions when she approached them for help. Ultimately, she was able to obtain a TRV and came to Canada seeking refugee protection at the Port of Entry.\nDetermination\n[4] The Panel finds that the claimant is a member of, of a particular social group which is women at risk of gender violence and is therefore a Convention refugee under Section 96.\nANALYSIS\nand Identity\n[5] The Panel was satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the claimant is a citizen of Kenya from the certified copy of her passport on the file.\nCredibility\n[6] The claimant responded to all questions clearly and spontaneously in the English language. The Panel finds the claimant to be a credible witness. And her evidence was corroborated by and is consistent with the documents she submitted that the Panel finds credible. Notably, medical reports, statement of suppor-, statements of support and some photographs.\n[7] The Panel makes the following findings on a balance of probabilities. The claimant was born into the Kisii tribe in Kenya in which FGM is still practiced in young girls and women along with other traditional customs. For example, after her father died, his brother inherited the claimant\u2019s mother as his wife. Her mother was forced to marry her brother-in-law who then insisted that her mother undergo FGM.\n[8] The claimant successfully pursued studies and became [XXX] and her step-father found a way to send her to study [XXX] at the [XXX] from 2008 to 2012. When she returned to Kenya, she started working at the [XXX]. In or about 2013 and 2014, she discovered to her horror that her step-father had promised her in marriage to a man who had secretly funded her university studies in the Philippines.\n[9] A summary of the next traumatizing fours years are set out in persuasive detail in the claimant\u2019s written narrative. The claimant was forced into the marriage in [XXX] 2015, raped brutally by her husband and ordered to undergo FGM. Shortly after the marriage, she reported her spousal rapes and violence to the Nakuru Central Police Station at the suggestion of her doctor. The police mocked her and said that alleging spousal rape was a waste of their time. The FGM was scheduled for [XXX] 2015. The claimant escaped from her husband and the vigilantes he hired to ensure that she underwent FGM. She moved around and worked in different places. For example, Nairobi, Nakuru and then Kibera where she stayed with her aunt. The claimant went to the police again in or about [XXX] 2016 when she was forced to return to her husband but managed to escape again. They told her that resisting FGM was a family matter but that she should go to the Anti-FGM Organization. The claimant went to get help from the Anti-FGM Organization but had to find money to hire a lawyer.\n[10] Among other things, she lived undercover by wearing a burqa in [XXX], about [XXX] kilometres away from Nairobi. In [XXX] 2017, while she was recuperating from an [XXX] she was discovered by the vigilantes, raped and seriously injured. She went to the police. A detailed copy of the report is found in Exhibit 5. And there was also other documents such as the [XXX] dated [XXX] 20th, 2017 and so forth. After this ordeal, she was advised by her friend [XXX] who had witnessed the attack on her by the vigilantes to leave the country and she applied for her T-, TRV. She falsiv-, she falsified the existence of a common-law husband and a child and some other documents to ensure that she was accepted. I also note that there were corroborative affidavits for most of the incidents from her friend [XXX], her aunt [XXX], her mother, [XXX] and another childhood friend. All of these are in Exhibit 5.\n[11] So, on a balance of probabilities the Panel accepts that the claimant has a subjective fear of persecution because of her membership in a personal social group, women at risk of gender violence.\n[12] So, now I\u2019m going to turn to the objective basis. The claimant testified that the traditional practice of FGM is rooted in Kenyan culture and the Kisii tribe. The United States Department of States, State report called the DOS report for 2018 on Kenyan human rights notes that human right issues in the country including the lack of accountability in many cases involving violence against women including rape and FGM.\n[13] Authorities cited domestic violence as a leading cause of preventable and non-accidental death for women during the year. Except in cases of death, police officers generally refrain from investigating domestic violence which they consider a private matter. With specific reference to FGM, the DOS report indicates and this is in, oh this is in still in 2.1, the law makes it illegal to practice FGM, procure the services of someone who practices FGM or send a person out of the country to undergo the procedure. The law also makes it illegal to make derogatory remarks about a woman who has not undergone FGM.\n[14] Government officials often participated in public awareness programs to prevent the pra-, the practice. Nevertheless, individuals practiced FGM widely particularly in some rural areas. According to a study by ActionAid Kenya published in October despite the legal prohibition on FGM, mis-supported the practice-, supporting the practice remain deep-rooted in some local cultures. The study concluded approximately 21% of adult woman have undergone-, had undergone the procedure some time in their lives. But the practice was heavily concentrated in a minority of communities.\n[15] The DOS report further states that there were also reports the practice of FGM increasingly occurred underground to avoid prosecution. The May 2018 report entitled Kenya and the Law of FGM which is Exhibit 5.10 states as follows FGM in Kenya continues to be carried out predominantly by traditional circumcizers for 74.9% of girls age 0 to 14. And 83.3% of women aged 15 to 49. There has been some concern over the increasing medicalization of FGM in Kenya. In recent years however, with claims that its risen to as much as 40 per-, 41% in some areas. And that medical professions-, professionals are performing FGM in homes, hospitals or temporary clinics.\n[16] According to the UK Home Office and this is exhibit or, sorry Item 1.4 of the NDP for Kenya, women and girls in Kenya in fear of FGM forma particular social group within the meaning of the refugee Convention. And it further reports that although it is against the law and in decline, FGM continues to be practiced in Kenya among most ethnic groups to varying extents. The report indicates that communities that practice FGM report a variety of social and religious reasons for continuing with it. Deeply-rooted customs linked to social and economic benefits are associated with FGM.\nState Protection\n[17] The agents of persecution in Kenya are the claimant\u2019s husband and his extended family and the vigilantes he hired to pursue the claimant. As noted above, the claimant approached the police with complaints and requested help on at least three occasions and was turned away. An extensive report entitled FGM in Kenya, this is Item 5.3 it\u2019s dated 2016 so it\u2019s actually longer than a sequel to it which is, was done in 2018. However, it, it finds that \u201cWhile there has been progress in both legal and policy frameworks, implementation and enforcement remain a challenge largely due to a lack of resources, difficulties reaching remote rural areas and the limited capacity of law enforcement agencies\u201d.\n[18] This is enforcing the Anti-FGM legislation and, and policies that are technically in place. The report further finds that there have been few prosecutions and low conviction rates across the country. Often even if survivors do report FGM they fail to attend court to give evidence. Finally, the report finds that intimidation and fear help to keep the practice secret and cases unreported.\n[19] Item 2.3 which is the 2018 Freedom of the World report for Kenya indicates that corruption continues to plague national and county governments in Kenya. And State institutions tasked with combating cor-, corruption have been ineffective. Item 2.5 which is the 2017-2018 Amnesty International report indicates that the authorities continue to use legal and administrative measures to restrict the activities of civil society organizations working on human rights and governance.\n[20] And finally, according to the 2019 Human Rights report which is Item 2.2, women are also vulner-, vulnerable to abuse from the State security forces that should be there to protect them. The Watch report, the Human Rights Watch reports further indicates that the Jack of accountability for serious human right violations perpetrated by security forces remains a major concern in 2018.\n[21] So, the Panel finds on a balance of probabilities and in the particular circumstances of this case, that the objective country evidence supports the conclusion that the Kisii tribe and the Kenyan government and security forces are too often complicit in the gender violence experienced by the claimant. The claimant has provided clear and convincing evidence that the State is unable or unwilling to protect her. Accordingly, the claimant has successfully rebutted the presumption of state protection.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[22] The claimant testified that she would be at risk in all regions within Kenya. And that her husband and his vigilantes might have the means and motivation to seek her out wherever she might live and work. The evidence that the Panel found credible indicated that her husband was able to find her on several occasions as she sought to escape him after their marriage. The Panel finds that relocation within Kenya would be unreasonable in the claimant\u2019 s circumstances. And the Panel further finds that there is no viable IFA where the claimant could reside safely.\n[23] So, in conclusion the Panel finds that the claimant is a member of a personal, particular social group which is women at risk of gender violence. And is therefore, a Convention refugee.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n",

Moutafova\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Peter J Wuebbolt\nCountry: Pakistan\nRPD Number: TB8-13720\nAssociated RPD Numbers: TB8-13781, TB8-13786, TB8-13787\nATIP Number: A-2021-00655\nATIP Pages: 000177-000188\nREASONS FOR DECISION\nINTRODUCTION\n[1] [XXX] (father and a principal claimant), his wife [XXX] (mother and an associate claimant), and their two children [XXX] (the adult child-claimant) and [XXX] (the minor claimant), are citizens of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan (hereafter Pakistan). They are claiming refugee protection pursuant to s. 96 and s. 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act1, hereafter \u201cthe IRPA\u201c.\n[2] The claims were heard jointly pursuant to Rule 55 (1) of the Refugee Protection Division Rules2.\n[3] The principal claimant was appointed as the designated representative for the minor claimant.\n[4] The Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 43 \u2013 Women Refugee Claimant\u2019s Fearing Gender-Related Persecution was used to help assess the circumstances of this claim that may affect findings of fact and findings of mixed fact and law.\nProcedural history\n[5] The claims were heard on May 31, 2019, however the member of the Refugee Protection Division of the IRB did not render decision on the merits of the claims. The IRB decided to administratively re-hear the claims in a DeNovo hearing, presided over by another member of the Refugee Protection Division of the Board. This DeNovo hearing was held on September 17, 2020\nDETERMINATION\n[6] The panel finds on a balance of probabilities that the claimants are Convention refugees on the grounds of their views on religion which places them as Members of a Particular Social Group. Their religious views are of moderate Sunni Muslims with humanitarian and liberal mindset, who do not support the Jihad and the fundamentalism in Pakistan, and who are against the religious extremists\u2019 methods of suiciding attacks against their perceived enemies.\n[7] The reasons are as follows.\nALLEGATIONS\n[8] The complete story alleging the basis of the Claimants\u2019 fear is captured in their Basis of Claim (BOC) forms4, and was expanded upon in testimony by the three adult claimants. In short, the claimants fear that they will be harmed or killed by religious extremists and fundamentalists in Pakistan stemming from their unsuccessful attempt to recruit the son of the family (the adult child-claimant) as a Jihadist solder and a suicide bomber.\n[9] Both parents are university educated individuals from Karachi. The family has only one son \u2013 the adult child-claimant, who is hafiz, a person who has memorised the Quran in Arabic language (the native language of the claimants is Urdu.). For this purpose, since the age of four he had attended a special religious school and had completed six classes, where he had studied also subjects from the general educational curriculum. He had obtained two Certificates for his achievements in the memorizing of the Quran.\n[10] Then he continued his education in a secular, international private school in Karachi. As a devoted Muslim, in performing his duties to volunteer and help those in need, and also to maintain his memory about the verses of the Quran, he attended the [XXX] 3 days at the end of each week. There he was teaching the Quran to younger children who were from poor families and were receiving free board, food and religious education in the [XXX] at the mosque. The adult child-claimant was also praying in this mosque with his father on the Fridays.\n[11] In the month of [XXX] 2017 several unknown and unintroduced men began appearing at the classes with the children (students) and began talking about Islam and about Jihad. They interpreted for the children some Qur\u2019anic passages that refer to the Jihad and explained the meaning of the Quran as requesting the true Muslims to be part of Jihad. They spoke about the purpose in life as per the Qur\u2019an and that being a better Muslim means fight against the non\u00adbelievers like Christians, Ahmadi, Shia Muslims, etc. The men were not friendly, they tried to instill fear in the students and warned them to keep secret the meetings with the men and threatened them with death if they would dare to speak with anybody else about these teachings. The unknown men gave away written materials with information, purporting to be the right interpretation of the Qur\u2019an and appealing to the readers to be true Muslims and followers of the Qur\u2019an by joining Jihad.\n[12] These materials were found inadvertently by the mother of the adult child-claimant (the associate claimant) and alarmed her. She asked her son for explanation, but he was very scared and did not tell her anything about the source of the materials. She sent her husband (the PC) to the [XXX] to inquire what is happening and the source of the materials.\n[13] The father attended the [XXX] and was assured by the management that there is no danger of fundamentalism of the students there. However, the extremists continued to visit the classes in the [XXX] and the adult child-claimant became more and more scared with each visit. The mother continued to invite explanations from her son about the Jihad literature and he eventually confided what is going on. Thus, the parents prohibited their adult child-claimant to continue to teach in the [XXX], which was not taken well by the administration there.\n[14] The management of the [XXX] tried multiple times to pressure the claimants to send back their son and initially the claimants were providing medical-problem-excuses for their son not attending any more. Eventually they got the courage to state, that their son \u2013 the adult child\u00ad claimant is not going to attend any mote and immediately they were threatened over the phone by the administrator of the [XXX]. They started receiving calls from unknow persons threatening that they will regret if disobey and do not send again the son back to the [XXX]. The claimants filed a complaint with the police on [XXX] 2018.\n[15] Further, the threatening phone calls continued and even on one occasion unknown people visited the family, angry from the disobedience to the orders the son to return to the [XXX]. They repeated the death threats against the entire family again.\n[16] Few days later, on [XXX] 2017 a stone with a life-threatening letter around it was thrown through the window of the claimants. The letter was accusing them as infidels, deserving to be killed, because they vive western education of their children and engage in un-Islamic activities. A second complaint was immediately filed with the police5, which did not investigate any of the complaints.\n[17] The adult child-claimant fell ill from fear. When recovered, he did not go any more to the [XXX], but he continued to attend his international high school. The commute to and back from the private school was arranged with a special school bus. Nevertheless, one day an unknown person attempted to pick up the boy after school. The security prevented the attempt and alarmed the administration and the family.\n[18] The Police refused to accept any more complaints and to be involved in a such religios issue, which they pretended to be a minor, unimportant dispute about the education of the son. Understanding that no protection is coming, the scared family moved immediately to Islamabad, where they stayed with a cousin. The threatening phone calls continued on the cell phone of the mother, insisting that the adult child-claimant get back to the [XXX]. The claimants arranged their travel to Canada and arrived on [XXX] 2018. They were planning that the PC would be able to make some alternative arrangements for their safe return and residence back in Pakistan.\n[19] The PC, who was working for the [XXX], and could not take a longer leave from his job, returned in Karachi on [XXX] 2018. He took precautious measures and stayed at his brother, visiting his home rarely only at night to pick documents and things of necessity.\n[20] Encouraged that everything seems calm, one night, on [XXX] 2018, the PC stayed in the house and on the next day, when leaving for his prayer, he saw many abusive slogans painted on the house. He left quickly for his brother, but on his way he was attacked and shot at by two individuals on a motorbike. The PC arrived back in Canada on [XXX] 2018 and the entire family applied for refugee protection three days later.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[21] The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that all claimants have provided sufficient documentation to establish their personal identities and citizenship in Pakistan, based on their testimony and the certified true copies of their Government of Pakistan passports.6\nReligious identity\n[22] The panel is satisfied that the mother and associate claimant are Shia Muslim and that the father and principal claimant are Sunni Muslim, based on the testimony of the adult claimants, the donation receipts from [XXX] and personal documents provided into evidence7. The claimants explained that they are cousins and the differences in their religious views have never been an issue, because the extended family has broad, liberal, humanitarian views on religion and on the individual liberty.\n[23] The panel accepts, on a balance of probabilities, that the adult child-claimant, is hafiz, a person who had memorised the Quran. He submitted two Certificates from the [XXX] from 2011 and 2012 for his achievements in memorization of the Holy Quran8. The claimant testified personally about his study experience and was able to demonstrate his knowledge by reciting verses from the Quran by heart in Arabic language. The panel is satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that the adult child-claimant is a Sunni Muslim and hafiz.\nNEXUS\n[24] The panel finds that the claimants are Convention refugees in that they have a well-founded fear of persecution from religious extremists due to their humanitarian and liberal religious views on Islam, and, thus, the nexus to the Convention is their membership in a particular social group.\nCREDIBILITY\n[25] All three adult claimants provided testimony. The panel finds that the claimants are credible on the material aspects of their claims \u2013 specifically the panel finds that the adult child\u00ad claimant is hafiz and that while teaching classes of poor children, boarding and studying in the local [XXX], he had been identified and targeted by extremists over a couple of meetings, who tried to pursue him to join Jihad and become a suicide bomber.\n[26] Generally speaking, the claimants\u2019 testimony was direct, sincere, detailed and spontaneous. Overall, the panel did not find any contradictions, inconsistencies, omissions or implausibility regarding any aspects of their account which could have undermined the credibility of their statements. They provided many details of the events, that have led to their fleeing Pakistan. In coming to this finding on credibility the panel also considered the numerous claimant-specific documents tendered into evidence9 by the claimants to support their allegations, namely: school documents, reports to the police, First Information Reports to the police, affidavits from eye eyewitnesses of the kidnapping incident from the school, letters of support from family members, letters from [XXX] from Pakistan and from Canada about the affiliation of the claimants, birth and death certificates, employment history records.\n[27] The panel finds that the claimants were credible witnesses and did not find any discrepancies or inconsistencies between their testimony and the documents they submitted. The panel finds, that the evidence before the panel establish, on a balance of probabilities, that the adult child-claimant was a victim, together with the [XXX] boarding school children, of persuasion to join the Jihad and attempt to be recruited as a suicide bomber. When his parents intervened and stopped him from further attending the [XXX] and meetings with the religious extremists, the entire family was targeted for harm by the particular individuals, belonging to the religious extremists and fundamentalists in Karachi, Pakistan.\nObjective basis of future risk\n[28] Based on the credibility of the claimants\u2019 allegations, and the documentary evidence set out above, the panel finds that the claimants have established a future risk to their lives and that they will be subjected to violence at the hands of Islamic extremists in Pakistan, owing to their identities of mixed family of Shia and Sunni Muslim, who has liberal and moderate religious views and is against Jihad, promulgated by religious extremists and fundamentalists.\n[29] The objective documentary evidence that corroborate the allegations of the claimants are found in many documents: In item 1.18 of the NDP on Pakistan (NDP)10 the UK Home Office informs about the report of the UN Secretary General (UNSG) on Children and armed conflict, dated 16 May 2018, where is noted:\n\u201cThe United Nations continued to receive reports of the recruitment and use of children, including from madrasas, and allegations of the use of children by armed groups for suicide attacks. In January [2017], TTP released a video showing children, including girls, being instructed in how to perpetrate suicide attacks.\u201d\nFurther, the UK Home Office advises that According to the USSD human rights report for 2017:\n\u201cNonstate militant groups kidnapped boys and girls and used fraudulent promises to coerce parents into giving away children as young as 12 to spy, fight, or die as suicide bombers. The militants sometimes offered parents money, often sexually and physically abused the children, and used psychological coercion to convince the children the acts they committed were justified. The government operated a center in Swat to rehabilitate and educate former child soldiers.\u201d\n[30] The suicide attacks are already part of the contemporary mode of terrorism of the militant groups. Item 7.1 of the NDP about the Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) militant group in Pakistan from the Research Directorate of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada reports that JeM was the first jihadi organization to launch suicide attacks (\u2026) in 2002. Sources indicate that the group\u2019s attacks are aimed at killing the maximum number of people, including security force personnel and civilians, targeting the Pakistani state and sectarian minorities. Despite bans on JeM\u2019s activities, the group continues to operate openly in different areas of Pakistan and has claimed to have 300 suicide bombers available to attack (\u2026).\n[31] In a June 2010 article11, The Economist quoted a Lahore-based political analyst as saying that:\n\u201c[t]he Punjab government is not only complacent, there is a certain ambivalence in their attitude\u2019 towards extremists\u2026..They compete for the religious vote bank\u201d\u2018 (The Economist 3 June 2010). The same source states that as the death toll grows, so do concerns that even the appearance of official tolerance gives these organisations legitimacy\u2026\u2026The Federal Interior Minister, Rehman Malik, declared that an \u201coperation\u201d was needed to clear out the Punjabi groups. He claimed that 44% of Pakistan\u2019s madrassas \u2013 Islamic seminaries \u2013 are based in south Punjab and that groups like (\u2026..) Jaish-e\u00adMohammed are \u201cpart of the Taliban and al-Qaeda.\u201d\nReavailment\n[32] The panel had concerns about the reavailment of the PC back to Pakistan after arriving in Canada and leaving his family here. The PC testified that he was having a lucrative employment in the [XXX] in Karachi and that he was not planning to seek refugee protection in Canada, when he fled Pakistan with his family after the incident, that looked like an attempt of kidnapping of his son. The PC testified that the family was planning to re-locate somewhere in Pakistan and he returned to maintain his job while obtaining re\u00ad assignment or finding another solution for re-location. However, upon his return in Pakistan, although the precautionary measures, he became a victim of an assassination attack and his house was vandalized with abusive slogans with religious context. This made him re-assess the threats from the religious extremists and fundamentalists for the entire family and to find them real and inevitable. This is when he decided to seek protection from Canada.\n[33] The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the explanations of the claimant were reasonable and credible and that in the circumstances, the PC\u2019s individual return to Pakistan does not amount to re-availment demonstrating a lack of subjective fear.\nState Protection\n[34] The claimants alleged that the state is unable or unwilling to provide them with adequate protection. The objective documentary evidence indicates that there is a lack of rule of law in Pakistan, including a lack of due process and a lack of government accountability. This means that abuse often goes unpunished, fostering a culture of impunity amongst perpetrators. The claimants have previously sought police protection in Pakistan, which was not provided to them due to unwillingness of the Police to be involved in such sensitive religious issue with violent agents of persecution\/harm. The NDP contains numerous reports that outline deficiencies and inaction from state authorities in situations such as those, alleged by the claimants. There are reports that law enforcement authorities are often unwilling, or even when they are willing, are unable to protect from the attacks of religious extremists. Pakistani authorities have faced criticism for their failure to protect religious violence, for permitting militant organizations to operate with impunity, and for not investigating and punishing the groups responsible for violent attacks.12 The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom described the response of the Pakistani government as \u201cgrossly inadequate state protection for Shia Muslims.\u201d13 That same report notes that \u201cthe government has proven unwilling or unable to crack down on groups that repeatedly plan, conduct, and claim credit for attacks, or prevent future violence.\u201d14\n[35] Further the reports inform that:\n\u201cPakistan\u2019s police system suffers severe deficiencies in a number of areas, including equipment, technology, personnel, training, and intelligence capability. They are considered one of the most corrupt institutions in Pakistan. There have also been reports that the police have often failed to protect members of religious minorities, women and the poor.\u201d15\n[36] In addition, the News International, a Pakistani newspaper, stated in a 3 March 2014 article that, according to the NISP, there are a total of 60 banned organizations in Pakistan, including JeM, and although the government has taken steps to ban certain organizations, \u201cmetamorphism\u201d of these groups and \u201cimplementation gaps\u201d remain a challenge for the government\u2019s internal security mechanisms.\n[37] The panel, therefore, concludes that the claimants have rebutted the presumption of state protection with clear and convincing evidence.\nInternal flight alternative (IFA)\n[38] The panel inquired as to whether the claimants could relocate to Hyderabad or Multan, or DG Khan and live safely. The male claimant testified that nowhere is safe for them in Pakistan and they would be at high risk of harm by the extremist organizations who would try to hurt him and his family.\n[39] The panel finds that there is a well-founded fear of persecution which exists throughout the country, and there\u2019s a serious possibility of persecution throughout Pakistan for the claimants. The conclusion is based not only on the statements by the claimants above, but also on evidence in the NDP, which indicates that, in general, an internal flight alternative would not be available where there is a likelihood that persons such as the claimants would be persecuted by extremists for their perceived un-Islamic position with respect to Jihad.\n[40] There are reports within the documentary evidence that given the wide geographic presence and reach of religious extremists or anti-Shia militant groups, a viable internal flight alternative would generally not be available to individuals at risk of being targeted by such groups, as is the family of the claimants, which is of mixed reldigion: Sunni and Shia Muslim and which opposed involvement of their son in Jihad. The panel finds that there is a serious possibility of the claimants being persecuted throughout the country given their profile and the reach of the agents of persecution.\n[41] Given the objective documentary evidence cited above regarding state protection and the claimants\u2019 testimony the panel finds that there is no viable IFA for these claimants in Pakistan at this time.\nCONCLUSION\n[42] Based on the analysis above and to the relevant provisions of IRPA, the panel concludes that the claimants do have a well-founded fear of persecution on Convention grounds and, therefore, are Convention refugees, within the meaning of section 96 of IRPA.\n[43] Therefore, the panel accepts these claims for refugee protection.\n(signed) R.

The claimant testified in a straightforward and concise manner during the oral hearing, testifying in English. The panel found that the claimant\u2019s testimony was in no way inconsistent or contradictory with the documentary evidence, including the supportive objective evidence contained in the National Documentation Package (NDP).3\n[14] The claimant\u2019s allegations of detention and torture at the hands of the Rwandan government, are consistent with information contained in the NDP document, excerpts of which are reproduced here for context.\n\u201cTreatment of Diana Rwigara\u2019s Supporters After the August 2017 Electoral Period\u201d\nAccording to the German magazine Der Spiegel, Diane Rwigara\u2019s supporters no longer dare mention their support for her in public (Der Spiegel 29 Apr. 2019). (\u2026)the following information on the treatment of President Kagam\u00e9\u2019s opponents in general may be useful.\nIn a telephone interview with the Research Directorate, an assistant professor at the University of Denver\u2019s Josef Korbel School of International Studies who has conducted research in Rwanda, notably on the impacts of violence on women\u2019s political mobilization, explained that, generally, opponents or critics of President Kagam\u00e9 avoid expressing their views in public, even in a casual setting like a caf\u00e9 or bar, for fear of being overheard by intelligence services or government informants (Assistant Professor 25 Apr. 2019). Similarly, in a telephone interview with the Research Directorate, an associate professor of development at the University of Ottawa\u2019s School of International Development and Global Studies working on issues of governance in Rwanda indicated that the Rwandan government\u2019s control apparatus is very developed, encompassing local forms of surveillance as well as informants in local governance structures (Associate Professor 2 May 2019). Similarly, in its Freedom in the World 2019 report, Freedom House states that \u201c[t]he authorities reportedly use informants to infiltrate civil society, further discouraging citizens from expressing dissent\u201d (Freedom House 29 Jan. 2019, sec. D4).\nAccording to the US Department of State\u2019s Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2018, laws prohibiting \u201cdivisionism, genocide ideology, and genocide denial\u201d were broadly applied by the Rwandan government, including to silence political dissent and those critical of the government (US 13 Mar. 2019, 14). The Associate Professor added that the government has instituted a [translation] \u201clegal control apparatus\u201d such that accusations of \u201cdenial or criticism [of the official version] of the genocide\u201d are often levelled against political opponents who may be imprisoned as a result (Associate Professor 2 May 2019). An article in the Wall Street Journal (WSJ), commenting on the treatment of certain opposition figures in Rwanda, also reports that the authorities used genocide denial charges to \u201csilence \u2026 opponents\u201d (WSJ 31 Oct. 2017).\nAccording to the Associate Professor, those openly critical of the government or opposing the government and who hold [translation] \u201clocally important\u201d positions (for example, a local prominent citizen or teacher) are especially at risk of being targeted by these forms of surveillance and control and of being threatened, arrested or physically injured (Associate Professor 2 May 2019).\nThe Assistant Professor indicated that \u201ceven low members [of opposition parties] who try to run, for instance, in local elections,\u201d as well as supporters of those opposition parties, risk being harassed by law enforcement, or arrested, and face risks of \u201cdisappearance, even murders\u201d(Assistant Professor 25 Apr. 2019). According to the Assistant Professor, the consequences can also be material, such as confiscation of property by the government or expropriation (Assistant Professor 25 Apr. 2019). Similarly, the Wall Street Journal cites an exiled Rwandan economist as stating that the authorities have proceeded with \u201c\u2018arbitrary\u2019\u201d seizures of businesses and properties based on accusations of financial crimes, such as tax evasion or fraud (WSJ 31 Oct. 2017).4\n[15] The claimant provided copies of his Facebook Messenger conversations5 with Diane Rwigara wherein she professes concern for the claimant\u2019s wellbeing and is wary of having any conversations that may be monitored by the government.\n[16] The claimant has also provided documentary evidence of the Public Prosecutor6 granting provisional release as well as Minutes of Detention,7 which speak to the charges against him based on his political involvement.\n[17] The panel accepts, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant\u2019s allegations did occur as he testified and as expressed in his Basis of Claim narrative.\nObjective Basis of Future Risk\n[18] Based on the credibility of the claimant\u2019s allegations, the documentary evidence provided and the objective evidence which supports these allegations, the panel finds that the claimant has established serious possibility of a future risk that he will be subjected to persecution.\n[19] To be considered persecution, the prospective risk of harm must be sufficiently serious, either individually or cumulatively, to constitute persecution.\n[20] The claimant has faced arrest, detention, inhumane treatment and punishment in detention. He fears he will be arrested again if he were to return to Rwanda. The panel find that the types of harm that the claimant has faced in the past and may face in the future are persecutory.\n[21] The fact that the claimant faces this risk is corroborated by the following documents: National Documentation Package (NDP) for Rwanda- September 1, 2020, item 2.2, Rwanda. Human Rights in Africa: Review of 2019, and item 4.1, Rwanda: Politically Closed Elections.\nState Protection\n[22] The panel finds that it would be objectively unreasonable for the claimant to seek the protection of the state in light of his particular circumstances. It is the government that the claimant fears.\nInternal Flight Alternative (IFA)\n[23] The panel considered whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for the claimant. On the evidence before me, the panel finds that there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout Rwanda. The government has effective control throughout the country and in the NDP, item 3.7, it describes the system of registration to account for citizens, through birth, death, and health, making the government capable of tracking the claimant should he return to Rwanda.\nCONCLUSION\n[24] Based on the analysis above, the panel concludes that the claimant has established a serious possibility of persecution based on a Convention ground pursuant to Section 96 of IRPA. Accordingly, the claim is accepted.\n(signed) Tim Crowhurst\nOctober 16, 2020\n1 The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c.27, as amended, sections 96 and 97(1).\n2 Exhibit 1, Package of Information from the Referring CBSA\/IRCC.\n3 Exhibit 3, National Documentation Package (NDP) for Rwanda (September 1 2020).\n4 NDP, item 4.6 at pgs. 2-3.\n5 Exhibit 6.\n6 Exhibit 7.\n7 Ibid.\n\n",

The claimants are citizens of Hungary who seek protection in Canada pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA)1 on the basis of their Roma ethnicity.\n[2] Their claims for protection were initially heard jointly with those of the [XXX] family and a decision rendered in 2011. On an application for judicial review, Hughes, J. returned the matter to the Board for redetermination, on the ground that the Refugee Protection Division (the RPD) had made erroneous credibility findings and had failed to deal adequately with the issue of state protection. Hughes, J. also ordered that the claims of the two families be severed.\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] The claimants rely on the allegations in the narrative portion of the principal claimant\u2019s Basis of Claim, (BOC)2. The following is a summary of those allegations.\n\u2022 That they are Roma, and readily recognised as such by their physical appearance and mode of dress;\n\u2022 They have suffered severe discrimination and harassment in their native Hungary, which discrimination and harassment started in school and has been lifelong;\n\u2022 They have been abused by the Hungarian police with the harassment growing worse during the 1990\u2019s;\n\u2022 Hungarian Guard and skinheads attack them and other Roma frequently;\n\u2022 During an attack on [XXX] 1995, the wife was beaten so severely that she [XXX];\n\u2022 In the fall of 1996 a group of 4-5 skinheads attacked the principal claimant at his home. The attackers dragged him outside, where they beat him. They set fire to his home. They also beat his neighbours. The claimants went to the police but were told that the police would not help;\n\u2022 While the atmosphere was calmer during the 2000\u2019s, between [XXX] 2005 and [XXX] 2009, the claimants were victims of a number of anti-Roma incidents. Their family members and friends were also victims of anti-Roma discrimination and violence. The principal claimant was kept naked in a cell for three days.\n\u2022 In [XXX] 2006, police arrested and detained the principal claimant on suspicion of theft as he was going to visit his wife after she had [XXX]. The police accused him of stealing the items he was taking to her. He was detained for three days. When he was released, he was asked whether he wished to file a complaint against the arresting officers. He provided the badge numbers of the officers who arrested and interrogated him, but was told that those badge numbers did not exist.\n\u2022 In [XXX] 2009, the wife and the principal claimant were returning home from a movie when the police stopped them for an identification check. The wife was let go, but the principal claimant was again detained for three days. His clothes were taken from him and he was kept naked for the entire three days. He was beaten during the first night and interrogated over the next two days of his detention, all with the intention of making him confess to crimes. When he was released, he was asked whether he wanted to make a complaint about his detention, however, when he said he wanted to, the officer asked him to consider it carefully as they [the police] would look into his family (a veiled threat).\n\u2022 The claimants made the decision to leave Hungary in [XXX] 2009, but before they could do so, they were victims of several serious incidents. On [XXX], 2010 Hungarian Guards attacked the wife and her mother while they were in town. The wife suffered injury to her head, arms, and legs. When they tried to make a complaint, the officer on duty accused the principal claimant of beating the wife and ordered the claimants to leave the police station.\n\u2022 In [XXX] 2009, Hungarian Guards violently invaded the claimants\u2019 home, forcing them to flee. The Guards tried to set fire to the home, but the claimants re-entered the home and were able to douse the fire before it could spread.\n\u2022 All attempts to seek police protection proved futile, as each and every time they turned to the police, the police refused to assist them.\nDETERMINATION\n[4] For the following reasons, the panel finds that the claimants are Convention refugees.\nANALYSIS\nThe Claimant\u2019s Evidence\n[5] At the hearing, both adult claimants gave extensive oral testimony about the major incidents that prompted them to leave Hungary. They testified that they are readily identified as Roma persons by their physical appearance. As a result, the wife has been subjected to numerous random attacks while out on the street, which attacks she blamed on the reluctance of the white Hungarian population to accept the Roma. The principal claimant testified that he is readily identified as a Roma person by the shape of his face, his large nose and the colour of his skin. As a result, he has had trouble finding work and was attacked at least twice a month. He spoke of mistrust when he was out in the public sphere that culminated in him being falsely arrested and accused of theft in [XXX] 2006.\n[6] When she was asked what prompted the family to leave Hungary, the wife responded that the turning point was the home invasion of [XXX] 2009.\nThe Major Incidents\n[7] In assessing the wife\u2019s oral testimony about the major incidents in the claim, the panel finds that overall her testimony was not credible and trustworthy because much of that testimony was exaggerated or unsubstantiated. This was particularly true of her testimony respecting her experience with the medical field.\nThe Wife\u2019s Experiences with the medical system\n[8] The wife submitted medical reports that show that she had [XXX]. She alleged that the only reason she had the [XXX] was because the doctor who performed the previous [XXX] was negligent. She attributed his alleged negligence to her Roma ethnicity. She testified that he was silent when she confronted him with his negligence. The wife interpreted the doctor\u2019s silence as proof that she was correct in her assumptions.\n[9] The panel gives little weight to this part of the wife\u2019s testimony because it is internally inconsistent and contradicted by the medical reports she submitted. The medical report shows that the wife suffered from [XXX] and underwent [XXX] to address her condition. The first was in [XXX] 2000; and the second in 2006. The 2006 [XXX] was required because her condition had returned.3 When the panel gave the wife the opportunity to respond to the content of the medical reports, she asserted that she had only [XXX]. This response is inconsistent with her earlier testimony that she had [XXX] for the same condition, one of which was unnecessary and was entirely due to the doctor\u2019s negligence and anti-Roma sentiment, a position she maintained throughout the hearing.\n[10] The panel is not an expert in any discipline of medicine, therefore, it is unable to attribute, as the wife did, that the [XXX] in 2006 was a) unnecessary, and b) occasioned only by the doctor\u2019s racism. Further, given the inconsistency between the medical report and the wife\u2019 s assertions that there were [XXX]; and her later denial that there had been a [XXX], the panel finds that her allegations that the doctor was negligent in his treatment of her condition because he harbored racist sentiment towards the Roma are neither credible nor trustworthy.\n[11] The wife also alleged medical misconduct when she gave [XXX]. She claimed that the staff forced her to [XXX], when, due to her prior [XXX], she was supposed to [XXX] section. She testified that she brought this to the staff\u2019s attention, who ignored her. Instead the medical staff performed tests designed to [XXX] and forced her to [XXX] \u201cthen and there\u2019. In her view, the medical personnel did not act in a professional way and wanted her to suffer because she was Roma.\n[12] For the following reasons, the panel rejects these allegations. The medical report regarding this event lists the following diagnosis: [XXX]\n[13] The medical report regarding this event sets out the circumstances of the wife\u2019s [XXX] as:\n\u201cshe got registered into our department following the [XXX] and the [XXX] got organised at [XXX] with a [XXX]. In regards to the previous [XXX] removal, to the [XXX] that is involved into the [XXX] and the prolonged period of time the [XXX] was completed with [XXX]; as a result of which a [XXX] without any complications \u2026 \u201c4\n[14] The panel interpreted this portion of the medical report to be saying that the wife went into [XXX]. That she suffered from [XXX] and that due to additional medical complications relating to her previous [XXX] and the length of [XXX], a decision was made to [XXX]. When the panel gave the wife the opportunity to respond to its interpretation of the medical report, she reiterated her claim that, due to her Roma ethnicity, the medical personnel forced her to [XXX] over her protestations. She maintained that as she was present at the time she was in a good position to assess how the staff acted towards her. In response to her counsel, she testified that during the [XXX] she was diagnosed with [XXX] and that her doctor had told her that it would be better for her to have a [XXX] so that they do not burst.\n[15] While not disputing the wife\u2019s subjective appreciation of the attitude of the medical staff, the panel is unable to find, as she suggested, that anti-Roma racism was the reason for the medical actions that were taken. It is clear that the wife felt that because of her earlier [XXX] she could not or should not have to [XXX]. No objective medical evidence was provided on this point, and, without additional information, the panel is unable to find, as the wife asserts, that the medical decisions taken by the staff were motivated solely by anti-Roma racism. The panel gives little weight to the wife\u2019s testimony regarding the medical treatment she received when [XXX].\nThe October 2009 Home Invasion\n[16] The claimants allege that in [XXX] 2009 Hungarian Guards entered their home in an unprovoked attack. The wife testified that they entered through the window. As the Guards came in, the family fled through the back door. She testified that as they fled, she looked back. She noticed that the Guards were not following them and were, in fact, leaving. The family returned to the house and on entering noticed that the Guards had started a fire using some of the family\u2019s clothing. They put the fire out. The principal claimant corroborated the wife\u2019s account but added that the fire did not spread because the Guards had used their damp clothes to start the fire.\n[17] While the description of the attack aligns with the claimants\u2019 general allegations as well as with the claims of Roma claimants, generally, for the following reasons the panel finds that the claimants\u2019 account of the incident is not credible and trustworthy.\n[18] According to the claimants the incident was relatively brief. The Guards came in through the window, the claimants fled through the back door, the Guards started a fire; they left and the claimants returned home. The panel is not prepared to accept that the Guards would use damp clothes to start a fire; even, if they did, the panel is not prepared to accept that their attempt would yield a fire that the claimants would be forced to put out. The panel is of the view that this is not what could reasonably be expected in those circumstances and, therefore, the credibility of the claimants\u2019 testimony regarding the [XXX] 2009 home invasion is seriously undermined. The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the alleged home invasion did not occur.\nThe Other Incidents\n[19] The claimants alleged that following an attack on [XXX] 1995 the wife suffered a [XXX] as a result of the injuries she received. No independent evidence was put forward that could link the alleged [XXX] to an attack by Hungarian guards. Further, the wife\u2019s testimony about the [XXX] mises concerns that the panel has not been able to resolve in her favour. She testified that while she went to the hospital because she felt pain, the only procedure that was carried out was a [XXX] that she testified was done at her urging. She received no other medical treatment, even though the doctor told her that the [XXX].\n[20] The panel finds that, notwithstanding the allegation that Roma women are routinely discriminated against in hospital, the events described by the wife are not in keeping with what might reasonably be expected where a [XXX] woman attends hospital complaining of with abdominal pain. Given that a [XXX] was in fact performed, the panel is not persuaded that the wife received discriminatory treatment amounting to persecution when she [XXX].\nThe [XXX] 2010 Incident\n[21] The claimants alleged that shortly before the wife came to Canada, Hungarian Guards attacked her and her mother. This incident allegedly took place on [XXX] 2010. The wife claimed to have suffered injury to her arms and legs. She testified that she received no assistance from either the police or the doctors. Photographs of her bruises were tendered as part of Exhibit 115. The wife testified that the Immigration Officer who interviewed them advised her to take the photographs. The photographs were the only supporting documentation respecting the alleged incident. The panel is aware of the presumption of truthfulness that attaches to the wife\u2019s sworn testimony, however, in light of its prior credibility findings, and absent any supporting documents that originated in Hungary, the panel is unable to draw any inferences or make any findings regarding the injuries and the alleged incident because the photographs cannot tell the circumstances under which the injuries were sustained.\n[22] While the panel does not dispute that the wife, as a Roma person, has experienced discriminatory treatment in Hungary, given the credibility concerns that the panel has not been able to resolve in her favour, the panel finds that the wife has not met her onus to establish, on a balance of probabilities, that she faces a serious possibility of persecution if returned to Hungary. The panel finds that the wife is not a Convention refugee. For the same reason, the panel finds that she has not established that she is a person in need of protection.\nThe Principal Claimant\n[23] The principal claimant testified that he was readily identified as a Roma person by his appearance, specifically his large nose. The panel places little reliance on this claim, nonetheless, it finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the principal claimant\u2019s association with his wife and her family and residence in a Roma area would likely cause him to be perceived as being Roma, which in turn leaves him open to the type of discriminatory treatment accorded to Roma persons in Hungary. Having made this finding, the panel examined the principal claimant\u2019s allegations of persecution. His allegations centred around two incidents. In both incidents the police arrested and detained him for seventy-two hours before releasing him without charge. The documentary evidence indicates that this is common practice in Hungary.\n[24] The first incident occurred in 2006, shortly after the wife [XXX]. The principal claimant testified that he was on his way to the hospital to visit her. He was taking her some supplies she needed, things like shampoo and sanitary napkins. On his way to the hospital the police stopped him. The officers accused him of stealing the items, a charge he denied. The police took him to the police station, where he was detained for seventy-two hours before being released without charges. During this period the police questioned and beat the principal claimant. For the three days he was detained, his family did not know where he was.\n[25] The second incident occurred in [XXX] 2009. The principal claimant testified that when the police arrested him, they told him that they were looking for him because he was charged with theft. At the police station he was stripped of his clothes, and in his words \u201cgiven dirty rags\u201d. But for these rags he was naked. He remained naked throughout the three days of his detention. The principal claimant testified that he was humiliated during the three days he was detained stating that \u201cit was unnatural the way they humiliated me\u201d. Asked to explain what he meant he replied that he did not want to do in front of the female claimants. Later on he would testify that since coming to Canada and finding work here, he feels like a man again.\n[26] The principal claimant was rather emotional while he was giving this testimony, however, he would not elaborate on his experience during detention. He testified that in 2013 he was assessed by a [XXX], who recommended that he join a support group and that he could benefit from [XXX].6 In fact, the principal claimant was found to have a score of [XXX].7 The principal claimant testified that he did not follow up on these treatment recommendations largely because of financial difficulty. Nonetheless, he testified that if returned to Hungary he would likely break down again.\n[27] While the panel is cautious of medical [XXX] reports that state that the only way that claimants can recover from their [XXX] and other health issues is for them to remain in Canada, it found that the principal claimant presented his testimony, which centred mainly on these two incidents and an incident in a public park, in a straightforward manner and without any seeming attempt at subterfuge. For this reason, the panel accepts the finding of the [XXX] that the principal claimant has suffered or [XXX], which likely stems from his experiences while detained.\n[28] Further, based on the principal claimant\u2019s demeanour while testifying about the second detention, the panel accepts that he was mistreated as he alleged. The documentary evidence indicates that Roma persons are often mistreated while they are in custody.8 Given these statements in the documentary evidence, the panel\u2019s findings respecting his perceived Roma identity as well as the principal claimant\u2019s testimony respecting the mistreatment he received at the hands of the police, the panel finds that, if returned to Hungary, there is a serious possibility that the police would continue to arrest and harass the principal claimant. Further, the panel finds that such continued harassment is treatment that would amount to persecution.\nState Protection\n[29] As the police are the agents of persecution, the panel finds that it is not likely that state protection would be available to the principal claimant. For these reasons, the panel finds that he is a Convention refugee.\nThe Minor Claimant\n[30] On the behalf of the minor claimant it was advanced by both the adult claimants and their counsel that he would be persecuted if he were to return to Hungary. They posited that the minor claimant would be denied adequate schooling and that he would suffer the same discriminatory treatment that all Roma face in Hungary. Segregated schooling for Roma children is well documented.9 However, this is not a situation that the now [XXX] years old minor claimant has ever faced, and there was little persuasive evidence before the panel that the minor claimant who has had the benefit of being educated in the Ontario school system will likely face segregated schooling if returned to Hungary.\n[31] It was also argued that the minor claimant was not sufficiently proficient in the Hungarian language to allow him to attend a Hungarian school. The panel is not persuaded by this argument because there was no independent evidence of the minor claimant\u2019s proficiency in the Hungarian language put before it that could allow the panel to make such a conclusion. What is evident is that he is reliant on his parents for support. The panel has already found that the principal claimant is a Convention refugee and by virtue of family membership and his dependency on the principal claimant, the panel finds that the minor claimant is also a Convention refugee.\n[XXX]\n[32] [XXX] is the wife\u2019s mother. She claims to have experienced lifelong discrimination and harassment in Hungary. She relies on the principal claimant\u2019s narrative, which states that she was with the wife on [XXX] 2010 when Guardists attacked them. Unlike the wife, no photographs were tendered to support this claim. The panel has already found that there was insufficient credible evidence before it to allow it to find that Guardists attacked the wife on [XXX] 2010 and for the same reasons it is unable to find that [XXX] was also attacked on that date.\n[33] In so far as [XXX] relies on the claims of the principal claimant, the panel\u2019s adverse credibility findings respecting these claims also apply to her. The panel is aware that, as a Roma person in Hungary and as indicated in the documentary evidence, [XXX] likely faced many acts of discrimination during her lifetime. Nonetheless, she has not put forward sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence to allow the panel to conclude that the acts of discrimination had risen to the level of persecution. For this reason the panel finds that she has not made out her claim to be a Convention refugee.\nFamily Membership\n[34] Notwithstanding, its findings respecting the wife, and [XXX] the panel considered whether there is a serious possibility that they would face persecution as family members of the principal claimant. It has concluded that, on a balance of probabilities, they are likely to do so because of the targeting of the principal claimant by the police in their neighbourhood. Accordingly, the panel finds that the wife, the minor claimant, and [XXX] are Convention refugees.\nCONCLUSION\n[35] [XXX] claimed protection in Canada pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the IRPA on the basis of their Roma ethnicity. Having considered their claims, the Refugee Protection Division finds that they are Convention refugees.\n[36] Pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA, their claims are accepted.\n(signed) H.

Rukaria\nCountry: Zimbabwe\nRPD Number: VC0-00752\nATIP Number: A-2021-00655\nATIP Pages: 000154-000158\nDECISION\nMEMBER:\n[1] This is the decision of the Refugee Protection Division in the claim of [XXX], a citizen of Zimbabwe who is claiming refugee protection pursuant to Section 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. In rendering my reasons, I have considered and applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guidelines on women refugee claimants fearing gender related persecution.\n[2] Your allegations are set out in your Basis of Claim form and by your testimony, the following is a brief summary.\n[3] You disagree with the current government of Zimbabwe and you\u2019ve supported the movement for democratic change, the opposition party MDC as a volunteer. You fear persecution on this basis. It states that your risk is exacerbated due to the gender-based violence inflicted by state actors on women who are perceived to be opposing the government.\nDetermination\n[4] I find that you are a Convention refugee as you have established a well-founded fear of persecution based on a Convention ground namely political opinion. I also acknowledge that you have a Nexus to membership in a particular social group as a woman facing persecution based on your gender and I\u2019ve considered this in conjunction with your political Nexus in this claim.\nIdentity\n[5] I find your identity as a national of Zimbabwe is established by your testimony and the supporting documentation on file including certified true copies of your passport in Exhibit 1.\nCredibility\n[6] The presumption before me is that your testimony is true. However, this can be rebutted in appropriate circumstances such as inconsistencies, contradictions, omissions or undetailed testimony. You were straightforward and forthcoming in your testimony. There were no relevant inconsistencies between your testimony or other documents before me, other evidence. You did not appear to embellish your description of events and actions, even when it might have appeared favourable to your claim to do so. You provided credible documentation. You explained that you tried, with limited success to obtain documents from Zimbabwe in support of your claim. You said there were problems with COVID as well as not having anybody in Zimbabwe that you could ask to give you assistance with this. However, you were able to provide a number of documents, particularly late disclosures, Exhibit 5 and 6. There is a copy of your membership in the [XXX] dated [XXX] 2020 in Exhibit 5. As well, there\u2019s a letter from [XXX] at the [XXX] Harare that confirms the injuries that you sustained when you visited the clinic on [XXX] of 2019. You have a paystub showing that you worked for a [XXX] from 2012.\n[7] Your husband provided an affidavit with a copy of his photo ID which corroborates the assault that you sustained on [XXX] of 2019 and that he and your sons have largely remained out of Zimbabwe. There\u2019s an affidavit from a colleague in the MDC Women\u2019s Assembly that confirms your participation. This too is accompanied by a copy of the writer\u2019s photo ID. Exhibit 6 includes a letter from the Department of Legal Affairs of the MDC Alliance in Zimbabwe. This letter documents your membership since 2007 and describes your voluntary service in promoting economic activities with the [XXX] and various support services such as typing and distributing materials. The letter includes references to the events that you describe and states that it is a common occurrence for members to be intimidated and assaulted as the brutal crackdown on those opposed to the government is a reality. It\u2019s signed by the [XXX], who provided a phone number and offered to give more information if the Board required. I found these documents relative and probative and that they supported your allegations.\n[8] Based on your testimony and your documentation, I find you are a credible witness and therefore believe what you\u2019ve alleged in support of your claim. I find the persecution that you face has a Nexus to two of the five Convention grounds that of political opinion as well as your membership in a particular social group as a woman facing gender-based violence and therefore, I\u2019ve assessed your claim under Section 96.\nWell-Founded Fear\n[9] In order to be considered a Convention refugee, you must demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution including both a subjective and an objective basis for that fear. Based on your testimony, your supporting documents and the country condition documents. I find that you have a well-founded fear of persecution for the following reasons.\n[10] You\u2019ve supported the MDC as a volunteer for the [XXX]. You described your role and support work and you told me that if you\u2019re a woman in Zimbabwe, you need to do something to be able to help yourself. You said that you used to [XXX], to sustain themselves and feed their families. You testified that the party ZANU-PF does not allow you to share your views. They want you to listen to what they say whether it is right or wrong. You spoke of corruption and misuse of public fonds and the need for those at the top to address this. Also, you said that if you spoke about this openly in Zimbabwe. You would face the threat of harm from the state. You testified that you want to see change and that people should be treated humanely and be able to live safely without fear in Zimbabwe.\n[11] In the runup to the 2018 elections, you worked as a volunteer for a leader Mwayemureyi Saungweme but you were warned by the MDC liaison officer about a pending crackdown. Fearing sexual assault and other forms of gender-based violence that women supporters are subjected to, you stopped volunteering. A few days after you stopped, there were several photographs of you volunteering for the MDC with a note saying, we know who you are, dropped off at your house. On [XXX] of 2019, you were caught up in violence when the police attacked a peaceful MDC march. You were merely waiting for a bus at that time and you were beaten by the police. Fearing gender-based violence, you hesitated to see a physician about your injuries and stayed home until [XXX] of 2019. On the [XXX] of January, your house was vandalized. At first you thought it was due to thieves but her neighbours told you that it was the police and you realized that your National ID and other documents had been taken.\n[12] You and your spouse moved to another area in Harare on [XXX] 2019, and after that you only went out to go to and from work and you avoided any active participation in MDC activities due to your fear of persecution. You kept a low profile. On [XXX] 2019, there was more violence during an MDC demonstration. You were working at a [XXX] and injured protesters came for treatment followed by police who ordered the staff not to treat them. When the [XXX] refused to follow these orders, the police dragged the front-line staff including yourself outside and assaulted you. You had already realized after the [XXX] assault that you had to leave the country for your safety but first you needed to ensure your sons were safe and to get the fonds for you to be able to leave yourself.\n[13] You stated that one of your sons was already out of the country studying at that time and that you ensured that he was not going to come back and you arranged for your other son to leave Zimbabwe on [XXX] of 2019. Your mother, who was visiting relatives in Canada became very ill and this enabled you to get a visa to come to Canada. However, you still didn\u2019t have the funds to leave at that time. On [XXX] of 2019, the police attacked the MDC office in Harare. This raised your level of concern even higher and your brother bought you a ticket so that you could leave for Canada on [XXX] 2019. You claimed asylum in Canada and signed your Basis of Claim form on the 21st of January 2020. In the meantime, your spouse has also left Zimbabwe and [XXX] in the [XXX] through to [XXX] only passing through Zimbabwe as necessary. Since coming to Canada. You\u2019ve joined the MDC North America. You said we are organizing and trying to see how we can contribute to help our youth in Zimbabwe to start some projects, so they can help themselves.\n[14] I found that you have adduced sufficient credible evidence by your actions; also which is supported by the country documents to establish that you do have a subjective fear of persecution in Zimbabwe. The country condition documents show that the ruling government of Zimbabwe the ZANU-PF has come down hard on the opposition such as the MDC. NDP 2.2 Freedom in the World says despite President Mnangagwa repeatedly voicing his commitments to human rights reforms Zimbabwe remained highly intolerant of basic rights, peaceful dissent and free expression in 2019. During nationwide protests in mid-January, security forces responded with lethal force, killing at least 17 people, raping at least 17 women, shooting and injuring 81 people and arresting over 1000 suspected protesters during door-to-door raids. In the months that followed several civil society activists, political opposition leaders and other critics of the government were arbitrarily arrested, abducted, beaten or tortured. Little or no efforts were made to bring those responsible for the abuses to justice. Following the protests security forces intensified a crackdown on supporters of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change Alliance, among others. The U.S. Department of State echoed this description of the poor performance of the Zimbabwe government with respect to human rights and notes that impunity remains a problem. Amnesty International also described the treatment of opposition members and supporters particularly during that January 2019 protest, where security agents opened fire on protesters.\n[15] The police also threatened and arrested journalists, medical doctors and lawyers, monitoring the protests or assisting protesters. They used tear gas, baton sticks, water cannons and live ammunition to disperse protesters. The crackdown on protesters included torture and other ill-treatment and mass arrests. By the end of February, over 600 people have been arrested in connection with the January protest that\u2019s NDP 2.4. The UK Home Office further notes direct targeting of opposition and perceived opposition, including NGOs that continued after the initial violence through house raids, arrests and detentions. The NDP provides evidence women are targeted, specifically in election times, as candidates and election workers. Women have also stated that they feared not only the direct act of violence but potential repercussions associated with it. For example, they\u2019re concerned that being politically active may result in getting caught in a mob or arrested and brought to jail where they could be raped. Impunity plays a large role in allowing this climate of fear to persist. Interviewees frequently referred to the role of the police in failing to protect or of even actively contributed to the violence against women in election times.\n[16] A review of online content showed that 60 percent of violent discourse and content in the political space was directed at women for the period between January 2013 to April 2018 according to NDP 5.7. You also provided country documentation detailing the heightened risk faced by women who are in opposition to the government. A February 2020 survey found that an astounding 75 percent of women surveyed by Transparency International Zimbabwe have been forced to exchange sex for jobs, medical care and even seeking placement in school for their children, that\u2019s Exhibit 4 on page 22 and it notes that even police officers are involved in this form of extortion. An academic article from the Journal of International Women\u2019s Studies on page 27 includes that gender-based and politically motivated violence has an ongoing negative impact on women and girls and has led to a broad acceptance of violence against women and girls in Zimbabwe. An August 30, 2019, article by Newsday reports on the MDC Women\u2019s Assembly\u2019s concerns over the growing abductions and abuse of women being perpetrated by suspects, state security agencies and members of the ruling ZANU-PF party. Another article from The Guardian of January 31, 2019, states that scores of women and girls say they have been raped over the past two weeks by army officials who have ransacked houses ostensibly in search of protesters and another article on pages 69 to 70 states that most rapes by soldiers and security forces go unreported to the security forces due to fears of reprisals.\n[17] I\u2019m satisfied that opponents of the government such as you, yourself face a serious possibility of persecution. Furthermore, your risk is compounded by the threat of sexual assault, which women, particularly women who are in political opposition face in Zimbabwe. Based on all the evidence before me, I find you would face a serious possibility of persecution if you were to return to Zimbabwe.\nState Protection and Internal Flight Alternative\n[18] In this case the agent of persecution is the state and its supporters. The persecution that you would face if returned to Zimbabwe is at the hands of the authorities. Accordingly, I find there is no state protection available to you and the presumption of state protection is rebutted. The state is in control of all of its territories and therefore on the evidence before me, I find there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout Zimbabwe and that there is thus no viable internal flight alternative available for you in your particular circumstances. Based on the totality of the evidence, I\u2019ve concluded that you are a Convention refugee and accordingly, I\u2019m accepting your claim.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n",

I would like to add that in the event that written reasons are issued, a written form of these reasons may be edited for spelling, syntax and grammar, and references to the applicable case law and documentary evidence may also be included.\n[2] The claimant, [XXX] claims to be a citizen of Zimbabwe and is claiming refugee protection pursuant to ss. 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nDETERMINATION\n[3] I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee as the claimant does have a well-founded fear of persecution on a Convention ground; namely, her political opinion. She\u2019s an active member of the main opposition alliance in Zimbabwe.\nALLEGATIONS\n[4] The claimant\u2019s complete allegations are set out in the basis of claim form and need not be repeated here in detail. To summarize briefly, the claimant is a woman born in [XXX]. In [XXX] 2019, there were unprecedented riots in Zimbabwe. The claimant is a long time political and social activist. She was active in the ZTCU Union, which was the steppingstone for the MDC under Morgan Tsvangirai; the MDC being one of the main opposition parties in Zimbabwe.\n[5] The claimant became an active member of the MDC which is the \u2014 just a minute, please \u2014 the Movement for Democratic Change and she is now a member of the MDC alliance. In addition, the claimant\u2019s work history has resulted in problems with the authorities, as result of which, her husband left her.\n[6] In [XXX] 2019 the claimant\u2019s sister [XXX] and her husband were killed in a vehicle accident near a police camp. The claimant started the guardianship process for the children of her late sister. The claimant fears that her sister was mistaken for her when her sister was chased in the course of this fatal accident. The claimant is a victim of sex abuse and assault from the Zimbabwe police and the Zimbabwe military. This is as she was employed by an [XXX] and she is also an active member of the MDC.\n[7] On [XXX] 2019 the claimant suffered at the hands of the police, the military and the ZANU-PF, which is the ruling party of Zimbabwe. While among 200 protesting citizens and activists, the claimant was hit, she was arrested and sexually abused. She passed out. The police recorded her name and threatened her against engaging in protest against the government. They said that she has always been on their close watch and that her movements would be monitored. They said that they would harm her more and eventually kill her.\n[8] On [XXX] 2019, two police officers who she knew from their previous visits to her workplace went again to her workplace looking for her. They caught her and took her to the Harare Central Police where they said her name is on the top list for elimination. The claimant had to relocate to another suburb in [XXX] some [XXX] away. Her family is in danger; her mother has been visited by the police approximately seven times since [XXX] 2019. Her mother has since relocated to be with the claimant\u2019s children. When the claimant reported to the police, they refused to take the report at face value. She then asked for a request for a medical report form, this was in order to seek treatment for health issues that she suffered from as a result of mistreatment by the police authorities.\n[9] The claimant obtained medical treatment, she then sought [XXX]. She did this at the [XXX]. She was [XXX]. The claimant applied for a Canadian visitor visa on [XXX] 2019. She obtained it on [XXX] 2019 and she left for Canada on [XXX] 2019. She later learned from her party, the MDC Alliance that the authorities of Zimbabwe are after her.\n[10] The claim was referred on October 30th of 2019. The claimant alleges fear of risk to her life, risk of torture or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment at the hands of the same agent of harm, and she also alleges that neither state protection nor safe and reasonable internal flight alternatives are available in her country of nationality.\nANALYSIS\n[11] The main issue is credibility.\nIdentity\n[12] The claimant\u2019s national identity has been established by the testimony and supporting documentation filed and entered in these proceedings. The current passport is on file along with other documents. I am satisfied as to the claimant\u2019s identity.\nCredibility\n[13] When credibility is assessed, there are two principles that are followed. Firstly, when the claimant swears to the truthfulness of certain facts, there is a presumption that what the claimant is saying is true unless there is reason to doubt it. Secondly, when assessing credibility, the panel is entitled to rely on rationality and common sense. The determination as to whether a claimant\u2019s evidence is credible is made on a balance of probabilities.\n[14] The panel found the claimant to be a credible witness. Her testimony contained many details which added credibility and context to her allegations. Her testimony was consistent with her allegations. Her testimony helped the panel to make sense of the allegations by putting them into the claimant\u2019s personal and national context. The claimant did not embellish. The claimant was able to answer difficult questions in a credible manner. The claimant provided original copies of multiple corroborating documents.\n[15] The claimant has established her profile as a long time social and political activist who has consistently worked for the opposition and\/or the founding ZCTU Union, which predates the MDC and\/or NGOs perceived to be anti-government. The panel finds that the claimant would be treated upon returning to Zimbabwe in a manner consistent with this profile, as she has come to the attention of the authorities as recently as [XXX] 2019. The panel finds that the claimant would resume these political and\/or anti-government activities in Zimbabwe should she return there as she has done this at her own risk for decades.\nSimilarly Situated Persons and Objective Basis\n[16] The claim is objectively based as per the country conditions documents. In the United States Department of State report at Item 2.1 of the National Documentation Package it says that the government of Zimbabwe restricts the rights to freedom of association and that ZANU-PF supporters, sometimes with government support or acquiescence intimidated and harassed members of organizations perceived to be associated with other political parties.\n[17] Another document which is at item 10.1 of the National Documentation Package and which was published in June 2019 and which is called, On the Days of Darkness in Zimbabwe, an Updated Report on the Human Rights Violations committed between January 14, 2019 and February 5th, 2019 states as follows,\n\u201cThe Zimbabwean army unlawfully deployed into the streets and residential areas where it unleashed a reign of terror on anyone they came across. The Human Rights NGO Forum published a report which details more than 1800 such violations of human rights since January 14, 2019 across the whole country. This was in response to mass protests among the Zimbabwean population in January 2019 following an increase in fuel prices\u201d.\n[18] Another document, which is part of the National Documentation Package at Item 4.7 of the National Documentation Package, which is a British document called, Country Information and Policy Notes, Zimbabwe Opposition to the Government, also published in 2019, states that,\n\u201cThe ruling ZANU-PF uses the state security apparatus to harass and intimidate those in opposition to it. The levels of politically motivated violence and human rights violations by state security forces and ZANU-PF supporters, fluctuate with recent peaks. With regards to those perceived to have been in the opposition to the government at the time of the January 2019 demonstrations, it is established that they faced serious human rights violations against them. This was followed by further direct targeting of opposition, perceived opposition and NGOs which continued after the initial violence through house raids, arrests and detentions.\u201d\n[19] This is very close to the experience of the claimant.\n[20] Moving to the question of state protection, the panel finds that state protection in Zimbabwe would not be forthcoming in this case as the claimant fears the Zimbabwean state itself. That state has already abused her rights to political expression and freedom of association and assembly.\n[21] The Zimbabwe government is described in the United States Department of State report as only taking limited steps towards potential consequences for security sector officials who committed human rights violations. This document states that impunity remained a problem in this regard. The presumption of state protection has, therefore, been rebutted based on the objective country conditions information.\n[22] Moving to the last question, which is whether there is an internal flight alternative where the claimant would not face a serious possibility of persecution, the panel finds that the analysis of internal flight alternative fails on the first prong as the claimant, on a balance of probabilities does face a serious possibility of persecution throughout Zimbabwe as a result of her profile and of the stated country conditions information.\n[23] In conclusion, having considered all of the evidence, the panel determines that there is a serious possibility that the claimant would be persecuted in Zimbabwe for her political opinion. Her claim is accepted.\n\u2014 DECISION CONCLUDED\n\n",

The claimant claims to be a citizen of Haiti and is claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).1\nDETERMINATION\n[2] Having considered all of the evidence, the panel determines that, on a balance of probabilities, the claimant would face a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in Haiti.\n[3] Its reasons are as follows:\nALLEGATIONS\n[4] The claimant\u2019s complete allegations are set out in the Basis of Claim Form (BOC)2 and need not be repeated here in detail.\n[5] To summarize briefly, the claimant was targeted by organized crime after refusing to give up his XXXX to the members of this organized crime group. The claimant was employed by [XXX] in Haiti. He was employed as a [XXX] (in Port\u00adau-Prince), a dangerous area overrun by bandits. He testified that his work involved [XXX]\n[6] On [XXX] 2019, while working, the claimant was approached by a stranger. The man asked him to give him his [XXX]. The claimant refused, explaining the procedure involved in handing over an [XXX]. The stranger became furious and threatened him. Strangers started asking the security guards at work about the claimant.\n[7] On [XXX] 2019, while at the [XXX], the claimant was called out by an individual who took an interest in his [XXX]. This person knew when the claimant\u2019s work shift ended, and the name of the person assigned to the following shift. Out of fear, the claimant remained at the [XXX] for several hours after his shift ended, until he felt it was less risky to leave the [XXX].\n[8] After this incident, the claimant took precautions in his means of transportation to work. Eventually, the situation became too stressful and the claimant quit his job on [XXX] 2019. He did so as he thought that quitting the job would put an end to his troubles.\n[9] On [XXX] 2019, while exiting [XXX], two persons gestured for him to stop his car. These persons shot in the direction of the car. The claimant sought state protection from the police in [XXX] on [XXX] 2019, to no avail. He does not know if the police investigated his complaint. The claimant moved to be away from his wife and daughter. He did this to keep them safe. Despite his move, on [XXX] 2019 a car chased him at high speed on the [XXX] highway. The car went out of its way to reach him. The claimant left Haiti on [XXX] 2019 on a plane ticket paid for by his sister. He landed in [XXX] USA, and made his way to Canada. His claim was referred at the Port of Entry on Aug 29, 2019.\n[10] The claimant fears being killed by the bandits who tried to kill him on [XXX] 2019 and [XXX] 2019.\n[11] The claimant also alleges risk to his life, risk of torture or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment at the hands of the same agent of harm\n[12] The claimant alleges that neither state protection nor safe and reasonable internal flight alternatives are available in his country of nationality.\nANALYSIS:\n[13] The main issue is internal flight alternative (\u201cIFA\u201d).\nIdentity\n[14] The claimant\u2019s national identity has been established by the testimony and supporting documentation filed and entered in these proceedings. The current passport is on file, along with other documents. The panel is satisfied of the claimant\u2019s identity.\nNexus\n[15] For the claimant to be a Convention refugee, the fear of persecution must be \u201cby reason of\u2019 one of the five grounds enumerated in the Convention refugee definition. In other words, the claimant must have a well- founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion.\n[16] There are numerous Federal Court cases which have held that victims of crime, corruption[1], or vendettas[2] generally fail to establish a link between their fear of persecution and one of the five grounds in the definition of Convention refugee.\n[17] The panel finds that the harm feared by the claimant is not by reason of one of the five grounds enumerated in the Convention refugee definition. The panel finds that the allegations concern criminal acts perpetrated against the claimant for reasons not related to a nexus. The panel shall therefore analyse the claim under section 97(1).\nCredibility\n[18] When credibility is assessed there are two principles that are followed. Firstly, when a claimant swears to the truthfulness of certain facts3 there is a presumption that what he is saying is true unless there is reason to doubt it. Secondly, when assessing credibility the panel is entitled to rely on rationality and common sense4. The determination as to whether a claimant\u2019s evidence is credible is made on a balance of probabilities.\n[19] The claimant\u2019s allegations do not run contrary to generally known facts. The claimant was interviewed by CBSA at the border5. The claimant\u2019s statements during the interview are consistent with his BOC allegations. In fact, they provide detail which adds to the credibility of the allegations. This adds to the credibility of the claimant as a witness. The claimant\u2019s testimony at the hearing was consistent with his allegations. The testimony was spontaneous and direct. He has documented his allegations. The claimant is credible.\nS. 97 ANALYSIS\n[20] Section 97 is based on an objective assessment of risk, and the evidence must establish a specific, individualized risk for a claimant rather than generalized human rights violations in a country. Being a victim of crime does not make someone automatically qualify under section 97. There must be evidence establishing, on the balance of probabilities, that the claimant would be subjected personally to a danger of torture, a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. In addition, to succeed under s. 97(1)(b), the claimant must also establish that the risk they face is not faced generally by others in or from the country.\n[21] The panel finds that the claimant would be subjected personally to a risk to life, or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in Haiti because of criminals\u2019 interest in getting back at him since his refusal to give them his [XXX] in [XXX] 2019. The panel further finds that the claimant\u2019s risk is not faced generally by others in or from Haiti.\n[22] The claimant does not name the criminals who have targeted him. But these criminals\u2019 continued threats against him would, the panel finds, reasonably point to one same group of criminals who are targeting him. On a balance of probabilities, the panel accepts that the threats were by the same group of criminals targeting the claimant. This is because the claimant was specifically targeted by people who knew his identity, his schedule and his whereabouts. These criminals tracked and targeted him by threatening and attacking him, trying to shoot at him and run him off the road. This targeting carried over during various months and in various locations. There is no evidence that the claimant had any other problems with criminals in Haiti. People in Haiti are susceptible to crime and violence, but the claimant in this case the evidence establishes that the claimant was individually and specifically targeted by the same group of criminals.\n[23] Moreover, the events described go well beyond the general situation of gang crime or organised crime that is prevalent in Haiti. Even after the claimant quit his job as an [XXX] at the [XXX] in [XXX] 2019, he continued to be targeted, notably outside of [XXX], while on the road to [XXX] This was after he moved from his home in [XXX] 2019. This is relevant as he no longer had access to the [XXX] which was the starting point for the criminals\u2019 interest in him in [XXX] 2019. The risk shifted to the claimant independently of whether his employment makes him of interest to the criminals. The risk has also now shifted independently of whether the claimant works in the area where he was first threatened. It is a risk that is more significant and more direct than that faced by others in Haiti.\n[24] In sum, the panel finds on a balance of probabilities that the claimant would be subjected personally to a risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in Haiti that is not faced generally by others in or from Haiti.\n[25] The risk he faces started as a risk resulting from his employment as a [XXX] for [XXX] at the [XXX]. That risk has now evolved to a specific, individualized risk that is unrelated to his employment as the risk is about him alone. That risk is not faced generally by large segments of the population in Haiti.\nSimilarly situated persons and objective basis\n[26] The objective country conditions evidence contains various documents on the harm faced by someone who has an unsettled score with gangs or other criminal elements6. The Board\u2019s Response to Information Request (RIR) on Acts of Revenge committed by gangs or by other organized crime entities7 provides relevant information on the objective basis of this claim. Several sources in this RIR state that gangs and armed groups commit acts of revenge in Haiti. These acts of revenge are described as one of the methods of control used by gang leaders. Independently of their connection to gangs, criminals reportedly also commit acts of revenge. The perpetrators of acts of revenge may be guns for hire who work for others. Given the number of sources cited in this RIR, the panel gives this information significant weight. The information it provides is in conformity with other documents on file on the country conditions in Haiti.\n[27] Having established the prevalence of acts of revenge committed in Haiti by a variety of actors, the panel turns to the question of the motive for these acts of revenge. They are described, still in this same RIR, as occurring for a variety of reasons. Among these reasons is wanting to punish or dissuade those who oppose armed groups, and to settle scores. According to one source, those who report criminals to the police are particularly targeted. The panel notes that the claimant did file a police report. Acts of revenge are generally described as including murder and other grievous acts.\n[28] As for the ability to track down victims, the principal means described in the same RIR is word of mouth. The RIR refers to the effectiveness of different ways of locating people in Haiti. In addition, it reports that anyone outside a one\u2019s small area will be quickly recognised. People in Haiti are reportedly \u201cgenerally well aware of their neighbours\u2019 business\u201d8. The ability to track someone reportedly persists for years when a gang remains interested in that person. Some victims of acts of revenge have reported that the police helped assailants locate them.\n[29] Based on all of the stated evidence, the panel finds that there is an objective basis to the claim.\nState Protection:\n[30] Claimants must show, on a balance of probabilities, that adequate State Protection is not available. The issue before the panel was whether it was objectively unreasonable for the claimant(s) to have sought state protection. While states are presumed to be capable of protecting their nationals, it was open to the claimant(s), according to the law, to rebut the presumption of protection with \u201cclear and convincing\u201d evidence.\n[31] The claimant sought state protection to no avail. This is consistent with the available country conditions evidence.\n[32] Several items of the NDP9 mention the inability of the police in Haiti to protect the people of Haiti. Corruption and impunity for crimes are described as being widespread in Haiti. One document references the French OFPRA report, which explains that: \u201cThe capabilities of the Haitian National Police are not sufficient, both in terms of the number of police officers who are mainly present in the capital, and in terms of the equipment available to the police, noting in particular the lack of fuel, cars and computers. \u00bb In the same vein, it states that \u201cHaiti\u2019s National Police has a limited response capacity and lacks the resources to complete investigations, which compromises the deterrent effect on criminals who act without fear of the police authorities.\u201d The document also indicates that the police are notable to protect themselves from criminals in Haiti. When the panel considers the entirety of the evidence on country conditions in Haiti, it finds that the claimant could not avail himself of adequate state protection in Haiti. The presumption of state protection has been rebutted.\nInternal Flight Alternative (IFA):\n[33] The IFAs of [XXX] were suggested at the hearing. Having heard the evidence the panel finds that the analysis of IFA fails on the first prong. The panel finds that the people who have targeted the claimant could locate the claimant in an IFA. As seen in the section on risk under section 97(1), the agents of harm have demonstrated their motivation to pursue the claimant outside of [XXX]. They have also demonstrated their motivation to pursue him over time. As seen in the section above on the objective basis, the social and neighbourhood networks in Haiti would make it possible for the agents of harm to locate him in the proposed IFAs. The panel finds that, on a balance of probabilities, the claimant faces a risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in the proposed IFA \u2013 s. 97(1) and throughout Haiti, which is a geographically small country.\nCONCLUSION\n[34] Having considered all of the evidence, the panel determines that, on a balance of probabilities, the claimant would face a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in Haiti.\n[35] The claimant is credible.\n[36] The panel concludes that the claimant is a person in need of protection and the panel therefore accepts their claim.\n(signed) Miryam Molgat\nOctober 19, 2020\n[1] Leon, Johnny Edgar Orellana v.

The former habitual residences for the other claimants is Oman as well as Gaza..\nAllegations\n[5] You fear return to Gaza because you fear political persecution at the hands of Hamas. You\u2019ve been involved with the [XXX] in the past when you lived in Gaza and you were subjected to a militia attack against the radio station in which you were physically harmed, including on your right leg and right arm.\n[6] You were also detained twice by Hamas forces and during which time you were physically and psychologically abused during both of those detentions.\n[7] You\u2019ve also given testimony regarding your status in Libya and Oman as the principal claimant, that you were a child when you left Libya, when Khadafi forced out the Palestinians and you\u2019ve also testified that more recently you were forced to leave Oman when you were terminated from your work as a [XXX] in Oman.\n[8] Further details are found in your Basis of Claims forms, some of which I will highlight in this decision.\n[9] I also note that I have applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline Number 4 with respect to victims of gender-based persecution, specifically for the joint claimant [XXX] and the three joint minor claimants which are girls.\nDetermination\n[10] I find for the principal claimant, [XXX], the joint claimants, [XXX] that you are Convention refugees pursuant to section 96 of the Act for the reasons that follow.\n[11] With respect to the two joint minor claimants [XXX], I find that they are neither Convention refugees pursuant to section 96 nor persons in need of protection pursuant to section 97 because there is not sufficient evidence with respect to the claim against the United States.\n[12] You testified today as their designated representative. The principal claimant you were the designated representative for all of your children and you testified that with respect to the United States your concern was family separation, that you did not want to be separated from your two minor sons who were born in the United States.\n[13] When I asked you for more examples or details or asked you directly about either persecution for your two boys in the United States or a risk to their lives in the United States, you testified that you did not have those concerns against the United States for your boys and it was more about family separation.\n[14] Accordingly, I find that their claims are not established either as a serious possibility of persecution in the United States or on a balance of probabilities that they face a person risk to their lives, or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in the United States.\n[15] As I\u2019ve indicated earlier, identity has been established by copies of your passports.\n[16] With respect to credibility, you both testified in a straightforward and consistent manner today and I find that you are both credible witnesses.\n[17] You also provided corroborative documentation in support of your claim at Exhibit 4 and this included a number of item, including letters from the [XXX] and human rights organizations supporting the attack as well as the summons that you\u2019ve received in 2007, in 2010 and further summons from Hamas authorities in 2016 and 2018.\n[18] You also submitted a medical report from [XXX] 2010 as well as \u2013 as I\u2019ve indicated \u2013 a letter from the [XXX] supporting your work with the [XXX].\n[19] You\u2019ve also provided the termination letter from your employer in Oman and I find that your corroborative evidence also supports your testimony today and supports your credibility.\n[20] For you, the principal claimant, you gave testimony regarding your time in Gaza as a young man, your time with the [XXX]. You also gave testimony regarding engaging in peaceful demonstrations against the human rights abuses by Hamas. You were around 25 years at that time.\n[21] You also gave consistent testimony about the physical abuse that you suffered while you were in detention \u2013 and psychological abuse \u2013 hitting, beatings, being forces to sit on small chair for extended periods of time, also including psychological abuse during that time.\n[22] You also testified that you did receive some medical help including medication and at least five sessions of counselling after you were released that time from detention.\n[23] Based on the totality of the evidence before me, I find that you have established a nexus to political opinion with respect to your fears of Hamas in Gaza.\n[24] The international law and the refugee law as adopted here in Canada for Stateless Palestinians requires that you must demonstrate that you have a well-founded fear of persecution in one of the former habitual residences and that you are unable to return to any of the former habitual residences, and I find that you have met this legal test.\n[25] You have demonstrated through reliable evidence that you have a serious possibility, a well-founded fear of persecution in Gaza if you were to return today and you\u2019ve also given sufficient evidence that you have no right of return either in Libya or Oman which are also former habitual residences for you.\n[26] Accordingly, I find that you have established your case under section 96.\n[27] Now, for your spouse, [XXX] and your three daughters \u2013 your three daughters [XXX] I find that they have also a nexus under a Convention ground, specifically membership in a particular social group, not only as family members to you, a victim of political persecution, but also because of gender.\n[28] Your wife and you both gave credible testimony with respect to your fears for your daughters because they are girls. It\u2019s not just because they\u2019re Palestinian, it\u2019 s also because of the different treatment that girls and women receive both in Oman and in Gaza; so restrictions on travel, restrictions on their freedom of movement \u2013 not being able to leave the home without males or permission, also not able to dress how they wish. As you testified, even as children, young girls are forced to wear the hijab in Gaza and you\u2019ve testified that you do not wish to have your young girls forced to wear the hijab, that they may not have the understanding of religion until they\u2019re a little bit older and that you\u2019re against this mandatory rule by some of the authorities both in Oman and in Gaza.\n[29] Accordingly, I find that the joint female claimants also have a nexus to gender, membership in a particular social group and that you would face a serious possibility of persecution if you return to Gaza today.\n[30] The test is the same for you and your daughters as stateless Palestinians; that you must have a well-founded fear in one of the former habitual residences and be unable to return to any of the former habitual residences.\n[31] For you, you lived in Gaza, that is a former habitual residence for you and I find that you have established a well-founded fear if you were to return to Gaza today.\n[32] For your daughters, I also find that they have established a well-founded fear in Oman, as young girls, as Palestinian young girls, who would not have freedom of movement, who would face ongoing discrimination not only because of their heritage as Palestinians, but also because of their gender and would not have freedom of movement or even freedom to control their own bodies or wear what they wish in Oman as well.\n[33] They would also face a forward-looking serious possibility of persecution and based on the totality of the evidence I find that you\u2019ve each established that also do not have a right of return, to return to either Oman or, of course, we\u2019ve indicated already the persecution in Palestine due to your husband\u2019s detentions and the threats that were made by Haas authorities directly against his family members to intimidate him during detention as well.\n[34] With respect to state protection and internal flight alternative, the objective evidence in the National Documentation Package also supports your testimonies today. For example, the National Documentation Package item 2.1 which is a US Department of State Report with respect to Gaza and the Palestinian-occupied territories indicates that Hamas is responsible for unlawful and arbitrary killings, reports of systematic torture, reports of arbitrary detention, political prisoners, arbitrary unlawful interference with privacy, family and home, undue restrictions on freedom of expression, undue restrictions on freedom of the press and journalists and radio, substantial interference with rights to peaceful assembly and freedom of association, significant restrictions on freedom of movement, restrictions on political participation \u2014 there has been no national election since 2006 \u2014 corruption, unlawful recruitment of child soldiers, threats of violence motivated by anti-Semitism, violence or threats also targeting women, and women are also discriminated further with respect to their dress and even further restrictions on their freedom of movement as well in the Hamas-controlled Gaza.\n[35] National Documentation Package item 10.6, a Human Rights Watch Report 2018 reiterates much of the same evidence and gives more specific details with respect to the kind of physical and psychological persecution that the Hamas authorities mete out against their detainees which is consistent with your testimony.\n[36] This report indicates that the Hamas authorities in Gaza will blindfold detainees. They\u2019ll force them stand or they force them to sit in small chairs for extended periods of time, usually during interrogations, to pressure them to confess. Detainees cannot speak, move, take medicine, sleep or eat without the permission of the guards.\n[37] The torture as practiced by the Palestinian Authority as well as Hamas may amount to crimes against humanity given its systemic practice over many years.\n[38] The National Documentation Package with respect to Oman \u2013 and this is somewhat dated in the National Documentation Package but you\u2019ve also given credible testimony which is more recent given your previous residence in Oman. Nonetheless, it is somewhat dated. This is a document from 2014 unfortunately. It\u2019s also a United States Department of State Report, also indicates the restrictions on women\u2019 s freedom of movement and restrictions on women\u2019s dress by authorities in Oman.\n[39] It also indicates that the government does not protect refugees in Oman, tight control over the entry of foreigners, limited access to protection for refugees in Oman. The authorities apprehend and deport hundreds of presumed economic migrants. It also will deport people if they don\u2019t have authorized status by the employer, all consistent with your testimony today.\n[40] Also, it indicates a lack of access to basic services, so without an official sponsor \u2013 which is what you testified to with respect to an employer \u2013 it\u2019 s very difficult for foreigners to have any access to basic services and this is somewhat dated but there were deportations as well as those who voluntarily chose to leave because of the conditions and treatment by the authorities in Oman.\n[41] So, I find that this evidence also supports not only the objective basis for your fears of return to Gaza and the kinds of persecution will suffer there if you return to Gaza today, but it also supports the lack of operationally effective state protection in Gaza for you as well.\n[42] With respect to internal flight alternative, as you\u2019ve testified and as the objective evidence indicates, Gaza is a very small area controlled by Hamas at this time and very difficult \u2013 any kind of movement out or in is under the control of Hamas at this time and given that Hamas is the group that you fear and the group that has targeted you directly and has also made threats against your family members I find that it is neither safe nor objectively reasonable in all of the circumstances, including your particular circumstances to expect you to try to relocate somewhere within Gaza which is a very small, tightly-controlled area by Hamas and accordingly there is no internal flight alternative available to you in your particular circumstances.\nConclusion\n[43] For the foregoing reasons, I determine that principal claimant, [XXX], the joint claimant, [XXX] the joint claimants [XXX] are Convention refugees pursuant to section 96 and the Board therefore accepts your claim.\n[44] This is a split decision and I also find that with respect to the joined minor claimants [XXX] they are not Convention refugees pursuant to section 96 of the Act nor are they persons in need of protection pursuant to section 97(1) of the Act as US citizens.\n[45] As I\u2019ve indicated there\u2019s not sufficient evidence to make out that claim today against the United States of America. Accordingly, the Board rejects their claims.\n[46] Thank you very much. I wish you and your family all of the best. Thank you counsel. Have a good day everyone. Thank you very much.\n\u2014PROCEEDINGS CONCLUDED\n\n",

Its reasons are as follows.\nAllegations\n[3] The claimant\u2019s complete allegations are set out in the Basis of Claim form and need not be repeated here in detail. To summarize briefly, the claimant is a man born in Cuba [XXX], he is from a place called [XXX]. His claim is based on his political opinion as a perceived \u201ccounter-revolutionary\u201d, he has suffered at the hands of the Cuban government who threatened to throw him in jail. On one occasion an agent told him that if he wanted he could easily end up dead in a jail cell. The claimant believes the agent was implying he could easily have him killed, the claimant yearns for freedom of expression. He became known in high school for defending his classmates rights, he would refuse to join the [XXX] in the Spanish acronym. As a result, he was unable to study medicine simply because of his political opinion not his grades. He and his family complained without any result. After he finished his two-year compulsory military service he was denied training in fields of his interest, there was no reason provided for the refusal, he believes it was because of his perceived political opinion. In 2014, while working as a [XXX] he was questioned by the police for refusing to participate in regime celebrations linked to the Committee of Revolutionary Defense. Those who refuse to donate to the celebration were threatened with losing their jobs. While questioned by the police the claimant was punched in the face, he complained about it after he was released but there was no follow up by the authorities. After this, it became impossible for the climant-, the claimant to find a job, this was because he was marked as a counter\u00ad revolutionary. He started working as a [XXX], he continued to have problems with the police. The claimant tried to leave Cuba illegally on [XXX] 2015 but was forced to paddle back to shore. His parents then received a visit by officials looking for boat parts, his parents complained to the authorities in vain. The claimant went to the town of Trinidad-,\n[4] INTERPRETER: (Inaudible) so just a moment.\n[5] MEMBER: No-, ok.\n[6] INTERPRETER: Nine\n[7] MEMBER: Ok just a minute because I haven\u2019t read Paragraph 8 yet ok. So, I\u2019m just-, I\u2019ll try and speak more slowly so I\u2019ll, I\u2019ll say Paragraph 8 and then we can continue together.\n[8] INTERPRETER: Ok, I\u2019ve just finished 8.\n[9] MEMBER: Ok.\n[10] MEMBER: So, the claimant went to the town of Trinidad Cuba where he worked as a [XXX], a few months later he started getting visits from people who knew about every single aspect of his file in [XXX]. They would ask him to work for them, he did not want to, he realized he could not be safe in Cuba. Ok, so, the claimant tried to leave Cuba illegally on [XXX] 2016, he and his friends bought a boat, they had to give up and return to land as the cheap engine seized. He was detained upon returning to Cuba but not jailed, police boss [XXX] was the presumed author of the police operation. In [XXX] 2017 the claimant started studying to be a [XXX], he also started studying [XXX] at university. Everything was fine for a year until he was contacted by [XXX] in [XXX] 2018, he wanted the claimant\u2019s help in finding a robber. [XXX] said the claimant have a large police file, he warned him he would be jailed for five years if he failed to co-, cooperate. The claimant relented offering to help, he was so pressured he stopped going to university, he returned to [XXX] to his family. The claimant went to Havana where he took advantage of a Panamanian law allowing Cubans to travel there without a visa, he bought a ticket with his tips, he arrived in [XXX]. He immediately traveled to [XXX], once there, a man said he could help him get to Canada, at the airport the man handed him a passport. The claimant has relatives in Canada, the claimant\u2019s cousin has also arrived in Canada, another cousin had to leave Cuba on account of his pro-LGBT activism. The claimant left Cuba on [XXX] 2019, in Cuba he still has his parents and siblings, his claim was referred in [XXX] 2019. The claimant also alleges fear of risk to his life, risk of torture or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment of the hands of the same agent of harm. The claimant alleges that neither state protection or safe and reasonable internal flight alternatives are available in his country of nationality.\nANALYSIS\n[11] The main issue is credibility.\nIdentity\n[12] The claimant\u2019s national identity has been established by the testimony and supporting documentation filed and entered in these proceedings. The current passport is on file along with other documents, the Panel is satisfied of the claimant\u2019s identity.\nNexus\n[13] For the claimant to be a Convention refugee the fear of persecution must be by reason of one of the five grounds enumerated in the Convention refugee definition. In other words, the claimant must have a well\u00ad founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion. The Panel finds that the harm feared by the claimant is by reason of one of the five grounds enumerated in the Convention refugee definition, namely his political opinion opposed to the government of Cuba.\nCredibility\n[14] When credibility is assessed there are two principles that are followed. Firstly, when a claimant swears to the truthfulness of certain facts there is a presumption that what he is saying is true unless there is reason to doubt it. Secondly, when assessing credibility, the panel is entitled to rely on rationality and common sense. The determination as to whether a claimant\u2019s evidence is credible is made on a balance of probabilities. The claimant was credible, his allegations do not run counter to generally known facts, his testimony was direct, it was consistent with his BOC allegations. His Exhibit 1 handwritten statement is consistent with his BOC allegations, he has supported his allegations with corroborating documents in counsel disclosure.\nSubjective Fear\n[15] The claimant failed to make an asylum claim in Panama or Costa Rica, this is not determinative given that he is credible. He provided a reasonable explanation for his failure to make a claim in panama or Costa Rica, namely that he has family in Canada, he has no family in Panama or Costa Rica. His relationship with his uncle in Canada is established via the documents on file.\nSimilarly Situated persons and Objective Basis\n[16] The government of Cuba persecutes those they believe are in political opposition and represses political dissent. There are serious consequences for those who criticize the government or express views that are in opposition to the government. The US Department of State report, which is NDP Item 2.1 states the government of Cuba has little tolerance for political criticism of government officials or programs and limits public debate on issues that are considered to be politically sensitive. The US Department of State also discusses severe restrictions on freedom of association, assembly and freedom of speech. In the NDP Item 2.6 from Freedom House it says that, political dissent is a punishable offence and dissidents are systematically harassed, detained, physically assaulted and frequently imprisoned for minor infractions. NDP Item 2.4 states this, the government continues to use other repressive tactics including beatings, public shaming, travel restrictions and termination of employment against critics. The Panel finds that there is an objective basis for the targeting of the claimant by the authorities of Cuba.\nState Protection\n[17] Claimant\u2019s must show on a balance of probabilities that adequate state protection is not available. The issue before the Panel was whether it was objectively unreasonable for the claimant to have sought state protection. The objective country conditions evidence on Cuba demonstrate that there is no available state protection for the claimant in Cuba, the claimant fears the Cuban State itself. His experiences establish his past persecution by the State.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[18] There is no internal flight alternative if the claimant faces a serious possibility of persecution throughout Cuba, the Cuban authorities control their whole territory.\nCONCLUSION\n[19] Having considered all of the evidence, the Panel determines that there is a serious possibility that the claimant would be persecuted in Cuba for one of the five grounds enumerated in the refugee Convention, namely, political opinion. Having come to this conclusion, the Panel has not conducted further assessment under Section 97(1) of the Act. The Panel concludes that the claimant is a Convention refugee and the Panel therefore accepts the claim.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n",

I have considered and applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guidelines on Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution. As a preliminary matter you applied for late disclosure of a document, your employment contract, it\u2019s relevant, probative, one relatively brief document which I was able to review completely before the hearing, it\u2019s late admission does not prejudice any party and you provided a, I find, reasonable explanation for the late disclosure. Considering all of the relevant factors I accepted the document into evidence and added it to the list of documents as Exhibit 5.\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] Very briefly, you allege the following. When you were young, about [XXX], you got a job as a [XXX] at a law firm to help pay for your university. You worked there as a [XXX]\n[4] The firm employed two drivers on staff, the drivers were there to drive partners, associates and sometimes yourself when needed for work. One of the drivers was a man named [XXX]. He drove you sometimes including giving you rides sometimes to your university where you took classes in the evening after working a full workday at the law firm.\n[5] On one occasion, [XXX] drove you to his home and sexually assaulted you after drugging you. When he was finished, he threatened you and told you that if you told anyone, if his wife and family found out he would kill you.\n[6] You went to the hospital, you were examined, you went to the police and reported the sexual assault. The police said they would get back to you if things progressed. You waited 11 months without hearing anything from the police. And from what you know from hearing about other women it\u2019s happened to, that\u2019s not unusual.\n[7] You did not tell anyone at your work, and you were afraid. You have not told your family. You did tell some of your friends at university, they told you that they had heard from [XXX] who he knew from dropping you off at the university that you had initiated a sexual encounter. They blamed you and insulted you calling you a slut.\n[8] You have seen [XXX] just on the road outside of work, although you actively avoided contact with him on that occasion. You fear that if you were to return to Rwanda [XXX] could carry out his threat to kill you if his wife or family finds out.\n[9] After the sexual assault, you noted that you have been not just uncomfortable around men, but you have actively avoided being in the company of men. And comparing your experiences around men in Rwanda after the sexual assault to your experiences around men in Canada, even in Canada you are not comfortable or able to internet comfortably with men.\n[10] You fear that if you were to return to Rwanda, you might be sexually assaulted again. You don\u2019t know much about [XXX]; you don\u2019t know anything about his family. You only know him through work.\nDETERMINATION\n[11] I find that you are a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[12] I find that you are a citizen of Rwanda, you\u2019ve provided in Exhibit 1 a copy of your current Rwandan passport with the still-valid multi-entry Canadian visa that you used to enter Canada.\nCredibility\n[13] I find that you are a credible witness and I accept your allegations. You\u2019ve testified in a responsive, meaningful and spontaneous manner. You have not taken opportunities to tailor or to exaggerate your evidence. Your evidence is consistent with the other evidence before me.\n[14] You have provided some documents to corroborate your allegations, in particular, you\u2019ve provided a copy of your employment contract corroborating your work with the Lawfirm. You\u2019ve also provided a copy of the medical report from the hospital following your complaint. The report is consistent with a complaint and investigation resulting from a sexual assault.\n[15] I note that a recent Federal Court decision, Volasko Chavaro (phonetic) -v- Canada [2020]\n[16] FC310 speaks to the issue of the delay in filing a refugee claim after arriving in Canada. The court finds, and I agree, that any finding on credibility based only on that delay in cases of sexual assault relies on,\n\u201cThe discredited and stereotypical myth that all women who are victims of sexual assault react in the same manner and will report a sexual assault in a timely manner. This is an ancient but rejected stereotypical myth about victims of sexual assault known as the Doctrine of Recent Complaint. For the reasons that follow, I find this Doctrine should form no part of Canada\u2019s Immigration Law. The Doctrine of Recent Complaint was thoroughly discredited decades ago because it is demonstrably false and because it is sexist being almost universally applied against female victims of sexual violence. It has been rejected by both the courts and Parliament in the context of criminal law. It has been denounced by this court in the immigration context\u201d.\n[17] The decision goes on to state that it should not be applied in a refugee context as a way to find a claimant uncredible simply because, in a case of sexual assault, it took a period of time to gather the courage to come forward to seek protection.\nNexus\n[18] I find that there is a nexus between the persecution alleged and the Convention ground of membership in a particular social group as a woman whose a victim of gender-based violence or GBV.\n[19] At tab 5.3 is a report by the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women. That report states,\n\u201cThe Committee welcomes the awareness-raising measures taken by the State party (meaning Rwanda\u2019s Government) to address discriminatory stereotypes about the roles and responsibilities of women and men in the family and in society. However, the Committee is concerned that those measures insufficiently tackle the prevalence of deep-rooted patriarchal attitudes and stereotypes that give a higher status to men and boys and the resulting subordination of women and girls, which undermines their social status, autonomy, educational opportunities and professional careers, as well as constitutes a underlying cause of gender-based violence against women\u201d.\n[20] Women are seen in Rwanda as a group, as a particular group, based on their gender and subject to, as the report states, deep-rooted patriarchal attitudes which not only hinder their lives in a variety of aspects, but also leave women particularly vulnerable to violence as gender-based violence.\nWell-founded Fear of Persecution\n[21] You have testified that you fear persecution if you return to Rwanda. I accept your testimony and so I accept that you do have a subjective fear of persecution.\n[22] Considering all of the evidence before me in this particular case, I find that your subjective fear is objectively well-founded.\n[23] I am satisfied, considering all of the evidence before me in this claim, that you would face a serious risk of persecution as a woman if you were to return to Rwanda.\n[24] I do not find that that serious risk of persecution is specific to Isaac. Considering all of the evidence, including the documentary evidence, I find that the serious risk is from men in Rwandan society in general, not tied to one particular man.\n[25] Returning to the United Nations Committee Report at tab 5.3, the report states,\n\u201cThe Committee appreciates the measures taken by the State party to eliminate gender-based violence against women and provide assistance to victims, including the adoption of the National Policy Against Gender-Based Violence and a corresponding strategic plan and the establishment of the Asanji (phonetic) One-Stop Centres Anti-Gender-Based Violence Clubs in schools that involve both girls and boys and gender desks in the Rwandan National Police and the Rwanda Defence Force. The Committee notes with concern, however, that the number of women who are victims of gender-based violence including sexual violence is particularly high in the State party. It is further concerned that (a) gender-based violence against women is widely accepted by society, a situation that is exacerbated by the common perception that the traditional patriarchal system is under threat and younger men are inclined to consider that it is justified to beat their wives; (b) gender-based violence against women is largely under-reported because of the victims fear of stigma, retaliation and women\u2019s economic dependence on the perpetrator as well as their lack of awareness of their rights and how to claim them, and continues; (f) the resources allocated to the provision of medical, psychological and legal assistance to victims are insufficient\u201d.\n[26] At tab 2.5 is a report by the National Commission for Human Rights. That report specifically states that women and daughters with mental-illness are victims of gender-based violence such as sexual abuse.\n[27] At tab 5.6 is a report from Rwanda\u2019s National Institute of Statistics on Gender Statistics. That report finds that 14-percent of women aged 15 to 49-years-old experienced physical violence within the 12 months proceeding the report. And 35 experienced physical violence since the age of 15.\n[28] Statistically, according to the report, 22-percent, or more than one in five women, have experienced sexual violence since the age of 15, and eight percent, or almost one in 10, experienced sexual violence within the 12 months proceeding the date of the report.\n[29] Of those women the proportion of women subjected to sexual violence by persons other than an intimate partner was 60.9, a significant amount of sexual violence against women in Rwanda comes from non-intimate partners, either friends, associates or strangers.\n[30] Putting this all together, as noted by the United Nations and by Rwanda\u2019s own statistics, gender-based violence, including sexual assault against women in Rwanda is frequent and as noted occurs with general impunity. It is under-reported and despite the Government\u2019s show of action in passing laws and establishing programs and centres to assist women, many of these programs that would provide assistance to vulnerable women in need are underfunded and underutilized. In particular, women who are otherwise vulnerable, such as women with mental-health issues, have a greater risk of experiencing gender-based violence.\n[31] There\u2019s no evidence before me, there\u2019s no documentation that you suffer a diagnosed mental\u00ad health condition. However, you\u2019ve testified, and I accept that since the sexual assault, understandably, you are afraid around men and you avoid socially interacting with men. That will, I find, mark you as someone vulnerable. You are still very young; you have never lived independently. You\u2019ve had one job and\u2013 one job in Rwanda, and you were sexually assaulted within months of beginning that work.\n[32] You are \u2014 you\u2019re a very intelligent young woman, but you are still quite young, you haven\u2019t completed a university degree; you haven\u2019t lived independently. All of these factors make you vulnerable and increase your risk of further gender-based violence if you were to return.\n[33] Your experiences are consistent with the documentary evidence. Gender-based violence remains under reported and the laws prohibiting rape, sexual assault, work-place harassment, are not effectively enforced.\n[34] You, yourself, experienced a stigma, not even from the sexual assaulter and his peer group, but from your own peer group following the sexual assault because they took the word of your rapist over your own word, the word of their friend. They took the word of a man they didn\u2019t know that well over the word of a woman with whom they\u2019ve been friends and classmates.\n[35] Considering all of the evidence before me in this particular claim, in particular the high, as stated, particularly high pervasive rate of gender-based violence in Rwanda. The lack of effective protection from the State in large part due to entrenched patriarchal attitudes that justify gender-based violence against women. And your particular characteristics as a young woman who has already experienced not just gender-based violence, not just a sexual assault, but also the stigma, harassment and exclusion from your friends following that assault.\n[36] You haven\u2019t told your family and you don\u2019t want to move away from them because they would ask why, because you\u2019re afraid of your family\u2019s reaction.\n[37] Considering all of the evidence before me, I find that you do face a serious risk of persecution because of your gender if you were to return to Rwanda. That persecution might take the place \u2014 might take the form of another sexual assault. It might result, it might simply be constant, ongoing harassment and discrimination amounting to persecution.\n[38] At tab 5.1 \u2014 sorry, 5.4, is a report from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development on Rwanda, Social Institutions and Gender Index for 2019 which makes clear that, despite Rwanda\u2019s laws promoting gender equality, women are still subject to pervasive discrimination at home, at work, economically and at law. Not under the law, but when trying to access the protection of the law. This discrimination may certainly amount to persecution, particularly when it\u2019s combined with your individual factors as a young, dependent women, already the victim once of gender-based violence.\nState Protection\n[39] I find that adequate State protection would not be reasonably forthcoming. You have rebutted, in this case, the presumption of State protection.\n[40] You testified and I accept that you went to the police, they were dismissive and over a year, possibly more, the police took no action that you could see. There\u2019s no reason to expect that they have done more since. You were there, you were available. The criminal, the man who sexually assaulted you was there, the police could have investigated, nothing has happened.\n[41] That is not inconsistent with the documentary evidence. Going back to the report at tab 5.4 the OECD states,\n\u201cDespite these efforts GBV remains pervasive as it was widely accepted by the society as a result of entrenched traditional patriarchal norms. Although reporting rates for GBV cases have increased as a result of the Government\u2019s prevention and protection efforts, it remains under-reported due to victim\u2019s fear of stigma, retaliation and women\u2019s economic dependence on the perpetrator.\n[42] It goes on to state,\nWhile the MAJ\u2019s (Access to Justice Bureaus) provide a system of legal aid, there are no legal aid schemes for women that address their specific barriers in access to justice, including lack of economic independence and sociocultural norms that constrain them from filing a GBV or land-inheritance claims. The Government has identified lack of information about the legal system as a key constraint as women\u2019s access to justice\u201d.\n[43] Taking that into account, the Government has specifically identified lack of information as a key constraint on women\u2019s access to justice. However, as the U.N. report at tab 5.3 notes, a particular reason for concern about ongoing risk faced by women in Rwanda is that the resources allocated to the provision of medical, psychological and legal assistance to victims of gender-based violence are insufficient.\n[44] Gender-based violence remains particularly high, in the words of the U.N., in Rwanda. It remains under-reported despite the Government\u2019s efforts. And as you experienced and as you\u2019ve seen in other cases, even when reported it does not necessarily lead to \u2014 it does not reliably lead to enforcement of those laws and consequences for the perpetrator of gender\u00ad based violence.\n[45] So considering all of the information before me in this claim, I\u2019m satisfied you would not receive adequate State protection if you were to return to Rwanda.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[46] I find you do not have a viable internal flight alternative. I find that you would face a serious risk of persecution throughout Rwanda.\n[47] The factors that we\u2019ve discussed so far, the laws and the enforcement of the law, social attitudes and the prevalence of gender-based violence are not specific to Kigali, those are the general conditions that exist throughout Rwanda. If anything, one might expect that you would receive better assistance and better treatment in Kigali, the capital of the country and the largest city, the most metropolitan city, the centre of the Government. You\u2019ve lived in Kigali all your life and this is what happened. There\u2019s no reason to expect that conditions would be better in any other particular part of the country.\n[48] Also, if you were to relocate from Kigali, you would be even more vulnerable. You\u2019ve never lived outside Kigali; you\u2019ve never lived away from your parents. You have contact with some people in other cities, but it\u2019s limited distant contact. For example, you were in contact with an uncle whose passed away. If you were to relocate, you would face an even greater risk of persecution because you would be perceived as, and you would be, even more vulnerable.\n[49] In conclusion, for these reasons, considering all of the evidence before me in this claim, I find you would face a serious risk of persecution because of your membership in a particular social group, as a woman, a victim of gender-based violence, if you were to return to Rwanda. You have a subjective fear of persecution that is objectively well-founded. You would not receive adequate State protection and you do not have a viable internal flight alternative.\n[50] For these reasons, I accept your claim.\n[51] So that concludes my reasons for the decision. Thank you for your patience through this process and thank you for being here today.\n[52] Counsel, thank you very much for your presentation. And I wish you the best of luck in the future.\n[53] CLAIMANT: Thank you. I would like to thank you and appreciate everything. I really appreciate with that understanding and belief, it\u2019s very special.\n[54] PRESIDING MEMBER: It\u2019s simply the hearing that you are entitled to under the laws of Canada. So, thank the law, but thank you.\n\u2014 DECISION CONCLUDED\n\n",

Dookun\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Amro Hayek\nCountry: Lebanon\nRPD Number: TB9-25948\nAssociated RPD Numbers: TB9-25981, TB9-26023\nATIP Number: A-2021-00655\nATIP Pages: 000115-000118\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: Based on the information that I have in front of me folks, you Sir, are a [XXX] male. You\u2019re a Stateless Palestinian with a Lebanese travel document. Your wife is a [XXX] female. She\u2019s also a Stateless Palestinian with this-, but she has an Egyptian travel document and the minor claimant is a [XXX]-male and he is also a Stateless Palestinian and he also, like you Sir, has a Lebanese travel document. You are all seeking refugee protection pursuant to Sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. You Ma\u2019am, served as the designated representative for the minor claimant. I\u2019ll go slower Mr. Interpreter, it looks like you\u2019re having trouble hearing me. I can\u2019t hear you but it looks like you\u2019re having trouble so I\u2019ll go slower.\n[2] Now, the specific details of your claims are set out in your Basis of Claim form, Sir. If I were to simplify what is already in your Basis of Claim form, I would say Sir, that you and the minor claimant fear persecution in Lebanon based on your nationality as Palestinians. You Sir, also fear harm at the hands of Hizballah and I\u2019m going to spell that for the record because this is going to be transcribed. H-I-Z-B-A-L\u00ad L-A-H, because they threatened you in Lebanon in 2011. You feared that they would harm you and harm the minor child out of revenge in-, in order to hurt you. Your wife fears that she-, number one, she would not be allowed to enter Egypt and if she did, then she would face difficulties in Egypt due to her ethnicity as Palestinian as well as other reasons. So, the Panel determines folks, that you are all Convention refugees pursuant to Section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[3] Now, with regard to your identities, you established all of your identities by way of these certified true copies of your travel documents that I have in Exhibit 1 and you also provided birth certificates for me in Exhibit 5, so I have no concerns with regard to your personal identities.\n[4] Now, with regard to credibility, Ma\u2019am, you-, you didn\u2019t always testify in a straightforward manner. The Panel finds that you did exaggerate your testimony a little bit, especially when, regarding the difficulties in renewing your Egyptian travel document, you described an example of your father getting a number for the que at-, at 3am and that by the time you arrived at 9 am, you weren\u2019t seen because that number had passed. That\u2019s not-, the Panel does not see that as mistreatment per say. If a system is in place where one takes a number and waits for that number to be called and one is not there when the number is called, it\u2019 s not unreasonable that an organization would not take you after that point. It happens even here in Canada at the passport office so, I didn\u2019t-, I-, I felt that you did exaggerate a little bit.\n[5] So, I switched with you and I had your husband testify instead and I find Sir, that you did testify in a very straightforward manner. For example, when you were asked if you had any problems in Lebanon before 2011, you very directly, well, initially, you very directly answered no, you did not have any problems. You did not try to embellish or exaggerate your testimony at that point, which the Panel very much appreciated. Now, e-, even though it seemed later that you changed your testimony to indicate that you did experience problems in Lebanon, the Panel does not draw a negative inference and I\u2019ll tell you why. The first time I asked you, it was suggested that you were being asked whether you had problems with Hizballah before 2011 and you said directly, no. The que-, the second time I asked you, the question was very specific and I said, did you have problems in Lebanon because of your Palestinian nationality. Y-, that\u2019s when you said yes, you did have problems but then you explained that the problems that you experienced as a Palestinian in Lebanon, those problems were so common that you-, you got used to it. You tolerated it, so you didn\u2019t really consider it to be a problem. It was life for you as a Palestinian in Lebanon so I don\u2019t draw a negative inference with regard to the-, the slight change in what might appear to be the slight change in testimony.\n[6] When I asked you whether you-, what the fear was that you had for the minor claimant, you said that you only fear Hizballah and you didn\u2019t mention a fear of persecution by society because of the-, the child\u2019s Palestinian identity. Again, the Panel appreciates that you did not embellish or exaggerate your fear for the minor claimant. So, taking both testimonies into account, the Panel finds that there were no serious contradictions or inconsistencies contained within your testimonies and so the Panel has no serious reason to doubt that your affirmed testimony this afternoon, even though at times exaggerated, for the most part was truthful.\n[7] Now, with regard to the-, the country conditions, I\u2019ll start with Lebanon because that\u2019s the most straightforward for the Panel. The documentary evidence that I have in Exhibit 3 and counsel\u2019s package in Exhibit 5, regarding the situation for Stateless Palestinians in Lebanon. It\u2019 s very clear, it\u2019 s very-, the-, the documentary evidence is very voluminous that Stateless Palestinians face widespread violence, harassment and discrimination that amounts to persecution in Lebanon. Aside from the problems that you\u2019re facing with the Hizballah supporters, even if I don\u2019t take that-, those problems into account, just being a Palestinian in Lebanon is enough Sir, that you and the child would face serious problems. When we combine that with the problems that-, and the threats that you have received from Hizballah supporters, it only increases your risk in Lebanon.\n[8] Now, with regard to Egypt, with counsel-, counsel\u2019s-, with counsel\u2019s guidance, we focused on Exhibit 3, Item 3.4 and that talks about the fact that there are hundreds if not thousands of cases in which Palestinian\u00ad Palestinians with Egyptian travel documents are denied re-entry for various reasons. Palestinians may face detention at the border in Egypt, imprisonment upon arrival or deportation. So that affirms or confirms the female claimant\u2019s fear that she would not even be able to enter Egypt. Now, if she were able to enter Egypt, this same document goes onto say that Palestinians in Egypt are denied rights to secure residency, employment, property and they are considered foreigners in Egypt no matter how long they have lived there. Egyptian laws do not allow foreigners which Palestinians are considered, to exceed 10% of employees in the labour force, so this limits the employment opportunities for Palestinians and then to add to this, as the female claimant indicated, she\u2019s never been to Egypt. She has no friends, she has no family, she has no support in that country and tho-, therefore she would-, she would be and feel even more out of place than Palestinians who have been residing in Egypt.\n[9] So, to conclude, the Panel finds on a balance of probabilities, based on the documentary evidence that the principal claimant and the minor claimant have a well-founded fear of persecution in Lebanon based on their ethnicities. And the female claimant has a well-founded fear of persecution in Egypt, based on her ethnicity. I should just mention for the record, although it\u2019 s-, it\u2019 s-, it\u2019s implied or it\u2019s well known, I should mention that even though they were born, they were all born in Saudi Arabia, they clearly have no rights to remain or return to Saudi Arabia. So, the Panel finds that the claimants are all Convention refugees pursuant to Section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. The Refugee Protection Division accepts these claims.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n",

I have had an opportunity to consider your testimony and examine the evidence before me and I am ready to render my decision orally.\n[2] You claim to be a citizen of Colombia and you are claiming refugee protection pursuant to Section 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[3] I find that you are a person in need of protection as your return to Colombia would subject you personally to a risk to your life for the following reasons.\n[4] The allegations of your claim can be found in your Basis of Claim form in Exhibit 2. In short, you allege the risk to your life at the hands of the criminal organization, in particular, Clan del Golfo or Golf Clan who have threatened to kill you unless you agree to collaborate with their security plan in Colombia through regular extortions.\n[5] Your personal identity as a citizen of Colombia has been established on a balance of probabilities by your testimony and the supporting documents in Exhibit 1, namely, copies of your passport and your national identity card.\n[6] With respect to the Nexus to the Convention, there is insufficient evidence that you were targeted for Convention grounds for race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in particular social group so the claim is being examined under Section 97.\n[7] In terms of your general credibility, I have found you to be a credible witness and I therefore accept what you have alleged in your testimony and in your Basis of Claim form. You testified in a straightforward manner about your fears without embellishment. There were no major inconsistencies that went to the core of the claim that were not reasonably explained. You described how the threats from Clan del Golfo began in [XXX] 2019 when you were intercepted by a truck or a van and a motorcycle, threatened and demanded to pay extortions. You did not-, you were later in [XXX] 2019 supplied with instructions on when, where and how to bring the money and you did not comply with the demands, hoping for police protection. You relocated to Bogota to escape the criminals. When you retuned after almost two months, somebody broke into your home at the end of [XXX] 2019.\n[8] You left for Bogota again, lost hope for protection measures and because you had a tourist visa to Canada, you decided to leave Colombia as fast as you reasonably could and you flew to [XXX] 2019. Overall, your testimony was spontaneous including being able to provide details about your professional activities as a cattle farmer, an entrepreneur as well as the details of the threats and seeking protection from the authorities. You filed the denunciation, asked for protection. You turned to the army for additional protection, but you were only given recommendations and nothing else.\n[9] In particular, I noted substantial documentary evidence that you presented, particularly, in Exhibit 6 which corroborates your personal and professional identity as well as the details of the threats and attacks, paperwork and supporting letters confirming your professional activities as a cattle farmer, entrepreneur. Also supporting letters from family members who confirmed you were a victim of extortions and threats. Moreover, there are copies of denunciations made at Attorney General and copies of protection measures and crime reports, however, one of them, Exhibit 5 reports that you were first threatened by Golf Clan in 2013. When I asked you to explain why this information was omitted from your Basis of Claim form, you said, in 2013, it was a closed case. You didn\u2019t lose any money [XXX]. In addition, the perpetrators back in 2013 were never identified as Clan del Golfo. The protection unit that took care of that case said that it was simply a paramilitary or a criminal group. That is why you did not mention it in your Basis of Claim form.\n[10] I find that explanation reasonable and it does not undermine your credibility. I find your testimony was consistent in content and chronology without the documents provided that were central to your claim and I find you are credible and I accept your allegations as identified in your written and oral testimony.\n[11] I find that you would be subjected to a greater personalized risk compared to the general population in Colombia. Your professional activities as a [XXX] make you more affluent and thus easily targeted by the gangs for extortions. In addition, due to the nature of your professional activities, you\u2019re well known in the community, hence, it made yourself open to public and easy to locate. I find on a balance of probabilities that you have established the personalized risk to your life that goes beyond the generalized risk in Colombia. Moreover, taking into account the past persecution at the hands of Clan del Golfo, I find you have established strong likelihood of harm in the future.\n[12] To just briefly comment on State protection and internal flight alternative. I find for two reasons that you have rebutted the presumptions of State protection and demonstrated there is no viable internal flight alternative. Firstly, you have provided credible evidence that you relocated, and you went into hiding in Bogota. You provided evidence that you approached the authorities for assistance and you applied for protective measures, but no adequate protection was provided. Due to the threats from Clan del Golfo that continued in spite of the complaints and recommendations from the police, you decided it was unsafe to remain in Colombia especially because no protection was forthcoming.\n[13] Secondly, I have reviewed the country condition evidence as reflected in National Documentation Package. Items 1.2 and 1.7 as well as the documents provided by the counsel on your behalf. Specifically, in Exhibit 5. The documents illustrate that while Colombia has made efforts to improve State protection, its ability to do so is severely limited due to a lack of presence and capacity in many areas of the country that have been recently vacated by FARC as well as significant issues of corruption and complicity by local offi-, officials. National Documentation Package, Item 7.2 reports that Clan del Golfo has succeeded in infiltrating divisions of the armed forces and the justice system. This narco-parla-, paramilitary group has infiltrated official institutions, forged alliances with public servants including armed forces, police, Attorney General and local governments officials so it would be the protection in my opinion would not be forthcoming in your particular circumstances. The preponderance of documentary evidence is clear and convincing in that.\n[14] In addition, I find you would be unable to safely relocate to any other parts of Colombia and that you fa-, face risk throughout that country at the hands of Golf Clan. Peace and Reconciliation Foundation reports in Item 7.2 in NDP and Exhibit 5 news articles provided by the counsel in particular, Colombia reports, news Latin America and Revista Semana ail confirm that Clan-, Golf Clan or Clan del Golfo also known as Urabenos or Clan Usuga or Autodefensas Gaitanistas de Colombia or AGC. They\u2019re currently the largest criminal gang operating in Colombia. It had grown to include more than 8000 members, including informants. It has also become the largest and most powerful self American narco poster. Clan del Golfo has a presence in 279 municipalities in 27 departments, that\u2019s NDP Item 7.2.\n[15] Clan del Golfo has made alliances with smaller groups and gangs throughout Colombia. They have a national reach and an ability to operate across the country. According to Human Rights Watch, there have been documented cases of persons being tracked down by the Cla-, Golf Clan after fleeing to other parts of the country and that\u2019s in Item 7.15 on page 20. I find that Clan del Golfo has taken sustained efforts to locate you and having determined on a balance of probabilities that you are a credible witness, I am satisfied that this group has both the means and the motivation to locate you anywhere you go in Colombia. Therefore, on the evidence before me and based on your particular circumstances, I find that on a balance of probabilities you face risk to your life by the Clan del Golfo anywhere in Colombia and there is no viable internal flight alternative for you.\n[16] So, for all these reasons above, I find that you face risk to your life if you return to Colombia and accordingly I find you to be a persan in need of protection pursuant to Section 97(1)b of Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. Therefore, I accept your claim.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n",

You are claiming to be a citizen of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Peoples Republic of China. And you\u2019re claiming refugee protection pursuant to s. 96 and 97 (1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[2] I\u2019ve considered your testimony and the other evidence of the case. I\u2019m ready to render my decision orally.\nDetermination\n[3] I find that you are a convention refugee on the ground of anti-government political opinion for the following reasons.\nAllegations\n[4] You allege the following: In 2015 and 2016, you experience threats and pressure to resign from your position as a [XXX] because of your pro-democracy views and activities.\n[5] After obtaining a study visa for Canada, you left Hong Kong in [XXX] 2018. You fear returning to Hong Kong because of your anti-government views in relation to the autonomy and pro-democracy views of Hong Kong.\n[6] You allege if you return, you will be persecuted. You allege that there is no state protection for you or an internal flight alternative.\nIdentity\n[7] I find that your personal identity as a citizen of the Hong Kong Special Administration Region People\u2019s Republic of China has been established on the balance of probabilities by your testimony and the supporting documents filed in the exhibits, specifically your passport, Hong Kong permanent identity card, and driver\u2019s license found in Exhibit-1.\nNexus\n[8] I find there is a link between what you fear and the ground of political opinion, and your claim is therefore assessed under s. 96.\nCredibility\n[9] In terms of your general credibility, I found you to be a credible witness, and I therefore believe what you have alleged in your oral testimony and in your basis of claim form. I find that you are a long-standing pro\u00ad democracy activist in Hong Kong.\n[10] Your testimony about your long-standing involvement and participation in the quest for genuine democracy and an autonomous Hong Kong was detailed and spontaneous. You described your strong belief in the rule of law, of human rights, and universal suffrage, and testified about your participation in protests during the Umbrella Movement. You submitted photos of your participation in protest activities in Exhibit-7.\n[11] As the result of your activities, I find on a balance of probabilities, that you face threats and harassment from anti-democracy persons. You\u2019ve provided detailed testimony about the threats and the steps you took to report them to school management and other colleagues. You explained that as a result of the ongoing threats, you were experiencing [XXX] which was [XXX], and you also tried [XXX]jjjl4po-0l with the symptoms.\n[12] Your testimony about the fear and worry you felt when you came to school each day was most compelling and without embellishment. Your testimony was corroborated by medical report which is found in Exhibit-7. You also testified that reported the issues to the police liaison officer who was assigned to your school, but no action was taken.\n[13] Based on legal advice from a colleague who is a lawyer, you decided not to file an official report to the police because of their violent response to protests and their bias against democracy and actions which demonstrate they are a tool of the communist government.\n[14] In support of your testimony, you filed a complaint letter and a letter from the episcopal delegate for education, both found in Exhibit-7 which are consistent with your testimony and basis of claim form.\n[15] Most compelling was your testimony about the significant impact the threats and harassment had on your [XXX] health and marriage.\n[16] You provided detailed testimony about your political activities in Canada as they relate to Hong Kong. And I find you\u2019ve attended a number of protests in Canada to support your brothers and sisters in Hong Kong. You provided testimony which is corroborated with photos and other supporting documents found in Exhibit-7 about your attendance at the Canada-Hong Kong Link event on [XXX] 2019, a protest on [XXX] 2020 at Old City Hall, an event about forgiveness in the context of the Hong Kong protest on [XXX] 2020, and another protest on St. George Street outside the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office.\n[17] Some of these events have been posted online, and papers you have written with political content about Hong Kong protests and anti-democracy policies are also published in writing and online.\n[18] I find that your reavailment to Hong Kong in [XXX] 2018, [XXX] 2019, and [XXX] 2019 was reasonably explained. You testified that you were experiencing difficulties in your marriage and returned to Hong Kong to save your marriage in [XXX]. And returned in May 2019 to support your wife during the difficult time she faced with the Joss of her mother.\n[19] I also find that your delay in claiming protection for about nine months is reasonably explained. You explained that it was not until the extradition law was proposed in mid-2019 that you were really fearful of returning to Hong Kong given your pro-democracy activist profile. You also testified that with the recent introduction of the Security Law, you are more fearful of harm given the dilution of democratic principles contained in this legislation.\n[20] I therefore find that your subjective fear is established by your credible testimony and supporting documents, and I believe what you\u2019ve alleged on a balance of probabilities.\nObjective Basis\n[21] Your fear of being deported to Hong Kong in the present circumstances is a fear that is well-founded in the objective documents.\n[22] Item 2.1 of the NDP indicates that the government increasingly moved to restrict the expression of views it found objectionable even when those expressions occurred abroad.\n[23] This item also reports the following: That the government also expanded attempts to control the global dissemination of information online. Economic leverage on the mainland was used to suppress freedom of expression in Hong Kong. For example, employees of Cathay Airlines who engaged in protests or who demonstrated radical conduct were not permitted to work on flights entering the Chinese airspace. The government heavily censored the Hong Kong protests and blocked any neutral or positive reports about the protestors.\n[24] Item 2.2 reports that the founders of the Occupy Central campaign were charged with public nuisance\u00ad related offences for their involvement with the Umbrella Movement. Also, four elected pro-democracy legislators were disqualified for failing to meet the National People\u2019s Congress standing committee interpretation of the Hong Kong basic law when they took their oaths of office.\n[25] The Freedom House report found in item 2.3 reports a downward trend due to the expulsion of four pro\u00ad democracy lawmakers from the legislature, jail sentences against protest leaders, and other apparent efforts by pro-Beijing authorities to stamp out a movement calling for local self-determination.\n[26] Item 4.1 reports that the 2014 Hong Kong protests and 2016 Legislative Council elections caught Beijing\u2019s attention, and since Beijing seems to be tightening it\u2019s posture towards Hong Kong\u2019s governance, Beijing views all protest and pro-democracy political voices as potential challenges to China\u2019s one-party rule. But it perceives Hong Kong\u2019s calls for democracy as particularly threatening because of the city status as an international economic hub.\n[27] Your Counsel has submitted more current, objective evidence from reliable sources. In particular, the BEC news report found in Exhibit-7 reports that a new security law came into force on June 30th 2020 which gives Beijing powers to shape life in Hong Kong like never before. This article reports that the provisions of this legislation effectively curtails freedom of speech and protest and includes the ability of referral of some cases for trial in mainland China.\n[28] The July 2020 Amnesty International report also found in Exhibit-7 states that the new security law is overly-broad and vague and almost anything could be construed as a threat to national security. A New York Times article dated April 23rd 2019 also in Exhibit-7 reports that Umbrella Movement activists have been sentenced with terms up to 16 months for their roles in demonstrations in 2014.\nState Protection\n[29] In this case, the agent of persecution is the state, as the persecution you would face should you return to Hong Kong is at the hands of the authorities. Accordingly, I find there is no state protection available to you.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[30] I find that there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout Hong Kong and therefore, no internal flight alternative is available to you, as the state is the agent of persecution and would be motivated to find you.\nConclusion\n[31] Based on the totality of the evidence, I find you to be a convention refugee, and I accept your claim.\nREASONS CONCLUDED\n\n",

Marcovitch\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): John Savalgio\nCountry: Pakistan\nRPD Number: TB9-15066\nATIP Number: A-2021-00655\nATIP Pages: 000100-000105\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] The claimant, [XXX] claims as a citizen of Pakistan and seeks refugee protection pursuant to subsections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (\u201cIRPA\u201c).1\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] The claimant\u2019s allegations are fully set out in his Basis of Claim (BOC) form2 and amendment.3 In summary, the claimant is a [XXX] man who was born to a Sunni Muslim family in Sialkot, Punjab province on [XXX]. He alleges a fear of persecution from the Sunni extremist group Lashkar-e-Jhangvi (\u201cLeJ\u201d) as a result of his conversion from the Sunni sect to the Shia sect and his active Shia religious practices.\n[3] On or about [XXX] 2019, the claimant traveled from [XXX]. Then, on or about [XXX] 2019 the claimant travelled from [XXX] Canada, via [XXX] and arrived in Canada on [XXX] 2019. On or about June 11, 2019, the claimant\u2019s refugee claim was referred to the Refugee Protection Board (the \u201cBoard\u201d).\nDETERMINATION\n[4] I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to s.96 of IRPA.\nANALYSIS\nNexus\n[5] I find that the claimant has a nexus to the Convention ground of religion, based on his allegations of having converted from the Sunni to Shia sect and consequent persecution alleged.\nIdentity\n[6] I accept, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant is a citizen of Pakistan on the basis of his Islamic Republic of Pakistan passport4 which was seized by Immigration, Citizenship and Refugees Canada (IRCC) when the claim was filed.\n[7] Further, I also accept on a balance of probabilities that the claimant converted from the Sunni sect to the Shia sect of Islam, based on his testimony and support letters from friends, [XXX] officials, religious leaders and family. I find on a balance of probabilities that the letters from the claimant\u2019s father and the [XXX] of the [XXX] that the claimant\u2019s father belonged to, establish that the claimant was formerly a follower of the Sunni Islam sect.\nCredibility\n[8] I had certain issues with the claimant\u2019s credibility stemming from the fact that he paid the equivalent of approximately [XXX] CAD to an agent, while he was still working in [XXX] in order to secure Visa\u2019s to various countries around the world, including Canada. I note that the claimant spent this money after converting to the Shia sect, but prior to having any threats made against his life in Pakistan. I asked the claimant why he would have spent [XXX] CAD to get the Visa\u2019s if there were no threat to his life. The claimant testified that he did so just to be safe in case he experienced problems related to his Shia conversion or feared for his safety. I find that such an explanation is unreasonable in these particular circumstances. I find that spending such a significant amount of money for a \u2018just in case\u2019 situation where he would not have used the Visa\u2019s if nothing transpired on his return to Pakistan, is implausible. I find on a balance of probabilities that the claimant spent [XXX] CAD to get the assistance of an agent and associated travel visa\u2019s because it was always his intention to leave Pakistan even though he had not yet experienced any persecution at the time the Visa\u2019s were acquired.\n[9] However, having made the above noted findings, I recognize that the above noted issues neither go to the core of the claim, nor should the implausibility finding, without more, lead to a negative decision.\n[10] While the above noted issues certainly raise questions, by inference, as to the credibility of the claimant\u2019s allegations concerning what happened to him after he returned to Pakistan from [XXX], I find on a balance of probabilities that the claimant has provided sufficient corroborative evidence of his faith and activities once he was back in Pakistan, that I am unable to deny the credibility the allegations that go to the heart of his claim.\n[11] I note that the claimant provided hospital records and a First Information Report (\u201cFIR\u201d) that corroborate his allegations of having been attacked and injured after he left his [XXX] on [XXX] 2019. The claimant\u2019s allegations in his BOC regarding this attack and the details contained in the FIR largely corroborate each other. The primary difference is that the FIR does not mention the LeJ as the claimant\u2019s attackers, but rather as local, unknown extremist persons.\n[12] I also accept, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant fled [XXX] and went to [XXX] prior to leaving Pakistan based on the support letter from [XXX], who the claimant stayed with in [XXX].\nWell-Foundedness\n[13] There is considerable documentary evidence5 before the panel that supports the claim that there are significant problems in Pakistan for Shia Muslims in general and Sunni to Shia Converts in particular.\n[14] I note that in a Response to Information Request at NDP Item 12.56 it is stated that, \u201c[s]ectarian violence in Pakistan has historically targeted individuals, places of worship, shrines and religious schools, however Shi\u2019a traditionally represented a higher proportion of the casualties,\u201d noting that Shia face threats from anti-Shia militant groups, including Lashkar-e\u00ad Jhangvi (LeJ), which \u201cseeks to have Shi\u2019a declared \u2018non-believers\u2019 or apostates,\u201d as well as from Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan (SSP), also known as Ahl-e-Sunnat-Wal-Jamaat (ASWJ), LeJ al-Alami, and other factions of the Tehrik-e Taliban Pakistan (TTP) (Australia 20 Feb. 2019, para. 3.99).\u201d I find that the claimant\u2019s fear of persecution in Pakistan is well-founded.\nState Protection\n[15] The UNHCR Eligibility Guidelines For Assessing the International Protection Needs of Members of Religious Minorities From Pakistan7 dated January 2017, states, that \u201c[T]he government has been criticized for failing to protect Shi\u2019ite Muslims from attacks, and for allowing militant organizations to operate with impunity by failing to investigate and punish those responsible for violent attacks against Shi\u2019ites in Pakistan.\u201d\n[16] Further, the same UNHCR document notes that \u201c[E]ven where the police have been present they have reportedly been unable to stop attacks; analysts have described the authorities as indifferent, incompetent or even complicit in the violence and discrimination against Shi\u2019ites.\u201d\n[17] As a result, and given that authorities in Pakistan did not appear to assist\/protect the claimant beyond taking the FIR, I find on a balance of probabilities that the claimant did not receive adequate state protection in the past and nor would he receive it in the future. I find that the claimant has rebutted the presumption of state protection.\n[18] The claimant testified that should he return to Pakistan today, he would be killed by the LeJ or other extremist religious militant groups due to his Shia religious activities. Based on the evidence adduced, I find on a balance of probabilities that the claimant came to the attention of the LeJ and is currently being pursued to stop his Shia activities. I find that while the claimant has only recently become an active and outwardly practicing Shia convert in Pakistan, I find that the evidence suggests that the LeJ has been looking for him in locations other than his home town of Sialkot and they also have his photograph as shown on the placard for the [XXX] mourning event on [XXX] 2019. I therefore find that there is no Internal Flight Alternative for this claimant because the LeJ tracked him down to a friend\u2019s house in Lahore and have therefore shown a continuing interest in the claimant. Further, even if the claimant were able to safely relocate in the short term to Hyderabad, I find that his active faith and sponsorship of [XXX] activities would create a serious possibility that he would eventually be found and persecuted in the future.\n[19] Therefore, based on the totality of the evidence adduced, I find that there is more than a mere possibility that the claimant will be persecuted by religious militant groups on account of being a Sunni to Shia convert and perceived to be active in Pakistan\u2019s Shia Muslim community.\n[20] In light of my finding that the claimant is a Convention refugee, it is unnecessary to consider his claim under s.97(1).\n[21] This claim is accepted.\n(signed) D.

The file number is TB0-09362. I have considered your oral testimony and the other evidence in this case and I\u2019m ready to render my decision orally.\n[2] (Indiscernible) claiming to be a citizen of Sri Lanka and are claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[3] I find that you are a convention refugee on the grounds of your ethnicity, religion, and an imputed political opinion for the following reasons:\n[4] Your allegations are made out in your Basis of Claim Form which is found at Exhibit 2. In summary, you allege that you are a citizen of Sri Lanka and that you fear harm at the hands of the Sri Lankan government, army, police, and security forces, as well as ballistic extremist as a Tamil-speaking Muslim.\n[5] You allege that you and your family historically faced discrimination and harassment as Muslims. You allege that after the Candy Riots of [XXX] 2018, you and your employee were attacked by Sinhalese men and called racial slurs. Sinhalese people also boycotted your business.\n[6] You further allege that land you had purchased in 2012 was supposedly taken by the military in 2013. You reached out to government officials and even held a demonstration in 2018 to have the land returned.\n[7] A lawsuit was filed against the army in 2017 by the man from whom you purchased the land. As a result of your efforts, you faced harassment and threats. In [XXX] 2019, you were detained by the Terrorist Investigation Department, or TID, for one day where you were questioned about your work, your trips abroad and who funded these trips. The TID alleged they had information about your anti-government and anti-Buddhist activities and accused you of turning innocent people against the government. You were beaten by the TID and released with a strict warning not to engage in anti-government activities.\n[8] The man who sold you the land and who had purchased \u2014 sorry \u2014 who had sold you the land and who had launched the court case against the Military received threatening phone calls and went missing in [XXX] 2019. You also received threatening phone calls in [XXX] 2019. It was then that you determined it was no longer safe for you to remain in Sri Lanka and you fled to Canada.\n[9] Since fleeing, the army has returned to your home and gone to your Mosque and your wife\u2019s workplace to inquire about your whereabouts. Your wife was informed that on return to Sri Lanka you are to present yourself to the Ampara Police Station concerning an investigation into your anti-government activities and a discovery of explosives on your land.\n[10] Your identity as National of Sri Lanka has been established on a balance of probabilities by your testimony and the identification documents found in Exhibit 1 and 6, including your passport and National ID card.\n[11] In terms of your general credibility, I have found you to be a credible witness and I therefore believe what you have alleged in your oral testimony and in your Basis of Claim Form. Your testimony was straightforward and consistent with your Basis of Claim Form. You did not embellish your testimony and there were no significant omissions or inconsistencies. Your testimony was spontaneous and included the detail one would expect from someone telling their own story.\n[12] You also provided several documents to corroborate your claim and the risks alleged. These include documents corroborating your work and involvement in the business community. At Exhibit 6, you have your business registration, Ampara District Chamber of Commerce and Industry ID, as well as certificates of membership from 2016 and 2018, Certificate of Membership from the International Association of Lions Club. You\u2019ve provided documents confirming the land you purchased in Exhibit 6 and 8. There\u2019s the land permit showing the grant of four acres to [XXX] (ph) as well as his affidavit confirming transfer of this land to you after receipt of [XXX], and a copy of the selling agreement and a request to have the land permit transferred to your name.\n[13] You provided the court order from [XXX] 2017 corroborating your allegation that a case was filed by [XXX] and dismissed by the court in (indiscernible) because the land falls under the Ampara Court\u2019s jurisdiction.\n[14] There\u2019s a letter from the lawyer who represented you and confirms that you and [XXX] approached him for help. He states that the re-opening of the case in Ampara had to be suspended because [XXX] went missing and you were being harassed and ultimately fled to Canada.\n[15] There\u2019s a letter from your Mosque, your wife, your father, a friend, and an employee who are aware of what has happened to you in Sri Lanka. [XXX] (ph) (indiscernible) states that the TID has visited the Mosque asking about you. Your wife states that since you fled, the TID has gone to your home in [XXX] 2019 and twice in [XXX] 2019 after the Easter bombings to ask about you and to search the home. [XXX] (ph) confirms that he was with you in [XXX] 2018 when you were attacked by Sinhalese men and called a racial slur.\n[16] Based on your testimony as well as the documents provided to corroborate your claim, I find on a balance of probabilities that you have established that you were harassed and targeted because you were a Muslim. I further find that you have established on a balance of probabilities that you purchased land that was forcibly taken by the military and that after trying various avenues of recourse to have the land returned to you, you were arrested, detained, and questioned by the TID.\n[17] I accept that the TID believes that you are opposed to the Government and have engaged in in anti-Sinhalese and anti-Buddhist activities and as a result, you face a serious possibility of persecution in Sri Lanka. Furthermore, I find that you have established subjective fear of harm.\n[18] The objective evidence in both the National Documentation Package found in Exhibit 3 and counsel\u2019s Country Conditions Package found at Exhibit 7, further corroborates what you allege and the risk you face as a Muslim in Sri Lanka.\n[19] With respect to the land issue, Item 10.4 of the National Documentation Package is particularly instructive. It\u2019s a Human Rights Watch Report on Land Occupation from October 2018. That corroborates the issue you had with your land being taken by the military as well as the challenges in having the land returned.\n[20] Security forces have occupied new land even after the end of the war to expand their role and presence in civilian activities including infrastructure development, tourism and administration. It contains examples of military going into villages, forcibly taking land and erecting military camps in the East and in Ampara, which is the district where you lived.\n[21] The report raises concerns that \u201cthe Sinhalese-dominated state is seeking to diminish the rights of minorities through continued militarization and territorial aggrandizement.\u201d\n[22] There are many challenges getting the land back. The government\u2019s approach seems at best ad hoc, and decisions are too often left to the discretion of the security forces, without a serious effort to systematically map and review military use of land as well as the status of release and reparations initiatives.\n[23] The report also talks about specific incidents where people have filed complaints in the court for their land and have been harassed forcing them to withdraw these complaints. Most cases that have been filed are either still ongoing or did not result in the release of the lands.\n[24] There are also numerous documents in both the National Documentation Package and counsel\u2019s Country Conditions Package that discuss the rise in anti-Muslim sentiment that has occurred in Sri Lanka over the past six or seven years. There\u2019s been violent attacks, threats, and harassments that came to a head in 2018 after the Candy Riots and again, in 2019 after the Easter bombings.\n[25] The articles in Exhibit 7 as well as Items 1.9, 2.1, 2.2, 2.4, 12.1, 12.5, 12.6, 12.8, and 12.9 in Exhibit 3 all discuss the myriad of attacks against Muslims in retaliation for the Easter bombings.\n[26] Exhibit 7, there\u2019s an article that talks about \u201cangry mobs\u201d going house to house to attack and threaten Muslims. On article \u2014 another article in Exhibit 7 states that the Human Rights Watch is urging the government to stop mob violence, threats, and discrimination against Muslims. Authorities are arbitrarily arresting and detaining hundreds under counterterrorism and emergency laws, and there had been a lot of arrests under the Prevention of Terrorism Act, which allows long-term detention without charge or trial.\n[27] Human Rights Watch spoke to lawyers who had a list of 105 detainees that summarized the justification for arrest by authorities and included such reasons such as keeping money at home, talking in a playground, a post that\u2019s shared on social media five years back, having English lecturer documents, Arabic songs on their laptop, or travelling to Jaffna for a job. Or simply no reason. Abuses by authorities had long been prevalent and unaddressed by the government.\n[28] And Government leaders themselves appeared to associate themselves with Buddhist Nationalist elements. On May 23rd, 2019, then President Sirisena pardoned the leader of (indiscernible) of the Buddhist-extremist group known for targeting Muslims.\n[29] In Item 12.8 which was also included in Exhibit 7, states that months after the Easter bombings, the situation is still dangerous, even though attacks were committed by a fringe group of Muslims. Muslims in general are facing significant backlash.\n[30] The government has sat idly by or even egged on violence and political divisions in Government have constructed efforts to reform the dysfunctional police and intelligence services.\n[31] Since the election of Gotabaya Rajapaksa as President in 2019, and Mahinder (ph) Rajapaksa as Prime Minister in 2020, the security situation and conditions in Sri Lanka have only deteriorated. Concerns of any gains made under the previous government towards improving the human rights situation, would be reversed are reflected both counsel\u2019s Country Conditions Package and the National Documentation Package.\n[32] Item 2.13 noted that the concern that the government will roll back any progress made under the previous government towards improving the human rights situation and that this government will renege on promises made under the former government. Item 4.13 of the National Document Package states that since Rajapaksa seeking power there is a trend towards authoritarianism and militarization. There has been a crack down on human rights with no regard for minorities. Rajapaksa is dismissive of what he calls divisive political demands and frames them as a result of manipulation by Tamil politicians and western aligned interests.\n[33] Item 13.1 states that human rights have deteriorated significantly since Rajapaksa was elected president. Both Gotabaya and Mahinder Rajapaksa have espoused anti-Muslim news publicly. An article in Exhibit 7 sates that Gotabaya campaigned on the province to protect Sri Lanka from the Muslim threat, and after the election, he appointed an all male cabinet with no Tamil or Muslim representatives.\n[34] Another article from 2020 states that Gotabaya and Mahinder Rajapaksa campaigned on a nationalist platform projecting your family as protectors of the Sinhalese Buddhist population. There has always been anti-Tamilism (ph) in the country, but recently there has been arise in hatred against the Muslim minority too. Mahinder Rajapaksa\u2019s message has been that Sri Lanka belongs toto the Sinhalese and that Tamils are Muslims are their permanent threats.\n[35] In 2020, a year after the Easter bombings, the situation from has not improved, and in fact, has worsened due to the global pandemic of COVID 19. Item 12.5, which was also included in exhibit 7, states that concerns were raised in April 2020 about recent arrests of well-known Muslims, biased government actions and rising ant-Muslim hate speech. COVID has worsened the situation, where there has been calls to boycott Muslim business and accusations that Muslims are deliberately spreading COVID 19. Senior government figures have made public remarks associating the Muslim community with COVID 19 infections.\n[36] Another article states that the government\u2019s frequent incidents of demonization, vilification and state guarding of Sri Lanka\u2019s Muslim population are a cause of great concern. The government has mandated cremation for those who have died due to COVID 19 and the body of the first Muslim death due to COVID 19 was forceable cremated against the wishes of his family and against urging of the Muslim community and religious leaders, a policy that was seen as discriminatory. This was also reflected in Item 12.9, which again noted the discriminatory law mandating cremation for those who die from COVID and for accusing the Muslim community being at high risk for spreading the disease. In the past year [XXX] have been arbitrarily arrested and accused critiquing Buddhism and the government.\n[37] Furthermore, the objective documents confirm the risk he would face on return to Sri Lanka as a Muslim who is under investigation by the TID and has been accused of engaging in anti-government and anti\u00ad Buddhist activities. Item 1.9 of the National Documentation Package states that there is a watch list which includes names of those individuals of the Sri Lankan Security Services considered to be of interest, including for suspected separatists or criminal activities.\n[38] Item 4.11 states that returning failed asylum seekers would likely be questioned at the airport by immigration officials and may be passed to the criminal investigation department. But they do security checks at the airport where they look into a police database from where the returnee is from, and it is not unusual to have further checks at home and to be monitored.\n[39] Item 14.6 states that returnees are checked against the watch list maintained by police as well as one maintained by State Intelligent Services. Returnees are questioned on arrivai by the Department of Immigration and Emigration, State Intelligence Services and Criminal Investigation Department for a few hours to several days. They may also be visited by police at their residence at a later time after the interrogation. Returnees from western countries in particular are placed under surveillance to determine whether they have ties to the LTTE.\n[40] Therefore, based on this documentary evidence, I find that the claimant has an objectively well-founded fear of persecution.\n[41] I find that state protection would not be available to you were you to seek it in Sri Lanka. Where agents of the state themselves are sources of persecution, the presumption of state protection may be rebutted without exhausting ail avenues of recourse in the country. In this case, the agents of persecution are the state; the police, army and intelligence community. Your evidence is that since fleeing, the TID has informed your wife that you are under investigation for engaging in anti-government activities. For that reason, it would not be reasonable to expect you to approach the state for protection.\n[42] The National Documentation Package also contains information about the Human Rights Commission in Sri Lanka. Item 1.9 states that the commission can only make recommendations to the Attorney General, but there is evidence that the state is not investigating a major of complaints filed. This report further states that Sri Lanka Jacks independent and efficient mechanisms to address complains to torture.\n[43] Item 2.2 also states that limited steps are taken to hold perpetrators of serious human right violations accountable. In Item 2.3, it is noted that police and security forces are known to engage in abusive practices, including extra judicial executions, forced disappearances, custodial rape, and torture.\n[44] So in light of the objective country documentation, as well as your persona) experience, I find that the claimant has rebutted the presumption of state protection. And based on this information again, I find that there would not be adequate state protection available to you in Sri Lanka.\n[45] I have also considered whether a viable internal fight alternative exists for you, however, given that the agent of persecution is the state and you have been targeted both the army and TID, I find that you face a serious possibility of persecution throughout Sri Lanka. Item 1.9 states that Sri Lankan forces maintain effective control throughout the country and individuals are unlikely to relocate internally with anonymity. You are known to security officials who believe you have engaged in anti-government activities. Security officials have repeatedly gone to your home looking for you and have instructed your wife to have you present yourself to the Ampara police station (indiscernible). Therefore, I find there is no viable IFA, or internal flight alternative, for you in Sri Lanka.\n[46] Based on the totality of the evidence, I find that you have established on a balance of probabilities that there is a serious possibility of persecution if you were to return to Sri Lanka. Therefore, I find that you are a convention refugee and your claim is therefore accepted.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n",

Moutafova\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Mohammad Khan Khokhar\nCountry: India\nRPD Number: TB9-07818\nATIP Number: A-2021-00655\nATIP Pages: 000085-000092\nREASONS FOR DECISION\nINTRODUCTION\n[1] This is the decision of the Refugee Protection Division (the panel) in the claim for refugee protection of [XXX] (the claimant), citizen of India. She claims refugee protection in Canada pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (the IRPA).1\n[2] The Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 4- Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution was considered and applied to the hearing and determination of this claim.2\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] The claimant\u2019s detailed allegations are contained in her Basis of Claim form (BOC)3 and in her testimony. In summary, the claimant is unmarried [XXX] single woman, who graduated from the [XXX] with a [XXX] and found work in the [XXX] field. She fears serious harm or death in India at the hands of her former managers, who sexually assaulted her and blackmailed her. The claimant also fears serious hmm or death in India at the hands of a high-ranking police officer who colluded with her former managers and participated in the abuse and the blackmailing.\nDETERMINATION\n[4] Having considered ail of the evidence, including the claimant\u2019s testimony, the panel finds that the claimant faces a serious possibility of persecution in India on the basis of her membership in the particular social group of Indian women facing gender-based violence. The panel therefore finds that the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA and accepts her claim.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[5] The panel is satisfied that the claimant\u2019s identity has been established, on a balance of probabilities, by a certified copy of her Indian passport filed into evidence4.\nNexus\n[6] The panel finds that for the claimant, there is a nexus with one of the five Convention grounds, i.e. her membership in the particular social group of women fearing gender-related persecution.\nCredibility\n[7] Testimony provided under oath is presumed to be truthful unless there is a reason for doubting its truthfulness. In this case, the panel has no such reason. The panel finds the claimant to be a credible witness and believes, on a balance of probabilities, the key allegations of her claim. The testimony of the claimant was spontaneous, emotional, detailed, and sincere. The panel did not find that she tried to embellish or exaggerate her allegations during her testimony. There were no significant inconsistencies or omissions with regard to the main allegations. Her testimony was consistent with the allegations in her BOC, and also included additional details that allowed the panel to more fully understand her claim.\n[8] Since this claim involves gender related violence, the panel considered the Chairperson\u2019s Guidelines on Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution.5 The Chairperson\u2019s Guideline assists in assessing the key evidentiary elements in determining to what extent women making a gender-related claim of fear of persecution may successfully rely on any Convention ground and under what circumstances gender violence constitutes persecution. The Chairperson\u2019s Guideline also highlights that women refugee claimants may face special problems in demonstrating that their claims are credible and trustworthy. Factors that may affect their ability to provide evidence include difficulty in providing testimony on sensitive matters, cross\u00ad cultural misunderstandings as well as social, religious, and economic differences. The Chairperson\u2019s Guideline was used to help assess the circumstances of this claim and to understand and apply the added sensitivities necessary to properly assess the evidence.\n[9] The claimant is unmarried [XXX] single woman, who graduated from the [XXX] and found work in the [XXX] field. She was promoted soon to [XXX]. In [XXX] 2016 a new manager substituted her previous lady- manager. Soon the physical and psychological mistreatment of the claimant started at the hands of this manager, who proposed to the claimant to become his personal assistant as a manner of promotion. She refused and then the sexual harassment began. Details of the mistreatment are detailed in the BOC form. The claimant tried to complain to HR department, but was made to understand that a dismissal will follow, should she proceed formally with the complaint.\n[10] The claimant decided to put the harassment to an end by leaving her job and she filed a notice of resignation.6 Her manager threatened her, that she would not find job in the [XXX] industry again. Nevertheless, she proceeded with her resignation and the employment contract was terminated upon the expiry of the notice, in [XXX] 2016.\n[11] Indeed, the claimant was not able to find a job [XXX] for a while and, thus, decided to change the industry of occupation. She found a job in another town, where she lived with her parents, as a [XXX]. The professional relationships in the new workplace were very good to the moment when her old manager appeared in the office, and talked to her current manager in [XXX] 2018. Then the claimant was subjected to horrible mistreatment and molestation by her manager and a man in police uniform and, who was introduced as a Senior Superintendent of the Police Department. She was threatened with kidnapping of family members and troubles for her family should she attempt to complain to the police. The claimant was repeatedly intimidated by her manager, who would come to the claimant\u2019s parents\u2019 house looking for the claimant and threatening to ruin her family and more particularly \u2013 her dignity by posting the video-material on-line.\n[12] The claimant felt she had no choice and resumed work in the office. The molestation and the sexual harassment continued on a regular basis. The claimant was devastated. Her mistreatment was turning into horrible sexual abuse, which led to profound [XXX].\n[13] The claimant arranged for the continuation of her study in Canada and arrived in [XXX] 2018 and filed this asylum claim.\n[14] The claimant outlined in her BOC that throughout her employment several men severely abused her, molested her and finally, learning about her plan to leave India and obtained student visa to Canada, abducted her and subjected her to a most horrible sexual violence, committed by several men. She provided credible testimony about her fears in India and the events that occurred in India that precipitated her departure. She testified about her employment experience and provided the expected details about it. She explained how, in early [XXX] 2017, she left her job, understanding that this is the only way to resolve the problem with the sexual harassment at work. She explained how she arrived to the decision to change the industries and the cities of employment. She explained that following the molestation at the new workplace, she unsuccessfully attempted to file a complaint in the police. She also described in detail how, in [XXX] 2018, she was intimidated by her manager, who came to her residence, insisting that she comes back and continue to work in the office, threatening to destroy her family and her reputation.\n[15] The claimant\u2019s allegations are supported by corroborating evidence, including her employment history, which was consistent with her allegations.\n[16] In the claimant\u2019s case, there were no relevant contradictions, inconsistencies, or omissions between her BOC, her testimony at the hearing, and the documentary evidence on file, that were not reasonably explained.\n[17] The claimant\u2019s allegations are supplied by the objective documentary evidence on file. The National Documentation Package for India indicates that violence against women, including sexual violence, has increased in India,7 and also points out the inadequacy of state protection, as discussed below. The documentary evidence also is replete with references to abuses of authority and corruption within the justice system, including within the police, and the growing demand for police account ability.8\n[18] The panel therefore finds that the claimant has established, on a balance of probabilities, that she suffered physical and sexual assault by her two managers, who initiated and organised violent and brutal sexual violence and harassment, involving a high-ranking police officer and unknown men, and that the police refused to perform their duties and to protect the claimant, when she attempted to file a First Information Reports (FIR) and to get police protection, but this was not successful.\nState Protection\n[19] The panel finds that the claimant has rebutted the presumption of state protection, with clear and convincing evidence that the Indian state would be unable or unwilling to provide her with adequate protection.\n[20] The documentary evidence indicates that in April of 2013, the President of India approved the Criminal Law (Amendment), which criminalizes several forms of violence against women and enlarged the definition of rape.9 However, the law has been criticized for not going far enough in certain aspects. According to the same source, the legislation \u201cdoes not remove the effective legal immunity that security forces accused of sexual violence enjoy under special laws like the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act.\u201d10 In addition, the documentary evidence points to inadequacy and inconsistency of police response to sexual assault across India, and the widespread need for the training of police officers in this regard.11\n[21] ln this case a high-ranking police officer was among the claimant\u2019s agents of persecution. The panel has found credible the claimant\u2019s allegations of sexual assault at the hands of her ex\u00ad managers and their friends. The panel has also found credible her allegations with respect to the unsuccessful attempt to complain to the police in Chandigarh and about the threats she received. Moreover, as indicated above, the documentary evidence is replete with references to police abuse and impunity throughout India.\n[22] Given the evidence, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that adequate protection would not be provided to the claimant in India.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[23] At the hearing, the panel asked the claimant whether she could relocate safely and reasonably to a large Indian metropolis, such as Mumbai or Kolkata.\n[24] The test to apply to assess whether there is an Internal Flight Alternative (IFA) has two prongs. The first is to determine whether there is, in the proposed IFA, a serious possibility of persecution under section 96 of the IRPA or if there is a risk, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant would be subjected to one of the harms set out in subsection 97(1) of the IRPA. The second prong involves determining whether it would be objectively unreasonable to expect the claimant to seek refuge there, taking into account the circumstances specific to her.\n[25] The claimant testified that she would not be able to relocate, arguing that she fears that her manager will find her given that he has ties with the police which would enable him to find her. This already happened once when the claimant, hoping to put the assault to an end, resigned from her job, changed her location, going to another town, and even changed the industry of employment, but, nevertheless, she was found by her former manager.\n[26] The panel finds that the claimant has demonstrated that the alleged agents of persecution \u2013 the claimant\u2019s managers and the colluding high-ranking police officer, have the means and the motivation to find and harm the claimant anywhere in India.\n[27] Accordingly, since the possibility of an IFA fails on the first prong, the panel will not proceed to the second prong of the IFA analysis. Thus, the panel concludes that an IFA is not a reasonable option in the claimant\u2019s particular case.\nCONCLUSION\n[28] After assessing all of the evidence, the panel concludes that if the claimant returned to India, she would face a serious possibility of persecution under section 96 of the IRPA, as a result of her membership in the particular social group of women fearing gender-related persecution. Thus, the panel finds that the claimant, [XXX], is a Convention refugee. Accordingly, the panel accepts her claim.\n(signed) R.

Griffith\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Peter G Ivanyi\nCountry: Romania\nRPD Number: TB9-02978\nAssociated RPD Number: TB9-03059, TB9-03070\nATIP Number: A-2021-00655\nATIP Pages: 000076-000084\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] [XXX], the principal claimant, his common-law spouse, [XXX], the female claimant, and their son, [XXX], the minor, claim refugee protection in Canada, pursuant to s. 96 and s.97 (1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA)i.\n[2] The minor son was born in the USA and is a citizen of the USA.\n[3] [XXX] was appointed Designated Representative for the minor son.\nINTRODUCTION\n[4] The claimants claim to be ethnic \u201cRoma\u201d, and the adult claimants, who were born in Romania, testify that, in Romania, they have been victims of extreme discrimination, because of their ethnicity. They allege that, in a number of cases of discrimination and confrontation by Romanians, the police in Romania have not assisted, or have been complicit.\n[5] The adult claimants left Romania in [XXX] and, after a stay in the USA, where an asylum claim was made, they travelled to Canada on [XXX] 2018.\n[6] The principal claimant lived for brief periods in Sweden and Belgium in the years 2003 and 2006, respectively.\n[7] The Minister\u2019s Representative provided submissions (written only) on the issue of the credibility of the overall testimony, as well as with specific concerns and request for clarification on the nature of criminal charges issued to the principal claimant in the USA, and clarification on the claimants\u2019 method of entering Canada.\n[8] No evidence was adduced in the claim of the US-born minor claimant.\n[9] The principal claimant is also the father of three children who, at the time of the hearing, were listed as being resident in Romania.\nALLEGATIONS:\n[10] A summary of the key elements of the testimony is, as follows.\n[11] The principal claimant gave oral testimony in which he states the following, as in the written narrative of the claimants\u2019 Basis of Claim (BOC)ii Form.\n[12] He states that in Romania, starting at an early age, as an ethnic Roma, he, personally, experienced extreme discrimination and persecution.\n[13] He testifies that he and his spouse are identified as \u201cRoma\u201d in Romania, as that, generally, a Roma is identified by a combination of skin color, facial hair, manner of dress, customs, language, and places of residence, and that they endure certain impositions such as that a \u201cRoma\u201d must register with the police if there is any attempt at residential relocation.\n[14] The principal claimant testifies that he experienced those conditions, starting as a young child, and that, at school, he experienced hard times, being called names such as \u201cdirty gypsy\u201d or \u201ccrow\u201d. He testifies that the teachers at school had no sympathy for him, or for other Roma students from his community.\n[15] The principal claimant testifies that, as a result of the regular harassment at school, he sought employment at an early age, but that in searching for employment, also, he experienced difficulties and discrimination. He testifies that he was regularly refused employment, with only the explanation that he was Roma.\n[16] The principal claimant testifies further, that, as an adult, also, he experienced direct physical and verbal abuse by Romanian persons, and even by the police in Romania. He testifies that on three occasions when he sought help of the police in Romania, he was rebuffed and insulted.\n[17] The principal claimant testifies to the following specific incidents that he faced as an adult., such as happened in Romania at a market, in the year 2008. On that occasion, he states, he became involved in a physical and verbal altercation at a grocery store with employees who perceived that his cousin, his wife and himself were there to steal.\n[18] The principal claimant testifies that they were followed around, and, at the cashier, an employee pulled the hair of his cousin. He testifies that he intervened, to also protect his wife, and he was punched in the face, and they were called \u201ccrows\u201d. As well, when they managed to exit the store, they noticed on that there were other persons on the outside who were gathering to physically abuse them.\n[19] The principal claimant testifies that, in that same year, 2008, while on his way to work in one of the villages, he was beaten by racist Romanians. Also, in that same year, he and his wife were kicked out of a restaurant because Romanians in the building felt uncomfortable. And, when he attempted to make a report to the police, it was not accepted.\n[20] The principal claimant states, further, that in the year 2010, while driving with a friend, they were pulled over by the police, and that even after offering a bribe, they were beaten by the police.\n[21] The principal claimant testifies further, as contained in his narrativeiii, to incidents that occurred in the years 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015, where the underlying facts are alleged to be incidents of discrimination, and physical altercations with Romanians, in which, also, he states, the police in Romania did not offer any assistance, following complaints, and that the police, themselves, assisted in the discrimination.\n[22] The principal claimant testifies that he left Romania in [XXX] 2016, and, after travelling with his brother [XXX] through [XXX] he arrived in the USA, where he asked for asylum.\n[23] The principal claimant testifies that he was arrested for being illegally in the USA, and, later, he was released, with an ankle monitor device.\n[24] The principal claimant testifies that, on [XXX] 2018, he and the spouse travelled to Canada in order to make a refugee claim, and they did so, travelling by boat.\nDETERMINATION\n[25] For reasons below, I find that the claimants are Convention refugees, as, in my opinion, their expressed subjective fear has an objective basis.iv\nANALYSIS\n[26] The claimants\u2019 national identity is established on the basis of a certified true copy of documentsv submitted by Immigration Canada, and, as well, as established in their package of personal documentsvi which include a copy of the national Identity card of Romania, in the name of the adult claimants.\nCredibility\/plausibility\n[27] I agree with counsel\u2019s submissions, namely that, overall, the evidence is credible, and that it presents information of a serious violation of the claimants\u2019 human rights in Romania.\n[28] I am satisfied that the principal claimant presented his testimony in a straightforward and consistent manner, and I find that he clarified, satisfactorily, the concerns raised by the Ministervii, in the written document.\n[29] I find that the principal claimant has adequately clarified that a charge against him in the USA was the result of an accusation of a [XXX] and that, in the end, it was [XXX] by a US Judge.\n[30] I note that, also, as clarification, the principal claimant has explainedviii that, in [XXX] by the police on a [XXX] on the street. Similarly, he explained, in [XXX], the principal claimant was [XXX] for the same offence of [XXX] on the street. He returned to Romania in 2007, following which he travelled around Europe job hunting, but eventually resorting to [XXX].\n[31] I find that the principal claimant was straightforward in his testimony in this area, and, with particular respect to the Minister\u2019s concern on the charge against the principal claimant in the USA, the testimony is accepted, and not fatal to the claims.\n[32] As well, I find that the details of the manner in which the adult claimants entered Canada [XXX] in a process that, seemingly was contrary to CBSA requirements, is not a bar to the making of a refugee claim, and given the clarification provided.\nObjective Basis\n[33] I find that the claims, as presented by the adult claimants, are supported by the guidelines in the Hand Bookix, and by the case-lawx, where it is held that a number of discriminatory and harassing acts may cumulatively amount to persecution.\n[34] I find that, in addition to the claimants\u2019 undisputed testimony, I can rely on the documentary evidencexi, some of which forms part of Counsel\u2019s submissions.\n[35] In his writtenxii and oral submissions, Counsel has provided a helpful review of the country condition documents and case law that relate to Romania, and as found in his documentary packagexiii.\n[36] In my own review, also, I find that a relevant guide to my conclusions is found in excerpts of the Response to Information Request, ROU105285.Exiv, as follows.\n[37] In that documentxv, the following is said, in part.\n\u201d \u2026 The World Bank report indicates that Roma in Romania are \u201cpoor, vulnerable and socially excluded\u201d (28 Feb. 2014, 5). A report produced by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) and the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) that\u201d draws on the results of the UNDP\/World Bank \/European Commission regional Roma 2011 survey [3]\u201d, reports that approximately 81 percent of Roma are at risk of poverty compared to approximately 41 percent of non-Roma (EU and UN 2012, 24.xvi\nUnder the heading Treatment of Roma (Treatment by Society), it is stated that, \u201cthe US Department of State\u2019s Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2014 indicates that roma face systemic discrimination by society, which affects them in areas of education, housing, health and employment (US 25 June 2015)\u2026 Country Reports 2014 notes that stereotypes and discriminatory language regarding Roma was widespread (US 25 June 2015,33)\u2026 According to a report the Open Society Foundation (OSF)\u2026 indicates that \u201cpervasive racism and racist violence continue to distance many Roma families and groups from the greater society (OSF 10 Sept 2013yvii.\n[38] I find to be relevant, also, a documentxviii found in Counsel\u2019s package where the opening sentence reads, \u201d \u2026 In a ruling dealing with what it called \u201cinstitutionalized racism\u201d directed against Roma in Romania, the European Court of Human Rights has for the first time explicitly made use of the term \u201cethnic profiling\u201d with regard to police action it found to be discriminatory\u201dxix.\nFailure to claim elsewhere- [XXX]\n[39] I have accepted as reasonable, the claimant\u2019s testimony and counsel\u2019s submissions on the issue that the claimant failed to seek asylum in [XXX], which he visited in the year 2003 and 2006, respectively. Counsel points out that, and as found in his documentary package, an IRB documentxx, notwithstanding that there is not likely a bar against claiming refugee protection in these countries by citizens of these countries, the provisions of the Asnar Protocolxxi virtually prevents the filing of refugee claims from citizen of European States, as there is an almost zero recognition of claims among the European States.\n[40] Counsel points out that, according to some documentary evidencexxii, procedurally, the governments of these countries behave differently in the matter of asylum claims, and that some countries reject applications from countries considered to be safe countries.\n[41] I have determined, also, that the claimants\u2019 decision to leave the USA to seek protection in Canada is not unreasonable, The principal claimant testifies that he was informed that Canada could provide them with protection, while, at the same time, during his wait in the USA he faced the difficulty of surviving on little money [XXX] while his spouse, the female claimant, [XXX] for money and food.\n[42] For these reasons and after careful consideration of the evidence and submissions, I find that the adult claimants [XXX], the principal claimant, and his common-law spouse, [XXX], the female claimant have established valid claims and are Convention refugees.\n[43] I accept the claims of [XXX].\n[44] I reject the claim of the son, [XXX], the minor claimant, a citizen of the USA. In his claim, no evidence has been adduced in support, pursuant to s.96 or s. 97 of IRPA.\n(signed) G.

Kim\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Aleksandar Jeremic\nCountry: Turkey\nRPD Number: TB8-27767\nAssociated RPD Number: TB8-27831\nATIP Number: A-2021-00655\nATIP Pages: 000071-000075\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: Okay, this is a decision for the following claimant\u2019s [XXX] File number TB8-27767. I\u2019ve considered your testimony and other evidence in the case and I\u2019m ready to render my decision orally.\n[2] You are claiming to be citizens of Turkey and are claiming refugee protection pursuant to Section 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[3] I find that you are Convention refugees for the following reasons.\n[4] You allege the following; that you are citizens of Turkey and are Alevi\u2019s and that if you were to return you will face persecution due to your active involvement with HTP and CHP. You allege that there is no state protection for you or an internal flight alternative.\n[5] You allege that you were detained multiple times by the police and that even after you left Turkey people who knew you were being asked about you by the police when they themselves were detained.\n[6] Your personal identity as citizens of Turkey has been established by your testimony and the supporting documents including your passports and your identity as Alevi has been established by your testimony and the supporting documents including a support letter from your father, [XXX] and a letter from Canadian Alevi Culture Centre.\n[7] I find that on a balance of probabilities that your personal and religious identities have been established.\n[8] I find that there is a link between what you fear and one of the five convention grounds specifically political opinion. I therefore assessed your claims under Section 96.\n[9] In terms of your general credibility I have found you to be credible witnesses and I therefore believe what you have alleged in your oral testimony and in your basis of claim forms. Your testimony was straightforward and was in keeping with your basis of claim form and there are no significant inconsistencies or omissions that went to the heart of the claim.\n[10] I therefore find the following to be credible; that you are people who face persecution due to your involvement with the oppositional parties, namely HTP and CHP, at the hands of the state authorities.\n[11] Your oral testimony today included details regarding your involvement with HTP and CHP and the incidents you experienced with the police. You testified how you became involved with both parties and the roles and responsibilities you had.\n[12] You also describe the number of protests and rallies you attended as well as the work you did helping with referendum and election campaigns which lead to a house raid where your parent\u2019s house was raided by the police and all of your sisters including yourself was taken into the police station and was interrogated.\n[13] You testified prior to the house raid that you experienced violent encounters with the police and were detained multiple times after protests. You also testified that you received phone calls that threatened you to stop your political engagements.\n[14] Your sister the associate claimant also testified regarding her involvement in political parties and rallies and the subsequent detainment and the house raid she also experienced.\n[15] You also provided documents in support of your testimony that you have been active members and supporters of HTP and CHP and that you have been experiencing threats and risk from the police and these documents include letters of support from your friend, father and sister, photographs of the associate claimant as she was campaigning for the referendum and a letter from Canadian centre for victims of torture.\n[16] You also submitted social media posts that were critical towards the government, the letter from your sister and your friend who was detained and interrogated after you left Turkey which describes how police were still looking for you and harassing your family members and friends to get information about you.\n[17] Your testimony and the supporting documentation all establish that you have been actively involved in the HTP and CHP and therefore have been targeted by the state authorities.\n[18] The objective documentation supports your allegations that individuals in your circumstance face persecution at the hands of state authorities and society at large.\n[19] According to the national documentation package Item 1.6, 2.1, 2.3, 13.1 and 13.3 the persecution that the HTP supporters and those who voice criticism against the government face, they face discrimination and violence.\n[20] National documentation package Item 13.1 speaks to it by stating that the anti Kurdish sentiment is high in Turkey and permissive political environment turns this sentiment into violence in some cases.\n[21] Item 13.3 describes that the anti terrorism legislation led members of the Kurdish community to be vulnerable to violence and that there are significant restrictions on their rights to freedom of expression and association as well as (inaudible), arrest and detention and persecution.\n[22] In your case it\u2019s not that the state authorities identify you as Kurdish people but as those who are active in supporting HTP and their goals.\n[23] Item 2.3 describes the correlation between the heightened conflicts between the resurgence and how the Turkish government has been using these conflicts to justify a crackdown on Kurdish political parties, media outlets and civil society organizations.\n[24] NDP Item 1.6 and 2.3 also describe how the different laws such as anti terror and defamation laws have been used to stop political opponents as well as ordinary citizens from voicing criticism by filing criminal charges against and persecuting a wide range of individuals.\n[25] According to the national documentation package Item 2.1 during the year of 2018 the government opened investigations into thousands of individuals including minors for insulting the president and the detainees charged against anti terror laws had no substantial link to terrorism and that they were detained to silence critical voices or weaken political opposition to the ruling AKP particularly the HTP members and officials.\n[26] Specifically Item NDP Item 11.3 and 11.4 describe the lack of freedom of speech on the internet and how the government recently started to crackdown on those who post, posted critical things against the government through criminal investigation and persecutions which have affected a wide range of people from journalists and human rights activists to high school and university students and construction workers.\n[27] I therefore find that you have a well founded fear of persecution. I find that you have rebutted the presumption of state protection because the state is the agent of persecution in this case and it would be unreasonable for you to seek state protection in this case.\n[28] According to the national documentation package Item 2.1 the government continues to take limited steps to investigate, prosecute and punish members of the security forces and other officials accused of human rights abuses and that impunity for such abuses remained a problem.\n[29] In Item 2.3 it describes that the issues of corruption remains a major problem in Turkey.\n[30] Based on your personal circumstances as well as the objective country documentation l find that the adequate state protection will not be available to you as the state will be unwilling to protect you in Turkey.\n[31] As you have rebutted the presumption of state protection and since the country documentation indicates that the situation for individuals in circumstances such as yours is the same throughout the country, I find that you do not have a viable internal flight alternative.\n[32] Based on the totality of evidence I find that you have established that there is a serious possibility of persecution on the convention ground namely the political opinion. I therefore find that you are Convention refugees and I accept your claims.\n[33] Thank you.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n",

Mary Akhbari\nCountry: Algeria\nRPD Number: TB8-26732\nATIP Number: A-2021-00655\nATIP Pages: 000066-000070\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: And I told the claimant I am accepting her claim, and here are my reasons.\n[2] So, the claimant, [XXX] \u2014 this is file TB8-26732 \u2014 is a citizen of Algeria and claiming refugee protection under s. 96 and s. 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. As the claim involves allegation of domestic and gender-based violence, the chairperson\u2019s guideline 4 on women refugee claimants fearing gender-related persecution was considered for the claimant and applied to the hearing and determination of this claim.\n[3] The details of this claim can be found in the Basis of Claim form, which is Exhibit 2, and as amended, found in Exhibit 2.2. The claimant alleges that she faces a serious possibility of persecution at the hands of her father and older brother. She alleges that she spent a life in Algeria being at the mercy of her father who regularly abused her, verbally, psychologically, and physically. She alleges that her father tried to stab her on two occasions, that both times he grabbed a sharp abject and came at her, but she managed to escape to her room. She alleges that she has not heard from her father since she left Algeria but fears for her life and continues to believe him to be capable of hurting or killing her, as she has disobeyed him by escaping and her father does not like to have his authority challenged.\n[4] I have considered all the evidence and I find that you are a Convention refugee and that you face a serious possibility of persecution under s. 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act on the basis of your membership in a particular social group as a woman fearing domestic violence.\n[5] With respect to your identity, I am satisfied of your persona) and national identities as a [XXX] Algerian woman and that these have been established on a balance of probabilities by a certified true copy of your passport filed at Exhibit 1, and this includes also a Canadian visa that you used to travel to Canada.\n[6] With respect to your credibility, I found you to be a credible witness, and I believe on a balance of probabilities the key allegations of your claim. You testified experiencing verbal and emotional abuse at the hands of your father in your childhood. You testified that the abuse got worse and included physical abuse after you finished school in 2005 and your father forbade you from working. You testified that your mother was also subject to frequent abuse by your father. You testified that your older brother subjected you to verbal abuse, but you testified during the hearing that you could \u201ctolerate\u201d him, and you felt like the one who would hurt you would be your father. You describe your father as a dangerous, illogical man with whom you had no relationship and who would frequently not talk to you. You testify in a straightforward, spontaneous, detail, and sincere manner.\n[7] I did not find that you embellished your story or exaggerated your allegations during your testimony. You provided several details beyond the parameters of your Basis of Claim thereby lending further credibility to your statements. I also note that there were no contradictions, inconsistencies, or omissions between your BOC, your testimony at the hearing, and the documentary evidence submitted.\n[8] You explained to me how you were living in an open prison, that you led a life with no goals, no purpose, with your dreams destroyed. Your father did not allow you to work or get married or have any friends. I believe what you have alleged on a balance of probabilities.\n[9] You also testified on the abuse by your father, the verbal and psychological abuse, the words he would use to call you at home, how he would constantly belittle you, and how he has attempted to severely hurt you with a sharp abject. You testified that your father\u2019s abuse left you feeling betrayed and feeling like there was injustice for you having to go through such hardship. I believe what you have alleged on a balance of probabilities.\n[10] I had concerns about your departure from Algeria. You told me that your father did not know that you had applied for a passport and that you were hiding this passport in your room. You told your mother why you were leaving Algeria, to get away from mistreatment, and that in order for you to do so, your mother had asked your brother to come with her for a [XXX] so that the house would be empty while your father was at work. I accept this explanation on a balance of probabilities.\n[11] I also had concerns about your delay in claiming in Canada. However, the evidence provided in your testimony and in your BOC satisfy me in terms of your efforts in seeking counsel and juggling the legal aid system in Ontario. You did initially file your Basis of Claim form with the assistance of your brother before retaining counsel. I also accept this explanation on a balance of probabilities, and I find that the credibility concerns by your delay in claiming in Canada are outweighed by your credibility regarding the violence and the threats perpetrated against you.\n[12] As such, I accept on a balance of probabilities what you have alleged as credible, and I also find that your actions reflected a subjective fear.\n[13] With respect to the objective basis now, your allegations are consistent with the objective documentary evidence concerning gender-related violence in Algeria.\n[14] There exist a societal atmosphere in Algeria that contributes to the tolerance of domestic violence and silence victims. That is found at item 5.3 of Exhibit 3.\n[15] Human Rights Watch has stated that the shortcomings of the Algerian government\u2019s response to the problem of domestic violence include a lack of services for domestic violence, particularly shelters, a lack of measures for the prevention of violence, such as use of educational curricular to modify discriminatory social and cultural patterns of behaviours as well as derogatory gender stereotypes, and insufficient protection from abusers, such as restraining orders and inadequate response from law enforcement. Domestic violence was made a criminal offence in Algeria under law number 15-19, but the law has serious shortcomings, as the scope of the definition of domestic violence does not include ail individuals. It is intended to apply to both current and former spouses but does not extend to relatives, unmarried couples, or other household members. And also, there is no overarching legal framework governing violence against women in Algeria. That is found at item 5.2 of Exhibit 3.\n[16] Also, in item 5.3, domestic violence survivors can find themselves trapped, not only because of economic dependence on their abusers, but also because of social barriers which included pressure to preserve the family at all costs, stigma, and shame for their family if women leave or report abuse.\n[17] Counsel\u2019s disclosure at Exhibit 6 included many reports about the domestic violence crisis in Algeria and the extent to which many women are killed by members of their own families.\n[18] Accordingly, I find your fear with respect to the violence at the hands of your father to be objectively well-founded.\n[19] With respect to state protection, you said that you never went to the police because you felt that they would not protect you, and that it would result in you ending up on the street, as there are no shelters. You added that, based on what you know, the police would call your father and force you and him to reconcile.\n[20] The documentary evidence provides that there are significant gaps in Algeria\u2019s legal framework, and the evidence also supports what you have testified about. Frequently, when a woman has enough courage to approach the police to denounce the violence, the officers try to deciduate (sic) her from pressing charges on account of it being a familiar matter, or are dismissive in their response. As previously discussed, the law offers the possibility for the offender to escape punishment or benefit from a reduced sentence. This has the effect of increasing the victim\u2019s vulnerability to social pressure to pardon her abuser, and it might lead to her being dissuaded from seeking court remedies for domestic violence. In addition, the law relies heavily on an assessment of physical incapacitation \u2014 think I said it right \u2014 in order to decide on sentencing without offering guidelines for doctors on how to make a determination of incapacitation in domestic violence cases.\n[21] So, in light of this evidence, I conclude that it would be unreasonable for you to seek protection from the authorities in Algeria, and as such, I find there is no adequate state protection.\n[22] Now, lastly, with respect to an internal flight alternative, you made it clear that the main problem in your relocation elsewhere in Algeria was not that your father would be able to find you anywhere you go, the problem is that you would have to live in Algeria as a single woman with no family support. You testified not being in contact with other family members living outside the capital, and that you had actually tried one time to reach out to your aunt for help because she lives in the desert of [XXX], but that she refused to help you. You have no family support available to you, and you explained that you had not worked since 2005, given that you were prohibited by your father from doing so. While I do note that you have a job in Canada, I will acknowledge the Canadian context and society to be different.\n[23] According to the objective evidence, women who try to relocate and live by themselves are mistreated in their new communities, and they expose themselves to gender-related risks, as they are seen as having poor morals. In addition, they usually face many challenges, including challenges in securing jobs and housing. To successfully relocate, women who are not accompanied by males need a strong network of relatives and friends in the new location, which you do not have. Often women running away from domestic violence end up living by themselves, and that is not something that can be done in Algeria. You are supposed to run to a family member.\n[24] So, based on this objective evidence, I find that the test for internal flight alternative fails on the second prong. I conclude that you do not have a viable internal flight alternative in Algeria.\n[25] In conclusion, after assessing all of the evidence, your testimony, objective evidence, your persona) evidence, I find that you would face a serious possibility of persecution should you return to Algeria based on your membership in a particular social group as a woman fleeing domestic violence and I therefore accept your claim.\n[26] That is it. Thank you, everyone.\n[27] And thank you for your patience. And congratulations and wishing you an excellent weekend.\n[28] COUNSEL: Thank you. Bye-bye.\n[29] CLAIMANT (without interpreter): Okay, thank you. Bye.\n[30] MEMBER: Madam [inaudible] \u2014\n[31] INTERPRETER: Bye-bye.\n[32] COUNSEL: Thank you, everyone. Bye, everyone. Have a great weekend.\n[33] MEMBER: Thank you. You \u2014\nREASONS CONCLUDED\n\n",

Nicholson\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Mary Jane Campigotto\nCountry: Lebanon\nRPD Number: TB8-25424\nAssociated RPD Number: TB8-25462\nATIP Number: A-2021-00655\nATIP Pages: 000058-000065\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] The claimants [XXX] and [XXX] purport to be stateless Palestinian refugees. They have claimed refugee status pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (the Act).1\nDESIGNATED REPRESENTATIVE\n[2] The claimant [XXX] acted as the designated representative for the minor claimant, [XXX]. He confirmed his knowledge of his responsibilities in this regard prior to the hearing.\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] The claimants\u2019 allegations are set out in their Basis of Claim forms (BOCs).2 They allege they are at risk of persecution in Lebanon due to their Palestinian ethnicity.\n[4] The male claimant testified being born in Lebanon, but moving to the United Arab Emirates as an adult, where he created a business [XXX]. The claimant testified to mistakenly arrested in [XXX] on suspicion of being a [XXX] due to confusion of his name with that of a [XXX], which resulted in his name being flagged and him being routinely harassed and threatened in Lebanon on his visits if he did not pay a bribe.\n[5] In [XXX] 2017, the claimant was questioned by UAE intelligence regarding his connections to refugee camps in Lebanon. After refusing to work with them, the claimant attempted to move to Lebanon, but testified to being frightened by an attack by militants.\n[6] The claimants arrived in Canada on valid visas on [XXX] 2018.\nDETERMINATION\n[7] The panel concludes that the claimants are Convention refugees.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[8] The panel was provided with true copies of their Lebanon issued Travel Documents for Palestinian Refugees,3 as well as documents relating to their residency in the UAE.\n[9] The panel finds that the documents, and the testimony of the claimants, are sufficient to establish their identities on a balance of probabilities.\nCountries of Habitual Residence\n[10] The claimants are stateless Palestinians. Statelessness per se does not give rise to a claim to refugee status: the claimant must demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution based on a convention ground or that they possess a s.97(1) risk in a country of former habitual residence.\n[11] The concept of \u201cformer habitual residence\u201d implies a situation where a stateless person was admitted to a country with a view to enjoying a period of continuing residence for some duration. The claimant does not have to be legally able to return to a country of former habitual residence. The claimant must have established a significant period of de facto residence in the country in question. The claimants must establish that they are persecuted in one country of former habitual residence, and are unable to safely return to any other.4\n[12] The Federal Court of Appeal established that a broad and liberal approach must be taken when assessing a proposed country of former habitual residence: there is no minimum period of residence required in that country, the analysis should not be unduly restrictive, the claimant does not need to be able to legally return; and the claimant must have established some significant period of de facto residence there.5\n[13] The male claimant and minor claimant lived for most of their lives in the UAE. The panel finds that the UAE is a country of habitual residence for them.\n[14] The claimants were able to legally enter and return to Lebanon, and if they had not gone to the United States and then Canada, they likely would have been required to return to Lebanon. The male claimant was born in Lebanon, the claimants presented documents that were provided to the claimants by the government of Lebanon, and the male claimant testified to having extensive family in Lebanon, and testified to intending to live in Lebanon with the minor claimant permanently.\n[15] The panel finds these circumstances are significant and substantially connect the claimants to Lebanon, and that Lebanon is a country of habitual residence for the claimants.\nNexus\n[16] The panel finds that the claimants have established a nexus to the convention, namely through their ethnicity as stateless Palestinians in Lebanon.\nCredibility\n[17] The panel had serious issues with regard to the male claimant\u2019s credibility.\n[18] The male claimant was, at times, flippant and dismissive of repeated questions from the panel. The claimant caused a considerable procedural difficulty at the first hearing date, when he admitted that he did not understand English to the extent required to understand his BOC without interpretation.\nIncident in Lebanon\n[19] The claimant indicated that he was attacked by militants on his return to Lebanon in 2018. He testified that two men on motorcycles stopped the car he was travelling in on [XXX] 2018, seized him, beat him, stated they were from Hezbollah and would follow him wherever he went.\n[20] It was pointed out to the claimant that his BOC did not mention that the attackers threatened the claimant, did not mention the claimant was driving a car, did not mention that the attackers were on motorcycles, and did not mention the attackers had mentioned they were members of Hezbollah.\n[21] The claimant responded that he did not remember the situation very well.\n[22] The panel finds it unlikely that the claimant, given the claimant testified it was his only physical interaction with persecutors, would make so many mistakes in his description.\n[23] The panel rejects the claimant\u2019s explanation for the omissions, and draws a negative inference with regard to his credibility.\n[24] Given the vast difference between the male claimant\u2019s description of the incident in his BOC and in his testimony, the panel finds that the incident did not happen and that the claimant is not pursued by Hezbollah.\nOther Incidents in Lebanon\n[25] However, the panel finds that the claimant has, through his testimony, established that he is a stateless Palestinian.\n[26] The claimant testified to having to pay a bribe every time he went through the airport, and to having family members who died in the camps from intrareligious warfare, and to having had difficulties as a businessman working in Lebanon due to his statelessness. It was also made clear that the minor claimant would have difficulty obtaining schooling and social services due to her status as a stateless Palestinian.\n[27] The panel accepts that the claimants are stateless Palestinians and the claimant\u2019s description of the incident of 1983 and the resulting issues, which were presented in detail and made clear by the claimant\u2019s testimony. The panel finds that the claimants have been subject to discrimination that, in its severity, amounted to persecution due their status as stateless Palestinians.\nUnited Arab Emirates\n[28] The claimant credibly testified that, due to his last name, he was questioned by UAE security forces, and that he was asked to offer intelligence to UAE security. The claimant refused, which he testified put a mark on his security record.\n[29] Through documentary evidence,6 the panel finds that the claimant has established his status has been revoked in the UAE and finds that, on a balance of probabilities, he would be unable to return given his security issues.\nSUBJECTIVE BASIS\n[30] The male claimant indicated he was afraid of returning to Lebanon due to the profile given to him by his last name and the treatment he suffered. The panel finds that the claimants have established a subjective fear of persecution.\nOBJECTIVE BASIS\n[31] Objective evidence indicates that the claimants\u2019 options as stateless Palestinians would be limited to either living in one of the refugee camps near Beirut, the conditions of which are described by the United Nations as \u201cdeplorable,\u201d7 or to attempt to live in general Lebanese society without familial connections, which objective evidence indicates is bereft of all but menial employment and features extremely limited housing opportunities, as well as reduced access to social services and healthcare.8\n[32] Militant groups are common in Palestinian refugee camps and frequently engage in violent conduct against fellow Palestinians within the camps, including arrest and kidnapping of outsiders in camps without judicial oversight and without protection by Lebanese authorities.9 Objective evidence indicates that this is a risk regularly faced by stateless Palestinians in Lebanon.10\n[33] The panel finds that the claimants have an objective basis for their claim of persecution in Lebanon as stateless Palestinians, and that they would face a well-founded fear if they were to return there, given their lack of connections, the primary claimant\u2019s age, and their status as stateless Palestinians.\nSTATE PROTECTION\n[34] The state is presumed able to provide adequate protection to its citizens. Therefore, claimants have the duty to seek state protection before seeking protection in Canada. However, in certain circumstances, it would be objectively unreasonable to expect a claimant to do so. Furthermore, the protection available to a claimant may not be adequate given their specific circumstances.\n[35] Lebanon does not provide state protection in Palestinian camps.11 Objective evidence notes that the security situation is generally poor throughout Lebanon for Palestinian refugees,12 and there is a \u201ccrisis of governance\u201d in Palestinian camps that means Peoples Committees are generally seen as being unable to protect their constituents from harassment from Lebanese forces harassing their residents.13\n[36] The panel finds that the claimants have rebutted the presumption that adequate state protection exists for them in Lebanon with clear and convincing evidence.\nINTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE (IFA)\n[37] The claimants were asked if they would be able to live elsewhere in Lebanon, and were given the example of Beirut. The panel finds that the claimants would face persecution as stateless Palestinians throughout Lebanon.14\n[38] The panel finds that the claimants would not have an IFA in all of Lebanon.\nCONCLUSION\n[39] The panel finds that the claimants face a serious possibility of persecution in Lebanon and can not return to the United Arab Emirates.\n[40] The panel accepts their claims.\n(signed) T.

Dookun\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Teklemicheal A Sahlemariam\nCountry: Ethiopia\nRPD Number: TB8-06719\nATIP Number: A-2021-00655\nATIP Pages: 000052-000057\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: So I have enough information ma\u2019am to go ahead and make a decision in your claim without hearing from your counsel. Mr. Interpreter I \u2018m just going to mute you and you can do this simultaneously okay, counsel you know if you need me just wave right?\n[2] So ma\u2019am based on the information that I have in front of me you are a [XXX] old female citizen of Ethiopia. You are seeking refugee protection pursuant to Sections 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, sorry I see Mr. Interpreter looking at me are you hearing me okay Mr. Interpreter or have you waved interpretation?\n[3] INTERPRETER: She waived (inaudible)\n[4] MEMBER: You waived interpretation? Is that what happened?\n[5] INTERPRETER: Yes, I will stay though.\n[6] MEMBER: Got you, alright so I don\u2019t have to mute you then fine.\n[7] So the specific details of your claim ma\u2019am are set out in your basis of claim form which I\u2019ve labelled Exhibit 2.\n[8] To summarize you are of Oromo ethnicity, in around [XXX] 2017 after your brother was displaced you along with other Oromo people demanded that the Oromia government seek justice for the Oromo people who were killed in an attack by the Liyu L-I-Y-U, forgive my pronunciation, police in [XXX] 2017.\n[9] So as a result of your actions you were detained overnight with the condition that you appear whenever the authorities demanded that you appear. After the state of emergency was declared in [XXX] 2018 you received word that two of the persons that were with you in [XXX] 2017 were arrested and two others had gone into hiding.\n[10] You then decided to flee Ethiopia for Canada. You fear that if you return to Ethiopia you could be killed by the government due to your ethnicity as Oromo and also due to your perceived political opinion and also due to your failure to comply with their demands which is to make yourself available whenever they ask for you.\n[11] There\u2019s also a brief mention in your basis of claim form of a fear of your Muslim family members because of your marriage to a Christian man which occurred in approximately 1992 by the Western calendar. I have to note that this fear is not reiterated in your narrative.\n[12] Anyway the panel finds that you are a person in need of protection pursuant to Section 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[13] With regard to your identity, you established your identity by way of your Ethiopian passport which I have in Exhibit 1. You testified that that is a genuine document, you established your identity as Oromo by way of your Kebele card which I have in Exhibit 4 and also a letter from an Oromo organization also in Exhibit 4. So, on a balance of probabilities the panel accepts your personal identity as you\u2019ve alleged.\n[14] With regard to credibility I have to the [XXX] report in Exhibit 5 that report warned me that you may find being questioned reminiscent of being interrogated which might cause you to experience [XXX] throughout the hearing such [XXX].\n[15] The [XXX] report warns that you may display nonverbal behaviours in response to questions that are a reflection of your experiences in Ethiopia. So I was mindful of that as I was asking you questions this afternoon, that\u2019s one of the reasons that the questions were few.\n[16] That being said you did testify in a straightforward manner, you made no attempts to embellish your testimony. There were no inconsistencies or contradictions inherent in your testimony. Your responses were all very detailed and direct.\n[17] I noticed that there were times where you switched from the Oromo language to the Amharic language but thankfully we had an interpreter who spoke and understood both languages so that was not a really a problem this afternoon. Overall the panel has no reason to doubt that your sworn testimony was truthful.\n[18] Now very briefly with regard to your religion and your fear based on the interfaith marriage, there was no real persuasive evidence put forward to support the allegation that there would be a risk to your life or a risk of persecution based on your interfaith marriage.\n[19] The documents at 12.1 specifically states that most major religions respected each other\u2019s religious practises and permitted intermarriage. You may have faced some displeasure at the hands or the voice of your family members because of your choice but nothing that amounts to persecution or a risk to life. So the panel finds no objective basis for your fear based on your interfaith marriage.\n[20] Now with regard to the situation for the Oromo people in Ethiopia and the change of circumstances I rely heavily on the documentary evidence in Exhibit 3 which talks about the changes that have occurred in Ethiopia since the new Prime, Oromo Prime Minister has taken place.\n[21] Now the panel is aware that the Oromo people have faced persecution in Ethiopia at the hands of the Ethiopian government in the past just as you\u2019ve described ma\u2019am but the panel finds that the changes that have occurred in Ethiopia appear to be substantial and appear to be sustainable.\n[22] I\u2019m going to talk about a few of those changes and this information comes from 2.1 of Exhibit 3, the government in Ethiopia took positive steps towards greater accountability under Prime Minister Abiy to change the relationship between security forces and the population.\n[23] On June 18th 2018, 2017, 2018 the Prime Minister 2018 yes, thank you counsel, the Prime Minister spoke to the nation and apologized on behalf of the government for decades of mistakes and abuse he said amount to terrorist acts. Prime Minister Abiy\u2019s assumption to office was followed by positive changes in the human rights climate.\n[24] The government decriminalized political movements that had been accused of treason in the past, this includes many Oromo organizations. The government under Prime Minister Abiy also invited opposition leaders to return to the country and resume political activities. The government allowed peaceful rallies and demonstrations and continued steps to release thousands of political prisoners.\n[25] The document goes on to say that both the number and severity of human rights issues diminished significantly under Prime Minister Abiy\u2019s administration and in some cases there were no longer, and in some cases the human rights issues were no longer issues by the end of the year.\n[26] Now some of these changes you indicated that you were aware of and some of these changes you indicated that you were not aware of because you don\u2019t know much about the politics.\n[27] The panel understands from some of the documents that your counsel provided in Exhibits 4 and 6 that the situation in Ethiopia today is not perfect, that\u2019s understood.\n[28] However based on the preponderance of the most recent objective documentary evidence the panel finds that the significant change of circumstances in Ethiopia has proven to be sustainable and is ongoing and it directly effects your situation ma\u2019am.\n[29] So the panel finds given the change of circumstances in Ethiopia there is Jess than a mere possibility ma\u2019 am that you would face harm at the hands of the Ethiopian authorities based on your previous political activities or your previous imputed or real political opinions or even your political opinions now and going forward.\n[30] Now that being said the panel finds that irrespective of your political affiliations and your political opinions there may be an outstanding warrant for your arrest in Ethiopia. Your committee members a couple of your committee members were arrested during the state of emergency and you testified that to date they have not been heard from.\n[31] So as far as you know they are still being detained. You were able to evade that arrest during that time by leaving Ethiopia. You testified this afternoon that you believe that there is a warrant for your arrest in Ethiopia an outstanding warrant for your arrest.\n[32] The panel finds on a balance of probabilities that if an outstanding warrant for your arrest exists that you may be detained upon entry to Ethiopia. So that\u2019s separate from your political activities, this warrant for your arrest that may exist.\n[33] The documents tell me again relying on Exhibit 3 Item 2.1 states that if detained you could face torture and abuse at the hands of security officials. Inmates are reported to have been flogged and have suffered broken bones and head injuries at the hands of prison guards and sexual abuse is also a concern at the hands of prison officials.\n[34] Overall prison and pretrial detentions centre conditions are said to be harsh and in some cases life threatening. So the panel finds in this particular case ma\u2019am that there is a serious possibility that you would face cruel and unusual treatment or punishment should you return to Ethiopia having evaded arrest in 2018.\n[35] So clearly because it is the state that your fear, the authorities that you fear there would be no state protection for in Ethiopia and similarly because the at this point the government or the police forces are the agents of persecution there would be no internal flight alternative available to you anywhere in Ethiopia.\n[36] So the panel therefore finds ma\u2019am that you are a person in need of protection pursuant to Section 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. The Refugee Protection Division accepts your claim.\n[37] So that\u2019s going to conclude the hearing for this afternoon, you can, you can interpret now Mr. Interpreter.\n[38] Thank you ma\u2019am for your answers this afternoon, your claim has been accepted. Thank you Mr. Interpreter for your patience and your professionalism.\n[39] INTERPRETER: Thank you (inaudible)\n[40] MEMBER: The echo?\n[41] INTERPRETER: Yes (inaudible)\n[42] MEMBER: I know I know sometimes that can be an issue and then you know my accent is so heavy hahaha\u2026 that\u2019s a problem as well.\n[43] INTERPRETER: No way.\n[44] MEMBER: You couldn\u2019t understand when I said committee and I couldn\u2019t understand when you said isn\u2019t it so it\u2019s fair right we had some trouble understanding each other so that\u2019s fine and counsel of course it\u2019 s always a pleasure working with you thank you for your time and your patience this afternoon\n[45] COUNSEL: Thank you bye bye.\n[46] MEMBER: You\u2019re very welcome\n[47] INTERPRETER: Your comment about your comment about accent I feel bad.\n[48] MEMBER: You feel bad?\n[49] INTERPRETER: You said my accent is heavy but I told you, I thought it was me.\n[50] MEMBER: No, my no my accent haha\u2026because to you I have an accent right, to you I have very strong accent and to me you have a very strong accent right but to each other you guys, you guys think you don\u2019t have accents at all, you speak perfectly well, so everything was relative, everything is very subjective but we made it through that\u2019s all that matters.\n[51] INTERPRETER: (inaudible) it was not about accent or anything but I hadn\u2019t done any significant communication (inaudible)\n[52] MEMBER: Okay it does take some getting used to there is sometimes a delay you know like a very bad long distance phone call where the person speaks and you have to wait then pause and until you hear it so it does take some getting used to. Counsel and I we\u2019re old pros at it now but\u2026for your first video conference Mr. Interpreter you did amazing excellent job.\n[53] INTERPRETER: Yes (inaudible).\n[54] MEMBER: Alright, alright so everyone have a good afternoon than I\u2019 m ending this call.\n[55] INTERPRETER: Thank you madam member.\n[56] MEMBER: Alright okay bye bye ma\u2019am.\n[57] CLAIMANT: Thank you\n[58] MEMBER: You\u2019re very welcome bye bye.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n",

And, alleging a well-founded fear of persecution, by reason of your imputed political opinions.\nDETERMINATION\n[2] I conclude that you have established that there is a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground.\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] Regarding your allegations, you have alleged the following. You are [XXX], from Burundi and a member of the Tutsi ethnic group. You fear, that should you return to Burundi, you will be perceived as an opponent of the government and subsequently face persecution at the hands of State authorities, including NISS, members of the CNDD-FDD Party, and the Imbonerakures. This fear is based on a number of factors. One being that prior to leaving Burundi, in 2014, at the end of\u2026 at the early [XXX] \u2026 in [XXX] 2015, in 2014 you were a student activist, and you had represented students at your youth university opposing a change in school policy, which brought you to the attention of the authorities at that time.\n[4] Not long after that event, you went to the U.S. on [XXX] 2015, with a Student Visa. And, you did seek asylum in the U.S. Your asylum application is still pending, but after receiving a letter from the Immigration authorities advising you that your asylum processing would be on the basis of a last\u2026 and first out, you decided to come to Canada because of the delays in having your claim processed in the U.S.\n[5] While being in the U.S.A., the situation in Burundi deteriorated, and there was also persecution towards ex-FAB members. The fact that your father is an ex-FAB, and the fact that you are a young Tutsi from Bujumbura, and who has resided out of the country for a number of years, are additional reasons why you fear persecution should you return to Burundi.\nANALYSIS\nIDENTITY\n[6] Regarding your identity, it has been established by acceptable documentation, namely your passport.\nCREDIBILITY\n[7] Regarding credibility, the onus is on refugee claimants to demonstrate the elements of their claim for refugee protection. And, regarding credibility, there is also a principle which is laid out in the Federal Court decision called Maldonado, which states that when a refugee claimant swears that certain facts are true, this creates a presumption that they are true, unless there is a valid reason to doubt their truthfulness. In your case, you testified in a spontaneous and detailed manner, and your testimony was consistent with the evidence on file. And, I do not make a negative conclusion regarding your credibility. In support of your claim, you also filed a number of documents. You supported documents to confirm your attendance at university in Burundi in 2014. Documents to corroborate your father is an ex-FAB. And, documents regarding your asylum application in the U.S.A.\nOBJECTIVE BASIS\n[8] Your allegations are also corroborated by objective evidence on country conditions. The documentary evidence in the National Documentation Package, in 13.6, indicates that Burundi has been in a crisis since the President announced in April 2015 a third mandate, and that since then the political and ethnic tensions in the country have increased, particularly for persons who would be perceived as an opponent. Which is a serious possibility, given your student activism, your father being ex-FAB and your ethnicity. Your father was a former soldier of the former Tutsi-dominated army called the ex-FAB. The documentary evidence in tabs 2.13 and 13.1 of the National Documentation Package support that ex-FAB members are being persecuted. According to sources, there is a purging of ex-FAB soldiers from the former Tutsi-dominated army. Human rights organizations have received on a regular basis information regarding assassinations, forced disappearance, torture, and arbitrary arrests of ex-FAB members.\n[9] With regards to ethnicity, you are a young male Tutsi, whose family resided in Bujumbura, an area that is at times considered hostile to the government. The objective evidence on country conditions supports that those who are perceived as opposing the government in power do face persecution, and the current situation in Burundi has deteriorated for political opponents and for the gen\u2026 the population in general in the country. Following the presidential elections held in July 2015, Burundi has been shaken by wave killings of members of political parties of all sides. These killings exemplify the climate of general insecurity in the country. A U.S. Country report stated that there were numerous reports the government, or its agents, committed arbitrary or unlawful killings, often against perceived supporters of the political opposition or those who exercise their lawful rights. The 2018 report of the U.N. Commission Inquiry, whose members were denied access to the country by the government, but who conducted interviews with more than 400 witnesses living in exile, restated its conclusion from the previous year and found reason to believe that arbitrary killings remain a widespread practice in Burundi, and that members of the National Intelligence Service, police and Imbonerakures, were mostly responsible for these killings.\n[10] Regarding your ethnicity, the documentary evidence would also indicate the following in 13.1, in a report that was published in 2016 by the International Federation of Human Rights and the Burundian Human Rights League, state that while the ethnic factor is not always the primary motivation for crimes committed by the Burundian security forces, it tends to become an indicator of the violence exercised by the Burundian authorities against those they suspect of being opposed to the President\u2019s third term. The same source states that Tutsi populations are thus perceived as being opposed by nature to the power in place and are persecuted for this reason. And that, according to another source, Burundi\u2019s ongoing political crisis has not occurred primarily on ethnic nine\u2026 ethnic lines, nonetheless in some places in the country violence has taken on explicitly violent dimensions. In most instances of ethnically charged violence, and this is violence that has largely targeted Tutsis.\nSTATE PROTECTION\n[11] Regarding State protection, taking into consideration the objective evidence regarding the situation in Burundi and of those perceived as opponents, and those who are Tutsi, as I indicated earlier, there are reports that indicate authorities have been the perpetrators of acts of violence towards persons in your\u2026 in your situation or a similar situation. Therefore, due to the current situation in Burundi at this time and the overall insecurity in the country, I find that it would be unreasonable for you to seek State protection, and the presumption of State protection is rebutted.\nINTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE\n[12] Regarding an internal flight alternative, haven\u2019t take\u2026 having taken into consideration your particular circumstances and profile, I find that the fear you have alleged would be found throughout the country, and therefore a viable alter\u2026 internal flight alternative would not be available.\nCONCLUSION\n[13] Having analyzed the evidence as a whole, I find that you have discharged your burden of establishing that there is a serious possibility that you would be persecuted on a Convention ground, and therefore I accept your claim for refugee protection. Alright, ok. So, that puts an end to the hearing.\n\n",

Having been informed of the cancellation of the [XXX] he took the initiative on or about [XXX], 2016 to organize a meeting with [XXX] [phonetic] of the [XXX].\n[4] During their conversation or discussion, should I say, he would have said to [XXX] that the military were indeed taking control over the country which was led [XXX] to terminate abruptly the meeting. Later on, his human resources department would have called him and told him that he was removed from [XXX], [XXX]. That wasn\u2019t all. This episode led to the following incidents which are forming the basis of their refugee claim.\n[5] On [XXX], 2016 at about 3 o\u2019clock the Claimant was arrested from home and brought to [XXX] where he was detained for [XXX] days plus one week and questioned about the Muslim Brotherhood, the revolution of the 25th of January, 2011 and the revolution of the 30th of June, 2013. He will eventually be released upon accepting to write a statement in which he engaged himself not to participate in future political events nor to express his political views in the future and therefore he was released.\n[6] A second arrest took place on [XXX], 2017. In fact, the Claimant was about to leave his office located in [XXX] which is a neighborhood of [XXX] in order to meet a friend or a colleague from [XXX] and once at the [XXX] he was arrested by the police and taken to the national security building. He was slapped, interrogated, humiliated and later on put in detention under poor conditions.\n[7] His release was secured after [XXX] days. However, he soon realized that they were direct repercussions to his problems with the [XXX] as his employer had forced him to resign and accordingly, he was facing a loss of several benefits. He was told directly and indirectly that the intelligence unit or national security apparatus had informed the employer that to keep him in this position was not good for their business. And it is understood according to the Claimant that he was sacrificed on the basis of higher commercial interests of [XXX].\n[8] This led him to make the decision to visit Canada with his wife, his younger child and his mother on [XXX], 2017. However, as two of his children had remained in Egypt the Co\u00adClaimant was forced to return to Egypt on [XXX], 2017 while the Principal Claimant remained in the Montreal area. It appears that he was trying to heal from the past incidents.\n[9] However, he was informed that the police raided his house on [XXX], 2018 in his absence as they were looking for him in order to arrest him. This prompted this decision to depart from Canada and return back to Cairn which he did on [XXX], 2018. Even though he was not arrested he was detained at the passport unit for two hours and let go.\n[10] Again, on [XXX], 2018 he was arrested from home by joint forces including police and army personnel, taken by truck outside Cairn and put in detention in a facility which was unofficial according to him. And where the regime opponents were detained. It is his understanding that the people there were mostly accused or suspected of having activities with the Muslim Brotherhood or to have western views or collaborating with western countries. He was later on taken to [XXX] [phonetic] where he was released as his wife was waiting for him.\n[11] Upon this last release the Claimant decided to go to the north part of Egypt to be as much as possible away from his family for their safety and it is on or about [XXX], 2018 that he took the decision to leave Egypt in order to seek international protection. As he was fearful of being controlled and possible arrested but also afraid of putting his wife and children in danger, he decided to contact people and try to organize a collaboration of state security apparatus in place by paying individuals that would facilitate his departure from Egypt without any problems.\n[12] It is therefore in those circumstances that the Claimant came to Canada with the idea of claiming refugee status which led to the current hearing.\n[13] Naturally as minor children are involved in the process of this hearing the tribunal had the opportunity to confirm that for this proceeding the main Claimant, Mr. [XXX] was appointed and accepted the responsibilities of Designated Representative for his minor children, namely, [XXX], [XXX] and [XXX]. This in accordance with Section 167(2) of the IRPA and RPD Rule 20 and Guideline No. 3.\n[14] Under the rubric of determination, the tribunal finds that the Claimants have established that they would face a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground should they return to their home country, Egypt. Therefore, the tribunal finds that they are \u201cConvention Refugees\u201d.\n[15] In making this assessment the tribunal considered all of the evidence including the oral testimonies and the documentary evidence filed by the board but also by their counsel.\n[16] The Claimant\u2019s identities as citizens of Egypt is established through their original passports containing a Canadian visa. Their passports were seized by Canada Border Services Agency, CBSA and therefore the Claimants have met their burden of proof to the satisfaction of the tribunal.\n[17] Under the rubric of nexus in this case the Claimant\u2019 s fear are linked to two Convention grounds. First political opinion and secondly, membership in a particular social group, namely the family group for the Co-Claimant and the children.\n[18] As for the credibility, when a Claimant swears that certain facts are true this creates a presumption that they are indeed true unless there is a valid reason to doubt their veracity. The determination as to whether a Claimant\u2019s evidence is creditable is made on the balance of probabilities. In assessing credibility, the tribunal was mindful of the Claimant\u2019s profile. The tribunal is cognizant of many difficulties faced by claimants in establishing a claim including cultural factors, the milieu of the hearing room, the stress inherent in responding to questions and sometimes through an interpreter and nervousness.\n[19] It is important to mention that the Claimant\u2019s allegations were also supported by numerous documentary evidence establishing that they were targeted by the state security apparatus, the police force and or the military and that the Principal Claimant was detained on several occasions.\n[20] To this effect it is important to mention that the Principal Claimant professional and corporate profile was established through several documents including but not limited to his CV, social insurance contributions, internal communications at [XXX]. All of these documents were filed under Exhibit 4, Item P4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 16, 17 and 18.\n[21] As for the prosecutor incidents they were also corroborated by the Claimant\u2019s letter of resignation to [XXX] and numerous police reports and lawyer\u2019s letters. Indeed, we have the resignation letter filed under Exhibit 4, Item P9 but also, we have a police report filed as Item P10 for the arrest of [XXX], 2016, P11 concerning the disappearance of the Principal Claimant on [XXX], 2017, P12 concerning the police raid on the residence of the Claimant on [XXX], 2018 and finally Exhibit P14 pertaining to the arrest of [XXX], 2018.\n[22] Accordingly, we had also the benefit of seeing the letters from his lawyer pertaining to the raid of [XXX], 2018 filed as Item P13 and the letter to the Attorney General sent by his lawyer pertaining to his arrest and detention following the event of [XXX], 2018.\n[23] So, all this evidence stated above corroborated the Claimant\u2019s allegations of the persecutory acts they have faced and also of their subjective fear of returning back to Egypt and facing again persecution at the hands of the state security apparatus.\n[24] In reaching this conclusion the panel also considering Section 203 of the UNHCR Handbook on procedures and criteria for determining refugee status as it states that it is hardly possible for refugee claimants to prove every part of their case and also Section 39 which states that a person would not normally abandon his home and country without some compelling reasons. As a matter of fact, under the objective basis the tribunal further finds that the Claimant\u2019s evidence as a whole is generally consistent with the objective documentary evidence.\n[25] Indeed, Exhibit 4, Item 19, filed on behalf of the Claimant consists of three newspaper articles pertaining to the arrest of opponents to the regime or their suspicious disappearances. Moreover, the latest Human Rights Watch Report for 2018 refers to the regime\u2019s campaign of intimidation, violence and arrests against political opponents, the civil society and whoever criticizes the government.\n[26] The fight against terrorism is the general pretext for the repression and multiple human rights abuses in order to silence even the most pacifist opponents. In fact, the poor human rights record of the current Egyptian regime is detailed throughout the National Documentation Package as it [phonetic] appears from Exhibit No. 3. Therefore, the Claimants allegations are plausible within the social and political environment prevailing in Egypt.\n[27] As for the state protection and the internal flight alternative even though the tribunal has not identified such issues it is important to mention that the state is the agent of persecution and the state of Egypt is in full control over its sovereign territory protection and state protection and IFA are not viable options in the case at bar.\n[28] Finally, under the rubric of conclusion the tribunal finds that the Claimants have established that they would face a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground in Egypt.\n[29] Having considered all of the evidence the tribunal determines that Mr. [XXX], his wife [XXX] and their minor children, [XXX], [XXX] and [XXX] are \u201cConvention Refugees\u201d pursuant to Section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[30] It is therefore unnecessary for the tribunal to conduct an analysis of Section 97(1) of the Act.\n[31] On behalf of all Canadians but in my personal name I welcome you to Canada and wish that you will be able to find happiness here and serenity and that you will be able to materialize your dreams.\n[32] Therefore, I would like to express my sincere thanks to Ma\u00eetre Beauchemin for his usual collaboration and to our interpreter and I wish you a wonderful day. It is now two minutes past eleven and this is ending today\u2019s hearing in the case number MB8-25654. Have a nice day everyone.\n\n",

        "unofficial_text":"2020 RLLR 34\n\nCitation: 2020 RLLR 34\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: January 16, 2020 (date of transcription)\nPanel: N\/A\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): N\/A\nCountry: Uganda\nRPD Number: MB8-21947\nATIP Number: A-2021-00655\nATIP Pages: 000024-000027\n[1] These are the reasons for the decision in the claim of Madam [XXX], who claims to be a citizen of Uganda, and is claiming refugee protection pursuant to Sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. I note that prior to the hearing, the Board has granted Counsel\u2019s request to designate the claimant as a vulnerable person according to Chairperson\u2019s guideline concerning procedures with respect to vulnerable persons appearing before the Immigration and Refugee Board. As per request of the Counsel, the Board has allowed the following procedure accommodations to ensure that the claimant was not disadvantaged in presenting her case. A female Member Panel, a small hearing room, and the taking of breaks according to the needs of the claimant.\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] The claimant alleges that she fears persecution by the government because of her political opinion and because of her sexual orientation as a lesbian. She believes that if she returns to Uganda, she will be imprisoned and seriously harmed by the government and there is no safe place for her to return to in Uganda.\nDETERMINATION\n[3] Having considered the totality of the evidence, I find the claimant to be a \u201cConvention refugee\u201d under Section 96 on the grounds of her political opinion.\nANALYSIS\n[4] The determinative issue in this claim is credibility.\nIDENTITY\n[5] Based on a certified true copy of the claim\u2026 claimant\u2019s Ugandan passport and her national identity card, the original of which was seized by the CBSA, I\u2019m satisfied with the claimant\u2019s nationality and personal identity.\nCREDIBILITY\n[6] In assessing the claimant\u2019s credibility, I have taken into consideration her medical report from the [XXX] in the United States, and her psychiatric reports from the [XXX] in Montreal, and a letter from a psychotherapist. I note that she was diagnosed with [XXX] by Dr. [XXX] (phonetic) of the [XXX]. With respect to her political activism, I find that claimant was capable of giving a spontaneous and straightforward testimony. She answered all the questions posed to her without hesitation. She was able to elaborate on her motivation, involvement, and aspirations in human rights issues and politics in Uganda. She provided a detailed account of the alleged incidents that she and her family encountered at the hands of the State agents because of her anti-government views and opinions. There were no major inconsistencies, discrepancies or omissions between the claimant\u2019s testimony, her previous declarations and the documentary evidence she provided in support of her alleged incident of persecution. In particular, the police reports and the medical certificate of her son corroborate her allegations of being targeted by the State. I have no reasons to doubt the authenticity of these documents.\n[7] With respect to the claimant\u2019s subjective fear, I note that the claimant was in the United States from [XXX] to [XXX] 2014, during which time she did not claim refugee status. As to explain why, she testified that her children were in Uganda then, under the care of her elderly mother. And, there had been no serious incident that occurred to her yet. She missed her children and she wanted to be reunited with them, taking care of them, with the hope that things would turn better. She therefore did not claim asylum in the States and returned to Uganda. I find her explanations not unreasonable. The claimant went to the United States again at the end of [XXX] 2018 and stayed there for three days before coming to Canada to seek protection. She was asked why she did not claim refugee status in the States on this occasion. She explained that her plan was to come to Canada because her husband was here and she believed this is a good country where she can have all the freedom. Given the short stay she was in the United States, the Panel does not infer her failure to claim refugee status in the U.S. to a lack of subjective fear. For both reasons, I conclude that the claimant has established her subjective fear of persecution by reason of political opinion.\nOBJECTIVE BASIS\n[8] I further examined whether there is an objective base to the claimant\u2019s subjective fear of persecution. I note that the claimant\u2019s allegations of the treatment of political opponents by the ruling party are supported by the following objective documentary evidence in the National Documentation Package for Uganda. The Amnesty International report 2017, 2018, states that rights of freedom of expression, association and assembly were restricted. Individuals in Uganda who express political views that do not align with the government in power face a risk of persecution. The Human Right Watch 2019 states that violation of rights to freedom of association, expression and assembly persisted, as security forces beat, and at times torture and arbitrarily detain protestors, journalists and opposition members. 33 people, including 6 parliamentarians, were arrested during the bi-election campaigns in Arua. They faced treason charges and alleged torture by the security forces, police and soldiers beat and detain journalist reporting in Arua and at ensuing protests. The United States Department of State country report on human rights practices for 2018 notes that significant h7uman rights issues were observed, including unlawful killings and torture by security forces, harsh prison conditions, arbitrary detention, restrictions on freedom of press, expression, assembly, and political participation as well as official corruption. The same report also notes that the Ugandan government was reluctant to investigate, prosecute or punish officials who committed human rights violations whether in the security services or elsewhere in the government and impunity was a problem. The police arrest and detain members of the opposition. Given all of the above objective country conditions, I find there is an objective basis to the claimant\u2019s subjective fear.\nSTATE PROTECTION\n[9] I have considered whether the claimant would have State protection should she return to Uganda. In this case, given the agent of persecution is the State, which acts with impunity as it transpires in the documentary evidence I just referred to, I find that adequate State protection would not be reasonably forthcoming to the claimant in her circumstances. Hence, the presumption of State protection was rebutted.\nINTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE\n[10] I have also considered whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for the claimant. The documentary evidence indicates that the State authorities operate similarly throughout Uganda, and that the State is un control of all its territory. Therefore, I do not find that the claimant has a viable alternative of internal flight anywhere in Uganda.\nCONCLUSION\n[11] Based on the foregoing analysis, I find that the claimant has established there is a reasonable chance or serious possibility that she would be persecuted for a Convention ground, that is by reason of political opinion, should she return to Uganda. I therefore accept her claim.\n\n",

The Claimant discussed how there was a general atmosphere of apprehension over [XXX] in the UAE, as foreign workers were beginning to be replaced with local Arab employees. On one of his biannual trips to visit his family in [XXX], Pakistan, he befriended [XXX] (the Mullah), a cleric at the mosque in his village, given that he was of the view that in the, not too distant, future he might be sent back to Pakistan from the UAE and he was looking to make connections in his home town. He developed a relationship with the Mullah and he introduced the Claimant to [XXX] ([XXX]) while on a subsequent trip to Pakistan in [XXX] 2018. The Claimant stated that [XXX] tried to pose himself as a scholar of Islam and contemporary issues, and they would speak about the greatness of Jihad.\n[3] The Claimant returned to the UAE in [XXX] 2018 to continue working. In [XXX] 2018, the Claimant stated that he received a call from [XXX] asking him to donate one million rupees for the Taliban Jihad. The Claimant refused, stating that the Jihad of [XXX] is sedition, and he would not pledge one penny to this cause. The Claimant stated that [XXX] responded by stating that the Taliban would have to now get involved to handle this case.\n[4] On [XXX], 2018, the Claimant stated that his family in [XXX] received a letter from the Taliban stating that if he did not pay, then they would kill him upon his return to Pakistan. In [XXX] 2018, the Claimant alleges to have received a call while in the UAE telling him to pay and that if he didn\u2019t comply there were people in the UAE that would take care of him. The Claimant stated that the caller accurately described his daily movements, visits and schedule which led him to believe that he was being watched and followed in the UAE. Fearful that both his job was not secure and fearing for his life in Pakistan, the Claimant left the UAE for the United States of American on [XXX], 2018, to claim asylum.\n[5] Following his departure from the UAE, the Claimant alleges that the Taliban issued a fatwa (the Fatwa) against him stating that he was a kafir (an infidel), they have added his name to a \u201chit list\u201d and information about him has been passed on to their expansive networks throughout Pakistan to find and kill him. Following the issuance of the Fatwa, the Claimant stated that police attended at his family\u2019s home in [XXX] looking for the Claimant, and stated that he is to appear at the police station for the purposes of investigating a religious complaint. He further asserts that the police continue to attend at his family\u2019s home every 3-6 months looking for him.\n[6] In an amendment to his Basis of Claim form (BOC)2, the Claimant advanced that in [XXX] 2020 his relatives stated that the Fatwa was being distributed at a mosque in Karachi, which is located at the other end of Pakistan, over [XXX] km away from [XXX].\n[7] The Claimant fears the Mullah, [XXX], the Taliban, the Pakistani police and now the general population who would glean favour for killing an infidel.\nDETERMINATION\n[8] Having considered the evidence and the Claimant\u2019s testimony in its entirety, the Panel concludes that the Claimant has established a serious possibility of persecution, based upon his imputed religious opinion.\n[9] For the reasons that follow, the Panel finds that the Claimant is a \u201cConvention refugee\u201d under Section 96 of the IRPA, and accepts his claim.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[10] The Claimant\u2019 s personal and national identity as a citizen of Pakistan is established, on a balance of probabilities, by way of a certified true copy of his Pakistani passport, including the United States Visa that the Claimant used to travel to the United States3.\nCredibility\n[11] The Panel finds the Claimant to be a credible witness and believes, on a balance of probabilities, the key allegations of his claim. The Claimant testified in a straightforward, spontaneous, detailed, and sincere manner. The Panel did not find that the Claimant embellished his story or tried to exaggerate the allegations during his testimony.\n[12] The Panel also noted that there were no significant contradictions, inconsistencies, or omissions between the Claimant\u2019s Basis of Claim BOC, his testimony at the hearing or the documentary evidence submitted. The testimony of the Claimant also included additional details which were not in the BOC and added to the credibility of the story.\n[13] The Claimant spoke and wrote in detail about his views of Islam. He is more open-minded, liberal and egalitarian given the years he has spent in a more moderate society, in the UAE. He described the various threats against him which began with demands, then led to telephone calls, visits by the police and ultimately culminated in the issuance and distribution of a fatwa.\n[14] The Panel believes, on a balance of probabilities, that the Claimant is targeted and continues to be targeted by the Mullah, [XXX], members of the Taliban and the police (collectively, the Agents of Persecution). Given that there was an announcement at the local mosque declaring that a fatwa was issued against the Claimant by the Taliban, the Claimant contends that he can become a target of any extremist who believes it is their duty to kill him in the name of religion.\n[15] In furtherance of the foregoing, the Claimant also disclosed a number of supporting documents, including a letter from the Taliban4, the Fatwa5, a letter from his Pakistani lawyer6, an affidavit from his father7 and his wife8, and a recent letter of public gathering with the Mullah and XXXX as guest speakers9, all of which are uncontradicted and which corroborate the Claimant\u2019s testimony.\nObjective Evidence\n[16] The objective documentary evidence provides that blasphemy and other offences relating to religion are criminalized in Pakistan under Articles 295 and 298 of the Pakistan Penal Code. Punishment for blasphemy is death10. \u201cThe introduction of the blasphemy laws in the [Pakistani] Penal Code has reportedly fostered an atmosphere of religious intolerance (\u2026). The blasphemy laws have also come under strong criticism for fuelling extremist violence and targeted attacks against individuals from religious minority groups11.\u201d \u201cIn 2017, the independent Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) reported an increase in blasphemy-related violence, use of religious rhetoric, incitement of hatred and discrimination against minority groups. The HRCP noted the government failed to repeal discriminatory laws. Local and international observers report increasing misuse of blasphemy laws, and a widening of actions considered chargeable blasphemy offences12.\u201d\n[17] While Pakistani\u2019s blasphemy laws purport to protect religious sentiments, sources have expressed concerns over the use of the laws by individuals apparently for other motives. These motives might include, and consistent with the case at hand, personal or religious disputes. The effect of these laws violates the rights to life, freedom of thought, conscience and religion or belief, and freedom of opinion and expression13.\n[18] Further, the law has been described as vaguely formulated, and enforced by the police, prosecutors, and judiciary in proceedings that often violate the right to a fair trial, including the fundamental principle of presumption of innocence where prosecution proceed on the basis of unfounded accusations by complainants. Death sentences have been imposed, in violation of international law, on people convicted of blasphemy14.\n[19] Religious clerics, such as the Mullah in the foregoing case, hold significant power in the registration of blasphemy cases. Their opinions are frequently sought by complainants, and often also by the police as part of their investigation. Faced with pressure from religious clerics and their supporters, the police may forward a case to the prosecutor on the basis of insubstantial evidence. Police rely on fatwas from local clerics to determine whether the allegations amount to blasphemy, even though they have no legal evidentiary value15.\n[20] The laws have created an environment in which some people, including complainants and their supporters in blasphemy cases, believe themselves entitled to take the law into their own hands, while the police stand aside. The laws have been used as a cover for perpetrators of mob violence16. There is a lack of a consistent, robust and timely response by the authorities to situations of such violence. The lack of response, and the failure to prosecute rigorously and promptly those responsible, leads to a climate of impunity for perpetrators of further such attacks17.\n[21] Given the foregoing, together with the numerous articles on blasphemy provided by counsel18, the Panel finds that the Claimant\u2019s allegations are consistent with the objective evidence and therefore the Panel concludes that his subjective fear is objectively well founded. In addition to the articles on blasphemy, counsel also submitted numerous articles regarding the continued pervasiveness of the Taliban in Pakistan19.\n[22] The Panel concludes that the Claimant has met his burden of proof and has demonstrated that he would face a serious possibility of persecution based on a Convention ground if he returns to Pakistan.\nState Protection\n[23] The Claimant fears religious fundamentalists\/extremists, in particular the Taliban, the Mullah and [XXX]. The Panel notes that the documentary evidence provides that there is a general lack of rule of law in Pakistan20, including a lack of due process, poor implementation and enforcement of laws and frequent mob violence and vigilante justice with limited accountability21.\n[24] The power wielded by the religious clerics, combined with the high level of corruption within the police force and the lack of political will in Pakistan to address said corruption leads the Panel to conclude that adequate state protection would not reasonably be likely to be forthcoming to the Claimant, should he return to Pakistan. Therefore, the Panel finds that the Claimant has rebutted the presumption of adequate state protection.\nInternal Flight Alternative (IFA)\n[25] The Panel finds that the Claimant has a credible fear of being persecuted by Muslim extremists, including the Taliban, throughout Pakistan and that, therefore, there is no possibility of a viable internal refuge anywhere in that country. The Panel is guided by the documentary evidence which provides that if the agents of persecution are armed militant groups, they may not be safe anywhere due to their wide geographical reach22. The Taliban is a major terrorist group in Pakistan focused on conducting terrorist attacks against the military and civilians in Pakistan23. Growing religious extremism in Pakistan threatens its security and stability, as well as freedom of expressing and other fundamental human rights24. Besides the militant groups\u2019 ability to find the Claimant, there are examples in the documentary evidence where vigilante justice was perpetrated against people accused of blasphemy by religious clerics.\n[26] Given the totality of the foregoing, the Panel finds that the Claimant has a credible fear of being persecuted throughout Pakistan and that, therefore, there is no possibility of a viable IFA anywhere in that country.\nCONCLUSION\n[27] Having considered the evidence, including the relevant documentary evidence and the Claimant\u2019s testimony, the Panel determines that the Claimant would face a serious possibility of persecution should he return to Pakistan based on his imputed religious opinion.\n[28] The Panel, therefore, finds that the Claimant is a \u201cConvention refugee\u201d pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA.\n[29] The Panel, therefore, accepts his claim.\n(signed) Samantha Bretholz\nDecember 7, 2020\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c, 27, as amended.\n2 Document 2-Basis of Claim Form (BOC).

When a Claimant swears\/affirms to tell the truth, this creates a presumption that those allegations are true unless there be reasons to doubt their truthfulness.3 However, standing alongside this is the recognition that I am entitled to make reasonable findings based on inconsistencies, omissions, implausibilities, common sense, and rationality. I am also entitled to reject un-contradicted evidence if it is not consistent with the probabilities affecting the case as a whole.\n[7] In assessing your credibility, I have considered several factors, including your age, level of education and experience, cultural and social factors, the unfamiliar hearing environment and the challenges inherent in responding to questions through an interpreter. As such, I find that your testimony was in-line with what I would reasonably expect of a Claimant with your particular profile regarding your support and membership with the Oromo Liberation Front (OLF) and your anti-government political opinion.\n[8] You testified in a forthright, genuine, and voluntary manner. I found your testimony to be detailed, and you intelligently described the political landscape in Ethiopia. Furthermore, I find that you were a credible and reliable witness as to your personal and political circumstances in Ethiopia. There were no relevant contradictions, omissions or inconsistencies between your testimony and the other evidence before me that were not satisfactorily explained.\n[9] Overall, I find you to be credible witnesses and therefore I believe what you have alleged in support of your claim.\nSupporter and Member of the Oromo Liberation Front (OLF)\n[10] Mr. [XXX], you testified that you were a supporter of the OLF since [XXX] of 2014 and became an official member on [XXX], 2018. You indicated that your support and your membership stems from the longstanding mistreatment of the Oromo people that you witnessed firsthand. You testified that growing up you used to hear about the struggle of the Oromo people from your parents and other relatives. I asked what prompted you to become an official member of the OLF at the time when you did. You responded that even though you were a supporter of the OLF since 2014 your knowledge about politics was rather general and that you decided to become an official member of the OLF because you wanted to contribute to the human rights struggle of the Oromo people in whatever way you could. You were able to give me details as to the history of the OLF, and the process to become an official member. In support of your claim you tendered your Oromo Liberation Front Membership Identification document.\n[11] I find that you have established, on a balance of probabilities, that you were a supporter and member of the Oromo Liberation Front while in Ethiopia.\nAttended Human Rights Demonstrations in Support of the Oromo Community\n[12] You testified that while in Ethiopia you participated in three public demonstrations. You were able to give fulsome details as to the peaceful nature of the protests, what they were about, the location, size, and how government authorities used violence to disperse the crowds. You testified that after each demonstration you witnessed many participants who were either injured or killed. I questioned you as to why you would continue to participate in these demonstrations when there was a possibility that you could be injured or killed. You indicated that since you are part of the Oromo community and know the injustice and human rights violations against your community you could not just sit home and do nothing.\n[13] I find that you have established, on a balance of probabilities, that you attended three demonstrations in Ethiopia: two in November of 2018 and one in December of 2018.\nClaimant was Detained\n[14] Your testimony as to your detention on two separate occasions was spontaneous, detailed, and consistent with the information you provided in your BOC and narrative. You were able to describe the circumstance surrounding your detentions, including the appearance of the detention rooms, the questions asked during your interrogations and the circumstances surrounding your releases, in a manner consistent with your BOC.\n[15] Regarding your first detention on [XXX], 2019, you testified that you went to the municipality to renew your business license, however, instead you were stopped and taken to a hidden location by two government security officers. You testified that a second arrest\/detention occurred on [XXX], 2019, when you went back to the municipality to inquire about your business license and was told that your business license had been cancelled because you were a supporter of the OLF and that you could no longer run a business in the country. You indicated that when you were leaving the municipality you were stopped by city police and taken to [XXX] Prison.\n[16] You testified that during both your detentions you were physically abused, accused of facilitating and inciting anti-government movements and organizing Oromo youth to act against the government. You indicated that after you were released from the second arrest on [XXX] 2019 you had to pay a [XXX]-birr bail with the condition of not being involved in any activities of the OLF.\n[17] In support of your claim, you provided two witness statements, including one from your wife, [XXX] which confirms your two arrests, and how she accompanied you during your hospital stay after your first detention. Your sister, [XXX] also provided a witness statement, which attests to the action she took to find you after your detentions and what she observed regarding your appearance and physical condition when she was allowed to visit you during your second arrest at [XXX] Prison. You also provided, your Business License Certificate along with a Commercial Registration. I find that these documents are consistent with your testimony and with what you have alleged in your claim.\n[18] I asked why you did not provide the board with any documentation regarding your hospital stay and any medical treatment that you alleged to have received. You testified that you were not given any discharge papers and when your wife went to retrieve your medical records, she was unsuccessful. Given the current political climate in Ethiopia, in particular, the treatment of individuals within the Oromo community, I find this answer reasonable and take no issue with it.\n[19] I find, on a balance of probabilities, that you were arrested and detained on [XXX] 2019 to [XXX] 2019 and again on [XXX] 2019 to [XXX] 2019.\nPolitical Activities in Canada\n[20] You testified that since your arrival in Canada on [XXX], 2019, you have been involved with the Oromo community by attending meetings at the Oromo Canadian Community Association, by joining the Oromo Christian Church of Toronto and participating in several peaceful protest demonstrations in downtown Toronto. You were able to give details as to the peaceful nature of the protests, what they were about, the location, size, and a list of dates that they took place. You testified that you spoke at a number of these demonstrations on how the Ethiopian government is abusive, divisive, and violates human rights. To support your claim, you tendered a letter of support from both organizations4, several photographs5 of you attending demonstrations in Toronto and a compelling video of you attending and speaking at a demonstration held in Toronto after the killing of an Oromo singer\/activist.6\n[21] I find that you have established, on a balance of probabilities, that you have been actively involved within the Oromo community here in Canada and continue to hold an anti-government opinion.\n[22] I find on a balance of probabilities, that you have established that you hold an anti\u00adgovernment opinion and therefore risk being persecuted by the Ethiopian authorities if you were to return to Ethiopia. As such, you have established a subjective fear.\nOBJECTIVE BASIS\n[23] The objective evidence is consistent with your accounts of fearing persecution because of your anti-government political opinion in Ethiopia.7\n[24] The evidence establishes, on a balance of probabilities, an objective basis for your fear of persecution upon return to Ethiopia. Specifically, Item 2.1 of the National Documentation Package (NDP), the US Department of State 2019 Human Rights Report for Ethiopia which indicates, that authorities arrested and detained opposition party members. It also states that the government uses a widespread system of paid informants to report on activities of individuals, such as opposition members, who report intimidating visits to their homes and offices. Furthermore, Ethiopian police are widely known to engage in serious human rights abuses against actual and perceived government opponents, including arbitrary arrest and detention, excessive use of force, and torture.\n[25] Reports from Human Rights Watch 2.3 of the NDP and Amnesty International 2.2 of the NDP still show that there are problems relating to opposition figures. However, in making my independent analysis, I have also looked to the International Criss Group (ICG) report found at 4.1 of the NDP. To summarize the ICG report, it states that \u201cPrime Mister Abiy Ahmed had taken important steps to move the country toward more open politics. But his efforts to dismantle the old order have weakened the Ethiopian state and given new energy to ethnonationalism. Hostility among the leaders of Ethiopia\u2019s most powerful regions has soared.\u201d The report goes on to say \u201csuch tensions could derail Ethiopia\u2019s transition. Meanwhile, reforms Abiy is making to the country\u2019s powerful but factious ruling coalition anger opponents, who believe that they aim to undo Ethiopia\u2019s ethnic federalist system and could push the political temperature still higher.\u201d\n[26] The objective evidence is consistent with your testimony and what you have alleged in your claim. Especially, your testimony regarding the treatment that you witnessed and suffered because you were a supporter and member of the OLF. Your testimony was clear that anyone who speaks out against the government becomes a target. You provided several news articles in your country document evidence8 that is in-line with what is seen in the NDP.\n[27] The situation in Ethiopia is still evolving, and while significant changes are certainly underway, I must consider the circumstance as they are right now. When doing so, I find the risk of persecution of those with anti-government opinions still stands as a serious possibility9. The stated intentions of those in control is not enough, the change needs to be durable.\n[28] I find that on a balance of probabilities, the country condition evidence establishes an objective risk.\n[29] I further find that your profile, specifically, as an individual who has already come to the attention of Ethiopian authorities through past detentions, who is actively involved in protesting the Ethiopian government here in Canada, and as someone who will continue to hold an anti\u00adgovernment political opinion, is consistent with your subjective fear.\n[30] Accordingly, I find that you have established a well-founded fear of persecution.\nSTATE PROTECTION\n[31] Ethiopian authorities are responsible for widespread human rights violations committed with impunity throughout the country, including arbitrary arrest, excessive use of force and torture.10\n[32] Given that the state is the agent of persecution, I find that it would be objectively unreasonable for the you to seek protection of the State in your circumstances, and that adequate State protection would not be reasonably forthcoming.\nINTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE\n[33] The Ethiopian government exercises its power throughout the whole of its territory and those who oppose the Ethiopian State are unlikely to be able to avoid attracting the attention of officials by relocating.11\n[34] Given that the State is the agent of persecution with control over the entire country, I find that there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout Ethiopia, and therefore that a viable Internal Flight Alternative (IFA) does not exist.\nCONCLUSION\n[35] Having considered the totality of the evidence, I find that you, Mr. [XXX], would face a serious possibility of persecution upon return to Ethiopia due to your anti-government political opinion pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA.\n[36] Accordingly, I accept your claim.\n(signed) Antoine Collins\nNovember 4, 2020\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n2 Exhibit 1.\n3 Maldonado [1980] 2.F.C. 302 (C.A).\n4 Exhibit 3\n5 Ibid.\n6 Provided at the hearing a recording of the video on Claimant\u2019s phone.\n7 National Documentation Package, Ethiopia, June 30, 2020.\n8 Exhibit 6.\n9 Item 4.1, National Documentation Package, Ethiopia June 30, 2020.\n10 National Documentation Package, Ethiopia, June 30, 2020.\n11 Ibid.\n\n",

        "unofficial_text":"2020 RLLR 31\n\nCitation: 2020 RLLR 31\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: November 24, 2020\nPanel: Paulina Gueller\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Jeffrey L Goldman\nCountry: Albania\nRPD Number: TB9-04003\nATIP Number: A-2021-00655\nATIP Pages: 000001-000007\nREASONS FOR DECISION\nINTRODUCTION\nIntroduction\n[1] These are the reasons for the decision in the claim of [XXX], who claims to be a citizen of Albania, and is claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[2] In rendering my reasons, I have considered the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9: Proceedings Before the IRB Involving Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression.\nAllegations\n[3] The claimant alleges that he fears persecution by the police and his family because of his sexual orientation as a gay man.\n[4] The claimant\u2019s allegations are set out in his Basis of claim form (BOC).1 In summary the claimant alleges that he realized that he was attracted to men at the age of 14. He had a relationship with his cousin. In [XXX] 2011 his maternal uncle found them and beat them. Both had to be hospitalized. While in the hospital police officer went to questioned them, but when he learnt that they were gays he spit on them and refused to take the report. After his uncle beat him, his father told him to leave the family home.\n[5] In [XXX] 2011 the claimant went to [XXX]. He applied for asylum, but it was denied. He was deported in [XXX] 2017. While in Albania, in [XXX] 2017 and [XXX] 2018, he was attacked by his cousins. The police hit him with a rubber baton in [XXX] 2017 when he told them the reason of his hospitalization.\n[6] The claimant tried to flee to Germany, but he was deported back to Albania. The claimant\u2019s cousins kept looking for him, so with the help of a smuggler he got an [XXX] passport and came to Canada. He applied for asylum at the airport.\nDecision\n[7] I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee, pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA, as there a serious possibility of persecution, should he return to Albania, on account of his membership to a particular social group as a gay man.\nIdentity\n[8] I find that the claimant\u2019 s identity as a national of Albania is established by his testimony and the documents provided, namely his Albanian passport.2\nCredibility\n[9] I find the claimant to be a credible witness and therefore believe what he alleged in support of his claim. He testified in a straightforward manner, and there were no relevant inconsistencies in his testimony or contradictions between his testimony and the other evidence before me which have not been satisfactorily explained.\n[10] For example: I note that the claimant sought asylum in [XXX], but he alleges it was denied and he was deported back to Albania in 2017. The claimant was asked to produce the documents from his asylum claim in [XXX], but he stated that he was not able to obtain them. I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant was deported in 2017 back to Albania. Therefore, on a balance of probabilities, I find that his claim was denied, otherwise he would have not been deported. Therefore, I find his explanation seems reasonable in his alleged circumstances, and therefore does not raise significant concerns with respect to subjective fear or credibility.\n[11] I also note that after the claimant was deported to Albania, he tried to leave the country again, but he was deported from Germany. I find on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant tried to flee Albania, because he feared persecution by his family. I find it reasonable in the claimant\u2019 s personal circumstances and I accept his explanations.\n[12] In particular, the following evidence establishes the allegations set above: the claimant provided a letter from [XXX], a friend in Albania who helped him providing shelter when he was deported from [XXX]; a letter from his cousin in Toronto and a friend he met in the community of 519, both are testifying of the sexual orientation of the claimant as a gay person. Documents from 519 and photos from the Christmas party.\n[13] After reviewing the documents, I have no reason to doubt their authenticity.\n[14] For someone who had grown up in a society where being on the LGBT spectrum is treated with contempt, ridicule and by many as an abomination, I find the claimant\u2019s testimony to be credible. He testified without any obvious embellishment and in a fluid, immediate way.\n[15] Therefore, I find, on a balance of probabilities, the claimant has a well-founded subjective fear of persecution in Albania and he established his core allegations of being a gay man.\n[16] I find that what the claimant fears constitutes persecution and that the persecution is linked to the Convention ground of his membership in a particular social group, as a gay man.\nObjective basis\n[17] The independent research3 shows there are serious human rights issues for LGBTI persons in Albania. The law in Albania prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation, including employment. However, the enforcement is considered generally weak. In addition, sexual orientation and gender identity are classes protected by the country\u2019s hate law. Despite these formal laws, public officials made homophobic statements, and there have been numerous cases of physical and psychological violence made against LGBTI persons including minors. While the Commissioner for Protection from Discrimination (CPD) investigated four cases of alleged discrimination, and opened an additional investigation based on gender identity and sexual orientation, it is a very small effort in the face of the 421 cases reported. The report also states that the Ministry of Health and Social Protection initiated a fund to open a shelter for LGBTI people, which assisted only 16 persons since March. While the effort is acknowledged, it appears to be a very small step forward.\n[18] In it\u2019s annual report the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association (ILGA), dedicated to LGBTI rights,4 reported on a growing number of LGBTI person, who have asked non-governmental organization\u2019s (NGO) for help in obtaining information about seeking asylum in EU countries, the US and Canada, caused by bias-motivated speech, violence, due to hate crimes towards LGBTI persons, who have been physically assaulted, bullying in schools, vulnerability with respect to obtaining housing, employment, backlash in cultural life, discrimination in healthcare, and the absence of support to amend the Family Code, to allow gay marriage. There was improvement in freedom of assembly as the Pride Parade went smoothly, and the Festival of Diversity for Human Rights of LGBTI was supported by the Tirana Municipality, the Council of Europe, and the EU. The report shows that LGBTI persons advanced their agenda, politically, nevertheless this segment of society is \u201cinvisible and unprotected\u201d.5\n[19] Referencing the social perceptions of Albanians, the Home Office reports6 that public visibility of LGBTI persons remains very low, even though individuals and activists have spoken up about their sexual orientation. It says that although the adoption of non-discrimination laws in 2010 have helped drastically, the topic is very present in the public debate. However, despite efforts to include LGBTI persons, homophobic sentiment remains high, and the \u201cculture of heteronormativity and patriarchy is still pervasive\u201d.7\n[20] The evidence also in the NDP does report societal violence against LGBT individuals, once again, starting with their families but also within society. While public communal violence against LGBT individuals is not as high in places like Tirana, given that there\u2019s perhaps a greater understanding of rights in some ways in that city, the documentary evidence is clear that discrimination continues even in Tirana in things like, employment and housing and education.8\n[21] The NDP9 also established that individuals are not open about their sexual orientation or gender identity in the workplace out of fear of being fired or facing discrimination and that it also notes that discrimination in employment occurs and that individuals continue to have to hide their sexual orientation in the workplace and that there\u2019 s also a noted rise, of LGBT youth having problem accessing housing given issues with discrimination10, as well as, not being able to live with their family. I find therefore that deep seated homophobia exists in Albania, which means that the claimant would not be able to find a viable internal flight alternative in Tirana, which is an area I questioned the claimant about.\n[22] Based on the country conditions evidence, your claim is objectively well founded.\n[23] Given that there are no serious credibility issues with respect to the claimant\u2019s allegations, coupled with the documentary evidence set out above, I find that there is more than a mere possibility that the claimant would face persecution in society in general, on account of his sexual orientation.\nState protection\n[24] I find that there is clear and convincing evidence before me that the state is unable or unwilling to provide you with adequate protection.\n[25] I find that it would be objectively unreasonable for the claimant to seek the protection of the state in light of his particular circumstances, as he has shown how he was unable to obtain police protection, because the police itself was de one ridiculing and beaten him. The independent research reports that \u201ccorruption is endemic in Albania\u201d the report examines the causes, and attempts of the current government to address the situation, however \u201cthe public perception on the spread of corruption among top police officials has increased\u201d, due examples given such as bribery, manipulation of evidence, etc.11\n[26] I also find that the claimant would not have adequate state protection in Albania given that some of the documentary evidence does speak about police officers continuing to be a source of the persecution and that they are themselves seen as agents of persecution by LGBT individuals in that, they ridicule. They don\u2019t help and they sometimes themselves are perpetrators of violence.\n[27] Therefore, I find that this objective evidence not only establishes that there would not be adequate state protection for the claimant, but it\u2019 s in line and consistent with his own experiences of what he has described of having been insulted and offered no assistance by the police officer who came to the hospital to interview him.\nConclusion\n[28] In light of the preceding, I conclude that the claimant is a Convention refugee, pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA. Accordingly, I accept this claim.\n(signed) Paulina Gueller\nNovember 24, 2020\n1 Exhibit 2\n2 Exhibit 1\n3 Exhibit 3 NDP for Albania (March 31, 2020).\n4 Exhibit 3 NDP item 6.1\n5 Ibid\n6 Exhibit 3 NDP item 6.5\n7 Ibid\n8 Exhibit 3 item 1.8\n9 Exhibit 3 item, 6.7\n10 Exhibit 3, item 6.6\n11 Exhibit 3 item 10.3\n\n",

I\u2019ve also reviewed and applied both Chairpers- I\u2019ve also reviewed and applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guidelines on proceedings before the IRB involving Sexual Orientation and Gender-Gu- and Gender Identity and Expression.\nAllegations\n[2] The sp- the specifics of the claim are set out in the narrative of the claimant\u2019s Basis of Claim form. In summary, the claimant fears persecution from unknown individuals, if he were to return to Ecuador because he is gay. I\u2019m not going to repeat in detail all the events that lead to the claimant to flee Ecuador, but I will note that, on [XXX], 2019, the claimant received his first threat on Instagram saying: they will get rid of all the gays in Ecuador. The claimant was visiting Utah at the time. On [XXX], 2019, the claimant received a phone call in Utah on his cell phone saying he\u2019s being watched. On [XXX], 2019, the claimant\u2019s cousin received a call that threatened the claimant. The claimant\u2019s cousin reported this threat to the authorities in Ecuador. On [XXX], 2019, the claimant got an email with the details of his return flight from an email account that roughly translates to: [XXX]. On [XXX], 2019, the claimant returned to Ecuador, after changing his flight from [XXX] due to the threats. On [XXX], 2019, the claimant made a report to the police and the attorney general\u2019s office. On [XXX], 2019, the claimant took a taxi home, after being out with friends and, after getting out of the taxi and walking towards his home, he does not remember anything else from that night. The claimant woke up the next morning and felt a burning sensation on his side, when lifted his shirt, he noticed the word \u201cgay\u201d had been burned into him. The claimant went to file a new complaint with the attorney general\u2019s office, but he was told he should wait for them to call. The claimant shared his story on Facebook and it was picked by the media in Ecuador. On [XXX], 2019, after the claimant\u2019s story was public, he received a call from the attorney general\u2019s office asking for his statement. He was told the process would take two or three weeks, and he should stay home and wait for another call. The claimant decided to move to Quinto, the capital of Ecuador, for his safety. On [XXX] 2019, when in, while in Quinto, the claimant received another threat, and it also stated that they knew his new location; although it did not provide any details. The claimant decided to leave Ecuador on [XXX], 2019. The claimant left, oh sorry, on [XXX] 2019, the claimant left Ecuador and flew to Canada where he applied for refugee protection.\nDetermination\n[3] I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to Section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nAnalysis\nIdentity\n[4] The claimant\u2019s identity as a citizen of Ecuador had been established by his Ecuadorian passport; located at Exhibit 1.\nNexus\n[5] The allegations establish a Nexus to a Convention ground for the claimant, based on his particular social group; namely as his sexual orientation as a gay man.\nCredibility\n[6] I find that the claimant is a credible witness. In making that finding, I\u2019m relying on a, the principle that a claimant who affirms to tell the truth creates a presumption of truthfulness, unless there are reasons to doubt their truthfulness. In this regard, the claimant testified in a consistent and straightforward manner that was consistent with his Basis of Claim form and supporting documents. The claimant was able to speak clearly about his previous relationships, his experience living in Ecuador as a gay man, and the threats he received. And he was also able to answer spe- the specific questions asked. There were no relevant inconsten- inconsistencies in his testimony of contradictions between his testimony and o- the other evidence. I find that the claimant is a credible witness. The claimant also provided documents to support his claim. For example, Exhibit 4 contains photographs showing the injuries the claimant received, copies of the threats he received, copies of the reports he made to authorities in Ecuador, and a news article about when he was assaulted. Exhibit 5 also contains examples of the threats the claimant\u2019s received. I have not reason to doubt the genuineness of these documents and, since they related to the claimant\u2019s sexual orientation and the abuse he received because of it, I find these documents support the claimant\u2019 s allegations and overall claim.\n[7] While the claimant did return to Ecuador after receiving his first threat, the claimant testified he did not appreciate the risk he faced until he was back in Ecuador. I accept the claimant\u2019s reasons for returning to Ecuador and for not making a claim in the United States, and I find that he claimant has a subjective fear of being persecuted if he were to return. As such, I find that the claimant has established, on a balance of probabilities, the fact alleged in his claim, including that the claimant is a gay man.\nObjective Basis\n[8] The objective evidence is mixed when it comes to the country conditions regarding sexual orientation. The US Department of State report, at Item 2.1 in the National Documentation Package located at Exhibit 3, states that, and I quote, \u201cthe constitution includes a principle of non-discrimination and the right to decide one\u2019s sexual orientation as a right. The law also prohibits hate-crimes. Although the law prohibits discrimination based on sexual-orientation; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersect: LGBTI, persons continue to suffer discrimination from both public and private entities, particularly in education, employment, and access to healthcare. LGBTI organizations reported that transgender persons suffered more discriminations because they are more visible.\u201d In addition, the report goes on to state, and I quote, \u201cthe government, lead by the ombudsman\u2019s office, was generally responsible, responsive to concerns raised by the LGBTI community. Never the less, LGBI- LGBTI groups claimed police and prosecutors did not thoroughly investigate deaths of LGBTI individuals; including when there was suspicion that the killing motivated by anti-LGBTI bias.\u201d, end quote. A report at Item 6.1 entitled, and I qu-: Ecuador LGBTI Landscape Analysis of Political, Economic and Social Conditions, indicates that, while Ecuador stands out amongst its neighbors for policies in favor of LGBTI rights, there is, and I quote, \u201ca clear rift between legal rights and the lives of LGBTI people, and the lives LGBTI people truly live\u201d, end quote. And the report goes on to indicate that, while violent crimes are an in, in a din- decline in general in Ecuador, LGBTI individuals face disproportionate levels of violence and abuse in public settings. The claimant also provided news articles to support his claim. Exhibit 4 and Exhibit 6, contain newspaper stories about the claimant\u2019s own assault and the threats he received. The article found at Exhibit 6, contains information about another individual who received similar threats. This individual in an acquaintance of the claimant, and who is now living in Spain due to his fears in Ecuador. Based on the totality of the evidence, I find the claimant has established a well-founded fear of persecution if he were to return to Ecuador, by reason of his sexual orientation.\nState Protection\n[9] With respect to state protection, a State is presumed capable of protecting its citizens and a claimant must establish, on a balance of probabilities, through clear and convincing evidence that a country\u2019s protection is inadequate. Simply asserting a subjective belief that state protection is not an- is not enough to rebut this presumption. The more democratic the State\u2019s insti- institutions, the more a claimant must do to exhaust the options available to him. As discussed below, I find the claimant has rebutted this presumption. While the objective evidence is mixed, it does support the claimant\u2019s fears that there is no operationally effective state protection available to him in his particular circumstance. Report at Item 6.1, states that, and I quote, \u201cin spite of legal advances, activists continue to document discrimination, abuse, and LGBTI activists complain of lack of enforcement are on the rise.\u201d, end quote. That report goes on to state that, and I quote, \u201cEcuador has established many protections for LGBTI people. Whereas the reports on the ground lel- on the ground reveal the Jack of meaningful implementation keeps many members of the LGBTI community from fully accessing these rights\u201d, end quote. Further, as noted above, Item 2.1, indicates that police and prosecutors do not thoroughly investigate violence against LGBTI individuals when it appears it was motivated by a hate-crime. This objective evidence is reflected in the claimant\u2019s own experience. The claimant testified that he made five attempts to receive state protection, including with the police, the attorney general\u2019s office, and the om- ombudsman. The complaints were made both before the attack, which is, which was in response to the threats he received, and after the attack. The claimant testified that, after he was attacked, he reported the attack to the police and the police officer told him that, next time, he should just relax and enjoy it. The claimant testified that he felt more vulnerable after contacting the authorities than he did before. The claimant followed up as recently as one month ago and was told there\u2019s been no progress with his complaints. The claimant has also sought help from LGBTI organizations in Ecuador. I note that the claimant testified that, when he was at an LGBTI organization, he was shown a listing of other victims of violence due to their sexual orientation in Ecuador, and that list was described as being over ten pages long. I find that the claimant has made efforts to obtain protection from authorities in Ecuador and that there is no adequate state protection available to him.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[10] The test for an internal flight alternative is well-established. I must be satisfied that, one, the claimant would not be subject personally a danger of torture, or to a risk of, of life, or a risk cruel and unusual punishment, or face a serious possibility of persecution in the proposed internal flight alternative. And, two, that conditions in that part of the country are such that it would be objectionally reasonable in all of the circumstances, including those particular to the claimant, for him to seek refuge there. For the reasons below, I find the claimant does not have an internal flight alternative, as he would face a serious possibility of persecution anywhere in Ecuador. The issue of whether a city of Cuenca would be a viable alter- internal flight alternative for the claimant, was identified at the start of the hearing. With respect to the risk faced elsewhere in the country, the claimant testified that the first tried to escape harm by moving to Quinto, which is the furthest city in Ecuador from where he was living. The claimant described Quinto as the capital of Ecuador in every sense; including its cultural, liberal and financial capital. With a population of 3 million, the claimant felt he would be safe there. Shortly after arriving in Quinto, the claimant began to receive threats again. While the threats do not specifically identify where he was, they did refer to him changing cities and that they have located him. With respect to Cuenca, specifically the claimant testified that while the crime rate is low, he would be unable to live openly in Cuenca as it is a very religious city and dominated by macho culture. The claimant described how a gay man was recently murdered in Cuenca and his body dumped by the river with a bag over his head. The claimant further testified that he has visited Cuenca before with his partner and he is aware that there is no gay culture there. As an example of the risk faced in Cuenca, the claimant testified that he used a popular at- App for dating gay men in Cuenca, and none of the men displayed photographs of their faces. The objective evidence supports the claimant\u2019s fears. In addition to what has been outlined above, a report at Item 6.3, notes that, and I quote, \u201cin most of Ecuador, there\u2019s a common view that religion must guide to those who are lost or struggling with sinful temptations, and that\u201d, end quote. And that report goes on to state that, and I quote, \u201cthese beliefs are further incentivized religious and political debates that infiltrate families, reinforce the deep-rooted disfavouring of the LGBTQ community in Ecuador\u201d, end quote. The claimant should not be required to hide his sexual orientation to be safe in an internal flight alternative. For the reasons above, I find that the claimant faces a serious possibility of persecution due to his sexual orientation in Cuenca and throughout Ecuador and, as such, there is no internal flight alternative available to him in the country.\nConclusion\n[11] For the foregoing resuns- reasons, I determine that the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to Section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, and the Board therefore accepts the claim.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n",

The claimants are citizens of India and are claiming refugee protection pursuant to Sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. At the outset of the hearing, I confirmed the designation of the principal claimant, Ms. [XXX], as the designated representative for her minor daughter. The associated claimant, Ms. [XXX] son turned 19 on [XXX] the [XXX], 2020 and therefore does not require a designated representative. In considering the claims of the principal claimant and the minor claimant, I have considered and applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 4 on female refugee claimants fleeing gender-based persecution.\n[2] In considering the claim of the associated claimant, I have considered and applied Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9 proceedings involving sexual orientation and gender identity and expression. I also considered Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 3 on procedural and evidentiary issues relating to child refugee claimants when assessing the claim of the minor claimant. Immediately prior to the hearing, counsel applied to admit a report from Dr. [XXX], a Winnipeg based [XXX] who specializes in [XXX], [XXX]. Her report included an apology from the [XXX] for her delay in finalizing the report. I admitted the report into evidence pursuant to Rule 36(4) on the basis of its relevant and probative value in interpreting cultural attitudes towards widows and sexual minorities in India. At the outset of the hearing, the principal claimant-, no pardon me-, at the outset of the hearing, the associated claimant and the minor claimant waived their right to be present throughout the entire hearing and were excused from the hearing room during the testimony of the principal claimant.\n[3] This was done so that the adult femal-, female claimant could testify more freely about her experiences after the death of her husband. Similarly, when the associated claimant was ready to testify, the adult female claimant and the minor claimant left the room so he could speak more freely. The claimants had an observer in the hearing, he left at a sens-, sensitive point in the adult femal-, female claimant\u2019s testimony and remained outside the room for the rest of the hearing.\nAllegations\n[4] The claimants\u2019 allegations are set out in the Basis of Claim forms. In essence, Ms. [XXX], the adult female claimant fears that she will continue to be assaulted and threatened by people on the basis that she\u2019s spurned the advances of a [XXX]-, [XXX]. Mr. [XXX] also wants the land that the adult female claimant and her son inherited from her husband after his death. She also fears that her status as a wis-, widow leaves her vulnerable to being ostracized, demeaned and sexually assaulted should she attempt to relocate within India. The associated claimant fears persecution or harm in India on the basis of his sexual orientation. The minor claimant fears that as a teenage girl without a father or other male relative in India to protect her, she is vulnerable to sexual violence as well as other forms of violence.\nDetermination\n[5] I find that the adult female claimant is a Convention refugee on the basis of her gender and her status as a window-, widow. I find that the associated claimant is a Convention refugee on the basis of his membership in a particular social group, namely young gay men in India. I find that the minor claimant is a Convention refugee on the basis of her membership in a particular social group, namely girls without fathers or other adult male protection.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[6] The identity of the three claimants as nationals of India has been established by the testimony of the adult female claimant and by the claimants\u2019 passports, certified true copies of which are on file.\nCredibility\n[7] The adult female claimant and the associated claimant both testified at the hearing. I found them to be credible witnesses. The adult female claimant was somewhat hesitant in her testimony, a fact which I attribute to shyness and cultural factors. She was emotional when speaking about the death of her husband and about the distress and shame she felt at different incidents in the intervening years. The associated claimant was also credible. He spoke freely and openly and with passion about his sexual identity. He described his long awareness of being different, the taunts and bullying to which he was subjected in India, his initial loneliness in Canada and the warmth he feels at having felt-, found an LGBTQ community into which he has been accepted. There were no material inconsistencies in the testimony of the claimants or contradictions between their testimony and the other evidence before me.\n[8] The claimants filed a number of documents to corroborate their claims. These include a sworn statement from the adult female claimant\u2019s parents-in-law who attest that their son was fatally injured by [XXX]. The deponents say that they had accompanied the adult female claimant to the police to file a complaint with the attack on the son but the police refused to investigate. The deponents attribute this fact to [XXX] connections and wealth. They also confirm that after their son\u2019s death, [XXX] and his cohort continued to target the adult female claimant knowing that they could do so with impunity. That after [XXX] months of threats and harassments, the adult female claimant moved to her parent\u2019s home with her children but she was targeted there as well.\n[9] The adult female claimant\u2019s parents also filed a sworn statement which contains similar information to that provided by her parents-in-law. They say that [XXX] and his cohort came to their home in [XXX], [XXX]\u00ad [XXX], to threaten, harass and assault the adult female claimant. As a result, the parents kept their door locked at all times and their daughter lived, \u201clike a prisoner\u201d in their home. Other documents include a brief medical letter which confirms a scar on the adult female claimant\u2019s leg and the First Information Report relating to an-, at-, an attack on the three claimants in 2017. Finally, the claimants filed a letter from [XXX] in Winnipeg, an organization which describes itself as a support service for two spirit LGBTQ people who are arriving from around the world. The letter confirms that the associated claimant has attended the drop-in program at [XXX] and is in daily contact with the author of the letter. I note that the claimants\u2019 accounts are generally consistent with the IRB\u2019s National Documentation Package on India which will be addressed in greater detail below. Having found the claimants to be credible witnesses and having regard to the corroborative evidence before me, I accept the allegations as set out in their BOCs.\nNexus\n[10] In order to find that the claimants are Convention refugees, I must be satisfied that they have established a well-founded fear of persecution because of their race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion. In Ms-, in the present case, Ms.-, the adult female claimant\u2019s fears relate at least in part to her refusal to marry [XXX], her husband\u2019s murderer. As such, I find that she has established a connection to a particular social group namely her gender and her status as a widow. I find that the associated claimant\u2019s claim has a Nexus to the Convention ground of particular social group, namely gay men and I find that the minor claimant\u2019s claim has a Nexus to the Convention ground in particular social group namely girls under the age of majority who Jack adult male protection.\n[11] I will turn first to the adult female claimant\u2019 s claim. I find on a balance of probability that she would be-, that she faces a serious risk of persecution should she return to India. My reasons are as follows. She\u2019s a 41-year-old woman who was born in the Punjab region of India. She has some high school education but has never worked outside the home. When she was 21, she married [XXX]. [XXX] and his father owned a small farm on which they grew wheat, rice and other crops. In keeping with tradition, the adult female claimant moved into the home that [XXX] shared with his parents. In a village about 30 minutes away from Ms. [XXX]-, the adult female claimant\u2019s home village of [XXX], [XXX]. In 20-, 2006, [XXX] was beaten to death by his cousins [XXX] and his brother.\n[12] [XXX] grievance with [XXX] was two-fold. First, he wanted to marry the adult female claimant himself. He had asked her to leave [XXX] and to marry him but she had refused. Secondly, he wanted [XXX] farm for himself. After her husband passed away, the adult female claimant went to the police to file a report but the police refused to take action. The adult female claimant attributes this to the fact that [XXX] is wealthy, is politically well connected and likely bribed the police. At the time of [XXX] death, the farm was in the name of his father. [XXX] father told the adult female claimant that he was worried that if something happened to him, someone else would seize the land. As I understand it, [XXX] father prepared a document which transfers ownership of the land to the adult female claimant and the associated claimant but has a continued right to occupy and use the land during his lifetime.\n[13] After her husband\u2019s death, the adult female claimant continued to live with [XXX] parents. She says that she was repeatedly threatened and harassed by [XXX] and his supporters who believed that they had successfully got away with murder and could continue their pursuit of the adult female claimant as well as the land that they believed she now owned. After two months of threats and harassment, the adult female claim-, claimant moved from her in-law\u2019s home to that of her parents in the hope of eluding [XXX] and his associates. The adult female claimant says that she rarely left the home. A fact which was re-iterated in the statements filed by her parents and her parents-in-law. She says that she endured several sexual assaults. She also says that she and her children were beaten in 2001 and 2017 by men who demanded that she comply with [XXX] demands. On each occasion, she filed a police report but the police refused to-, to take action.\n[14] Although the adult female claimant\u2019s-, I\u2019m sorry scratch that. During his testimony, the associated claimant said that he wanted to share an incident that he believed his mother would not have volunteered. He said that approximately 5 years ago, he went to a playground. His mother was alone in the house. When he returned, two men wearing turbans and having shawls over their faces were leaving the house. He found his mother in her room crying. He said her hair was messed up and her clothing was tom. When she-, he asked what had happened, she begged him to leave her alone. They have not spoken about this incident. He believes that something bad happened to her but that her sense of shame prevented her from talking about it with others or indeed from sharing it with me.\n[15] I find on a balance of probabilities that [XXX] and his cohort will continue to target Ms. [XXX] as retribution for his-, her spurning his offer of marriage and in his quest for ownership of the land. I find that Ms. [XXX] is not in a position to sell the land given that the legal documents which may have transferred title to her, stipulate that the original owners, her parents-in-law have the right to use and to live on the farm until they die. As such, it is not a simple matter of the adult female claimant simply surrendering or relinquishing the land.\nState Protection\n[16] The question then becomes whether the adult female claimant can obtain protection from Indian authorities against the threats and assaults by [XXX]. I find she cannot. She has sought state protection with the help of her parents-in-law and her own parents on numerous occasions. On each occasion, the police failed to take action. The US Department of State report for 2018 found that the Immigration and Refugee Board National Documentation Package Tab 2.1 confirms that police in India are understaffed, under-resourced, undertrained and overburdened. Police failed to respond effectively, particularly when it comes to crimes against women. The Bertelsman Stiftung Index on political transformation at Tab 4.9 of the NDP reports that in general, underprivileged groups are particularly affected by the limited enforcement of protection laws and by the extremely slow progre-, process of the judicial system.\n[17] De facto, disadvantaged social groups do not enjoy equal access to justice. That same report goes on to say that violence and discrimination against women remain significant issues meaning that they are one of the disadvantaged groups who do not have meaningful access to justice. Dr. [XXX], who\u2019s report I referred to above states that it is particularly difficult for widows to obtain state protection. She cites a prominent human rights lawyer in Delhi as saying, \u201cIf you are a woman in distress, the last thing you want to do is go to the police.\u201d She quotes another victim as saying-, she quotes a victim as saying, \u201cIf you have money or connections, you can get justice, if you don\u2019t, forget it.\u201d\nInternal Flight Alternative for the Adult Female Claimant\n[18] The next question is whether the adult female claimant might get away from the problems she has experienced by moving to another part of India. This is known as internal flight alternative or IFA. The IFA test is two prongs. For the first, I must be satisfied that there\u2019s no serious possibility of persecution in the proposed IFA. The second prong requires that I consider whether it is objectively unreasonable for the claimant to seek refuge in the proposed IFA. In the current case, I find that [XXX] and his cohort are unlikely to find the adult female claimant in the proposed IFA. I should note that I had proposed New Delhi as a potential internal flight alternative. However, I find it is objectively unreasonable to expect the adult female claimant to relocate to New Delhi or indeed anywhere else in India due to the stigmatization and marginalization that she would face as a widow with limited education and no work experience.\n[19] The National Documentation Package says that-, reveals that women in India are exposed to a continum-, continuum of violence throughout their life cycle as some observers have put it from the womb to the tomb. Within a culture of patriarchy, discrimination and violence against women, women who attempt to set up independent households fare particularly poorly. The IRB\u2019s response to information request at Tab 5.1 states that single women, a category that embraces widows as well as divorced women and women who have never married have to depend on someone\u2019s good will, whether it be that of their in-laws, their parents, their brothers and sisters-in-law to provide for them and that they encounter serious struggles with basic life issues. The RIR states that nobody wants to rent to single woman-, women because a woman is expected to live with her father or her spouse. There are an estimated 10 to 15 thousand homeless women in Delhi. Home Jess woman are subject-, subject to constant violence, sexual assaults and murder from passers by and even from police and they Jack access to essential public services.\n[20] Delhi is increasingly perceived as being the most unsafe city in India for women. Nearly 73% of women in Delhi say they do not feel safe in their own se-, surroundings and report to feeling unsafe all of the time and for this, I refer to the IRB report at Tab 5.2 of the NDP. Now, I recognize some of the factors that would make it-, that I have referred to may not apply to an affluent, educated or cosmopolitan woman from a major urban center but this is not the adult female claimant\u2019 s situation. She is marginally educated. Comes from a farming background and has never held a paying job. Moreover, she does not have those relatives with whom she can live outside her home region. Based on the evidence before me, I find on a balance of probabilities that the conditions the adult female claimant would face should she attempt to relocate to New Delhi could jeopardize her life and her safety. I therefore find that she does not have a viable internal flight alternative within India.\n[21] I now turn to the claim of the associated claimant. I find that he has established a well-founded fear of persecution for reason of his sexual orientation. He testified that he realized he was gay from an early age. He began to apply makeup when he was 5 or 6 and would talk to girls about his dreams of marrying a boy. He says he was taunted and bullied by boys in the school who attacked him in the washroom and in the playground. He says that his mother asked him if he was gay while they were still in India. He says he initially denied this but then admitted it. He said she broke down upon hearing this. She said they were already vulnerable because of her status as a widow and she asked him not to tell him anyone about his sexuality. The adult female claimant had previously testified that she realized that her son was gay in 2015. She feared for her son \u2018s safety because India is not safe for gay people. She says it has-, has a been a huge relief for both her son and for herself that he can finally be open about his sexuality without fear of harm.\n[22] Even in the safety of Canada, she has not told her sister with whom she lives about her son\u2019s sexuality. When asked why she-, is so concerned, she says that she believes that Punjabi society will blame her for her son\u2019s sexuality because she had to raise him alone as a single parent after her husband was murdered. The associated claimant says that he follows news about treatment of members of the LGBTQ community in India. He says that the laws may have changed, same-sex relationships are no longer criminalized under the law but that societal attitudes have yet to shift. The NDP confirms that there are changes relating to the situation in-, of sexual minorities in India. In September 2018, in the decision of Johar, J-O-H-A-R, the Indian Supreme Court declared that the provisions of the crim-, penal code which criminalized consensual same-sex relations were unconstitutional. The decision was ground breaking. The question however, is whether it is resulted in changes on the streets which are meaningful, effective and enduring.\n[23] The decision will undoubtedly change the shape of India in the years to come but the question is not whether the associated claimant may be able to live there safely in 5 or 10-years time but whether he can express himself fully now and avail himself of meaningful protection. The US Department of State report at Item 2.1 of the NDP says that people in the LGBTI community-, LGBTQ community continue to face physical attacks, rape and blackmail. The UK Home Office report on sexual minorities in India which was released in October 2018 and can be found at Tab 6.4 of the NDP reports that many religious organizations including Hindu, Christian and Muslim groups are up in arms about the Johar decision. An IRB Response to Information Request on the treatment of sexual minorities found at Tab 6.1 of the NDP quotes the ILGA for the proposition that Indian courts have taken positive steps to protect gay and lesbian couples. Overall, however, the ILGA says there is no protection for sexual minorities in India, either in the constitution in terms of broad protection or in employment or against hate crimes or incitement.\n[24] Dr. [XXX] also provides interesting incites. She quotes a student activist as saying that the ideology of marrying a woman havening-, having children is deeply rooted in Indian society and that this attitude places LGBTQ persons on the periphery of a society that enforces social rules with threats and violence. She notes that law enforcement only rarely prosecuted gay men when Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code was still enforced. That is because most enforcement was provided by societal policing. She notes the International Commission of Jurists findings about violence and discrimination against sexual minorities and states that the associated claimant could be subject to anti-gay honor abuse in India. In this she is referring to recent-, research that says that in collectivist societies such as India where homosexuality is considered dishonorable, homosexuals are at great risk of violence and death. In sum, I find the law has changed but is not yet sufficiently entrenched that a young man can assert his identity freely and openly without a risk of occurring hate crimes. As such, I find the associated claimant has established a well-founded fear of persecution on the basis of his identity as a gay man.\nState Protection and Internal Flight Alternative for the Associated Claimant\n[25] I find that the associated claimant has rebutted the presumption of adequate state protection in India. The res-, IRB Response to Information Request quotes the International Commission of Jurists for the proposition that the attitude and behaviour of the police is one of the biggest barriers to queer persons access to the justice system in India. In several cases, the police refused to file complaints submitted by queer persons owing to bias or stereotypes. Several people have spoken about violence, abuse and harassment that they suffered at the hands of the police. So queer people\u2019s trust in the police is further eroded by the frequency of their negative interactions with the police, reducing the likelihood that they will seek protection. I further find that the associated claimant cannot avail himself of an internal flight alternative in India because the social distrust and loathing of gays extends across the country. The evidence indicates that LGBTQ communities are developing and they\u2019re growing bolder in some cities, however, these communities are relatively small. I find that in all the circumstances, it would be objectively unreasonable to expect a person as young and vulnerable as the associated claimant to relocate to New Delhi or elsewhere in India.\n[26] Finally, I turn to the claim of the minor claimant. She is a 16-year-old girl. She no longer has a father. She says that she was attacked by [XXX] children throughout her schooling and by his goons in the market place in 2011 and again in 2017 shortly before her flight from India. The country reports in the National Documentation Package lead me to conclude that the minor claimant, a girl without a father or other close male relative in India to assist and protect her, faces a serious possibility of sexual violence. And for here, for this proposition, I turn to the UK Home Office report found at Tab 5.9 of the NDP which says that discrimination against women remains a major issue in India. Especially in the still extremely patriarchal north, women tend to be discriminated against from the outset in their families. With poor families, this means worse access to food and sanitation. Some substantial progress has been made as far as access to education is concerned but India\u2019s female labor force participation rate has steadily declined. The report continues that central to the problem of gender-based violence is that Indian men and women have been socialized to believe that men\u2019s dominance over women is normal and acts of women-, violence against women are justified.\n[27] The UK Home Office refers to findings of the UN Human Rights Committee Special Rapporteur that says that sexual violence including rape is widespread across the country and perpetuated-, perpetrated in public and private spheres. There is a general sense of insecurity for women in public spaces especially in urban settings. Women are easy targets of attack including sexual violence whether it yu-, involves using public transportation or sanitation facilities or on the way to collect wood or water. The report continues that many victims of sexual violence carry a deep sense of shame which is further exacerbated by the stigma and exclusion-, exclusion they experience, especially from family members and the community. The Home Office report also refers to the UN Special Rapporteur\u2019s Observation that economic develop in India has bypassed women who continue to struggle at subsistence levels and this too increases their marginalization.\n[28] I have already addressed the reasons that I find that the adult female claimant cannot avail herself of an internal flight alternative in India and I find that the same reasons apply to the situation of the minor claimant. I find therefore that the minor claimant is unlikely to receive adequate state protection from the police and that the risk of sexual violence extends across the country. This forecloses the possibility of an internal flight alternative.\nCONCLUSION\n[29] Based on the above analysis, I conclude that [XXX], the adult female claimant is a Convention refugee. I find that [XXX] is a Convention refugee based on his identity as a gay man. I find that [XXX] is a Convention refugee based on her membership in a particular social group namely, girls without fathers or other adult male protection. I accept your claims.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n",

They testified in straightforward and forthcoming manner and there were no relevant inconsistencies in their testimony or contradictions between their testimony and the other evidence before the panel.\n[8] The panel accepts the following on a balance of probabilities:\nThe claimants opened a store in Guadalajara at the end of [XXX] of 2017 and members of the CJNG demanded the claimants pay them [XXX] Mexican pesos for the CJNG to provide protection to the store over the Christmas season. When the claimants did not pay this fee, [XXX] days later, the amount was increased to [XXX] Mexican pesos and the CJNG members threated the Associate Claimant telling her they knew about her daily activities and where the claimants lived.\nOn [XXX], 2017 three CJNG members came to the claimants\u2019 store. Two of the men attacked the Principal Claimant and the other man stole merchandise from the store. The claimants went to the prosecutor\u2019 s office to make a complaint but was told nothing could be done.\nThe claimants spent Christmas at the Principal Claimant\u2019s family\u2019s home in [XXX], Michoacan and when they returned home on [XXX], 2017, their home had been broken into but nothing had been stolen.\nOn [XXX] 2018 the members of the CJNG came to the claimants\u2019 store, beat up the Associate Claimant and locked her in the bathroom while they robbed her store. The CJNG members told the Associate Claimant they now want [XXX] Mexican pesos and they would continue to steal merchandise until the claimants paid this amount. The CJNG members also told the Associate Claimant that if they ever made a complaint to the police again they would kill the claimants and their family. The CJNG members stole merchandise and the money from the cash register before they left.\nThe CJNG members continued to visit the claimants store throughout much of 2018. In [XXX] of 2018 the CJNG members came to the claimants\u2019 store and threatened to kill the claimants and told them that this is no longer about the money but about the claimants having challenged the CJNG by not paying the money requested.\nOn [XXX], 2018 the Principal Claimant was dragged out of his car and badly beaten by members of the CJNG. The CJNG members told the Principal Claimant they were going to kill him and stole all of the Christmas presents that were in his car.\nIn [XXX] of 2019 members of the CJNG ransacked the claimants\u2019 store and the claimants ultimately arranged to sell the business and merchandise that was left.\nIn [XXX] of 2019 the claimants visited the Principal Claimant\u2019 s family in Michoacan and on [XXX], 2019 the Principal Claimant received text messages from members of the CJNG asking him if he thought this would end just because they went to Michocan. The Principal Claimant\u2019s mother purchased the family plane tickets to travel to Canada on [XXX] 2019 to disappear for a while.\nOn [XXX], 2019 the Associate Claimant\u2019s mother told them not to come back to Mexico as members of the CJNG had been to their place looking for them and told her they would be paying attention and were not finished. Members of the CJNG visited the home of the Associate Claimant\u2019s mother again in [XXX] of 2019 looking for the claimants.\nSince coming to Canada, the Associate Claimant has started receiving text messages from members of the CJNG threatening death to the claimants and including pictures of dead and tortured bodies. These threats have continued as to as recently as a month prior to the hearing of this matter.\n[9] The panel finds that the claimants\u2019 have established a subjective fear of harm by the CJNG in Mexico.\n[10] The objective evidence of country condition in the National Documentation Package (NDP) for Mexico supports the claimants\u2019 allegations. In 2015 the Mexican government declared the CJNG one of the most dangerous cartels in the country and one of two with the most extensive reach. In October of 2016 the US Department of Treasury names the CJNG as one of the world\u2019s most prolific and violent drug trafficking organizations. The CJNG\u2019s reputation for extreme and showy violence continues in 2019, including 19 bodies found on display m Michoacan, some of which were dismembered and others that were hung from overpasses.3\n[11] The panel therefore finds that the claimants have established that they would each face a personalized risk to their life or of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment that is not faced generally by others in their country.\nState Protection\n[12] Except in situations where the state is in complete breakdown, states must be presumed capable of protecting their citizens. To rebut this presumption, the onus is on the claimant to establish on a balance of probabilities through clear and convincing evidence that their state\u2019s protection is inadequate.\n[13] The claimants indicated that they did approach the police for assistance but were not provided with any assistance or protection.\n[14] Overall, the evidence regarding state protection in Mexico is mixed:\nAccording to item 7.18 of the NDP, in addition to federal police, Mexico had 382,277 police personnel as of 2015, as well as additional soldiers engaged in law enforcement activities4. According to item 9.11 of the NDP, these officers are arresting individuals who commit crimes and such individuals are being successfully prosecuted by the court system; there are presently more than 229,915 prison inmates in Mexico, with about 60% having been convicted of a crime, and the rest in pre-trial detention pending a trial or sentence.5\nThe US DOS\u2019 report at Item 2.1 of the NDP explains that \u201corganized criminal groups were implicated in numerous killings, acting with impunity and at times in league with corrupt federal, state, local, and security officials.\u201d6\nThe Victimology of Extortion report from Rice University found at item 7.16 of the National Documentation Package indicates that various levels of government in Mexico are \u201cincapable or unwilling to protect its citizens and often collaborate with the organized crime groups to further their criminal endeavors\u201d. The report describes the Mexican government as being \u201cwillfully blind and permissive of criminal activity\u201d and reiterates that in many cases the state has become a \u201cpartner in crime\u201d with several criminal organizations or cartels.7\nAn August 2019 Response to Information Request found at item 7.15 of the NDP indicates making a complaint to a state authority against a gang \u201cwould lead to pressure to drop the complaint and \u2018almost certainly\u2019 lead to death if the individual did not comply.\u201d8\n[15] Upon consideration of the evidence as a whole, the panel finds that the presumption of state protection has been rebutted. Certainly, the state is not entirely ineffective and is able to provide some protection to some of its citizens. However, given the claimants\u2019 own experiences and the country condition evidence before it, the panel finds that the state is either unable or unwilling to provide adequate protection to the claimants.\nIFA\n[16] In Rasaratnam v. Canada,9 the Federal Court of Appeal held that, with respect to the burden of proof, once the issue of an internal flight alternative (IFA) was raised, the onus is on the claimant to show that she does not have an IFA. To find a viable IFA, the panel must be satisfied that (1) there is no serious possibility of the claimant being persecuted or, on the balance of probabilities, a danger of torture or subjected to a risk to life or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in the proposed IFA and (2) that the conditions in that part of the country are such that it would be reasonable in all the circumstances, including those particular to the claimant, to seek refuge there.\n[17] The first question is whether the claimants would be safe in proposed IFA. At the outset of the hearing the panel identified that IFA was in issue and proposed the IFA locations of Campeche City and M\u00e9rida.\n[18] When the claimants were asked if they could live in either of the proposed IFA locations they said they do not believe they can be safe anywhere in Mexico as the entire country is controlled by cartels. When asked specifically about whether members of the CJNG could find them in Campeche City or M\u00e9rida the Principal Claimant said the CJNG can find anyone within the republic of Mexico and that the cartel may track them through their relatives. When asked about how the CJNG would be able to find them in the IFA locations, the Principal Claimant said that that the CJNG was able to find them in Michoacan and even in Canada. When asked for details regarding the motivation of the CJNG to find them, the claimants both said that this is no longer just about money and that the CJNG believes that the claimants have mocked them and made a fool of them by not paying them the money they demanded and being able to escape without being harmed.\n[19] The panel finds that the claimants have provided sufficient evidence to establish that the agents of harm in their case would have the means and motivation to find them in Campeche City or M\u00e9rida. In coming to a decision, the panel has considered the CJNG\u2019s size, its area of operation, and its level of interest in the claimants.\n[20] The CJNG is not present in Campeche City or M\u00e9rida, as indicated in the 2019 Stratfor Global Intelligence map in the NDP,10 however the NDP describes that a group such as the CJNG could leverage corrupt officials in another location or utilize \u201cstrategic alliances\u201d with other groups to locate someone if sufficient interest exists.11 According to the NDP, it is possible for cartels to track people outside of their areas of operation; the common motivation to do so being something the magnitude of \u201ca large debt or a personal vendetta\u201d.12\n[21] Campeche City and M\u00e9rida are both over [XXX] km and about a [XXX]-hour drive from where the claimants lived in Guadalajara. However, the agents of harm have shown they were able to track the claimants to the home of the Principal Claimant\u2019s mother in Michoacan, and have even managed to locate them in Canada to continue the threats. The panel finds that the CJNG\u2019s persistent interest in the claimants, including the very recent threats received in Canada, support an ongoing vendetta by the CJNG that would reach the magnitude necessary for the CJNG to have sufficient interest in using their ability to track the claimants outside of their area of operation.\n[22] On the evidence before it, the panel finds on a balance of probabilities the claimants are at risk to life or cruel and unusual punishment throughout Mexico and that the claimants therefore have no viable IFA.\nCONCLUSION\n[23] The panel finds that the claimants have satisfied the burden of establishing on a balance of probabilities, they would personally be subjected to a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or a danger of torture upon return to their country. The panel therefore accepts their claims.\n(signed) Jacqueline Gallant\nFebruary 11, 2020\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n2 Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (IRB) Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 4: Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution, November 13, 1996.\n3 Exhibit 3; National Documentation Package, Mexico, 30 August 2019; Item 7.2: Mexico: Organized Crime and\nDrug Trafficking Organizations, United States Congressional Research Service, 15 August 2019.\n4 Exhibit 3; National Documentation Package, Mexico, 30 August 2019; Item 7.18: Criminality, including organized crime; state response, including effectiveness; protection available to victims, including witness protection (2015 \u2013 July 2017), Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada, 21 August 2017.

The minor claimant claims to be a citizen of Colombia and the United States of America, the second associate claimant a citizen of Venezuela and Colombia, the associate claimant a citizen of Venezuela, and the principal claimant a citizen of Colombia. All claimants are claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).1\n[2] The tribunal designated [XXX] as representative for the minor children included in the claim, being [XXX].\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] The totality of the claim is contained the claimants\u2019 Basis of Claim forms and corresponding narratives.2\n[4] The risk to the claimants began in 2014. After living temporarily in the United States, the family moved to Colombia in 2012. In 2014, when political tensions in Venezuela were rising, the associate claimant traveled to her home country for three months to engage in political activism against the Maduro regime on behalf of the VOLUNTAD POPULAR political party. While in Venezuela she engaged in street protests and served as organizer for her political party in her local municipality of Lagunillas. She was involved in numerous efforts to encourage people to vote and to protest against the Maduro regime. After three months of these political activities, she was beaten by state agents and was visited at her home by state agents, which caused her to return to Colombia to live with her family. Because the agent of harm in this case was the Maduro regime, and because the agent of harm was motivated by the associate claimant\u2019s political activity, the associate claimant sought to leave Venezuela.\n[5] Approximately four years passed, and the associate claimant continued her support to her political party remotely from Colombia. In [XXX] 2018, the principal claimant began to receive a series of approximately fifteen threat-related phone calls from the EJ\u00c9RCITO DE LIBERACI\u00d4N NACIONAL (ELN), which has close operational ties with the Maduro regime in Venezuela. The principal claimant received the calls from the ELN between [XXX] 2018 and the family\u2019s departure to Canada on [XXX], 2018. At first the ELN appeared motivated by extortion, demanding payment, but as it became clear that the principal claimant did not have much money to extort, the nature of their threats shifted towards issuing death threats against the entire family for the associate claimant\u2019s political activism against their ally, the Maduro regime.\n[6] Because the associate claimant is a political opponent of both the Maduro regime in Venezuela and its operational proxies in Colombia, the ELN, the associate claimant fears she will be harmed anywhere she resides in either country. Although the principal claimant and second associate claimant are not themselves political activists, they fully support the political activities of the associate claimant. Because of their familial association with the associate claimant, and their support of her political activism, the other claimants claim they would be regarded by the ELN or the Maduro regime as having the same political opinions as the associate claimant.\n[7] With respect to the minor claimant, no claim against the United States of America is being made.\nDECISION\n[8] I find that, with the exception of the minor claimant, all claimants are refugees, pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA, as there exists a serious possibility of persecution, should they return to Colombia or Venezuela, on account of their political opinion or imputed political opinion.\n[9] The minor claimant has not advanced any claim against the United States of America and has not presented any evidence about the risks he may face in the United States of America. Therefore, I cannot find that he faces a serious possibility of persecution, or on a balance of probabilities, a risk of s. 97 harm in the United States of America. Accordingly, his claims for protection are rejected.\nNature of the harm\n[10] I have examined this claim under section 96 of the IRPA, as I conclude that the risk the claimants \u2013 apart from the minor claimant \u2013 described constitutes persecution based on at least one of the grounds prescribed in section 96, specifically their political opinion or their imputed political opinion.\nIdentity\n[11] I find that the principal claimant\u2019s, the second associate claimant\u2019s, and the minor claimant\u2019s identities as nationals of Colombia, and the associate claimant\u2019 s and the second associate claimant\u2019s identities nationals of Venezuela, and the minor claimant\u2019s identity as a national of the United States of America is established by the documents provided, namely their passports.3\nCredibility\n[12] When a claimant swears to the truth of certain allegations, this creates a presumption that those allegations are true unless there be reason to doubt their truthfulness.4 However this presumption does not apply to inferences (conclusions drawn from facts) or speculation (for which there is no evidentiary basis).\n[13] There is no evidence before me to rebut this presumption.\n[14] I find that the associate claimant\u2019s profile as a dissident against the Maduro regime to be credible in light her testimony and the documentary evidence before me, namely an official letter and registration card certifying her membership and participation in the VOLUNTAD POPULAR political party.5\n[15] By establishing this credible profile with her testimony and documentary evidence, the profile of the principal and second associate claimant are likewise supported along with their own credible testimony. Through credible testimony from the principal claimant and the second associate claimant to the effect that they fully support the associate claimant in her political activism, I find that these claimants have credibly established their profile as persons who would be perceived as having imputed political opinions similar to the associate claimant.\nObjective basis\n[16] Given that there are no serious credibility issues with respect to the allegations, coupled with the documentary evidence set out below, I find that, with the exception of the minor claimant, the claimants have established a prospective risk of being subjected to the following harm: namely that they would face judicial or extra-judicial violence on the part of the Maduro regime or its proxies within Venezuela or violence on the part of the ELN in Colombia. As highlighted in the documentary evidence, this extra-judicial violence amounts to persecution.\n[17] This risk is corroborated by the following documents in the National Documentation Package (NDP).6\nAre opponents of the Madura regime persecuted in Venezuela?\n[18] While the documentary evidence specifically focused on the VOLUNTAD POPULAR in the NDP is dated to 2014, it nevertheless establishes on a balance of probabilities that the VOLUNTAD POPULAR is viewed by the Maduro regime as its opponent and that even as early as 2014 they received persecutory treatment by the Maduro regime in the form of extra-judicial raids, arbitrary detention, political manipulation of the judicial system, and other forms of political intimation.7 The state of political conflict has significantly intensified since 2014 when that document was published, and even more so since 2018 and 2019 when the Maduro regime came into intensified conflict with the competing regime of Juan Guaido, president of the National Assembly. In this heightened environment of conflict, opponents of the regime and those perceived to be opponents of the regime are subjected to \u201cunlawful or arbitrary killings, including extrajudicial killings by security forces of the [\u2026 ] Maduro regime, including colectivos (regime-sponsored armed groups); forced disappearances; torture by security forces; arbitrary detention by security forces; harsh and life-threatening prison conditions; political prisoners; unlawful interference with privacy; and lack of judicial independence.\u201d8 US State Department reporting notes that in the current climate, the Maduro regime uses the \u201cjudiciary to intimidate and prosecute individuals critical of regime policies or actions.\u201d9\n[19] The US State Department also notes that in \u201cmany cases, particularly regarding the political opposition, regime-aligned authorities searched homes without judicial or other appropriate authorization, seized property without due process, or interfered in personal communications. FAES and other security forces regularly conducted indiscriminate household raids. Media reports documented raids by security forces on the homes of at least 10 opposition party politicians during the year.\u201d10\n[20] These actions extend also to perceived opponents: \u201c[r]egime-aligned intelligence agencies, which lacked independent oversight, conducted surveillance for political purposes. Courts relied on evidence obtained from anonymous patriotas cooperantes (cooperating patriots) to harass perceived opponents [emphasis added] of the[\u2026] regime, and senior[\u2026 ] Maduro regime-aligned officials used personal information gathered by patriotas cooperantes to intimidate regime critics and human rights defenders.\u201d11\nDoes the ELN act as a proxy of the Madura regime in Colombia?\n[21] Recent country countries reported in Exhibit 6 demonstrate a clear operational connection between the Maduro regime and the ELN. On July 5, 2019, the Washington Post reported that some analysts are now describing the ELN as a \u201cColombo-Venezuelan rebel army\u201d given the strong operational links between the two. Reuters, citing Colombian military intelligence sources, reported June 5, 2019 that 45% of the ELN\u2019s fighters \u2013 including its commanders \u2013 are hiding in neighboring Venezuela and receiving protection from the Maduro regime. On September 12, 2019, the Washington Post reported on Venezuelan intelligence leaks to a Colombia newspaper Semana that describe \u201cVenezuela\u2019 s relationship to Colombian \u201cred groups\u201d [like the ELN] as something close to Iran\u2019s relationship with Hezbollah.\u201d The reporting states that \u201cThe documents leaked to Semana imply Venezuela is mainstreaming ELN and the resurgent FARC into its intelligence systems, relying on the groups to help identify high-value military targets inside Colombia.\u201d Recent reporting in January 2020 from InSight Crime highlights that while the Maduro regime does not officially recognize the ELN as a formal ally, the two entities share a significant covert operational relationship.12\n[22] Given this considerations, I find that there is sufficient country condition reporting to conclude that, on a balance of probabilities, the ELN is sufficiently operationally enmeshed with the Maduro regime that an intelligence-sharing relationship exists such that the disclosure of the associate and principal claimant\u2019s identities and activities to the ELN could be facilitated. In this sense, the claimants\u2019 allegation of fear regarding the ELN targeting the family in Colombia because of the associate claimant\u2019s activities and political profile in Venezuela is well-founded in objective country conditions.\n[23] Considering the totality of the allegations and the country conditions of both Venezuela and Colombia, I find that there is an objective basis for the allegations the associate claimant faces persecution in both countries for her political activities and associations in Venezuela. I find further that the principal claimant and the second associate claimant, because of their relationship to the associate claimant, would face a serious possibility of persecution in both countries because of imputed political opinions; they would be perceived by the Maduro regime or the ELN as liable for the same political offences as the associate claimant and thus face a serious possibility of persecution.\nState protection\n[24] Whereas \u2013 insofar as Venezuela is concerned \u2013 the agent of persecution is the state, I find that adequate state protection would not be reasonably forthcoming in this particular case.\n[25] Insofar as Colombia is concerned, and the ELN is the agent of persecution, I find that as per reporting in NDP 7.23, the ELN has the capacity to monitor targets across Colombia.13 That the ELN has the capacity to conduct surveillance operations across Colombia leads me to find that there is a serious possibility they could mount kinetic operations if sufficiently motivated. The same reporting notes that state protection against this threat actor is \u201cvery limited\u201d and the \u201cmeasures in place do not yet meet the needs on the ground and are not adapted to living conditions in the areas where most violence has been reported.\u201d14 As such, I find that adequate state protection in Columbia would likewise not be reasonably forthcoming.\nInternal flight alternative\n[26] I have considered whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for the claimants.\n[27] With respect to Venezuela, on the evidence before me and given that the agent of persecution is the state, and the state has effective control over the entire country, I find that there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout Venezuela.\n[28] With respect to Colombia, given the above considerations regarding the capacity of the ELN to monitor its targets anywhere in Colombia, I find that there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout Colombia.\nCONCLUSION\n[29] In light of the preceding, I conclude that the principal claimant, the associate claimant, and the second associate claimants are refugees, pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA. Accordingly, I accept their claims.\n[30] The minor claimant did not establish that he faces a serious possibility of persecution, or that, on a balance of probabilities, he faces s. 97 harm in the United States. His claims are rejected on that basis.\n(signed) Bjorn Einarson\nOctober 23, 2020\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n2 Exhibit 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4.\n3 Exhibit 1.\n4 Maldonado v.

Bebbington\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Hannah Lindy\nCountry: Mexico\nRPD Number: TB9-14699\nAssociated RPD Number(s): TB9-14767\nATIP Number: A-2021-00540\nATIP Pages: 000151-0000156\nREASONS FOR DECISION\nINTRODUCTION\n[1] These are the reasons for the decision in the claims of [XXX], [XXX], who claim to be citizens of Mexico, and are claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.1\n[2] In rendering my reasons, I have considered and applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guidelines on Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution.2\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] The female claimant alleges that her ex-partner is a member of the Los Zetas cartel in Mexico and she is a victim of domestic abuse. Should she return to Mexico she alleges her life is at risk. The complete allegations are set out in the Basis of Claim (BOC) Form,3 as well as the BOC amendments.4\nDETERMINATION\n[4] I find, on a balance of probabilities, that you would be subjected personally to a risk to your lives or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, should you return to Mexico, for the following reasons.\nANALYSIS\n[5] The determinative issue(s) in this case are credibility, state protection, internal flight alternative.\nIdentity\n[6] I find that your identity as nationals of Mexico is established by your testimony and the supporting documentation filed including your passports.\nCredibility\n[7] Unless specifically noted in the analysis below, I accept your evidence about your allegations of domestic abuse and the events associated with it that you encountered in Mexico as being generally credible.\n[8] The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) Rules require claimants to provide acceptable documents establishing their identity and other elements of the claim. I have drawn a negative inference to the credibility of your allegation that the Agent of Persecution (AOP) is a Los Zetas cartel member. You have not provided sufficient persuasive evidence that would reasonably be expected to identify this individual, nor a reasonable explanation why you were not able to obtain them.\n[9] You were questioned about providing documentary proof of the identity of [XXX], the alleged agent of persecution (AOP). The panel acknowledges that the AOP\u2019s name appears on the copy of the birth certificates for your children, but I find beyond this you have provided little support to establish his identity or his identity as a member of the Los Zetas cartel.\n[10] You have provided a series of medical reports from [XXX] 2013,5 as well as a series of 2011 police witness statements from neighbours that state that they have witnessed bruising on the claimant.6 The witnesses describe the claimant\u2019s partner ([XXX]) as an aggressive and threatening individual, much like his father and friends he associates with. The same documents contain another statement from a neighbour that describes the claimant\u2019s partner as a drunk and aggressive. You have also provided a copy of a lawyer\u2019s letter dated in 2011, that describes a statement from the claimant about the AOP and the abuse she has experienced. The letter states the claimant identified that her partner belonged to the \u201cZetas\u201d cartel. I would note that this statement is simply based on self-reporting from the claimant.\n[11] The Panel finds upon review of all of the evidence, on balance there is insufficient persuasive evidence to confirm the alleged AOP is a member of a cartel and anything more than a local thug who has abused you. I find this lack of evidence to be unreasonable because of your long-term relationship with this individual, as well as your alleged long term and continued contact with his family members. In addition, your statements at the hearing and in your amended BOC narrative confirmed that all of your neighbours and a number of your friends and relatives have interacted with this individual. Yet, when questioned about obtaining additional affidavits from any of those individuals you testified that you had not considered it. I find on a balance of probabilities that you have not provided evidence to confirm the identity of the AOP as a member of the Los Zetas cartel and that your problems are limited and local to your home area of Oaxaca.\nContact With the AOP\n[12] You have alleged that you continue to receive threatening messages from the AOP. When you were asked to explain how and when you received these messages you stated they came in the form of Facebook messages. I note that you have provided copies of photographs of messages from your telephone or tablet.7 Upon examining these messages, the panel notes the name of the individuals on the text is not that of the AOP. I further note that there is no way to ascertain the contact information or identity of the individual who sent the messages. The claimant described that the AOP was using an alias, the panel is unable to assess whether that is true or not. The panel places little evidentiary weight on the copies of photographs of the text messages submitted in evidence. Therefore, I draw a negative inference concerning your credibility by reason of your failure to adduce corroborating documentary evidence as to the association ofyour partner with the Los Zetas cartel and ongoing threats from the AOP.\n[13] You allege that the AOP has been able to locate you on numerous occasions in Mexico. Your testimony and statements confirm that you have maintained social media profiles where you have received messages and threats from the AOP. You have confirmed in your evidence that you have corresponded with the AOP when receiving these messages. You have further confirmed in your evidence that you have maintained contact with the sister and mother of the AOP, yet you state they are not interested in assisting you. I find it reasonable to believe that these interactions could provide the AOP with details as to your location.\nInternal flight alternative\n[14] I have considered whether a viable internal flight alternative (IFA), exists for you and the male claimant.\n[15] I acknowledge that the complicating concern in this situation is that you have children with the AOP and at this time the AOP has taken custody of the children. In your BOC narrative, as well as your testimony you confirm that should you return to Mexico you will continue to make efforts to contact your children and seek some form of custodial relationship.\n[16] The female claimant testified that in the past the AOP has threatened to kill her or the children if she starts custody proceedings against him. The panel acknowledges Counsel\u2019 s submission that if the female claimant initiates legal proceedings in Mexico, she would have to face the AOP, and he would be able to easily locate her.\n[17] The Federal Court has found that the Board cannot find an IFA is available or reasonable where a condition of its viability is that the claimant does not try to get custody of her children. The Court in Calderon8 found it would be \u201cunduly harsh and unreasonable to expect the [claimant] to foreswear any efforts or attempts to re-secure custody of her young children.\u201d That particular case involved a similarly situated claimant from Mexico.\n[18] I find in considering the fact that you will and should pursue custody of your children that there are no other parts of the country, where you would not face a risk to your life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. Hence the concept of a viable IFA will not stand.\nState Protection\n[19] The objective documentary evidence states:\nThe Bertelsmann Stiftung mentions in its 2016 Mexico Country Report that there are \u201cthousands of unresolved crimes of violence against women in many regions\u2026.\u201d In its world report covering the year 2015, Freedom House notes that perpetrators of domestic violence \u201care rarely punished.\u201d The report continues to state: \u201cImplementation of a 2007 law designed to protect women from such crimes remains halting, particularly at the state level, and impunity is the norm for the killers of hundreds of women each year.\u201d9\n[20] The panel finds that the documentary evidence supports a finding that state protection in respect of gender-based violence in Mexico can be described as limited at best. The literature describes efforts to address a long-standing culture of acceptance of domestic abuse, but despite strong existing legislation protecting women\u2019s rights and preventing violence against women, enforcement varies widely and largely depends on social norms, pointing to potential gaps between the de jure laws and the de facto practices.10\n[21] The panel finds that in the particular circumstances of this claim that adequate state protection would not be reasonably forthcoming.\nCONCLUSION\n[22] Based on the analysis above, I conclude that you are persons in need of protection. Accordingly, I accept your claims.\n(signed) R.

They are citizens of El Salvador who claim refugee protection pursuant to Section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. At the start of the hearing, I appointed the principal claimant as the designated representative for the minor child, her daughter, given there has been long term separation of daughter from her birth father, who now lives in the USA. It is not contended there\u2019s any issue here of abduction otherwise or problem about the principal claimant having sole custody of the minor claimant.\n[2] I determine that both claimants are citizens of El Salvador and no other country by reference to the copies of the passports found in Exhibit 1. The certified true copy of that for the principal claimant and the copy of a copy for the minor claimant. It was explained to me that the original passport for the minor claimant is being held by the US immigration authorities.\n[3] Let\u2019s refer to the allegations in brief. The claimants assert a fear of the Maras otherwise known as the MS- 13 in El Salvador. Specifically, because the principal claimant was involved in a number of [XXX] as a [XXX] whose primary function was to work with at risk youth and try to divert those youth from otherwise becoming involved with the Maras, the gangs, who are the criminal actors in El Salvador. Because of the principal claimant\u2019s work then and her background as a [XXX] who ran several programs to work with the at-risk [XXX], the Maras took a dim view of this, they threatened her repeatedly, they forced her to leave one job and relocate to another job. And in the most recent occupation in a new [XXX] starting in or so of [XXX] 2017, she only lasted there for about [XXX] months because by [XXX] of that year, she began to receive serious threats from a Mara member, personally identified himself to the principal claimant at her [XXX] as being from the MS-13 and he warned her that if she did not do as she was told then she would face the consequences \u201cshe took this as being a death threat\u201d. She was also aware that in pervious positions, other [XXX] had been killed and in that most recent position, the [XXX] who were her pre-assessors had been forced to flee for their own lives. The principal claimant tried to seek help from the local police in [XXX] 2017 but while the police took her statement, nothing concrete came of the corn plaint. More importantly, as she was leaving the police station, she was approached by a runner or observer, a young boy acting on behalf of the Maras who was following her and who asked why she had gone to police. She knew at that point that she was under constant surveillance by the Maras, she never returned to the [XXX]. And furthermore, she learned soon afterwards that the extent of the Maras interest in her also went as far as her own daughter.\n[4] For these reasons, she decided to leave El Salvador as quickly as possible. A smuggler or snake head was found to get mother and daughter into the USA. They crossed the border first through Guatemala and then Mexico and into the USA by way of a raft on the Rio Grande. She was then picked up with her daughter in the USA and they were processed at that time however they found the detention conditions and the church to be aberrant. And furthermore, there were in the USA awaiting the outcome of their claims because of the situation there and other reasons which were detailed in oral testimony, they felt they would be safer by far in this country and thus made their move to come north into Canada. For these foregoing reasons they make their current claims.\n[5] I find to determine that the claimants are persons in need of protection due to risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment for the following reasons. I accept that the testimony was credible throughout, it was given in a forthright and detailed fashion by the principal claimant. There were very few missed steps. There were some areas of concern primarily through gaps of the written narrative. I per say the narrative cannot be all encompassing for fear as it would be too lengthy but I would of appreciated for example, further details as to the problems in the second [XXX] where the principal claimant started in [XXX] or [XXX] 2017. The written narrative jumped into the problems in that second place by reference to an event in [XXX] 2017 but by comparison the oral testimony indicated area of problems from [XXX] even some months before hand. Furthermore, the country documentation disclosed by the claimants indicates that even before the principal claimant arrived at that [XXX] there was a history of violence against [XXX] like herself who had tried to engage the at-risk [XXX], this we see from Exhibit 6, page 13 and 14, the news article. So, in my view it is certainly my perception it would have been ideal to have seen greater detail as to why the principal claimant went to that [XXX] despite knowing-, actually said in oral testimony, all the history of problems there but that\u2019s a minor point where one has easily overall thrashed the claim. So, to-, it would have been preferred had we been able to obtain the credible fear interview notes from the USA which I believe one from the access through the appropriate Access to Information Request to US CBP or INS or both, that might of assisted by corroborating that the allegations put forward to the USA at the credible fear interview stage were the same or consistent with the current claims. I see confirmation of the US credible fear interview though as being successful by way of the Notice to Appear from the US, department of Homeland Security appendant to Exhibit 2.1, the Basis of Claim From for the principal claimant.\n[6] So, in summary, I found the testimony given throughout was credible and trustworthy. There was appropriate corroboration by way of letters from calling [XXX] in the Exhibit package 6. We see the attestation also of the police and deputy inspector at page 1 to 5, employment letter regarding her [XXX], letters from the principal claimant\u2019s colleagues and principal. All these serve to corroborate the details of the situation for the principal claimant and her daughter in El Salvador. Furthermore, the information applied by the principal claimant is entirely consistent with the known country conditions in El Salvador. Persons who are [XXX] are one of the classes of individuals who are at particular risk in so far as the gangs whether the MS-13 or the MS-18, consistently have reacted with the violence even murder against those who try to divert young [XXX] ages 10 and up from following the gang lifestyle. We this for example, when one looks at the report on the eligibility guidelines for assessing the international protection needs of asylum seekers from El Salvador, this from the UNCHR at Tab 1.5 of the National Documentation Package, Exhibit 3 on page 40, paragraph sub 10. It states, due to the youthful membership of the gangs in El Salvador, gangs reportedly often seek to exert inference on and in [XXX] and [XXX] institutions where they operate. [XXX] and other [XXX] working across the country where gangs are present reportedly occupy themselves subject to extortion demands and those who represent as I believe the principal in this insist, also did an alternative source from authority or resist or oppose the gangs and their recruitment of local youths have reportedly been threatened and killed by the gangs. It goes on then to state, depending upon the particular circumstances of the case, UNCHR considers that [XXX] and [XXX] working in [XXX] and [XXX] institutions may be in need of international refugee protection on the basis of their imputed political opinion or on the basis of other Convention grounds.\n[7] Given the outcome as positive, I dare say that the claimants care little that in my view there is questionable Nexus to any Convention refugee ground. The fear of persecution in my view is not necessary to enter the five grounds, I\u2019ve considered the claimants testimony and I find that they fear crime or vendetta from members of the criminal gang, the MS-13. And the federal court cases in this regard for the most part have held that victims of such generally failed to establish any link between their fears in any one of the Convention grounds and that\u2019s noted in the case law. For example, Marincas, M-A-R-I-N-C-A-S citation IMM-5737-93, more recently Bacchus, B-A-C-C-H-U-S that\u2019s 2004 FC 821. So, certainly is an arguable point as to whether there is a Nexus or not. UNCHR takes a different view in the final outcome given my determination in positive, I doubt it matters to the claimants per say.\n[8] The claimants in view have also rebutted the presumption of state protection. They went to police as noted in the oral testimony and as evidenced by the reports we find in the Exhibit 6 package but with no success and more to the point the attempt to seek help from the police created a negative reaction from the gangs who were then able to identify the principal claimant as being what we would refer to ask a snitch and that itself exposed her to grave problems of irate immediate nature necessitating her departure from her job that very same day. So, as I said I consider that they have rebutted the presumption of state protection and all the circumstances and given that the country documentation consistently indicates in my view from Exhibit 3 NDP that there is no state protection both because of the inability but also because pervasive corruption that the MS-13 and MS-18 have managed to infiltrate various local police.\n[9] There was a further question mark about the abandonment of the US claims. As I said, I might of preferred to have seen more careful discussion of that in the written narrative. The only mention about the USA really indicates when I looked to the narrative at line 91 and 92 and thereafter, there were problems securing a lawyer, Jack of fonds and that was the real reason to depart from the USA for fear of deportation or arrest. The oral testimony differed from this because we got forward details about the oppressed conditions in the USA that indeed when the principal claimant consulted with the lawyer after arriving in the USA, in or about [XXX] 2018 she was advised that there was little chance of success in making a claim based on gang violence in El Salvador. The lawyer according to oral testimony based that upon directors from the president himself. My specialized knowledge and expertise is of course that the directive to restrict the ability to make a refugee or asylum claim in the USA arose from the promulgation of the then Attorney General, Mr. Sessions, S-E-S-S-I-O-N-S in or about [XXX] 2018. Whoever said it, I acknowledge that the US law is in flux, there is a clear indication from the highest authorities in the US that there is a grave risk of rejection of one\u2019s asylum claim based upon the grounds of gang violence in El Salvador. So, for that reason, I draw no adverse inference in the all the circumstances that the claimants abandoned their US asylum claims in order to come here seeking true safety.\n[10] So, to summarize, as I said, there is ample documentation from the claimants to corroborate their process situation. The articles presented by counsel in the Exhibit package 6 address the particular problems of those who deal with [XXX] children who are at risk. We see this for example in the articles presented at page 18 from the Atlantic Magazine, the Rogers article at page 25 and the Inside Crime Discussion starting at page 31, all within the country disclosure section and these are all consistent with the allegations from the principal claimant. I did note also, in my discussion with her during the course of oral testimony that she had applied for a Canadian visitor visa but being rejected even as early as we see from the GCMS notes in Exhibit 1, in or about May or so of 2017, sometime before she actually left the country to go to the USA. Upon questioning the principal claimant, she said because of her prior experiences in the previous [XXX], she was then worried about getting further threats and had little confidence about her long-term prospects in El Salvador, however she lacked the fonds to get a visa from the either the Canadian authorities or US authorities at that time and was thus refused. It is apparent that there was the-, not shall we say obligation to leave the country even then so there is a slight question mark as to the timing of departure. In theory, the claimants might have left earlier then they did but in all these circumstances, I draw no negative inference. It would appear that their finances were limited and the principal claimant was trying her best to seek a new avenue of employment where she had been assured in the second [XXX] where she had worked most recently that she would be offered security. After a few months in that place in Morazan, M-O-R-A-Z-A\u00adN, she found out that her employers had misled her because the police protection was withdrawn leaving her to the approaches by the gangs at their mercy.\n[11] My point here is essentially, I draw no adverse inference from the delay in leaving, from the abandonment of the US claim and ail the circumstances and I find the claimants have successfully made their made as persons in need of protection. I, therefore determine that the claimants [XXX] and her minor daughter [XXX] are persons in need of protection due to the risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment which is more likely then not were they to return to El Salvador in the present day. And which risk is entirely personalized in nature given the repeated escalating threats to the principal claimant from the Maras in El Salvador. That concludes my decision.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n",

Khamsi\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Amedeo Clivia (Clivea Law)\nCountry: Turkey\nRPD Number: TB9-12901\nATIP Number: A-2021-00540\nATIP Pages: 000143-0000145\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: This is the decision in the claim for refugee protection made by [XXX]. So you claim to be a citizen of Turkey and you are claiming refugee protection pursuant to Section 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. Your allegation are detailed in your-, in the narrative portion of your Basis of Claim form but to summarize, you fear persecution in Turkey due to your Kurdish ethnicity and your Alevi faith and also your support of the HDP. You mentioned that you have been discriminated and bullied because of your Kurdish ethnicity and also because of your religion.\n[2] You were arrested twice by the police in-, in Turkey. You were also involved with the HDP and you have relatives who were arrested and held in custody because of their involvement with the HDP. So, now you are afraid to return to Turkey and be discriminated because of your-, of your faith and also because of you are a supporter of the HDP and you are afraid that if you become involved in politics and you are arrested by the police, they find out that-, about your record and you would be in much more trouble. You also testified that you were involved in social media and that you have been criticizing the government and all that maybe held against you.\n[3] So, determination. I find that you are a Convention refugee based on your ethnicity and your political opinion.\n[4] Now, the identified issues are identity and credibility, your ethnicity. So, with respect to your personal identity, I find that you are a citizen of Turkey based on your testimony and documents that you have provided, including your passports.\n[5] With respect to your ethnicity and religious identity, I find on a balance of probabilities that you are of Turkish descent and Alevi faith. You needed prompting, your testimony was not that forthcoming when you were asked about your religion but you also provided some evidence with regarding the Alevi Cultural Centre here and a letter from the Kurdish Association. Too, you also explained that you did not speak Kurdish because your parents wanted to protect you, however, it\u2019 s not something that you were hiding and that led to-, to-, to-, to travel as you have alleged in-, in your story.\n[6] Now with the regard to credibility, I find that your oral testimony did not contradict your written evidence. You needed prompting but there was no contradiction between your oral and written evidence. You were able to explain all the questions that I asked you. You have also provided evidence to support all your allegations. You have provided as I said, a letter from the Alevi Cultural Centre and from the Kurdish-, Toronto Kurdish Centre. You have provided evidence from your social media. I have a letter from your sister who corroborated your-, your story with regard to your arrest in [XXX] 2018.\n[7] I have reviewed also all country conditions documents that we provided in the NDP and by your counsel and the documentary evidence supports your allegations were always targeted and the information that we have in the NDP. They confirm that Kurds were already-, in Turkey, however, the situation has worsened since the-, the 2016 attempted coup and lots of people are-, were arrested in Turkey just because of-, of their background. Who-, so when you are Kurd and Alevi, it makes things worse and we have lots of evidence with regard to discrimination, with regards to Alevi.\n[8] Now, with regard to your political activities. The evidence indicates that if you are perceived to be a member or-, or of any political group, any opposition group sorry, in-, in Turkey, you may be subjected to human right violations and in-, in Turkey, those who are viewed as anti-government are subjected to lots of mistreatment. Specifically, Kurdish and Alevi\u2019s, they are viewed as a threat to the government and as sometimes associated with the-, sorry, I\u2019m trying to find the-, sometimes they can viewed-, be viewed as-, as associated to terrorist activities.\n[9] So, I find that your profile as a Kurdish and Alevi and your political activities may put you at risk of detention and torture at the hand of the government if you were to turn-, to return to Turkey, based on the objective evidence that we have on file. There were other issues that I did not touch, for example, delay in claiming and you went back to Turkey as well, it could have been considered as re-availment, however, you explained in your narrative and that\u2019s I was-, the reason why that happened and you provided evidence with-, with regard to your delay. A letter from your friends who I did not held that against you.\n[10] Now I looked at state protection and given that the State is the agent of persecution, I find that, there is no state protection for you in Turkey and for the same reasons, I find that there is no internal flight alternative available to you in Turkey.\n[11] And to conclude, I find that you are Convention refugee and I accept your claim.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n",

Bugby\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Keith MacMillan\nCountry: Colombia\nRPD Number: TB9-12310\nATIP Number: A-2021-00540\nATIP Pages: 000138-0000142\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: So this is the decision for the claimant [XXX], the claimant seeks refugee protection pursuant to Sections 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[2] I have considered the oral testimony and the other evidence in the case and I am ready to render a decision orally.\n[3] I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee as defined under Section 96 of the act and I accept the claim.\n[4] The allegations are set out in the basis of claim form, in summary the claimant has been targeted by FARC dissidents as a result of his work as a government employee responsible for the [XXX], [XXX] and [XXX].\n[5] The nexus is political opinion and or imputed political opinion and it is expressed though the claimant\u2019s employment.\n[6] The claimant on a balance of probabilities has established his identity through his testimony and submission of his Columbian passport and other documents.\n[7] Based on the claimant\u2019s credible evidence I accept the following facts and find that the claimant has established on a balance of probabilities a well founded fear of persecution. The claimant was employed by the state and was responsible for [XXX], efforts subsequent to the signing of the 2016 FARC peace accord.\n[8] The claimant\u2019s duties included [XXX], [XXX] and [XXX] as obtained from demobilized FARC members.\n[9] In [XXX] 2018 the claimant was approached and threatened by armed men demanding the names of ex combatants providing his department with [XXX] information. The men stated that they were acting on behalf of the leader of the FARC dissidents and threatened to kill the claimant unless he provided the information demanded.\n[10] Following two subsequent contacts one in which the lives of the claimant\u2019s family were threatened, the claimant fled the area.\n[11] In [XXX] 2018 the claimant returned to Florencia and was attacked and threatened at gun point in front of his family. Following the advice of the authorities the claimant provided his attackers with fake information saved to a [XXX].\n[12] Shortly after there were reports that the military had bombed the base camp of the FARC dissidents killing their leader and rumors began to circulate that the military learned of the location from a [XXX] and that reprisals would follow.\n[13] Fearing that FARC dissidents would believe the claimant to be responsible for providing this information to the military, the claimant made the decision to flee the country and left Columbia two weeks later.\n[14] Additionally the claimant is a gay man adding to his fear of the group as they are noted for targeting members of the LGBTQ population.\n[15] The objective country documents are consistent with the claimant\u2019s evidence. At Tab 1.2 the reports indicate that following the demobilization of the FARC in 2017 dissidents formed groups throughout Columbia and since a number of demobilized forces have rearmed having lost faith in the peace process.\n[16] Further the maps contained in this report show the presence of FARC dissidents throughout Columbia.\n[17] At tab 7.22 the reports indicate that many FARC dissident groups have formed alliances with both the ELN and the AGC further extending their reach.\n[18] At Tab 1.7 the NDP speaks to the risk profiles of social leaders and human rights activists and at Tab 2.9 indicates a constant level of violence against social leaders and human rights activists perpetrated by the Bacrim.\n[19] While the claimant did not self identify as a social leader or activist his employment reflects at the very least activities aimed at social changes and support and in support of demobilization and the peace accord.\n[20] Lastly at Tab 6.3 the reports indicate societal abuse and discrimination against the LGBT community and notes that criminal groups target homosexual individuals, though the claimant\u2019s sexual orientation may not be sufficient in itself to establish his claim there are reports that support the claimant\u2019s position that criminal groups target homosexuals thus heightening the claimants level of risk and level of fear.\n[21] Based on the forgoing I find on a balance of probabilities that the claimant has established a well founded fear and serious possibility of persecution in Columbia.\n[22] The claimant reported each of the threats to government authorities who undertook to investigate. In the end all that was offered was advise to provide false information to the FARC, advise which the claimant followed in which he believes placed him at greater risk, no other protective measures were put in place.\n[23] The claimant\u2019s evidence is consistent with the objective country reports at Tab 7.3 which indicate that the claimant does not fit the profile of those eligible for protection.\n[24] At Tab 7.23 the NDP indicates that protection measures for victims are very limited and the measures in place do not meet the needs on the ground.\n[25] Based on the claimant\u2019s personal circumstances and the objective country documentation I find that the claimant has rebutted the presumption of state protection with clear and convincing evidence, adequate state protection is not available to the claimant.\n[26] With respect to internal flight alternative, on a balance of probabilities I find that there is no viable internal flight alternative that would be safe for this claimant, the claimant was threatened by FARC dissidents demanding he provide information about ex combatants who were collaborating with the government regarding land mine location and removal.\n[27] Following the advice of the authorities the claimant provided false information and is of the opinion that the risk intensified.\n[28] In essence the FARC dissidents were seeking the person who assisted the military to locate and bomb the camp and the claimant fears he would be suspected given his past interactions with the group.\n[29] While the claimant left the area and was not located by the FARC dissidents on two occasions I accept as reasonable that the motivation of the group to locate the claimant changed after the bombing of the camp.\n[30] Further the parents, the claimant\u2019s parents relocated after the claimant fled Columbia due to the presence of individuals in the area of their home who have, who it was suspected were looking for the claimant. The claimant fears that he would be at risk throughout Columbia.\n[31] The country conditions are consistent with the claimant\u2019 s position. At Tab 1.2 the reports indicate that following the demobilization of the FARC in 2017 dissidents formed groups throughout Columbia and since a number of demobilized forces have rearmed.\n[32] Further the maps contained in this report show the presence of FARC dissidents across Columbia. At Tab 1.7 the country reports indicate that given the reported ability of guerilla groups to operate country wide a viable IFA may not be available to individuals at risk of being targeted by such actors.\n[33] It is particularly important to note the operational capacity of the groups to carry out attacks in all parts of Columbia irrespective of territorial control.\n[34] Further the country reports referred as societal abuse and discrimination against LGBTQ individuals and I also note that LGBTQ individuals are targeted by these criminal groups.\n[35] The impact of this is twofold the claimant believes and I accept as reasonable that the fact that he is a gay male would provide additional motivation for the FARC to track him and the claimant\u2019 s sexual orientation would render him more visible if he were to attempt to relocate in Columbia.\n[36] Having given consideration to the claimant\u2019s personal circumstances and the objective country conditions I find that there is no viable internal flight alternative that would be safe as the claimant faces a risk of persecution in all parts of the country.\n[37] In conclusion based on the totality of the evidence I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee and I accept his claim and we are concluded.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n",

In short, the claimant alleges a fear of persecution at the hands of the Saudi authorities because of his political views. The claimant has voiced those views repeatedly on publicly accessible social s- media platforms, like Twitter and Snapchat. The claimant was also actively involved advocating for minority rights in Saudi Arabia. If returned to Saudi Arabia, the claimant fears that he will be detained by the authorities or disappeared, or in worse case scenario, killed. For the reasons outlined below, I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee, as he has established a serious possibility of persecution in Saudi Arabia, based on his real or perceived political opinion.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[3] The claimant\u2019s identity as a national of Saudi Arabia is established, on a balance of probabilities, through the certified true copy of his passport, which can be found at Exhibit 1.\n[4] Exclusion under Article 1 F(a) is not applicable. Exclusion is not applicable in this case, as the claimant\u2019s time in the Ministry of Defence, does not engage any concerns related to Article 1 F(a). The claimant was a [XXX] in the Ministry of Defence for Saudi Arabia, for approximately [XXX] years. During his time of service, the claimant assisted with the [XXX] activities. The claimant never engaged in armed conflict, nor was he present for any armed conflict, nor was he aware of the Minister of Defence military activities in the eastern province of Saudi Arabia. While the Saudi Arabian military, in particular the Ministry of Defence, has been accused of committing war-crimes and crimes against humanity, the claimant\u2019 s position was so far removed, that he could not have been complicit or willfully blind to any of the alleged activities, for which he would have had no knowledge. Lastly, I note, that the Minister decided not to intervene in this matter and noted the following in its letter: the claimant\u2019s front-end security screening passed and was favourable.\nCredibility\n[5] It is trite law that testimony given under oath is presumed to be true, unless there are reasons to doubt its veracity. The claimant\u2019s testimony and corroborating evidence, in particular, the plethora of evidence concerning his online activities, which can be found throughout Exhibit 10, establishes his political profile. The claimant clearly articulated his fear of returning to Saudi Arabia, specifically, his fear of being killed because he has spoken against the King; a fear that is well supported in the documentary evidence, within the National Documentation Package, for Saudi Arabia. While the claimant falsely presented himself as a security specialist in his visa application, I do not draw a negative inference, as it is clear that he only did so to be more likely to be successful in obtaining a visa; his only way out of the country. And, given that he was fleeing persecution, I will not fault the claimant for doing so. I do not draw a negative inference from the amendments to the Basis of Claim form, which can be found at Exhibit 11. It is clear that the amendments are only additions, that include events that have happened after arriving in Canada. And, even if one were to disagree with me, any concerns that could arise from these amendments are not sufficient to rebut the presumption of truthfulness with respect to the claimant\u2019s political views which can be viewed publicly; online on Twitter. It\u2019 s the nature of these political views that he voiced so publicly, that places him at risk in Saudi Arabia on his return. So, based on the above reasons, I find that on a balance of probabilities, the claimant\u2019s allegations are true.\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution\n[6] The documentary evidence, which can be found within Exhibit 3 of the National Documentation Package for Saudi Arabia, specifically, at Tabs 4.1 and 11.2, establishes that there is a well-founded fear of persecution for those persons, like the claimant, who are critical of the government on social media. In late 2010, the government moved to increase its control over independent blogs and websites, demanding that these too obtain official licences. The rule could not be effectively imp- implemented, but several Twitter users and bloggers have been arrested in recent years for alleged religious deviance. The government closely monitors social media and has its own operatives engaged in targeted counter-propaganda. Internet freedom in Saudi Arabia further declined in 2018, amid an escalating intolerance for all forms of political, social, and religious dissent. An anti-terrorism law, introduced in November 2017, laid out lengthy prison senten\u00ad terms for offences linked to non-violent political and religious speech; such as portraying the King or a crown-prince in a manner that brings religion or justice in disrepute. Given the climate of oppression towards persons who post on social media views critical of the government, I find that the claimant\u2019s fear of persecution is objectively well-founded.\nState Protection\n[7] As the agent of persecution is the government of Saudi Arabia, I find that it would be objectively unreasonable for the claimant to seek protection of the very agent of persecution whom he fears.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[8] I also find that the claimant faces a serious possibility of persecution throughout Saudi Arabia, especially given the country documentation that indicates that the authorities operate similarly throughout Saudi Arabia, towards those who are, or perceived to be, political dissidents. Therefore, viable internal flight alternatives are not available to the claimant.\n[9] Based on the foregoing analysis, I conclude that the claimant is a Convention refugee and I accept his claim.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n",

[XXX], file TB9-01495. The associated minor claimants [XXX], file TB9-01515; [XXX], file TB9-01516; and [XXX], file TB9-01517.\n[2] I\u2019ve considered your testimony and the other evidence in this case and I\u2019m ready to render my decision orally.\n[3] Your claiming to be a citizen of \u2014 or you and your family are claiming to be citizens of Eswatini and are claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. I find that you are Convention refugees for the following reasons.\n[4] The allegations of your claims can be found in your Basis of Claim Forms at Exhibit 2. In short, you allege persecution from the Eswatini authorities and police based on your imputed political opinions, as you had agreed to [XXX] for PUDEMO, P-U-D-E-M-O, a prohibited political party. You allege that you had [XXX] for the PUDEMO as an act of charity, as you had helped other people and groups in similar ways before. You had six [XXX] before completing a large order and kept two.\n[5] When you [XXX] you were arrested. You were interrogated about your involvement with various prohibited political parties before being released through the assistance with \u2014 of a lawyer. You noticed that the authorities began to follow you and monitor you. You were stopped and questioned repeatedly. You came to Canada on previously obtained visitor visas and claimed refugee protection. You fear future arrests and physical harm for yourself and fear the Eswatini authorities.\n[6] You allege that your wife and children, these seated claimants, could face harm from the same people because the Eswatini authorities would want to find you. You allege there\u2019s no state protection available for you, nor any available internal flight alternative in Eswatini.\n[7] In terms of identity, you\u2019ve submitted copies of your Eswatini passports, which can be found in Exhibit 1. I therefore, find that on a balance of probabilities that identity and country of reference have been established.\n[8] The adult claimants have offered evidence at Exhibit 7 that they had Pakistani citizenship. note that they \u2014 their passports state that they were born in Pakistan. However, at Exhibit 7, I note evidence about renouncing that Pakistani citizenship in order to become citizens of Swaziland or Eswatini. I note that each of the minor claimants were born after that renunciation. I note from the passports available at Exhibit 1, that each of the claimants required visas to visit Pakistan after this renunciation.\n[9] In terms of country of reference, a claimant may be considered to be a national of a country where the evidence establishes that it is within his or her control to acquire the citizenship of a country, for example, where the application for citizenship is a mere formality and the authorities of that country did not have any discretion to refuse the application. I reference the Williams case, neutral citation of 2005 FAC 126.\n[10] \u201cAfter a thorough review of the documentary evidence, including the National Documentation Package for Pakistan at Exhibit 8, and an updated response to information request at Exhibit 9, the law regarding the resumption of Pakistani citizenship after renunciation as an adult is still unclear. Available Pakistani law states that in situations like this, the law is not explicit.\u201d (as read)\n[11] All indications point to this still being good case law. Accordingly, I cannot find that an application to resume Pakistani citizenship would be a \u201cmere formality\u201d as it is unclear as to whether the authorities of Pakistan have any discretion to refuse that application. As such, I cannot find Pakistan to be a country of reference for any of the claimants. The only country of reference in this matter is Swaziland, or Eswatini, as it is now called.\n[12] In terms of credibility, I find that on a balance of probabilities you have established credibly that you will be at risk of persecution because of an imputed political opinion. I have found you to be credible, generally. Your testimony about your political involvement was straightforward and was in keeping with your Basis of Claim Form. There were no significant inconsistencies that went to the core of your claim that were not explained. I did note some minor omissions, however, I do believe that you\u2019ve offered a reasonable explanation for each omission.\n[13] You were able to provide detailed testimony about your businesses, your charitable work, and why you agreed to help the PUDEMO members. You were able to describe in detail the steps you took to obtain the PUDEMO [XXX] and to deliver them to the party members. Your testimony about your arrest was specific, detailed, spontaneous, and all in all, consistent with your allegations. I place a great deal of weight on these lines of testimony.\n[14] I also note that in support of these aspects of your claim, you provided documentary evidence. I note Affidavits from employees from your store who witnessed you being arrested and witnessed that you had to close down these stores after the arrest. You also provided a medical report from the day you were released from detention. That documented injuries that you\u2019ve sustained while in detention. I further note the \u2014 a letter from your brother saying that the police were still searching property that used to be owned by you and that they had been questioning your brother about your location. Furthermore, I note a letter from the lawyer that you had hired in Eswatini to help you get out of detention. These documents can be found at Exhibit 6.\n[15] I further note that today you were able to provide a documentation, your travel documentation that you had used in order to travel to South Africa to obtain the [XXX] for the PUDEMO party members. I note that the travel dates are stamped specifically on this document, and this document can be found at Exhibit 10.\n[16] I did note some issue with some of the Court documents that you had provided. This would be bail documents and an Affidavit in order to obtain bail. Also, at Exhibit 7, I noted some issues in \u2014 regarding stamps or lack of stamps, lack of signatures. I do have concerns about these documents, however, overall these concerns are not enough to find that on a balance of probabilities that these documents are non-genuine, or non-credible. I put some weight on those documents specifically. Those Court documents, again, can be found at Exhibit 6. The other documents, as noted at Exhibit 7 and 10.\n[17] In terms of documentary support, although this is not technically a document, I note that you were also able to show me one of the extra PUDEMO [XXX] here today at the hearing. I do place a great amount of weight on the documents that had no issues. They do go to help establish your credibility.\n[18] I further note that you had travelled outside of Eswatini to South Africa and then returned to Eswatini. This travel happened after your arrest. I must assess whether this travel impacts your credibility in terms of the failure to claim asylum and then reavailment, as you did not claim protection in South Africa at that time and indeed returned to Eswatini. I asked you about these issues and you explained that it was because South Africa was dangerous for foreigners because of issues with Xenophobia. I also note that your family did not travel with you on these trips. You explained that this travel was necessary because you were wrapping up your business in order to obtain funds to flee Eswatini.\n[19] In light of your other credible evidence regarding your imputed political opinion, I find that you\u2019ve offered a reasonable explanation for both the failure to claim refugee protection and the reavailment. These issues do not impact your credibility.\n[20] Overall, as I said before, I do find you to be a credible witness. I find that you\u2019ve established your profile as someone with an imputed political opinion on a balance of probabilities, and as such, your family\u2019s profile as family members of somebody with a imputed political opinion, I find that your allegations about the risks that you face due to these political opinions, real or imputed, as outlined in your Basis of Claim Forms and your testimony, to be credible.\n[21] I find that you\u2019ve established your subjective fear. I find that there\u2019s a link between what you fear and two of the five Convention grounds, specifically, you \u2018ve been persecuted by the Eswatini government because of an imputed political opinion, therefore your claim has been assessed under section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. Your family faces persecution because of their membership in a particular social group as family members of someone with an imputed political opinion. Their claims as well has been \u2014 have been assessed under section 96.\n[22] In terms of objective documentation, I note that the available documentation supports your allegations that individuals in your circumstances face persecution in Eswatini. I\u2019ve referenced the National Documentation Package as found at Exhibit 3, specifically Item 2.1:\n[23] \u201cHuman rights issues included restrictions on political participation and corruption. The Government often did not investigate, prosecute, or administratively punish officials who committed human rights abuses. With very few exceptions, the government did not identify officials who committed abuses. Impunity was widespread.\u201d\n[24] I note Item 2.7:\n\u201cIndividuals have been charges with terrorism and sedition for participating in peaceful assemblies and\/or associated \u2014 associating with political parties, especially PUDEMO.\u201d (as read)\n[25] I note Item 4.1 which states that \u201cPUDEMO was officially banned in the country under the Suppression of Terrorism Act.\u201d Excuse me. It\u2019s also noted that \u201cthose found associating with PUDEMO may face prison terms of between 25 years and life.\u201d The same item states that:\n\u201cPersons or groups that abet, aid, sympathize with, shelter, or provide logistical support to the organizations invite \u2018the wrath of the law\u2019.\u201d (as read)\n[26] I\u2019ve considered these \u2014 this documentary evidence in conjunction with your credible allegations about your experiences in Eswatini. Having considered these factors, I find that you face a serious possibility of persecution based on your imputed political opinion.\n[27] In regards to your family members, the associated claimants, I note the claimant\u2019 s Exhibit 6 at page 35, this is Objective Country Condition Evidence. It states that:\n\u201cThe use of various forms of intimidation, torture, and murder to silence dissidence is a long\u00ad standing tradition in Eswatini.\u201d (as read)\n[28] I do find that this is enough to establish that there is more than a mere possibility of persecution for the associated claimants, as well as the family members of a political dissident, again, whether real or imputed. I find there is an objective basis to their fears as well, and that a well\u00ad founded fear of persecution has been established for each of the claimants.\n[29] As the agent of persecution is the state, which acts with impunity, I find that there is clear and convincing evidence that state protection would not be available to you, nor would it be reasonable for you to seek such protection.\n[30] Likewise, as the agent of persecution is the state and membership in PUDEMO has been criminalized across the country, I find that there would be no safe place for you anywhere in Swaziland where you would not face a risk of persecution because of your imputed political opinions. And your family, in terms of their association with somebody with a political opinion, real or imputed. As the test for an internai flight alternative fails on the first prong, I find there is no viable IFA or internal flight alternative for you anywhere in Swaziland or Eswatini.\n[31] Based on the totality of the evidence, I find the claimants to be Convention refugees. Your claims are therefore accepted. So this will conclude today\u2019s hearing.\n[32] I would like to thank everyone for their participation. Thank you, Mr. Interpreter, and thank you counsel, and thank you sir. Counsel, l\u2019m going to ask that you explain this to the associated claimant and remind her that a copy of this decision will corne in the mail to remedy any issue caused by her not being present for this decision.\n\u2014 DECISION CONCLUDED \u2014\n\n",

They have claimed refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).1\nDesignated Representative\n[2] At the time of the hearing, the minor claimants [XXX] and [XXX] were minors. As the principal claimant is their father, the panel designated him as their representative. At the start of the hearing, the principal claimant confirmed his role as the designated representative and his responsibilities therein.\n[3] Given their ages, the panel did not require the minor claimants to testify during the hearing.\nALLEGATIONS\n[4] The claimants\u2019 allegations are set out in full in their Basis of Claim (BOC) forms.2 The claimants allege that they are being persecuted due to the male claimant\u2019s work as [XXX] for a NGO that [XXX] of politicians.\n[5] The male claimant claimed to have become involved with the [XXX]. As part of his work, he investigated a number of prominent politicians and after reporting discrepancies in their [XXX], testified he became a target.\n[6] The claimant indicated that he was kidnapped, brought to a rural village, and severely beaten, and was threatened with further harm.\n[7] The claimants left Sri Lanka on [XXX], 2018. The principal claimant\u2019s mother testified that the police have come to their house repeatedly and asked about the claimants.\nDETERMINATION\n[8] The panel concludes that the claimants are persons in need of protection due to a risk to their lives.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[9] The panel was provided with true copies of valid passports and birth certificates from Sri Lanka for all claimants.3\n[10] The panel finds that these documents and the testimony of the claimants are sufficient to establish their identities on a balance of probabilities.\nNexus\n[11] The claimants are Sinhalese, Buddhist, and speak the Sinhala language, in common with the majority of the country.\n[12] The claimant indicated that he was being targeted due to his political affiliation with [XXX] political party, the National Unity Alliance. The male claimant was asked what party symbol appeared on ballots next to the party name, a traditionally important symbol in Sri Lankan politics.\n[13] The claimant indicated he did not know. When it was put to him that it traditionally used an image of eyeglasses, the claimant was candid with the panel that he was not heavily involved in the political side of the foundation, and did not regularly vote.\n[14] The panel finds it unlikely that the male claimant would be imputed as a supporter of a political movement he had next to no involvement in. Given the male claimant\u2019s clear testimony on the matter, the panel did not draw a negative inference with regard to his credibility.\n[15] Taking in to account the claimant\u2019s BOC narrative and his testimony, the reason his agents of persecution are targeting him relies on his performance of accounting duties with [XXX] and his probable reporting of crimes and regulatory offences. It is not because of his political beliefs. The panel finds that the male claimant was not politically involved in Sri Lanka, and finds that there is not a nexus connection to the Convention on the ground of political belief. This also means that the other claimants are not members of a particular social group as family members of the male claimant.\n[16] The panel finds that the claimants have not established a nexus to the convention. The panel must find that the claimants are not Convention refugees. The panel will continue its analysis regarding Section 97(1) of IRPA.\nCredibility\n[17] The panel found both adult claimants to be generally credible in their testimony. They answered questions clearly and completely, were spontaneous, and did not seem calculating in their responses. The claimants also provided considerable corroborating documentary evidence, including affidavits from family members, medical notes, and letters from the organizations the male claimant was a member of.\n[18] The panel accepts that the male claimant worked as an [XXX], that he was abducted and beaten by the police as described, and that the other claimants were threatened due to his actions.\nObjective Basis\n[19] The panel also considered objective evidence contained in the National Documentation Package, which noted that police in Sri Lanka are notorious for being able, despite legal guidelines, to arbitrarily detain and question suspects.4 The panel finds that, given the local police and other thugs have been after the claimants, the claimants have credibly indicated that the claimants have been targeted by the agents of persecution and are being pursued and face a risk to their lives.\n[20] Given the specific targeting of the claimants due to the male claimant\u2019s accounting of funds of specific politicians, the panel finds that this would not be a risk generally faced by others, and is not inherent or incidental to lawful sanctions.\n[21] The panel finds that the claimants have established an objective basis for their claim, and finds that they fear, on a balance of probabilities, a risk to their lives or of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if detained.\nSTATE PROTECTION\n[22] The state is presumed able to provide adequate protection to its citizens. Therefore, claimants have the duty to seek state protection before seeking protection in Canada. However, in certain circumstances, it would be objectively unreasonable to expect a claimant to do so. Furthermore, the protection available to a claimant may not be adequate given their specific circumstances.\n[23] The claimants testified that the local police were targeting them, and that they feared going to authorities due to them being targeted by politicians. This is corroborated by objective evidence, which notes that witness protection regimes in Sri Lanka are not considered viable or up to international standards, and are prone to abuse.5\n[24] The panel finds that the claimants have rebutted the presumption regarding adequate state protection existing in Sri Lanka.\nInternal Flight Alternative (IFA)\n[25] The panel finds the claimants have credibly established that the agents of persecution have the ability to track the claimants, given that they have effective control over the entire country, and finds that there is no IFA for the claimants in the entirety of Sri Lanka due to a risk to the claimant\u2019s life existing, on a balance of probabilities, throughout Sri Lanka.\nCONCLUSION\n[26] The panel finds that the claimants, on a balance of probabilities, face a threat to their lives if they were to return to Sri Lanka and are persons in need of protection.\n[27] Their claims are accepted.\n(signed) Tyler Nicholson\nJune 19, 2020\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27, as amended, sections 96 and 97(1).\n2 Exhibits 2-5.\n3 Exhibit 8, pp. 73-89.\n4 Exhibit 3, 1.4 at 8.2.4\n5 Exhibit 3, 1.4 at 6.6.4, 1.9 at 5.12.\n\n",

Hogarth\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Ian D Hamilton\nCountry: India\nRPD Number: TB8-27230\nATIP Number: A-2021-00540\nATIP Pages: 000118-0000123\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] [XXX] is a citizen of India. He claims refugee protection under sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).1\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] The claimant alleges the following.\n[3] The claimant was in a secret homosexual relationship with [XXX] from [XXX], 2013 until he left India in [XXX] 2018.\n[4] The claimant is afraid to return to India because the police learned of his homosexuality and informed his wife. She stated she would divorce him.\n[5] The claimant further fears returning to India because members of a political party want to kill him because he did not leave the ADMK party. The claimant fled to Malaysia in 2014 and worked there for two years. He returned to his village in [XXX] 2016 when he thought he would be safe.\n[6] In [XXX] 2016, the ADMK leadership asked him to begin recruiting new members as it was safe for him to work for the party. When the head of the ADMK died, the party split into two different groups. The claimant worked for one faction. [XXX], a member of the other faction, disrupted the claimant\u2019s meeting and when the claimant refused to disband the meeting, he was hit on the head with a bat. [XXX] threatened his life and left.\n[7] The claimant moved to Ootty and worked there from [XXX] 2018 until [XXX] 2018. On [XXX], 2018, the police visited the claimant\u2019s home looking for him. When he returned he was to go to the police station because [XXX] told the police that the claimant threatened his life and the police wanted to question him. The claimant\u2019s wife advised the claimant not to return home as it was not safe.\n[8] The claimant found an agent who arranged a visa and the trip to Canada where he could ask for refugee protection.\n[9] The claimant left on [XXX], 2018 and claimed refugee protection on October 26, 2018.\n[10] After the claimant was in Canada, his friend [XXX], his secret gay lover in India, spoke out at a political meeting criticizing the party for abusing the claimant. [XXX] was arrested on [XXX], 2018 for committing hate crimes against the public. The police seized [XXX] cell phone and found compromising photos of the claimant and [XXX] together.\n[11] The police informed the claimant\u2019s wife that her husband was engaged in homosexual activities and the police wanted to talk to him about it. The claimant left India to travel to Canada to make a claim for refugee protection on October 25, 2018.\nDETERMINATION\n[12] The panel finds that the claimant is a Convention refugee according to section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[13] Before making its decision, the panel took into consideration the SOGIE guideline 9.2\nANALYSIS\n[14] The issues are credibility, state protection and internal flight alternative.\nIdentity\n[15] The claimant\u2019s identity as a citizen of India was established by his testimony and the certified copy of his passport, held by CBSA.3\nNexus\n[16] The claimant is afraid he will be killed by members of the splinter group of the ADMK party and he is afraid he will be harmed because he is a homosexual. The claim is based on political opinion and membership of a particular social group. Therefore, the claim will be assessed according to ss. 96 and 97(1) of IRPA.\n[17] The panel will analyze the claim for protection because the claimant is a homosexual.\nCredibility\n[18] The claimant testified that when he married his wife, he considered it a love marriage, not one that was arranged. However, he began to fantasize about having a sexual relationship with a man. When he met [XXX], they began a relationship that lasted until the claimant came to Canada. The claimant had to hide his true sexual orientation as, at that time, it was against the law. This law was changed on September 6, 2018.\n[19] The claimant did not have problems in India because of his sexual orientation. He never revealed that he was gay except to [XXX], his partner in 2013. He lived \u201cin the closet\u201d and continued his relationship with [XXX] in secrecy while he continued his married life. His wife did not learn of his sexual orientation until the claimant was in Canada. She no longer speaks to him and has moved the family to her father\u2019s home.\n[20] The claimant is afraid to go back to India and live his life as a gay man. The claimant testified that while living in Canada, he has learned that people accept his homosexuality and he can walk freely with his partner. He cannot do that if he returns to India.\n[21] The panel finds the claimant testified in a straight forward manner; there were no embellishments nor any attempts to exaggerate the allegations during the oral testimony. He testified that he does not consider himself bisexual; he is gay. He is only interested in men. The claimant noted that he has a partner whom he met when he was volunteering at the [XXX] 2019 Gay Pride Parade. They entered into a sexual relationship in [XXX] 2019 and have been together since then. His partner was at the hearing and acted as a witness. His partner\u2019s sworn testimony confirmed the evidence given by the claimant. Therefore, the panel accepts that the claimant is gay and is presently in a homosexual relationship and finds the claimant to be a credible witness.\n[22] The law made it legal to be a homosexual in India in late 2018, however, according to the evidence, the general public have not accepted such relationships. The documentary evidence4 states, \u201cLesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex (LGBTI) persons faced physical attacks, rape and blackmail. LGBTI groups reported they faced widespread societal discrimination and violence, particularly in rural areas\u2026\u201d Some police committed crimes against LGBTI persons and used the threat of arrest to coerce victims not to report the incidents. Further documentary evidence5 indicates that although a landmark decision was made by the Indian Supreme Court, the discrimination against people based on their sexual orientation has not ended. The Board\u2019s evidence6 indicates, \u201c[t]he attitude and behaviour of the police is one of the biggest barriers to queer person\u2019 access to the justice system in India\u201d. They suffer violence, abuse and harassment at the hands of police and police have refused to file complaints by queer persons. The panel finds that based on all of the evidence, the attitudes remain the same despite the change in the law. The laws might be in place and mechanisms of protection for homosexual persons, however, the panel finds that at this particular time they are not effective. Therefore, there is no state protection available and since the negative societal attitudes against homosexuals are prevalent throughout India there is no viable internal flight alternative available to the claimant at his particular time.\n[23] Therefore, the panel finds that based on the evidence, including counsel\u2019s submissions, the claimant would face a serious possibility of persecution throughout India.\nCONCLUSION\n[24] For the foregoing reasons, the panel concludes that the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to ss. 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[25] The Refugee Protection Division accepts his claim.\n(signed) Marlene D.M.

And the testimony is from the parents, the married couple in this family. The Board has also considered other relevant evidence in this case and is ready to render its decision orally. The claimants\u2019 a family, a mother, father, husband, wife and two sons. One of the sons, obviously the youngest is a minor. They are all citizens of Slovakia. And they have all made claims for refugee protection under Sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. Regarding the youngest son, his mother has been designated as the representative for him in this proceeding.\n[2] Regarding the determination of the claim of the youngest son, the Board has taken into consideration Guidelines regarding Child Refugees. Regarding the claim of the female claimant, that is the mother, the Board has taken into consideration the Chairperson \u2018s Gender Guidelines regarding all relevant factors such as social, cultural context in which the mother finds herself in respect to the issues of state protection. And the changing country conditions were examined with respect to the Gender Guidelines.\nAllegations\n[3] The specifics of the claim are stated in the mother\u2019 s, the adult female claimant\u2019 s narrative which is found in her Basis of Claim form (BOC). She and the claimants allege the following. They are citizens of Slovakia and their ethnicity is that of Roma. They have been harassed, discriminated, threatened with violence and in some cases, assaulted while living in Slovakia. They maintain that the security apparatus in particular the police do not protect them because of their discriminatory attitude towards the Roma community. The claimants left Slovakia on or about [XXX], 2018. And filed their application for refugee protection on or about October 14th, 2018.\nDetermination\n[4] The Board finds that the claimants are Convention refugees pursuant to Section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. The reasons are as follows.\nANALYSIS\n[5] The Board is concerned with the issues of credibility and state protection.\nIdentity and Credibility\n[6] The Board is satisfied with the claimants\u2019 personal identity as well as being citizens of Slovakia. And this is based on certified copies of their passports. In addition, the Board is satisfied with the claimants\u2019 ethnicity, that being Roma. It should be noted that the language that was used in today\u2019s proceedings and hearing was that of Roma.\n[7] Furthermore, regarding their identity the Board found the two claimants that testified, the parents, that their testimony regarding their ethnicity was trustworthy, credible. As such, the Board accepts that the claimants are indeed Roma.\n[8] Regarding the country conditions articles and reports that were filed in this proceeding, it does indicate, that is the country conditions articles and reports, do indicate that the Roma community is discriminated on a continuous basis. Simply put, the country condition articles, reports do substantiate the claimants\u2019 testimony and the allegations in their claim as to what they confronted. What other members of the Roma community confront on a daily basis.\n[9] I want to emphasize that the testimony, their brief testimony regarding the incidents that they confronted is substantiated in the country conditions articles. As such, the Board finds that the claimants do have a well\u00ad founded fear of persecution. I would also like to emphasize that the country conditions articles and reports, many of them are from independent reputable international human rights organizations as well as reports from agencies and departments from very well dis-, respected western democracies such as Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States of America.\n[10] From the particular incidents that the claimants testified to and mentioned in their narrative, I think it would be fair to say not one of the incidents alone would amount to persecution. However, put them all together I believe that they do amount to persecution. There, these incidents they testified to and more, and the country condition articles stated are continuous, widespread and yes, they do touch upon in my view core, some core human rights. It affects their education. And again it\u2019 s based on their ethnic-, ethnicity. It affects their employment. It affects their treatment regarding social services. Many of these discriminatory attitudes are actually perpetrated by official agents of the government, including the police. It\u2019s fair to say that this particular minority group as described in the country condition articles and reports are marginalized. Excluded from society in most of the spheres of normal daily life.\n[11] It is trite law that states that refugee law is forward-looking. If they return, would they be dis-, discriminated to the point of persecution. I\u2019ve already answered that question, yes. I\u2019m not going to go through the country condition articles, reports and, to any great detail. Because they all say the same. They state that there\u2019s continued societal discrimination and violence towards the Roma in Slovakia. And yes, as the claimants testified to, there are incidents in which the police are, how I would describe, a little too aggressive and violent towards this particular minority community.\n[12] The reports indicate that extremists, nationalists, what could possibly be described as neo-Nazi groups continue to hold events designated or designated, or designed to intimidate the minority groups, including the Roma by these far right groups. Organized anti-Roma gatherings and locations where tension between the Roma and non-Roma population exist. There\u2019s also indication that the Roma face discrimination not only regarding government services but also, to a certain extent, in the commercial sphere. That is indicate, indicate that employers in Slovakia refused to hire Roma. And what is alarming is the statistics regarding the unemployed in Roma. That is unemployment statistics for non-Roma compared to Roma. There\u2019s a stark difference. A significant difference which cannot be explained away by coincidence.\n[13] Now, the Board does acknowledge that there is some comments made that the Slo-, Slovak government has expressed a willingness to improve the treatment of the Roma. And that the government has made commitments to the European Union to make efforts to improve conditions of its minority citizens including, the Roma. However, the Federal Court of Canada has held on a number of occasions that good intentions alone do not protect or improve the plight of the Roma in Slovakia. Is not good, is not good enough.\n[14] There\u2019 s jurisprudence that states that having legislation that protects its citizens but not implemented at all or not adequately impie-, implemented while their citizens are being deprived of important rights, core rights, does not amount to adequate state protection. The Board finds that the Slu-, Slovak government at this time is unable to provide adequate state protection toits citizens of Roma ethnicity.\n[15] Simply put, the Board finds that the claimants have proved or rebutted the presumption of state protection with clear and convincing evidence.\n[16] Based on the previous statements, it\u2019 s clear that there is no viable IFA for these claimants as the discrimination against this minority group is widespread. And as noted, the Slovak government and the police at this time are not adequately protecting the Roma.\nCONCLUSION\n[17] Based on this brief analysis, the Board finds that the claimants are Convention refugees. And accepts their claims.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n",

The claimant, the principal claimant, [XXX], is a citizen of Nicaragua, her husband, [XXX], is a citizen of both Guatemala and Nicaragua. They claim refugee protection pursuant to Section 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[2] The allegations of the couple are contained in the Basis of Claim form narrative, I\u2019m going to briefly summarize those allegations.\n[3] After the couple were married, the, they lived in Guatemala. In Guatemala, in [XXX] 2016, the principal claimant was robbed at gunpoint, this was an extremely traumatic event for her. The couple decided to relocate to Nicaragua, which they did in 2017. In [XXX] 2018, the principal claimant and her husband both became involved in the demonstration against the Ortega regime. Not only were they involved in protest, the principal claimant also shared articles and videos on her Facebook page and also expressed her support of the opposition to the Ortega regime. She began to s-, receive suspicious anonymous phone calls in [XXX], mid, late [XXX] 2018. During these calls, at one point, she was called a traitor. She also began to receive threatening text through her phone. She was involved in protest on [XXX], in which people were, were shot at. She continued to receive threatening text messages and phone calls after the demonstration. [XXX], her husband, also participated in demonstrations in Managua and he too began to receive threatening text messages. The problems became more severe in the country and they began to look for a way to get out of the country. They applied to come to Canada as, as visitors, however, their applications were denied. They went into hiding. On [XXX], 2018, the principal claimant\u2019s sister received a notice for her and her husband to attend court the following day, accusing them of altering public order, participating in demonstrations and so on. The couple fled Nicaragua, travelled to Guatemala. However, the principal claimant was unwilling to remain in Guatemala, as she had been quite traumatized by the armed robbery that had occurred in 2016 and her presence in Guatemala was worsening her symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. So, the couple made their way to Canada, made a refugee claim upon their arrival and they\u2019re now fearful of returning to, to Nicaragua.\n[4] Having considered the totality of the evidence before me, the Panel finds that the principal claimant, again that\u2019s [XXX], has established that, that she is a Convention refugee pursuant to Section 96 of IRPA.\n[5] Her husband, [XXX], as a dual citizen, must establish a well-founded fear in both Nicaragua and Guatemala.\n[6] As he\u2019s provided no evidence to support any fear of returning to Guatemala, his claim fails.\n[7] The analysis of the claim is as follows.\n[8] First, with respect to their identities, the claimants\u2019 identities as citizens as, as the gentleman\u2019s dual citizen of Nicaragua and Guatemala, and [XXX] as a citizen of Nicaragua, was established by the documents on file, which include copies of their passports.\n[9] With respect to credibility, I have no significant concerns.\n[10] Firstly, I, I thought they were able to describe their involvement adequately in terms of the questions they were asked during the hearing and most significantly, there\u2019s a number of, of, I thought, quite strong documents to corroborate their allegations. These documents include photos taken at the demonstrations, they include copies of the threat letters they received, includes the two summons for the couple to appear in court, there are a number of corroborative statements provided by friends who were aware of their situation in Nicaragua. There\u2019s also a, a number of medical documents to corroborate [XXX] post-traumatic stress disorder diagnosis, as well as issues with anxiety and the documents indicate it\u2019 s, this is both from the robbery but it\u2019 s also her, her situation has been made more serious by the events that occurred in Nicaragua.\n[11] So, in, in consideration of both the oral and the written evidence, on a balance of probabilities, I accept their allegations as to what occurred to the couple in Nicaragua to be credible. Given that I accept the credibility of their allegations, the documents before me make it clear that there\u2019 s an objective basis to their fear of returning to Nicaragua. The government\u2019s response to the [XXX] 2018 protest has been quite severe, heavy-handed and many people have been killed and many more have been arrested and exiled.\n[12] I\u2019m just going to briefly look at the, the DOS report, that\u2019s Item 2.1 of the Nicaraguan Package. It notes that President Ortega ordered police and parapolice forces to put down with violence peaceful protests. The government\u2019 s excessive response included the use of lime, live ammunition and snipers. As of late [XXX] 2018, the conflict of less le-, had left at least 325 people dead, more than 2000 injured, hundreds of illegally detained and tortured and more than 52,000 exiled in neighboring countries. Beginning in [XXX] of that year, the government, the Ortega government, instituted a policy of exile, jail or death for anyone perceived as opposition. The document notes that human rights deteriorated significantly during 2018 and so on.\n[13] So, the, the documents make it clear that there\u2019s an objective basis to their fear of returning to Nicaragua now that they\u2019ve been labelled, involved in the protest, now that the authorities believe they\u2019re involved in the protest, they are in danger in Nicaragua. And clearly IFA and state protection is not a relevant issue, as it\u2019s the State that they are afraid of and there\u2019s no information that the State does not have complete control allo-, over and of, all of Nicaraguan territory.\n[14] So, for these reasons, I find the principal claimant, [XXX], to be a Convention refugee pursuant to Section 96 of IRPA.\n[15] As I stated at the outset of the decision over her husband as a dual citizen of Guatemala, he needs to establish that he has a well-founded fear of each country that he is a citizen of. He was asked if he had any reason to fear returning to Guatemala, he indicated that he has no reason to fear returning to Guatemala.\n[16] So, there\u2019s no evidence before me that the-, this gentleman has a well-founded fear of persecution in Guatemala or that there\u2019s a reason why he is a person in need of protection due to what might happen to him in Guatemala.\n[17] So, given there\u2019s an insufficient amount of evidence to find otherwise, I conclude that he is not a Convention refugee and he\u2019 s a person-, not a person in need of protection by virtue of his citizenship in Guatemala and a Jack of evidence that he would be persecuted or harmed in that country.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n",

I have considered your testimony and other evidence in the case and I\u2019m ready to render my decision orally.\n[2] You are claiming to be a citizen of Turkey and are claiming refugee protection pursuant to Section 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[3] I find that you are a Convention refugee for the following reasons.\n[4] For making this decision and in formulating questions for the hearing, I considered Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9 with regard to proceedings before the Immigration and Refuge-, Immigration and Refugee Board involving claims of sexual orientation and gender identity and expression.\n[5] You alleged the following. That you are a citizen of Turkey and that if you were to return, you will face persecution as a member in a particular social group which is your gender identity and sexual orientation. You alleged that there is no stat-, state protection for you or an internal flight alternative.\n[6] Your personal identity as a citizen of Turkey has been established by your oral testimony and supporting documents, including your passport and the national identification card. I find that, on the balance of probabilities, that identity and country of reference have been established.\n[7] I find that there is a link between your-, what you fear and one of the five Convention grounds, specifically particular social group, namely your gender identity. Therefore, I assessed your claim under Section 96.\n[8] In terms of your general credibility, I have found you to be a credible witness and I therefore believe what you have alleged in your oral testimony and in your Basis of Claim form. Your testimony was straightforward and was largely in keeping with your Basis of Claim form. And there are no significant inconsistencies or omissions that went to the heart of the claim.\n[9] I therefore find the following to be credible. That you are a num-, queer non-binary person facing persecution in Turkey due to your gender identity and sexual orientation. Your oral testimony today included details regarding your aware-, awareness that you were different from other people. And then discovering and exploring the label for your gender identity.\n[10] You also provided details regarding your relationships with women and non-binary people in Turkey and in Canada. And the everyday discrimination and physical and psychological violence you\u2019ve faced from the society in Turkey. You also provided details about your involvement with the LGBTQ+ organizations in Turkey and in Canada, such as being the [XXX] of the student group in Turkey. And the virus-, vari-, various involvement with groups in Toronto like the [XXX] and the [XXX].\n[11] You also provided documents in support of your testimony, that you are a queer non-binary person who has been active in LGBTQ+ communities in Turkey and in Canada. And a person who experienced violence and discriminations in Turkey. Those documents include letters of support from your friends in Turkey and in Toronto who have the knowledge of violent incidents you faced. As well as your active involvement and advocacy work for your communities. As well as letters of support from your roommates, former partner and current partner.\n[12] You\u2019ve also submitted letters from different LGBTQ+ focus organizations in Toronto and in Turkey, including the 519 and Supporting Our Youths, to name a few. You\u2019ve also submitted Facebook messages and posts.\n[13] Your testimony and the supporting documentation all establish that you are a queer non-binary person who has been experiencing violence in Turkey due to their sexual orientation and gender identity.\n[14] The objective documentation supports your allegation that individuals in your circumstance face human rights abuse. Although there is no law that criminalize LGBTQ+ communities but the provisions of law on offense against public morality, protection of family and unnatural sexual behaviour are used as a basis for abuse according to National Documentation Package dated March 29th, 2019, Item 2.1.\n[15] Bans on LGBTQ+ events by the State officials in recent years has demonstrated in-, and National Documentation Package, Item 2.7 show that the LGBTQ+ communities and their members face discrimination and violence bail-, based on their sexual orientation and gender identity. Information in both the National Documentation Package and the country condition package submitted by the counsel in Exhibit 6 all corroborate the heightened level of violence against the LGBTQ+ communities and their rights by the State authorities.\n[16] In particular, the package provided inform-, package from the counsel provided information on the oppression on the student activists for LGBTQ+ rights, as well as the violence faced by transgender persons.\n[17] I therefore find that you have a well-founded fear of persecution. I find that adequate state protection would not be available to you if you were to seek it in Turkey. You testified that you never sought state protection because the State will be unwilling to protect you. And because the police were also the ones harassing you and targeting you. This is corroborated by the objective documentern-, documentary evidence. The objective documentary evidence indicates that in National Documenta-, Documentation Package, Item 1.14, that the government is unable or unwilling to protect vulnerable LGBTQ+ people from violence and discrimination.\n[18] Impunity for crimes against LGBTQ+ individuals continue to be reported as a problem. That according to NDP 21-, 2.1 there\u2019s no state-, there\u2019s no protection based on sexual orientation or gender identity on the criminal code. In light of the objective country documentation, I find that the claimant has rebutted the presumption of state protection.\n[19] Based on your personal scan-, circumstances as well as the objective country documentation, I find that the adequate state protection will not be available to you as the State will be unwilling and unable to protect you in Turkey.\n[20] As you have rebutted the presumption of state protection and since the country documentation indicates that the situation for individuals in circumstances suggests yours is the same throughout the country, I find that you do not have a viable internal flight alternative.\n[21] Based on the totality of evidence, I find that you have established that there is a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground, namely your membership in a particular social group as a queer non\u00adbinary person.\n[22] I therefore find that you are a Convention refugee and I accept your claim.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n",

Riley\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Lisa Winter-Card\nCountry: Haiti\nRPD Number: TB8-23375\nAssociated RPD Number(s): TB8-23445, TB8-23446, TB8-23447\nATIP Number: A-2021-00540\nATIP Pages: 000103-0000106\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: These reasons will stand as the decision in this case. The reasons given orally today will be rendered into writing and the claimants and their lawyer will receive the written version, within a matter of weeks.\nAllegations\n[2] The claimants allege that they are citizens of Haiti.\n[3] The principal claimant, [XXX], was appointed designated representative for the minor claimants.\n[4] The principal claimant indicated that she was married to the father of the children, in 2004 and that serious abuse, including sexual assaults, began against her around 2007. The abuse continued up to her divorce in 2018, at which time the principal claimant and the minor claimants left Haiti.\n[5] The principal claimant has received indications that her former husband remains angry with her and intends to pursue her and cause harm to her.\n[6] The claimants state that the government of Haiti will not protect them and that there is no safe place for them anywhere in Haiti.\nIdentity\n[7] The claimants have provided their passports and their Haitian birth certificates. The panel is satisfied as to the Haitian citizenship and the persona) identities of the claimants.\nCredibility\n[8] The principal claimant\u2019 s testimony was straightforward and spontaneous and there was no inconsistency or contradictions between her Basis of Claim Form and her oral testimony.\n[9] The panel accepts the evidence of the principal claimant on the core issue of continued fear of domestic violence if she were to return to Haiti. The panel finds the evidence of the principal claimant to be credible and trustworthy.\nDocumentary Evidence\n[10] The evidence of the principal claimant was consistent with the objective evidence found in the National Documentation Package with respect to Haiti\u2019s treatment of the victims of domestic violence.\n[11] So, for instance, at Item 2.1 of the NDP, which is the annual report of the U.S. Department of State, it\u2019s indicated that domestic violence in Haiti, domestic violence against women in Haiti, is commonplace. It also states that, victims of sexual violence face major obstacles in seeking justice.\n[12] At Item 5.12 of the NDP, we have a report from the French office that deals with refugees. It quotes the Haitian Prime Minister, in 2015, as saying, in respect of a rape accusation against a prominent politician, that:\n\u201cRape is a private matter and of interest only to the complainant.\u201d\nIt goes on to say that:\n\u201cDomestic violence is commonplace, tolerated and hidden from view.\u201d\n[13] Item 5.13 of the NDP is a report on domestic violence in Haiti. The report reminds us that violence based on gender is recognized throughout the world as a violation of a fundamental human right and at page 9 of that report, it indicates that only 11% of Haitian women involved in domestic violence had tried to contact police.\n[14] This is an illustration of the lack of confidence that Haitian women have in the police of Haiti to give them any kind of help.\n[15] The claimant was not in a position to provide any medical evidence as to abuse but the panel noted the e-mail from the claimant\u2019s former husband, found at page 5 of Exhibit 5. The panel had reference to the translation found at page 4 of that exhibit and the panel notes that the ex-husband admits to sexual assault of his then wife and he provides the following justification:\n\u201cIt was better for him to sexually assault his spouse than to cheat on her.\u201d\n[16] The panel also notes the testimonials from persons in Haiti who knew both the husband and the wife and it\u2019 s obvious that the former husband was very quick to anger when one reads pages 7 and 9 of Exhibit 5.\n[17] So, all in all, there\u2019s a harmony which reflects the allegations found in the Basis of Claim Form and the documentary evidence. The documentary evidence supports the allegations made by the principal claimant and reinforces her credibility.\nState Protection\n[18] Given the documentary evidence on domestic violence in Haiti, the panel is satisfied that it would not be reasonable for the principal claimant to ask the State of Haiti for protection.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[19] The principal claimant testified that, no matter where she settled in Haiti, her former husband still had the intention to pursue her and cause her harm, no matter where she would be in Haiti.\n[20] The panel is satisfied that the documentary evidence indicates that the government of Haiti has no interest in protecting its female citizens, throughout of all of its territory.\n[21] The panel concludes that it would not be reasonable for the principal claimant to seek an internal flight alternative, in Haiti.\nConclusion\n[22] Having considered all of the evidence, the panel determines that the claimant, [XXX], has satisfied her burden of establishing that there is a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground if she were to return to Haiti.\n[23] The panel, therefore, concludes that the claimant, [XXX], is a Convention refugee and the Division accepts her claim.\n[24] With respect to the minor children, the principal claimant was honest in admitting that they had not faced violence before and that the likelihood of abuse at the hands of their father was too remote for them to seriously claim protection in Canada.\n[25] No evidence was advanced to suggest that the minor claimants are at risk for a Convention reason, if they return to Haiti.\n[26] The panel is confident that the principal claimant will apply for permanent residence and include her children in such application\n[27] The minor claimants, [XXX], [XXX] and [XXX], are not Convention refugees and are not persons in need of protection and the Division rejects their claims.\n[28] I wish you the very best in the future, Madame.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n",

Marcovitch\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): James Stephen Schmidt\nCountry: Guatemala\nRPD Number: TB8-20434\nAssociated RPD Number(s): TB8-23370\nATIP Number: A-2021-00540\nATIP Pages: 000097-0000102\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] The claimants, [XXX] (the \u201cprincipal claimant\u201d or \u201cPC\u201d) and [XXX] (the \u201cassociated claimant\u201d or \u201cAC\u201d), (collectively, the \u201cclaimants\u201d) claim refugee protection as against Guatemala pursuant to s.96 and s.97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (\u201cIRPA\u201d).1\n[2] The claims were joined pursuant to Rule 55 of the RPD Rules.\n[3] In deciding these claims, I have considered the Guidelines on Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution.2\nALLEGATIONS\n[4] The allegations of the claimants are set out in their respective BOC forms.3\n[5] In summary, on [XXX], 2018, the PC was forcibly taken off the street by members of the local Mara 18 gang and into an abandoned lot and sexually assaulted. Afterwards a neighbour found her and brought her home. The AC insisted that she and the PC go to file a report on the assault with the police. The PC received a medical evaluation which confirmed the sexual assault.\n[6] The gang members learned that the PC filed a report about the sexual assault and called and threatened both her and the AC to withdraw the complaint. The PC and AC moved to a nephew\/cousin\u2019s home about 200km away, however, the claimants were eventually found there too. As a result of the negative attention, the nephew\/cousin asked the claimants to leave his home because he was now in danger.\n[7] The claimant left Guatemala for the USA on [XXX], 2018, where they stayed with AC\u2019s sister\/PC\u2019s aunt. The AC had a [XXX] related health emergency while in the USA and then the AC\u2019s sister asked them to leave because she could financially support them, so the claimants did not leave for Canada until August 2018. The AC still had a valid Canadian visa (from previously visiting a daughter in Ontario) so she crossed the border on August 18, 2018. The PC travelled to Canada on August 22, 2018 after having booked a border appointment through Vive la Casa.\nDETERMINATION\n[8] I find that the claimants are Convention refugees as they would face a serious possibility of persecution at the hands of the Mara 18 gang based on their membership in a particular social group, namely women who are victims of gender violence.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[9] The claimants\u2019 have established their identities, on a balance of probabilities, based on their testimony as well as the certified true copy of the claimants\u2019 Guatemalan passports, all on file and which were forwarded to the Board by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada.4\nNexus\n[10] I find that the principal claimant has established a nexus to the Convention by virtue of her membership in a particular social group, namely, female victim of gender violence. I find that the AC has established a nexus to a Convention ground on the basis of her membership in the particular social group of family, through the PC\u2019s allegations.\nCredibility\n[11] The onus rests on the claimants to establish their allegations on a balance of probabilities. In this regard, it is well-established that a claimant\u2019s sworn testimony is presumed to be truthful, unless there are valid reasons to doubt the claimant\u2019s truthfulness.5 Moreover, a claimant\u2019s allegations must be proven on a balance of probabilities only.\n[12] The principal claimant testified credibly with respect to the sexual assault and attempt to get state protection. I also find that the claimants were credible with respect to their testimony regarding being found by Mara-18 approximately 200km\u2019s away from their home. While I find that there has been some embellishment regarding details around whether the Mara 18 members surrounded their nephew\/cousin\u2019s home, it is not enough to take a negative inference as to the entirety of the claim.\n[13] The claimants provided some documentary evidence in support of their allegations, including documentation from the Police, the Public Ministry and Prosecutor\u2019s Office in Guatemala, as well as forensic medical and psychological reports.6 The claimants also provided support letters from family members and neighbours.7\n[14] These documents support the claimants\u2019 allegation that the PC was sexually assaulted and that both claimants\u2019 lives were threatened and reported to the police and the Public Ministry and Prosecutor\u2019s Office. The panel notes that there were some inconsistencies with the principal claimant\u2019s testimony; however, after considering the entirety of the evidence, the panel has accepted the claimants\u2019 allegations on a balance of probabilities.\nState Protection\n[15] The documentary evidence on country conditions establishes that criminal gangs like the Mara 18 are powerful, deadly, and out of control in Guatemala and that they are active in extortion and violent criminal gang activity in all parts of the country, such that Guatemala is in the midst of a criminal gang crisis.8\n[16] The country documents also establish that the Guatemalan police are corrupt and collude with gangs and are under-resourced and overwhelmed. From this perspective, the police are therefore both unwilling and unable to provide adequate protection to persons, and particularly women, fearing such gangs at the operational level. I find that the PC (as well as the AC) have approached authorities on numerous occasions seeking protection. I therefore accept that the claimants did not receive adequate assistance. Therefore, I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimants would not receive adequate state protection on a forward-looking basis should they return to Guatemala and require protection.\n[17] Therefore, based on country condition evidence and the claimants\u2019 credible allegations, I find that the claimants face a serious, ongoing possibility of persecution at the hands of the Mara- 18 if they were to return to Guatemala.\n[18] As previously noted, I am satisfied that the risk is probable no matter where they go in Guatemala. Guatemala is a small country and the documents indicate that criminal gangs like the Mara-18 are active everywhere in Guatemala and they could, on a balance of probabilities, track the claimants down\/find out their past history no matter where they attempted to hide.\n[19] I therefore find that a viable internal flight alternative is not available to them.\nCONCLUSION\n[20] I therefore conclude that the claimants are Convention refugees under s.96 of the IRPA and their claims are accepted.\n(signed) D.

Mortazavi\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Vino Shanmuganathan\nCountry: Venezuela\nRPD Number: TB8-00045\nATIP Number: A-2021-00540\nATIP Pages: 000090-000096\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] [XXX], the claimant, is a citizen of Venezuela. She is claiming refugee protection under sections 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (the IRPA).1\nNEXUS\n[2] The claim is based on political opinion, namely, political dissident.\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] The claimant\u2019s allegations are detailed in her Basis of Claim Form (BOC) narrative,2 and amended narratives.3\n[4] In summary, she alleged that she is a registered member of the Primera Justicia Party (PJC) of Venezuela. She had attended protest against the government of Nicolas Maduro calling for social and financial reforms.\n[5] The claimant stated that the PJC believed in democracy, social justice, solidarity, the rescue of human dignity, equal opportunities, and progress. At the time, the claimant supported Juan Pablo Guanipa for a gubernatorial election, who later became the first vice president of the National Assembly.\n[6] The claimant alleged that on [XXX], 2017, she was arrested, along with other protesters at a peaceful protest, detained, and interrogated by the Bolivarian National Police. Subsequently, she was further interrogated in [XXX] 2017, and threatened to pay extortion money to have her case dropped.\n[7] On [XXX], 2017, the claimant, who was in possession of a visitor visa for Canada, fled the country alone, while her husband remained behind, as he did not have a valid Canadian visitors visa. At a later date, unable to obtain a Canadian visa, her husband, who was also harassed, threatened, and subjected to extortion by the authorities after obtaining his passport through a bribe of an official, fled to Chile.\n[8] On December 12, 2017, the claimant sought asylum in Canada. The claimant alleged that she fears the government authorities and the Tupamaros, an armed group associated with the government, if she were to return to Venezuela.\nDETERMINATION\n[9] The panel finds that the claimant is a Convention refugee for the following reasons.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[10] The panel finds the claimant, on a balance of probabilities, is a citizen of Venezuela based on the copies of her original passport.4\n[11] The panel is satisfied that the claimant has no permanent status, either residency or citizenship, beside Venezuela.\nCredibility\n[12] Notwithstanding the issue of delay in claiming asylum in Canada, the panel finds that the claimant\u2019s evidence is internally consistent, inherently plausible, and is not contradicted by documentary evidence on country conditions in Venezuela and the personal documents submitted by the claimant. The panel therefore, finds her evidence credible, and that the allegations which form the basis of her subjective fear are, on a balance of probabilities, true.\nObjective evidence\n[13] Having considered the totality of the evidence and counsel\u2019s submissions, the panel finds that there is sufficient credible or trustworthy objective evidence before it to support the claimant\u2019s subjective fear.\n[14] The documentary evidence with respect to the current political climate in Venezuela, including freedom to protest and treatment of protesters at the hands of the authorities, indicated the following:\nVenezuela is formally a multiparty, constitutional republic, but for more than a decade, political power has been concentrated in a single party with an increasingly authoritarian executive exercising significant control over the legislative, judicial, citizens\u2019 power (which includes the prosecutor general and ombudsman), and electoral branches of government. On May 20, the government organized snap presidential elections that were neither free nor fair for the 2019- 25 presidential term. Nicolas Maduro was re-elected through this deeply flawed political process, which much of the opposition boycotted and the international community condemned.\n[\u2026 ]\nHuman rights issues included extrajudicial killings by security forces, including colectivos (government-sponsored armed groups); torture by security forces; harsh and life-threatening prison conditions; and political prisoners. The government restricted free expression and the press by routinely blocking signals, and interfering with the operations of, or shutting down, privately owned television, radio, and other media outlets. Libel, incitement, and inaccurate reporting were subject to criminal sanctions. The government used violence to repress peaceful demonstrations. Other issues included restrictions on political participation in the form of presidential elections in May that were not free or fair; pervasive corruption and impunity among all security forces and in other national and state government offices, including at the highest levels\u2026\n[\u2026]\n\u2026 There were continued reports of police abuse and involvement in crime, including illegal and arbitrary detentions, extrajudicial killings, kidnappings, and the excessive use of force. Impunity remained a serious problem in the security forces.\n[\u2026 ]\nIn some cases government authorities searched homes without judicial or other appropriate authorization, seized property without due process, or interfered in personal communications. [Special Actions Force] and other security forces regularly conducted indiscriminate household raids.5\n[15] Amnesty International reports that:\nAnti-government protesters and some opposition leaders were accused by the government of being a threat to national security.\n[\u2026 ]\nThe right to peaceful assembly was not guaranteed. According to official data, at least 120 people were killed and more than 1,177 wounded \u2013 including demonstrators, members of the security forces and bystanders \u2013 during these mass demonstrations.\nThere were also reports from the Attorney General\u2019s Office that groups of armed people with the support or acquiescence of the government carried out violent actions against demonstrators.\n[\u2026]\nHundreds of people reported that they were arbitrarily detained during the protests that took place between April and July. Many were denied access to medical care or a lawyer of their choice and in many cases were subjected to military tribunals. There was a notable increase in the use of military justice to try civilians.6\n[16] With respect to anti government Venezuelans returning from abroad, the documentary evidence indicates the following:\n\u2026 failed refugee claimants who return to Venezuela may face, among other things, the following consequences: not being able to find employment, having their passport cancelled or being imprisoned [translation] \u201cwithout a regular trial, since the judicial system is subordinate to the executive power\u201d\u2026 According to the same source, a person who opposes the government [translation] \u201cruns the risk of being imprisoned and even disappearing\u201d\u2026\n[\u2026]\nAccording to the same source, it is very difficult to obtain a passport from abroad, and the national identity card (c\u00e9dula), which is required \u201cfor everything,\u201d including obtaining a passport, is available only in Venezuela \u2026 Similarly, the coordinator from La voz de la diaspora venezolana indicated that the government does not allow Venezuelans in the diaspora to obtain identity documents, including national identity cards and passports\u20267 [footnotes omitted]\n[17] In view of the above, the panel finds that the claimant has established that there is more than a mere possibility of persecution should she return to Venezuela, on the grounds of her political opinion.\nState protection\n[18] The claimant must establish, through clear and convincing evidence, that the state would be unwilling or unable to provide adequate protection if she were to return to her home country, Venezuela.\n[19] The panel has taken into consideration the claimant\u2019s profile at the present time, an opponent of the government. The panel has taken into consideration that the claimant fears the Venezuelan authorities. In view of the above noted objective documentary evidence, the panel finds that there is clear and convincing evidence that state protection would be unavailable, as the state is the agent of persecution, if she were to return to Venezuela at the time of the hearing. The panel concludes that the presumption of state protection has been rebutted in this particular circumstance.\nInternal flight alternative\n[20] As the state is an agent of persecution, and the state authorities are in control throughout the country, there is more than a mere possibility of persecution in all parts of Venezuela. Thus, a viable internal flight alternative is currently not available to the claimant within Venezuela.\nCONCLUSION\n[21] The panel concludes that [XXX] is a Convention refugee. Thus, the panel need not analyze the refugee protection claim under section 97 of the IRPA.\n[22] The panel therefore accepts her claim.\n(signed) F.

Seevaratnam\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Teklemicheal A. Sahlemariam\nCountry: Ethiopia\nRPD Number: TB7-14076\nAssociated RPD Number(s): TB7-14126, TB7-14127\nATIP Number: A-2021-00540\nATIP Pages: 000076-000089\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] The principal claimant, [XXX] and her daughters, [XXX] and [XXX] (the minor claimants), claim to be citizens of Ethiopia and they are claiming protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA)1.\n[2] This matter is a hearing de nova referred back on November 18, 2019, by the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD), for redetermination by a differently constituted panel.2\n[3] The mother and principal claimant, [XXX], consented to be the designated representative for her minor daughters, [XXX] and [XXX], for the purposes of the hearing.\n[4] The principal claimant alleges that she fears returning to Ethiopia because of her perceived political opinion in opposition of the Ethiopian regime since she critiqued the government.3\n[5] The minor daughters allege they fear returning to Ethiopia due to their gender.4 They are being forced by the family members of their father, who are ethnic Gurages,5 to undergo female genital mutilation (FGM)6.\n[6] The panel has also carefully considered the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 4: Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution, prior to assessing the merits of this claim.7\nALLEGATIONS\n[7] In [XXX] 2016, the principal claimant voiced her criticism of the actions of the Ethiopian government at a meeting held at the Ethiopian consulate in Qatar. High level government officials were present including the Ambassador. The claimant explained that she opposed the killing of innocent civilians who were protesting peacefully. She further explained that she opposed the ethnic divisions among the Tigrayan, Oromo, and Amhara people that were exacerbated by government policies and action. In addition, she opposed the lack of religious freedom and tolerance by the government.\n[8] On [XXX], 2017, the principal claimant travelled to Ethiopia to visit her family during Easter. The principal claimant was arrested, detained, and interrogated upon arrival at the airport. The principal claimant and her daughters were terrified and feared for their lives. Ultimately, family members paid an exorbitant bribe for the claimant\u2019s release on the condition that she depart Ethiopia on a specific date authorized by the Ethiopian government and she was denied the right of return.\n[9] The principal claimant believes that there is no protection for persons who are critical of the Ethiopian government since political opposition is not tolerated. She fears re-arrest, detention, and even death since the security forces suspect her of being a political opponent of the government of Ethiopia.\n[10] The principal claimant further fears that if she is incarcerated by the security forces, her husband\u2019s family would have a larger influence and control over her daughters and subject them to FGM in keeping with their ethnic Gurages traditions. Thus, fearing for their safety, the claimants fled to Canada. The principal claimant testified that she had a strained marital relationship and her husband. He chose to remain in Qatar as a [XXX] and refused to join his wife and children in initiating a refugee claim in Canada. The principal claimant further testified that she and her husband have separated, but he consented to giving her sole custody of their minor daughters.8\n[11] In Canada, the principal claimant continues to participate in political activities such as demonstrations9 in opposition to the Ethiopian government actions and policies.10\nDETERMINATION\n[12] The panel finds the claimants to be Convention refugees. The panel\u2019s reasons are as follows.\nIDENTITY\n[13] The claimants submitted copies of their passports issued by the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, which was certified to be true copies by an Immigration Officer with Citizenship and Immigration Canada on July 24, 2017.11\n[14] The principal claimant also provided copies of the minor children\u2019s birth certificates,12 her Ethiopian identification card,13 her educational certificates,14 a letter of employment,15 letters of support from friends and family,16 letters from the Ethiopian community association in Qatar, a letter from the Unity for Human Rights and Democracy in Toronto,17 and photos of the principal claimant participating in protests against the Ethiopian government.18\n[15] The claimants have provided copies of their State of Qatar Residency Permits, which expired on [XXX], 2017.19 The principal claimant explained that their temporary resident status in the State of Qatar was dependent on the employment of the principal claimant\u2019s husband, [XXX], an Ethiopian national, who was employed on contract as a [XXX]. He was issued a residency permit by the State of Qatar.20 The principal claimant testified that they lived as a family unit in Qatar from 2013 until 2017 when there was a breakdown of their marital union. Accordingly, the principal claimant further explained that she and her daughters have no right of return or legal status in Qatar.\n[16] The panel is satisfied that the claimants do not have a right to nationality or permanent status in the State of Qatar. The panel finds that the claimants are citizens of Ethiopia.\nCREDIBILITY\n[17] The panel is guided by the leading jurisprudence on the issue of credibility. Maldonado stands for the principle that when a claimant \u201cswears to the truth of certain allegations, this creates a presumption that those allegations are true unless there be reason to doubt their truthfulness.\u201d21\n[18] The principal claimant responded to all questions clearly and directly. Her sworn viva voce evidence was consistent with her Basis of Claim form (BOC),22 her personal documents,23 letters of support from friends, family, and community organizations,24 as well as the documentary evidence.25\n[19] The principal claimant\u2019s brother, [XXX], provided a letter that corroborated the claimant\u2019s arrest in Ethiopia.26 Other Ethiopian nationals who were residents of Qatar, namely, [XXX]27 and [XXX]28 witnessed the claimant\u2019s criticism of the Ethiopian government and are cognizant of her arrest and harsh treatment by the Ethiopian authorities.\n[20] The panel finds the principal claimant to be a credible and trustworthy witness. Accordingly, she has established her own subjective fear of persecution and for her daughters.\nWELL-FOUNDED FEAR OF PERSECUTION\nImputed Political Opinion\n[21] The panel has carefully reviewed reputable, objective, and reliable sources in assessing the objective basis of this claim.\n[22] The Ethiopia. Freedom in the World 2020 Report, states in its overview that,\nEthiopia is undergoing a transition set off by the 2018 appointment of Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, who came to power after Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn resigned the face of mass protests at which demonstrators demanded greater political rights. Abiy has pledged to reform Ethiopia\u2019s authoritarian state, ruled by the Ethiopian People\u2019s Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) since 1991, and is in the process of rewriting the country\u2019s repressive electoral, terrorism, media, and other laws. However, Ethiopia remains beset by political factionalism and intercommunal violence, abuses by security forces and violations of due process are still common, and many restrictive laws remain in force. A major reorganization of the ruling party, growing conflict between ethnic communities, and new claims for self-determination have created a fluid political situation as the country prepares for elections in 2020.29\n[23] The United Kingdom Home Office Fact-Finding Mission. Ethiopia: The political situation report dated March 2020 states as follows:\nWe are trying to make people aware that they are being targeted due to bad politics and their ethnic background, simply for being Amhara. Abiy is not working in a way that he said he would. We had a team of brilliant lawyers who are representing Amhara prisoners of conscience at the courts. They challenged \u201cevidences\u201d by the police and government Attorneys. However, the problem is that the final decision is a political one and not a legal one. The farmers in different parts of Oromia were detained for at least 2 weeks, brought to court, the court investigated and ruled that they should be released with a 5,000 Birr bail. This is a lot of money. It is to discourage them economically, they cannot afford that, if they are arrested again.30\n[24] The United State. Department of State (DOS) Ethiopia 2019 Human Rights Country Reports indicates the following:\nSignificant human rights issues included: reports of unlawful or arbitrary killings by security forces; citizens killing other citizens based on their ethnicity; unexplained disappearances; arbitrary arrest and detention by security forces; harsh and life-threatening prison conditions; unlawful interference with privacy; censorship, and blocking of the internet and social media sites; criminalization of same-sex sexual conduct; and child labor, including the worst forms.31\n[25] The DOS report further states that:\nThere were numerous reports that the government and its representatives committed arbitrary and unlawful killings. Security forces used excessive force against civilians.32\nThe constitution and law prohibit arbitrary arrest and detention and provide for the right of any person to challenge the lawfulness of his or her arrest or detention in court. Authorities, however, detained persons arbitrarily, including activists, journalists, and opposition party members.33\n[26] According to a report by Human Rights Watch titled Ethiopia: Communications Shutdown Takes Heavy Toll indicates as follows:\n\u201cThe Ethiopian government\u2019s blanket shutdown of communications inOromia is taking a disproportionate toll on the population and should be lifted immediately,\u201d said Laetitia Bader, Horn of Africa director at Human Rights Watch. \u201cThe restrictions affect essential services, reporting on critical events, and human rights investigations, and could risk making an already bad humanitarian situation even worse.\u201d\nUnder Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed\u2019s administration, communication blackouts without government justifications has become routine during social and political unrest, Human Rights Watch said.\nA ruling party regional spokesman told the media in January that the communications shutdown had \u201cno relationship\u201d to the military operations but then said that it had contributed to the operation\u2019s success. The federal government offered no explanation for the shutdown until February 3, when Abiy told parliament that restrictions were in place in western Oromia for \u201csecurity reasons.\u201d34\nInstead of indefinite, blanket shutdowns and repressing peaceful dissent, Ethiopian authorities should use the media to provide transparent information that can discourage violence and direct security forces to act according to international human rights standards, Human Rights Watch said.\n\u201cThe lack of transparency and failure to explain these shutdowns only furthers the perception that they are meant to suppress public criticism of the government,\u201d Bader said. \u201cAmid ongoing unrest and ahead of critical national elections, the government should be seeking to maintain internet and phone communications to ease public safety concerns, not increase them.\u201d35\n[27] In its report titled Ethiopia: Political situation and treatment of opposition, the Danish Immigration Service states that:\n\u2026[M]embers of the diaspora community were, \u201cwithout doubt\u201d monitored closely by the government, wherever they might reside. This is, according to the interlocutor, no secret\u2026\nThe editor noted that if Ethiopians participate in demonstrations against the Ethiopian regime in a foreign country, be it in Europe or in the USA, would be video-taped to document their activity. This would also be the case if members of the diaspora had gotten foreign nationality. Thus they would fear that they were to return to Ethiopia then something might happen to them upon return. As examples of what might occur, Mr. Giorgis mentioned that they could run the risk of being detained in the airport or jailed.36\nFemale Genital Mutilation (FGM)\n[28] The United States Department of State (DOS) Ethiopia 2019 Human Rights Country Reports indicates the following indicates the following:\nFemale Genital Mutilation\/Cutting (FGM\/C): FGM\/C is illegal, with punishment including imprisonment and a fine, depending on the crime. The government did not actively enforce this prohibition. The 2016 DHS stated that 65 percent of girls and women ages 15-49 were subjected to FGM\/C. The prevalence of FGM\/C was highest in the Somali Region (99 percent) and lowest in the Tigray Region (23 percent). It was less common in urban areas. The law criminalizes the practice of clitoridectomy and provides for three months\u2019 imprisonment or a fine of at least 500 birr ($17) for perpetrators. Infibulation of the genitals (the most extreme and dangerous form of FGM\/C) is punishable by five to 10 years\u2019 imprisonment. According to government sources, there had never been a criminal charge regarding FGM\/C, but media reported limited application of the law.37\n[29] According to Ethiopia Social Institutions and Gender Index 2019, 65% of women in Ethiopia have undergone FGM.38\n[30] The principal claimant testified that she was also a victim of the traditional cultural practice, and she opposes her minor daughters being subject to this painful and dangerous practice.\n[31] The Gender Index 2019 further finds that,\nFGM rates have reduced significantly since 2000 for girls aged 0 to 14 years old (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2014). However, despite measures and efforts by the Government and the notable decrease of FGM amongst younger girls and in urban areas, the CEDAW Committee (2011) stresses that FGM is prevalent in rural and pastoralist areas. FGM is a practice embedded in social constructs on gender roles and values and is practiced by different communities in Ethiopia. Its prevalence and the age girls undergo FGM vary across regions and communities. One of the reasons invoked by some communities for the practice of FGM is the preservation of women\u2019 s chastity. It also occurs that parents encourage the practice as uncircumcised girls are likely to be marginalized and socially excluded in some communities, and would face difficulty to be married.39 [footnotes omitted]\n[32] Counsel\u2019s documentary evidence corroborates the principal claimant\u2019s sworn viva voce evidence that FMG is still practiced among several rural communities including the Gurages.40\n[33] Based on current country documentary evidence and the credible allegations, the panel finds that the claimant has a well-founded fear of persecution in Ethiopia, by reason of the principal claimant\u2019s perceived political opinion and the minor claimants\u2019 gender.\nSTATE PROTECTION\n[34] There is a presumption that except in situations where the state is in complete breakdown, the state is capable of protecting its citizens.41 To rebut the presumption of state protection, a claimant must provide clear and convincing evidence of the state\u2019s inability to protect its citizens.42\n[35] The National Documentation Package (NDP) for Ethiopia states that \u201c[w]here the person has a well-founded fear of persecution from the state, they are unlikely to be able to avail themselves of the protection of the authorities.\u201d43\n[36] According to the United Kingdom Home Office Fact-Finding Mission. Ethiopia: The political situation report dated March 2020,\nSeveral sources noted the effect of ethnic politics on regional security services. William Davidson observed \u201cThere are complicated federal dynamics at play, we are seeing increasingly assertive administrations in certain regions.\u201d Wondemagegn Goshu Addis Ababa University stated: \u201cAbiy has not consolidated the regional states and their militias, there are some political groups against Abiy and his reforms and this is showing at the regional level\u2026 You can see the danger that arises from certain ethnic groups against each other.\u201d44 [footnotes omitted]\n[37] The Report further indicates that \u201cInformation on the effectiveness of security services varied between some regions.\u201d45\n[38] In addition, the report cites, Wondemagegn Goshu, from Addis Ababa University,\nnoted that the central government did not have effective control over regional security forces and the senior officials of EZEMA noted that \u201c[t]he government does not have effective control over the local regional states. Wondemagegn Goshu and the Life and Peace Institute considered that regional areas had become increasingly assertive.46 [footnotes omitted]\n[39] In addition, the report finds that,\nThe people who were in power previously are still very much there, the very same people who were against the social revolution but when it became reality they are a part of it. What should have happened was more people should have faced justice. If they do not put people before a justice system, the government will lose all the reformation progress they have made. The reformation for the public was always about whether there was rule of law or not. So, if the law is for everyone, including the military and prime minster and the public, let everyone face justice.\nBut the government have not been proactive in this area, therefore it can be assumed by some that they are against the reformation. There is a lack of commitment from the government.\nThere has been a high number [level] of corruption. Human rights abusers are still in power, for example at all levels. The public demand they be brought to justice.47\n[40] The report discusses the extent to which the government has control over the security forces.\nThey have control but it in an issue of capacity especially security.\nThe intelligence and military in the past 90% was controlled by TPLF, Abiy purged them so quickly when he came to power, the change should have been more gradual and smarter. There has been no process put in place. This was a security that could not see members of the Army marching to the PM, they didn\u2019t see it coming they weren\u2019t prepared. We needed the structure. The alleged coup would never have happened under previous government.\nThere has been arise Amhara nationalism and militant groups is concerning. We haven\u2019t seen the security doing anything because of lack of intel \u2013 not looking at the issues properly, regional areas have become more assertive.48\n[41] The report further finds that,\nIn some cases of arrests or human rights abuses, police try to push their own agenda and avenge past crimes by abusing their power.\nWe hear about a lot of harassment from the police or security forces, which we think are genuine, but I do not think Abiy is involved in this. When it comes to rule of law, respecting human rights, respect for different languages etc, our culture is awful. There are definitely cases where individuals are arrested, beaten, refused to hold a press conference. The different groups fighting for their own status, for example the Amhara and Oromo.49\n[42] The DOS report states that \u201c[c]orruption, especially the solicitation of bribes, including police and judicial corruption, remained a problem.\u201d50 The report further finds that \u201c[t]he law provides criminal penalties for conviction of corruption. The government did not implement effectively or comprehensively.\u201d51\n[43] According to Ethiopia. Freedom in the World 2020,\nThe judiciary is officially independent, but in practice it is subject to political interference, and judgments rarely deviate from government policy. The November 2018 appointment of lawyer and civil society leader Meaza Ashenafi as president of the Supreme Court raised hopes for judicial reform, though no major improvements were registered in 2019.\u201d52\n[44] The 2020 Human Rights Watch report for Ethiopia indicates that:\nHuman rights reforms implemented by Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed during his first year in office were threatened in 2019 by communal, including ethnic, conflict and breakdowns in law and order.\nThe June 22 assassinations of several high-level government officials, which the government linked to an alleged coup attempt in the Amhara region \u2013 as well as political unrest and communal violence in the capital, Addis Ababa, and Oromia following an incident with a popular Oromo activist and media owner, Jawar Mohammed-highlighted increasing tensions ahead of Ethiopia\u2019 s scheduled 2020 national elections.53\n[45] Counsel\u2019 s most recent country condition package54 has a plethora of examples of human rights abuses by the Ethiopian security forces.\n[46] The principal claimant was arrested, detained, and interrogated by the Ethiopian security forces in Addis Ababa on [XXX], 2017.55 The claimant fears that she would be re\u00ad arrested, detained, and mistreated upon her return to Ethiopia. Given her previous arrest, the claimant would be perceived to be an opponent of the state, if she were to return to Ethiopia today.\n[47] The NDP for Ethiopia56 and the documents submitted by the claimant57 make clear that the state is the agent of persecution, and in these particular circumstances, is clear and convincing evidence that the state is unable or unwilling to protect the claimant.\n[48] Accordingly, the panel finds that the claimants have met the burden of proof, on a balance of probabilities, and the presumption of state protection has been rebutted.\nINTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE (IFA)\n[49] The Federal Court of Appeal established a two-part test for assessing an IFA in Rasaratnam and Thirunavukkarasu:\n(1) As per Rasaratnam, \u201cthe Board must be satisfied on a balance of probabilities that there is no serious possibility of the claimant being persecuted in the part of the country to which it finds an IFA exists\u201d58 and\/or the claimant would not be personally subject to a risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture in the IFA.\n(2) Moreover, the conditions in the part of the country considered to be an IFA must be such that it would not be unreasonable in all the circumstances including those particular to the claim, for him to seek refuge there.59\n[50] The claimants bear the burden of proof to demonstrate that they would be persecuted on a Convention ground, or subject personally, on a balance of probabilities, to a risk to life, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in all of Ethiopia.\n[51] The United Kingdom Home Office Report on Country Policy and Information Note: Ethiopia: Opposition to the Government cautions,\nThat decision makers must carefully consider the relevance and reasonableness of internal relocation taking full account of the individual circumstances of the particular person. However, where the person has a well-founded fear of persecution from the state, it is unlikely to be reasonable to expect them to relocate to escape that risk.60\n[52] It is evident that the Ethiopian security forces operate with impunity throughout the country. The documentary evidence corroborates the claimant\u2019s testimony that there is no state protection available to her since the state security forces are her agents of persecution. Regarding the minor claimants, their mother testified that FGM is practiced in the rural areas and there is no effective action by the government forces in prosecuting violations of the FGM prohibition act, As such, there is no safety for the claimants anywhere within Ethiopia.\n[53] The principal claimant is a single mother who is perceived as a political opponent by the Ethiopian regime with two minor daughters.

The adult claimants have little schooling; all of the children have been harassed by their teachers and bullied by fellow students. You had difficulty finding work. When employment opportunities arose you were not hired when the employer recognized you as Roma; or if you were hired, you were shortly fired for some unknown excuse.\n[6] Sir, you joined a political party that wanted equality for the Roma people. You visited their homes to see how everyone was doing and organized rallies trying to get equal rights. The Romanian citizens became violent and threatened to kill you if you did not stop the demonstrations and leave Romania. Several Roma were injured, including you. The incidents were reported to the authorities; however the police did not investigate.\n[7] You operated a [XXX] to keep yourself and your family fed. Ma\u2019am, you also worked there. You had to close the [XXX] after you were harassed on several occasions by Roman (sic) citizens and the police. They destroyed your [XXX] and stole your money. On one occasion your finger was badly ripped after an officer seized a vase. You reported these various incidents to the authorities; however you never received any help.\n[8] You decided the discrimination you endured was too much to take. You travelled to Germany and found work there. However you were verbally abused there and the minor, the younger children had difficulties with teachers and fellow classmates in school.\n[9] You decided to come to Canada to claim refugee protection. You arrived on [XXX], 2019 and made a claim on April 25th, 2019.\n[10] Your identities as Roma (sic) citizens has been established by your testimony and the certified copies of your passports held by Immigration Canada, found in Exhibit 1.\n[11] Credibility is always an issue in a refugee protection hearing. I found you were credible witnesses. Your answers were consistent with the documents and your narratives and evidence submitted in Exhibits 5 and 8. We also have country documents that support your allegations pertaining to the treatment that you received. These are all found in the Board\u2019s documentation package found in Exhibit 3. Therefore I believe the allegations that you have written in support of your claim.\n[12] You have suffered discrimination throughout your lives. Documentary evidence found in Exhibit 3, 2.1, states that Romania is a constitutional republic with a democratic multi party parliamentary system. However significant human rights issues included police violence against Roma, endemic official corruption, law enforcement and authorities condoning violence against women and girls. The judiciary did take steps to prosecute and punish officials who committed abuses but the authorities did not have effective mechanisms to do so and delayed proceedings involving alleged police abuse and corruption resulted in many of the cases ending in acquittals.\n[13] The same document continues; police officers were frequently exonerated in cases of alleged beatings or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. Discrimination against Roma continued to be a major problem. Romany groups complained that police harassment and brutality including beatings were routine.\n[14] Both domestic and international media observers reported societal discrimination against Roma. They were denied access to or refused service in many public places. Roma also experienced poor access to government services, a shortage of employment opportunities, high rates of school attrition, and inadequate health care. Roma have a higher unemployment rate and a lower life expectancy.\n[15] Now these things are all, all types of occurrences that you had to endure throughout your lives; difficulties finding employment, not continuing your schooling, and having difficulties with the health care, where you had to pay your own. As a matter of fact when you were having your children you had to pay the nurses to come into the room to help you. Even though there is an order by the Ministry of Education forbidding segregation of Romany students, Romany students were placed in segregated classrooms located in separate buildings.\n[16] And I just want to read just a couple of lines from Exhibit 3, 13.4. It states, \u201cThe World Bank report indicates that Roma in Romania are poor, vulnerable and socially excluded. They face systematic discrimination by society which affects them in the areas of education, housing, health and employment. It has been learned that government officials make discriminatory statements against Roma. The housing situation is grim; twice as many Roma live in houses made with poor quality material and they have less access to gas, running water, sewage and electricity.\u201d\n[17] As you mentioned in your testimony today, you lived in a two room house and a kitchen that had no running water and no electricity.\n[18] Now we know that there is a law that prohibits discrimination in Romania; however the government does not effectively enforce these prohibitions and Roma often experience discrimination and violence.\n[19] So taking into consideration ail of the evidence that I have in front of me and there are several documents in Exhibit 3 that agree with your testimony and allegations, so taking into account all of the evidence and the documents that show the various forms of discrimination, although the government is attempting to improve the situation with the Roma population discrimination in all forms continues to exist.\n[20] I find that this continued discrimination you have faced amounts to persecution. Therefore considering all of the evidence and your testimony I find that if you returned to Romania there is a serious possibility that you would continue to face persecution. And in your particular situation there is no state protection available for you; you have gone to the police with no results. And there is no Internal Flight Alternative.\n[21] Therefore I accept your claim. You are Convention refugees, according to Section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. Congratulations to you all. You can go home and tell your children and I wish you the best of luck. Thank you for coming and telling me your story. I know it\u2019s not an easy thing to do.\n[22] So thank you very much, Counsel, and everybody have a good day.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n",

        "unofficial_text":"2020 RLLR 10\n\nCitation: 2020 RLLR 10\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: September 29, 2020\nPanel: Ana Rico\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Md Wazir Hossain\nCountry: Bangladesh\nRPD Number: TB8-19236\nAssociated RPD Number(s): TB8-19239, TB8-19247, TB8-19248, TB8-19249\nATIP Number: A-2021-00540\nATIP Pages: 000066-000071\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] These are the reasons for decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) in the claim for protection filed by [XXX], [XXX], [XXX], [XXX], and [XXX] under sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[2] The Board appointed Mr. [XXX] as the designated representatives of the minor claimants.\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] The allegations are fully set out in the Basis of Claim forms (which can be found at exhibit 2.1-2.5). In short, the claimants allege that they face a risk to their life at the hands of Awami League and Communists cadres because they seek to extort them for [XXX]. If returned to Bangladesh, the claimants fear that they will be subjected to further assaults, kidnappings, and ultimately lose their lives.\nDETERMINATION\n[4] The panel determines that the claimants are persons in need of protection as they face a risk to their lives in Bangladesh because of extortion threats from criminal elements.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[5] The claimants\u2019 identities as nationals of Bangladesh are established, on a balance of probabilities, through the certified true copies of their passportsi, and other government issued documentsii that were submitted to the Board.\nNexus- Section 97(1) Claim\n[6] The panel finds, for the reasons outlined below, that the fear alleged by the claimants fall under section 97(1) of the IRPA and has assessed it as such. Though the claimants are targeted by a politically motivated organization, the reasons for them being targeted is not tied to a Convention ground. The claimants indicate in their evidence that they are targeted because of their wealth, and social standing. While the claimant believes that the targeting may also be tied to a future political bid, the claimant indicated that he had no aspirations for politics. Moreover, in none of the incidents of persecution do the persecutors allude to any political reasons for targeting the claimants. It is clear in the agent of persecutions\u2019 threats and actions that the reasons for targeting the claimants is tied to their wealth. A person\u2019s socioeconomic status is not an innate or immutable characteristic as contemplated by the ground of membership in a particular social group. Given that the claimants are targeted because of their wealth, the panel finds that they have failed to establish a nexus to a Convention ground.\nCredibility\n[7] Testimony given under oath is presumed to be true unless there are reasons to doubt its veracity. The claimants have given the panel no valid reasons to doubt the veracity of their evidence. There were no significant, unexplained inconsistencies, implausibilities or omissions from the principal claimant\u2019s testimony. The principal claimant appeared to testify in a spontaneous and forthright manner.\n[8] The principal claimant provided realistic detail about the incidents of persecution that remained largely consistent with his Basis of Claim and other evidence contained in the record. The claimant provided significant detailed testimony concerning the first extortion event, the kidnapping of his sons, as well as, the agent of persecutions ability to locate them after relocating within Bangladesh.\n[9] While the principal claimant\u2019s police report regarding the kidnapping of his son omitted the actual kidnapping, the panel finds the explanation given to be reasonable. It is entirely reasonable that the principal claimant would omit the kidnapping to shield the children from any greater violence, as he was threatened with death if he reported the kidnapping to the police. Given the threats made, and the police\u2019s past inability to protect, that the principal claimant would not provide these details to the police.\n[10] Overall, the principal claimants\u2019 evidence remained internally consistent and consistent with the other evidence in the record. Moreover, the allegations are well supported with a plethora of evidence whose authenticity the panel has no reasons to doubt. The corroborative evidenceiii, including police reports, witness statements, proof of sale of properties\/assets to pay ransoms, proof of hiding in Bangladesh, is persuasive evidence that the allegations are, on a balance, true.\n[11] For the reasons state above, the panel finds that the claimants claim is credible, and that they have established that the allegations are true on a balance of probabilities.\nPersonalized Risk to Life\n[12] The panel must consider whether the claimants face a personalized risk to their life that is not faced generally by others in Bangladesh. The panel finds, for the reasons outlined below, that the claimants face a personalized risk to their life in Bangladesh. While kidnappings and extortion of wealthy persons is commonly faced by citizens in Bangladesh, the specific and repeatedly increased violent targeting of the claimants escalated the risk from that faced by others generally in the country to that of a personalized targeting of the family. It is evident from the claimants\u2019 evidence that the targeting escalated from extortion threats, to threats of violence, to kidnappings. The steady increase of violence meted against the claimants, as well as the agent of persecutions pursuing the claimants to other parts of Bangladesh, clearly demonstrates that the targeting, and ultimately risk to the claimants\u2019 lives, was very personal in nature. As such, the claimants face a personalized risk to their lives that this not face generally by others in Bangladesh.\nState Protection\n[1] There is a presumption that States can protect its own citizens; however, it is open for a claimant to rebut this presumption with clear and convincing evidence of an unwillingness or inability of the State to protect them.\n[13] In the present case, the claimant sought state protection on four occasions. The claimants\u2019 actions of seeking state protection is corroborated by the General Diaries contained in the record.iv While the police did record the claimant\u2019s recounting of the incidents, the police did not investigate further, nor did they offer the claimants any protection, despite promising to take steps to follow up. Despite the claimants\u2019 repeated attempts to follow up regarding the open investigation, the police failed to respond or provide any concrete information as to the state of the open investigations. The claimants above described personal experiences demonstrate that the police failed to provide adequate state protection to the claimants.\n[14] The objective documentary evidence also demonstrates that, in this case, state protection at an operational level remains inadequate. The National Document Package for Bangladesh contains many reports of extortion, kidnappings, and threats made by Awami League cadres, and their counterparts. The NDP for Bangladesh also highlights that the crimes go largely unpunished, and under-reported. There are reports of impunity for crimes committed by Awami League cadres, and their supporters. There are also instances in which the police collaborate with Awami League cadres to perpetuate these very same crimes against citizens in Bangladesh.v\n[15] Given the claimants\u2019 own experiences with the police, and the level of impunity documented in the objective evidence, the panel finds that there is no adequate state protection for the claimants in Bangladesh at this time.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[16] As the agent of persecution is active throughout Bangladesh and has located the claimants even after relocating within Bangladesh, the panel finds that there is no viable internal flight alternative for the claimants.\nCONCLUSION\n[17] Based on the totality of the evidence, the panel concludes that the claimants are persons in need of protection. The panel accepts their claims.\n(signed) Ana Rico\nSeptember 29, 2020\ni Exhibit 1.\nii Exhibit 6; items 1.1-1.4.\niii Exhibits 6 and 7.\niv Exhibit 6, items 8.1-8.2, and items 9.1-9.2.\nv Exhibit 3, National Document Package for Bangladesh, March 32, 2020, tab 2.1, tab 2.3, 2.7, and 2.9.\n\n",

        "unofficial_text":"2020 RLLR 9\n\nCitation: 2020 RLLR 9\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: September 22, 2020\nPanel: Linda Doutre\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Me Jessica Lipes\nCountry: Palestine\nRPD Number: MB9-20414\nATIP Number: A-2021-00540\nATIP Pages: 000060-000065\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] The refugee protection claimant, [XXX], is a citizen of Palestine (Occupied Palestinian Territories), specifically living in the Gaza Strip. He is claiming refugee protection under section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] The claimant fears Hamas. He lived in the Gaza Strip and was the subject of false accusations made by Hamas. In addition to the insecurity in the region, his apartment was destroyed in the war. Because of that group, the claimant stopped going to the mosque. There is no freedom of expression there, and he does not subscribe to their way of practising Islam.\n[3] The claimant\u2019s problems began in 2008, when he was dating a girl who had brothers in Hamas.\n[4] In [XXX] 2010, the brothers found out about their relationship and disapproved of it. That was when the claimant\u2019s problems began. His girlfriend\u2019s brothers tried to keep her and the claimant from seeing each other. However, one year later, they continued to be in touch with each other.\n[5] In [XXX] 2012, the claimant received a notice to appear from the police in relation to accusations of illicit relations with women in the community. His girlfriend\u2019s brothers were behind the accusations. The claimant was released.\n[6] On [XXX], 2012, some men attacked the claimant after he was tricked by one of his girlfriend\u2019s brothers.\n[7] Because of the constant harassment, the claimant stopped speaking to his girlfriend.\n[8] In [XXX] 2016, he received a call from his ex-girlfriend, who told him that she still loved him and that she did not want to marry the man that her parents had introduced her to.\n[9] Her brothers held this against him and blamed him for the breakdown of their sister\u2019 s marriage.\n[10] On [XXX], 2016, the claimant received a notice to appear from the police, in which he was accused of trying to turn his ex-girlfriend against her family. He was released and went to the hospital to receive treatment.\n[11] On [XXX], 2017, the claimant had to report to the police station, where several accusations were discussed. He began to consider fleeing the country.\n[12] In [XXX] 2017, he applied for a Chinese visa. He was granted the visa, but he realized that Hamas had forbidden him from leaving the country.\n[13] On [XXX], 2018, the claimant was attacked. He managed to flee Gaza via Egypt with the help of an uncle.\n[14] He took steps to obtain a Chinese visa. However, in order to obtain the document, he had to apply for it in Gaza, which forced him to go back. He was arrested upon his arrival in Gaza.\n[15] The claimant then obtained his Chinese visa and again fled with the help of his uncle.\nDETERMINATION\n[16] Having analyzed all the evidence on the record, the panel determines that the claimant is a \u201cConvention refugee\u201d under section 96 of the IRPA by reason of his imputed political opinion and religion.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[17] The panel is satisfied as to the claimant\u2019s identity, which was established by means of the photocopy of the travel document he was issued by the Palestinian authorities1 and his testimony.\nCredibility\n[18] The claimant testified relatively well at the hearing. His testimony was spontaneous and forthright. He explained the reasons for his problems with his ex-girlfriend\u2019s brothers. Relationships between men and women are difficult to maintain in Palestine. He gave a good account of the problems that this caused him. He clearly explained the situation he would find himself in if he returned to the Gaza Strip. He made several clarifications for the panel and did not seek to embellish his story. No contradictions were noted between the testimony he gave at the hearing, the statements he made to the immigration authorities, and the documents he filed. The panel is of the opinion that the claimant\u2019s testimony was credible.\n[19] Furthermore, the documentary evidence, including that contained in the package on the Occupied Territories2 and the documents filed by the claimant, namely, the medical certificates,3 notices to appear issued by the authorities4 and emails,5 and the objective documentation on the Islamist radicalization of Gaza and honour crimes,6 corroborate the claimant\u2019s allegations:\n2.1\nIn Gaza the terrorist organization Hamas exercised de facto authority. The security apparatus of the Hamas de facto government in Gaza largely mirrored the West Bank. [\u2026 ] In some instances the Hamas de facto \u201ccivilian\u201d authorities utilized the Hamas movement\u2019 s military wing to crack clown on internal dissent.7\n4.8\nHamas\u2019 primary base of operation is in the Gaza Strip, the coastal enclave of 1.7 million Palestinians, where it has remained the de facto authority since shortly after Israel\u2019s unilateral withdrawal in 2005.8\nState protection\n[20] The claimant sought to obtain the help of a lawyer to defend himself against the state, to no avail. Given that the agents of persecution are also potentially members of the security forces, it is understandable that the claimant had difficulty obtaining state protection:\n2.1\nWith respect to Hamas: reports of unlawful or arbitrary killings, systematic torture, and arbitrary detention by Hamas officials; political prisoners; arbitrary or unlawful interference with privacy; restrictions on free expression, the press, and the internet, including violence, threats of violence, \u20269\n[21] Considering the evidence in this case, the panel is of the opinion that the claimant would be unable to obtain assistance from the authorities, and therefore concludes that the state would be unable to provide him with adequate protection.\nInternal flight alternative\n[22] The panel assessed whether a viable internal flight alternative is available to the claimant, that is, whether there is another part of the country where he would not face a reasonable fear of persecution; then, if the first prong is not satisfied, the panel must assess whether it is objectively unreasonable for the claimant to seek refuge by moving to another part of the country.\n[23] Given the documentary evidence indicating all the problems experienced by Palestinians fearing Hamas and given the claimant\u2019s particular circumstances, the panel concludes that no internal flight alternative would be available to him should he return there.\n[24] The panel is of the opinion that the claimant would face a serious possibility of persecution if he returned to the Gaza Strip.\nCONCLUSION\n[25] The panel allows the refugee protection claim and determines that the claimant is a \u201cConvention refugee.\u201d\nDECISION\n[26] The refugee protection claim filed by [XXX] is allowed.\n(signed) Linda Doutre\nSeptember 22, 2020\n1 Document 1 \u2013 Information package provided by the Canada Border Services Agency \/ Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada.\n2 Document 3 \u2013 National Documentation Package on the Occupied Palestinian Territory, March 31, 2020.\n3 Document 4- Exhibits E-1, E-2 and E-4.\n4 Document 4 \u2013 Exhibits E-3, E-7 and E-8.\n5 Document 4 \u2013 Exhibit E-24.\n6 Document 4- Exhibits E-14 and E-20.\n7 Document 3, Tab 2.1: United States, Department of State, March 11, 2020, Israel, West Bank, and Gaza \u2013 West Bank and Gaza.

The Claimants are seeking refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (the Act).1\n[2] In deciding this claim, the Panel applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9 on Proceedings before the IRB Involving Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression.2\nDETERMINATION\n[3] The Panel finds that the Claimants are \u201cConvention refugees\u201d pursuant to section 96 of the Act and accepts their claims, for the following reasons.\nALLEGATIONS\n[4] The Claimants\u2019 allegations are detailed in their Basis of Claim (BOC) forms, their narratives3 annexed thereto which are identical in substance and only adjusted to the first person where applicable, and their statement update. The following is a summary of the allegations therein.\n[5] The Principal Claimant is from [XXX], in the state of Haryana, India. The Co-Claimant is from [XXX], in the state of Haryana, India. They allege that they are and have been in a same-sex relationship since [XXX] 2014. They fear returning to India because of their sexual orientation.\n[6] They were arrested by the police and were released on the payment of bribes with warnings to never be together again.\n[7] They fear that, should they return to India, they will be arrested and abused, and possibly killed by the police, society or their respective parents who are all against them.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[8] The Claimants\u2019 personal and national identity as citizens of India are established, on a balance of probabilities, by the documentary evidence on file, including a copy of their Indian passports.4\nNexus\n[9] The Claimants\u2019 allegations establish a nexus to a Convention ground of particular social group, specifically homosexual men. The Panel has, therefore, analyzed the claim pursuant to section 96 of the Act.\nCredibility\n[10] Testimony given under oath is presumed to be true unless there is a reason for doubting its truthfulness. In this claim, the Panel has no such reasons.\n[11] The testimony of the Claimants was straightforward, detailed, and sincere. The Claimants were spontaneous in their answers, and the Panel did not find that they tried to embellish their allegations during their testimony. The Claimants answered clearly and openly to the questions that were asked by the Panel and their counsel. Their allegations were coherent and plausible based on the documentary evidence.\n[12] The Panel found the Claimants to be credible as analyzed in the examples hereinafter.\nTestimony of Principal Claimant\nDiscovery of Sexual Orientation and First Relationship\n[13] When asked about his discovery of his sexual orientation, the Principal Claimant was able to provide a great deal of detail about how he saw himself growing up. He explained that from the age of 14, he realized that he was different when he compared himself to other boys. For instance, the boys in his class only wanted to talk about girls during the lunch break. He testified that, \u201cfrom inside he preferred men more and he was afraid why he felt like that (sic)\u201d. Asked if any of the boys in school knew about how he felt he replied, \u201cthose kinds of things were not spoken about (sic)\u201d.\n[14] The Claimant testified that his first intimate same-sex relationship was with the Co\u00ad Claimant. He testified that prior to that he would just hang around men, talking closely to them and \u201csometimes touching\u201d. He testified that it was only when he met the Co-Claimant in the beginning of [XXX] 2014 that he felt he could have a full relationship with another man.\n[15] He testified that they met while playing [XXX]. They exchanged eye contact, but it was only the day after when the coach called them in for a briefing that the Co-Claimant approached him, asked for his name and told him, \u201cyour game is as good as how good you look (sic)\u201d. They started talking; he enjoyed that and found him very wise. The Principal Claimant took the Panel through the development of his relationship with the Co-Claimant, which started with a friendship, playing [XXX] and training together, then three weeks later came the intimacy and the emotional commitment.\n[16] When asked how he and the Co-Claimant spent their time together, the Claimant testified that most of the time they stayed in the Co-Claimant\u2019s room; sometimes they would go very far to a neighbouring village 20 kilometres away from theirs. Otherwise, they did not go out very much because they were afraid someone would see them and they did not know of places where other gay men socialized, because it was considered a sin. He added that when they did go out, they did not hold hands nor look each other in the eyes so as not to raise suspicion.\nTestimony of the Co-Claimant\n[17] The Panel also asked the Co-Claimant numerous questions about his sexual orientation and his relationship with the Principal Claimant. He answered all questions clearly and without hesitation. He described his relationship with the Principal Claimant in a spontaneous manner. When asked what drew him to the Principal Claimant, he said he liked his eyes and he was a nice person. When asked what were his expectations from this relationship, he testified that they already lived together and in future they want to marry, get a house and live a good life. The Panel saw glimmers of emotion and happiness as he was testifying about his relationship.\n[18] When asked what would happen to him should he return to India, he testified that he came to Canada to save his life. If he returns to India, he knows about the law, but society doesn\u2019t change and police are corrupt: the next time they arrest the Claimants, they will formally issue a summons and they will have to pay even more money to be released.\n[19] The Panel finds that the amount of detail provided by the Co-Claimant could only be provided by a man who is genuinely in a relationship with another man and who lived these experiences. There was coherency to the Claimants\u2019 oral testimonies that demonstrated the Claimants\u2019 credibility. There were no discrepancies between the Claimants\u2019 testimonies and their BOCs, nor were there any relevant omissions. As a result, the Panel finds that, on a balance of probabilities, the Claimants are credible with respect to their same-sex relationship.\nIncidents\n[20] When asked about the one event that made them fear for their life and leave India, the Principal Claimant testified that it was on [XXX], 2016, when a police officer \u201ccaught them red-handed (sic)\u201d. The Panel asked the Principal Claimant to explain what he meant. He provided the Panel with tremendous amount of detail about the incident and its aftermath. He explained that the police officer was a neighbour of his with whom he shared a common wall. He testified that the Co-Claimant often came to visit him and he would take precautions by ensuring that the police officer was at work and by locking his door. On that particular day, the officer came home very early: \u201cit was roughly 12h30pm and he saw that the Principal Claimant\u2019s door was ajar (sic)\u201d, and he walked in and saw the Claimants together in an intimate position.\n[21] The Panel asked how the police officer could access his room apartment. The Principal Claimant was able to situate the Panel by describing the layout of the two apartments and their proximity. When asked how the police officer reacted, he testified that he started to beat them with his baton. He specified that most police officers are not in uniform, but they always have their baton with them which is what he beat them with.\n[22] The Panel asked if the Claimants were arrested by the officer. The Principal Claimant replied \u201cno\u201d, but added that he did not allow them to leave and he called other policemen who came and took them to the police station. When asked what happened at the station, he testified in a sincere and open manner without hesitating or exaggeration. He confirmed the allegations in the BOC narrative. He explained that he was separated from the Co-Claimant and was tortured by the police, with the village Panchayat present who insisted that the police teach him a lesson. He got released on payment of a bribe by his father. Then 84 villagers got together and took the decision to take his life, \u201cbecause they have the authority (sic)\u201d. His family blamed the Co-Claimant for enticing their son.\n[23] When asked about his fear, the Principal Claimant was spontaneous and sincere in expressing to the Panel his feelings of fear ever since these incidents occurred. He added that his fear is ongoing despite the fact that he is in Canada, because the Panchayat is a member of the 84 Khap Panchayat and his [XXX], with whom he is still in touch and who lives in another village, informed him that the members of the Khap Panchayat and the police are looking for him all around.\n[24] The Panel notes that the Principal Claimant was very emotional and shaking when describing the aforesaid incidents. The Panel noted that the Co-Claimant extended his hand to provide him with support and he explained to the Panel that the Principal Claimant has still not been able to overcome these traumatic experiences and is being followed by a physician for stress. The Panel noted a tenderness and deep caring in the Co-Claimant\u2019 s testimony and action of support which is a further testament to the realness of the Claimants\u2019 relationship.\n[25] Overall, the Claimants\u2019 ability to provide so much detail on the allegations already contained in their BOCs leads the Panel to conclude that they genuinely experienced all the above incidents.\n[26] There was an openness and spontaneity to the Claimants\u2019 testimonies that demonstrated the Claimants\u2019 credibility. There were no relevant inconsistencies between their narratives in their BOCs and their testimonies at the hearing that were not reasonably explained.\n[27] As a result, the Panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the Claimants are credible with respect to the aforementioned incidents and the resulting difficulties they experienced.\n[28] Given the objective country evidence hereinafter discussed, the Panel finds that their fear is objectively well-founded.\nCorroborating Documentary Evidence\n[29] The Claimants provided documentation corroborating their allegations, the most important of which are an order issued by the village Panchayat to kill the Principal Claimant5, an order issued by the village Panchayat to socially boycott the Principal Claimant and his family6, a letter of support by [XXX]7, the Claimants\u2019 gay friend with first-hand knowledge of their relationship, numerous pictures8 of the Claimants alone in personal moments, in gay clubs with their gay friend [XXX] and others, and at home together with friends celebrating their birthdays, and a medical certificate and prescription for stress from the Principal Claimant\u2019s physician, submitted post-hearing and accepted by the Panel.9\n[30] For the aforementioned reasons, the Panel finds that the Claimants have established their allegations, on a balance of probabilities.\nState Protection\n[31] The Panel finds that the Claimants have rebutted the presumption of state protection with clear and convincing evidence that the Indian state would be unwilling or unable to provide them with adequate protection. The Panel took into account the substantial documentary evidence from independent and reliable sources on the situation in this country from the National Documentation Package for India.10\n[32] The Panel recognizes that the documentary evidence reports11 that same-sex consensual relations were decriminalized in India, in September 2018, when the Supreme Court declared that Section 377 of the Penal Code was unconstitutional. The evidence reports12 that the decriminalization of same-sex conduct will not immediately result in full equality for the LGBT community in India. While the Supreme Court judgment held that the aforesaid reading down of Section 377 shall not lead to the reopening of any concluded prosecutions, the documentary evidence reports that it is too early to draw any conclusions for pending arrests.\n[33] The orders by the Khap Panchayat against the Principal Claimant and the Claimants\u2019 arrests occurred prior to the Court decision, and the Claimants\u2019 names are still on file with the police. Furthermore, the documentary evidence13 confirms that violence, abuse and harassment of homosexuals suffered at the hands of the police still exist throughout India and the Panel therefore finds that the claimants would be at risk.\n[34] Moreover, the objective evidence on the powers of Panchayats and Sarpanches14 confirms that though it is the \u201cresponsibility of a district-level bureaucrat who is appointed from above\u201d to work in close cooperation with the police, \u201cif, however, a sarpanch has acquired considerable informal power and influence, then she or he may in practice strongly influence the behaviour of the police\u201d.\n[35] Further, according to objective evidence, corruption remained a significant problem within the Indian police force15 as confirmed by the credible evidence of the Claimants that they had to pay the police bribes to be released.\n[36] Under the above circumstances, the Panel finds that the police would not protect the Claimants, on a balance of probabilities. Moreover, the Claimants would be putting their lives and physical security in danger by even approaching the authorities to ask for protection.\nInternal Flight Alternative (IFA)\n[37] The Panel proposed Mumbai as a possible IFA for the Claimants.\n[38] The Panel finds that the Claimants have established that, on a balance of probabilities, they face a serious possibility of persecution in Mumbai. The Panel therefore finds that there is no viable IFA for the Claimants in India.\n[39] The Claimants are both persons of interest and known to the police through their arrests and the orders of the Khap Panchayat. While the evidence does confirm there is no national police16 in India, the police do have the ability to track people through the \u201cCriminal Tracking Network and Systems\u201d (CCTNS) database, which is shared by 36 out of 37 states, and is enabled in 13,439 out of 15,398 police stations.17 The Principal Claimant\u2019s credible testimony is that the police and the members of the Khap Panchayat are still looking for him.\n[40] Moreover, the documentary evidence18 reports that tenant registration is existent in Mumbai. The evidence specifies that the purpose of tenant registration is not only for the authorities to confirm that tenants are not wanted criminals, terrorists or fugitives from the law, but also \u201cto get a history of the person\u201d.19\n[41] Furthermore, both Claimants were firm about their fear of being beaten, humiliated, harassed and sexually attacked by the police, society and their families should they return to live in India. They testified that they would have to live in hiding. Their fear is confirmed by the above cited evidence and the citation below20, which confirms that there is still violence and discrimination by members of the community against persons who are homosexual:\n\u201cStereotypes about the LGBT community are widespread and pervasive, and it is these stereotypical perceptions which are responsible of the hatred, violence and discrimination which LGBT persons face on a day to day basis\u201d.\n[42] In addition to the aforementioned, it is well established in law that the possibility of IFA is not viable if the person has to live in hiding.\n[43] In view of all these particular circumstances, the Panel concludes that the Claimants would face a serious possibility of persecution should they return to India and live in Mumbai or any part of the country.\n[44] Given that the first prong of the IFA test has not been met, there is no need to consider the second prong. The Panel, therefore, finds that there is no viable IFA for the Claimants in India.\nCONCLUSION\n[45] For the foregoing reasons, the Panel concludes that there is a serious possibility that the Claimants would be persecuted on the basis of their membership in a particular social group, namely homosexual men, in the event they return to India.\n[46] The Panel finds that [XXX] and [XXX] are \u201cConvention refugees\u201d and therefore accepts their claims.\n(signed) Georgia Pagidas\nJune 25, 2020\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c, 27, as amended.\n2 Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9 of the Refugee Protection Division: Guideline issued by the Chairperson pursuant to paragraph 159(1)(h) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act: Involving Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression.

He is claiming protection in Canada under section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] The claimant is of Tutsi ethnicity. From 1986 until his retirement in 2010, the claimant worked [XXX].\n[3] In 2015, when Burundian president Pierre Nkurunziza declared that he wanted to run in the elections, even though he knew that a third presidential term violated the provisions of the Constitution, which set the limit at two terms, Burundi was plunged into a serious crisis marked by ethnic clashes. The Tutsis were accused of trying to destabilize the government, and former members of the Tutsi-dominated Burundian armed forces (ex-FAB) were apparently targeted by the Burundian authorities.\n[4] When he realized that several of his former colleagues had been victims of targeted killings, and after becoming a person of interest to the police, the claimant started sensing that his own safety was at risk.\n[5] Accordingly, the claimant left Burundi on [XXX], 2017, and after a brief two-week stay in the United States, he came to Canada and claimed refugee protection.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[6] The claimant\u2019s identity was established to the panel\u2019s satisfaction by a copy of his passport issued by the Burundian authorities that was entered on the record.1 The panel concludes that it is an acceptable document establishing identity within the meaning of section 106 of the IRPA.\nCredibility\n[7] In general, no contradictions, omissions or implausibilities were identified in the claimant\u2019s testimony. In support of his allegations about his lengthy career in the Burundian [XXX], the claimant filed a photograph of himself [XXX],2 a certificate of service issued by the [XXX],3 and his bank: statement showing deposits of his retirement pension from the [XXX].4\n[8] In short, the panel finds that the claimant is a credible witness.\n[9] So, what does the documentary evidence on the ex-FAB say?\n[10] For decades, the Tutsis were given preferential treatment over their Hutu compatriots in the FAB.\n[11] However, following the Arusha peace agreement and the election of President Nkurunziza, a Hutu, in 2005, the FAB had to integrate thousands of former Hutu rebels into the corps. As a result, many Tutsi soldiers from past military regimes were quietly retired from their commands, transferred or dispersed to isolated provincial locations.5\n[12] In 2015, there was strong opposition to President Nkurunziza\u2019s decision to run in the presidential elections because it violated the constitution, which limited the presidency to two terms.\n[13] Divisions between the ethnic groups in Burundi started to manifest themselves, especially within the security forces.6 The movement against the third term became more ethnically driven against the Tutsis and became more about the military.7 Since the beginning of the crisis and especially since January 2017, the army has been the target of a purge and reprisal campaigns mainly against the ex-FAB, both active and retired.8 The Burundian authorities have been accused of being involved in dozens of targeted murders, forced disappearances and arbitrary arrests of former soldiers and police officers in the Tutsi-dominated Burundian armed forces. The evidence also indicates that the bodies of ex-FAB soldiers, both active and retired, are often found in rural or urban areas.9 The ex-FAB are considered to be disloyal elements in the army and likely to tum against President Nkurunziza because of their ethnicity.\n[14] So, after learning that two of his former [XXX] had been arrested by the police, the claimant decided not to respond to the summons from the commissioner general10 and to leave the country.\n[15] Given those circumstances, even though the claimant was not personally targeted before he left his country, the evidence shows that ex-FAB members are persecuted by the current regime by reason of their real or imputed political opinion. As Justice Shore eloquently stated in Matore,11 \u201cSomething must certainly be done before we see the corpses in the media.\u201d\nState protection\n[16] The evidence is clear: opponents of the regime, or people perceived as such, as in the case of the ex-FAB, cannot expect to obtain protection from protection and security services, who are politicized in favour of the Nkurunziza regime.12\n[17] Therefore, at this time, it is simply unreasonable to expect that the claimant could obtain adequate protection from the authorities, when they are his agent of persecution. Accordingly, the panel is of the opinion that the presumption of state protection has been rebutted.\nInternal flight alternative\n[18] As mentioned, in this case, the agent of persecution is the entire state apparatus, which has the interest and the necessary resources to find the claimant no matter where he is, especially in a small country like Burundi. Therefore, the panel concludes that there is no internal flight alternative.\nCONCLUSION\n[19] Having considered all the evidence, the panel concludes that the claimant has discharged his burden of establishing that there is a serious possibility that he would be persecuted on one of the five Convention grounds. The panel determines that he is a \u201cConvention refugee.\u201d\nDECISION\n[20] The refugee protection claim is allowed.\n(signed) Jacqueline La\nJanuary 28, 2020\n1 Document 1 \u2013 Information package provided by the Canada Border Service Agency and\/or Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada: Passport.\n2 Document 4 \u2013 Exhibit P-11: Photograph of [XXX] in a [XXX].

        "unofficial_text":"2020 RLLR 6\n\nCitation: 2020 RLLR 6\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: February 13, 2020\nPanel: Kristelle De Rop\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Russell L Kaplan\nCountry: Democratic Republic of Congo\nRPD Number: MB7-18074\nATIP Number: A-2021-00540\nATIP Pages: 000037-000043\nREASONS FOR DECISION\nINTRODUCTION\n[1] [XXX] (the claimant) is a citizen of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and is claiming refugee protection under section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] The claimant\u2019s complete allegations are set out in his Basis of Claim Form (BOC Form).1 The following is a short summary.\n[3] The claimant alleges that he joined a not-for-profit organization (NGO) entitled Congo Handicap in [XXX] 2013 as a [XXX].\n[4] The claimant alleges that the NGO\u2019s goals are to advocate and stand up for persons with disabilities in South Kivu and to fight against all crimes, including rape.\n[5] The claimant states that, on [XXX], 2017, he was summoned to the national intelligence agency office (ANR), where he was detained and criticized for his involvement in a report exposing [XXX] who allegedly committed rape.\n[6] The claimant alleges that he fears he will be arrested again and killed should he return to his country as a result of his involvement in the NGO and in published reports exposing [XXX].\nDETERMINATION\n[7] For the reasons set out below, the panel concludes that the claimant is a Convention refugee by reason of his imputed political opinion as a result of his involvement in an NGO that exposed military officers for their crimes against persons with disabilities.\nIdentity\n[8] The claimant\u2019s identity was established to the panel\u2019s satisfaction by means of a copy of his passport issued by the Congolese authorities filed on the record.2\nANALYSIS\nCredibility\n[9] The panel finds that the claimant was a credible witness. The panel did not identify any serious contradictions, omissions or inconsistencies that could not be reasonably explained during his testimony. The panel considers that the claimant gave credible testimony on the essential aspects of his claim. As a result, the panel believes that the claimant\u2019s allegations in his BOC Form are truthful, on a balance of probabilities.\n[10] The panel considers that the claimant gave credible testimony on his involvement and role in Congo Handicap and in reports exposing armed forces officers. The panel also considers that the claimant gave spontaneous and credible testimony on his and his parents\u2019 detention at the ANR.\n[11] The panel notes that the claimant submitted as evidence the following documents that corroborate his testimony: Congo Handicap membership card with proof of payment, [XXX] card, letters from the ANR, article from the awareness campaign held in [XXX] 2015, and a number of photographs taken at events related to his duties.3\n[12] The claimant explained that, before his detention, he presented a detailed and complete dossier at his NGO\u2019s quarterly meeting concerning cases of rape by officers in the DRC\u2019s [XXX], the FARDC, including [XXX], [XXX], [XXX], [XXX] and [XXX]. He explained that his role in the NGO was to [XXX] in the community of persons with disabilities and to identify information likely to bring the culprits to justice.\n[13] The claimant testified that [XXX] wanted to use him as a spy in his NGO and that he had an informer in his group and should be smart and accept the offer.\n[14] While the claimant was already in Canada to attend a work-related conference, his brother called to inform him that a convoy of soldiers visited their home, that the soldiers were looking for him and that, after searching his room, they left with all his personal effects. The soldiers also took his parents away with them. After being detained for two days, his parents were released on a promise to report to the ANR every two weeks until the claimant returned home.\n[15] The claimant testified that another report exposing cases of abuse and rape was supposed to be released when he returned from Canada in [XXX] and that the soldiers left with his information.\n[16] The claimant also referred to the murder of Dr. [XXX]4 on [XXX], 2017. The claimant had worked with this [XXX] when persons with disabilities were raped and needed care. The claimant testified that the doctor\u2019s cause of death was never disclosed. The claimant is convinced that the doctor was killed because of his involvement with victims and his possible possession of incriminating information regarding certain [XXX].\nChange of circumstance\n[17] At the hearing, the panel asked the claimant why he thought that he would be at risk should he return to the country, given the change in circumstances, namely, the election of the new president in January 2019. He explained that only the leader changed, but that all the rest remains unchanged. He stated, as an example, that the security service and police [XXX] remain the same. He added that the new president does not have a majority in either parliament or the serrate.\n[18] The panel notes that, on December 30, 2018, F\u00e9lix Tshisekedi, the leader of the UDPS party, was elected president. However, sources state that the transfer of real power is debatable. The former president Kabila is now Senator-for-Life, and his party won sweeping majorities in the parliament and provincial assemblies.5 Some contest the legitimacy of the elections.6 The post-election demonstrations turned violent, and the security forces responded with excessive force.7 The authorities are still being accused of political killings and arbitrary arrests. After Tshisekedi\u2019s election, student demonstrations against power and water cuts and rising tuition fees led to an intervention in which the police shot and killed demonstrators.8\n[19] The panel notes that the documentary evidence9 states that an [translation] \u201ceasing\u201d of political tensions occurred. The same document states that the country had a [translation] \u201cnew openness,\u201d that opposition radios reopened, that exiled politicians returned to the country and that political prisoners were released. However, the same evidence also states that, after the release of some political prisoners, human rights advocates were still waiting for the conditional release of the 700 prisoners who had been pardoned.10\n[20] In light of the foregoing and in the claimant\u2019s specific case, the panel concludes that the claimant would not be safe in the DRC, which remains unstable despite the recent change in government. The claimant stated that he would continue to face a risk since the same repressive structures remain in place and that, despite the change in leader, the situation remains unchanged. On the basis of the claimant\u2019s testimony and the documentary evidence, the panel concludes that the claimant established that he faces a risk of persecution by reason of his imputed political opinion linked to his role and involvement in the NGO.\nState protection\n[21] In light of the objective evidence, the panel concludes that the presumption of state protection is rebutted. The claimant would not obtain adequate state protection in the DRC because the agents of persecution are part of the state.\n[22] According to the objective documentary evidence, sources indicate that the state security forces, including the police, are undisciplined and corrupt.11 They are often accused of arbitrary, political and extrajudicial killings.12 State security forces are also accused of having weak leadership, low capacity and a lack of training and of engaging in extortion.13\n[23] The panel concludes that the objective evidence constitutes clear and convincing evidence that rebuts the presumption of adequate state protection in the DRC for the claimant.\nInternal flight alternative\n[24] The panel also assessed whether the claimant had an internal flight alternative (IFA).\n[25] In this case, the agents of persecution are state agents, namely, the Congolese government intelligence agency. According to the objective documentary evidence, people in situations similar to that of the claimant face the same difficulties throughout the country. The claimant has reason to fear the authorities because the police and military forces are present and in control throughout the country. The panel considers that the claimant would face a serious possibility of persecution throughout the DRC. As a result, the panel considers that it would be unreasonable to expect the claimant to return to the DRC.\n[26] The panel therefore concludes that an IFA is not available to the claimant.\nCONCLUSION\n[27] In light of the foregoing and after reviewing all the evidence, the panel determines that the claimant, [XXX], has established that he faces a serious possibility of persecution in his country of origin, the DRC. Therefore, the refugee protection claim is allowed.\n(signed) Kristelle De Rop\nFebruary 13, 2020\n1 Document 2 \u2013 Basis of Claim Form.\n2 Document 1 \u2013 Information package provided by the Canada Border Services Agency and\/or Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada, formerly Citizenship and Immigration Canada, Claimant\u2019s Congolese passport.\n3 Document 5 \u2013 Evidence submitted by the claimant (exhibits 1 to 14).\n4 Document 5 \u2013 Exhibits 12 and 13 (articles concerning the death of Dr. [XXX]).\n5 Document 3 \u2013 National Documentation Package (NDP), Congo, Democratic Republic of the (DRC), July 31, 2019, Tab 4.3: Democratic Republic a\/Congo: Background and US.

In summary, the claimant fears persecution from government security forces, Malen chieftain, and local vigilantes, due to his advocacy related to the land conflict in the Malen area in southern Sierra Leone. The following is a brief overview of the claimant\u2019s allegations.\n[3] The claimant is from [XXX] (ph) village in the [XXX] area in Pujehun District in southern Sierra Leone. In 2011, the claimant became involved as a volunteer with the [XXX], otherwise known as [XXX]. In 2017, after the claimant returned to Sierra Leone from [XXX] in the [XXX], he became an active volunteer with [XXX]. The claimant lived and worked in [XXX] but would travel to Malen region to consult with the affected communities and raise their concerns with the local authorities, including the Malen chieftain.\n[4] On [XXX], 2019, the claimant was involved in the organization of a peaceful protest in the Malen region. Government security forces and local vigilantes cracked down on the protest, and two protestors were shot and killed. Security forces started arresting members of [XXX], and local vigilantes raided homes targeting members of [XXX], including the claimant\u2019s home in [XXX]. The claimant hid in a neighbouring village for five days before making his way back to [XXX]. The claimant remained in hiding until he left on [XXX], 2019 for Canada and applied for refugee protection. The claimant fears he\u2019ll be arrested or killed if he were to return to Sierra Leone.\nDetermination\n[5] I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to s. 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nAnalysis: Identity\n[6] The claimant\u2019s identity as a citizen of Sierra Leone has been established on a balance of probabilities by a Sierra Leone passport located at Exhibit One.\n[7] The claimant\u2019s allegations support a nexus to the Convention ground of \u201cPolitical opinion, actual or imputed,\u201d for his [XXX].\nCredibility\n[8] I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant is an active member of [XXX] and has been an [XXX] of the local Malen people. I also find, on a balance of probabilities, that the Sierra Leone security forces and the Malen chieftain perceive the claimant to have a political opinion which is in opposition to them. In making these findings, I am guided by the principle that a claimant who affirms to tell the truth creates a presumption of truthfulness unless there are reasons to doubt their truthfulness. In this regard, the claimant testified in a consistent and straightforward manner that was consistent with his Basis of Claim form and supporting documents. The claimant was able to speak clearly and provide specific details about the purpose of [XXX], the concerns of the Malen people, his involvement with the group, why the government and the local chieftain would see that his involvement is in opposition of their interests, and he was able to answer specific questions when asked. There were no relevant inconsistencies in his testimony, or contradiction between his testimony and the other evidence. I find the claimant is a credible witness.\n[9] The claimant also provided documents to support his claim. For example, documents found at Exhibit Five include a newspaper article about the security forces searching for the claimant, specifically for his involvement in [XXX]. Also at Exhibit Five is a [XXX] that supports the claimant\u2019s description of the events related to the protests, including the killing of two civilians, the arrest of [XXX] members, and the ongoing search for other [XXX] members. I have no reason to doubt the genuineness of these documents and, since they relate to the claimant\u2019s involvement in [XXX], and the response by security forces, I place significant weight on these documents to support the allegations and overall claim. As such, I find that the claimant has established, on a balance of probabilities, the facts alleged in his claim.\nObjective Basis\n[10] The objective evidence supports the claimant\u2019s fear of returning to Sierra Leone. The somewhat limited National Documentation Package for Sierra Leone, located at Exhibit Three, indicates some positive conditions exist in the country. For example, a 2019 report from the US Department of State, found at item 2.1, indicates that in 2018, there were no reported killings or disappearances connected with government authorities. But it does note that there are significant human rights issues in Sierra Leone, including life-threatening prison conditions, official corruption, and impunity of government officials. However, with respect to the government\u2019s response to protests, the National Documentation Package indicates significant concerns.\n[11] An Amnesty International report found at item 10.1 is titled \u201cImpunity for Lethal and Excessive Use of Force by Police During Protests.\u201d And this report indicates that the police in Sierra Leone have used lethal and excessive force to disperse protests with impunity, noting that Amnesty is not aware of any police officer being held criminally responsible for using excessive force. Further, the report states that \u201cThe heavy-handed approach of the police limits the rights and freedoms of peaceful assembly and creates a chilling effect, with people reluctant to exercise this right due to fear of intimidation and violence.\u201d\n[12] The claimant also provided country condition documents, which are found at Exhibit 5. These include a 2019 Amnesty International report that indicates there are concerns about public order management by Sierra Leone police, and highlights a number of incidents, including the protest the claimant participated in in January 2019. That report further notes that 19 human rights advocates with [XXX] were arrested pursuant to that protest, and that as of December 31st, 2019, their cases were still pending.\n[13] I\u2019m also guided by the principle that a victim of politically motivated persecution is not required to abandon his commitment to political activism in order to live safely in his country. The claimant testified that he would [XXX] in the Malen region. As such, given the country conditions noted above and the use of protests as a way to express these concerns, the claimant would face a future risk if he were to return to Sierra Leone. Based on the testimony and the claimant\u2019s supporting documents and the country condition documents, I find that the claimant has a well-founded fear of persecution.\nState Protection and Internal Flight Alternative\n[14] Given that the state is the agent of harm, I find there\u2019s no state protection available to the claimant. In making this finding, I note that the claimant attempted to seek state protection when he was in hiding in [XXX]. The claimant contacted by telephone the [XXX] police, and the police in Pujehun District where the incident occurred. The police in the Pujehun District said that the [XXX] organizers were at fault for inciting people. The police in [XXX] did not take the claimant\u2019s complaints seriously. I also note that the objective evidence indicated above is clear that impunity for government security forces remains a problem in Sierra Leone. Further, given the state\u2019s capacity, I find that the claimant would face a serious possibility of persecution throughout Sierra Leone. Accordingly, I find there is no internal flight alternative available to the claimant.\n[15] For the forgoing reasons, I determine that the claimant is a convention refugee pursuant to s. 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, and the board therefore accepts the claimant.\n[16] Okay, thank you. Do you have any questions before we conclude today?\n[17] CLAIMANT (without interpreter): No, I don\u2019t have a question.\n[18] MEMBER: Okay, great. And Counsel, thank you very much for your assistance, especially -\u00ad\n[19] COUNSEL: Thank you, Member.\n[20] MEMBER: \u2014 assistance with some of the country condition documents, because, as I noted, the NDP was lacking in this regard. All right.\n[21] COUNSEL: Thank you very much, sir.\n[22] CLAIMANT (without interpreter): Thank you.\n[23] INTEPRETER: Thank you.\nREASONS CONCLUDED\n\n",

The hearing date is October the 20th, 2020.\n[2] I\u2019ve considered your testimony and the other evidence in this case and I\u2019m ready to render my decision orally.\n[3] You are claiming to be a citizen of Sri Lanka and are claiming refugee protection pursuant to Sections 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[4] I find that you are a Convention refugee on the grounds of your imputed political opinion for the following reasons:\nAllegations:\n[5] Your allegations are found in your Basis of Claim Form and related narrative which are found in Exhibit 2.\n[6] You alleged that you lived in the Vanni area during the civil war which was an LTTE controlled area. You then moved to Jaffna under army control where they grew to be suspicious of you since you had come from Vanni. You moved to Columbo in 2006.\n[7] You \u2026 you allege that on [XXX] of 2008, the police raided a market where you were located. They checked your ID and found that you were found from Vanni and then you were detained and abused for two days. They asked you questions about your involvement in the LTTE and you were released.\n[8] On [XXX], 2009, you allege that you moved to Chani, India on a tourist visa and registered as a refugee there and subsequently got a degree in [XXX] there. During this time you allege that you\u2019d taken interest in Tamil refugees and started work on a documentary outlining the challenges that they face.\n[9] Sometime in [XXX] of 2017, you allege that you mailed a portion of the documentary to a Tamil leader in Jaffna. You then returned to Columbo on [XXX] of 2017.\n[10] Upon returning at the airport, you allege that you were detained where you were questioned, abused, and accused of spreading anti-government propaganda and being a supporter of the LTTE. You were held for [XXX] days and then released after you learned that your mother had bribed the police.\n[11] You allege that on [XXX] of 2018, when you were [XXX] for a [XXX] you were approached and detained by at TIB Head Office in Columbo where you were beaten and questioned again.\n[12] You allege that you managed to escape while left unattended at the [XXX] hospital. You fled to your aunt\u2019s house for three months after which point an agent arranged for your departure to Canada.\n[13] You allege that you\u2019ll be harmed or killed anywhere throughout Sri Lanka since you were found in Columbo and you will not be protected.\nIdentity:\n[14] With respect to your identity, I find your identity has been established, on a balance of probabilities, as a national of Sri Lanka by your testimony and the supporting documents you provided, namely your expired passport, birth certificate, and national ID card.\nNexus:\n[15] I find there is a nexus between what you fear in Sri Lanka and Section 96, namely on the ground of imputed political opinion for the reasons that follow.\nCredibility:\n[16] In terms of your general credibility I found you to be a credible witness and therefore accept what you have alleged in your oral testimony and your Basis of Claim Form.\n[17] In support of your claim you provided or rather counsel provided a country conditions document which supports what I\u2019ve noted in the objective evidence.\n[18] You also provided education records and evidence of your prior refugee registration in India, a letter from your mother, a letter from your aunt which supports where you were hiding, a letter from your friend who attested to your detainment in [XXX], is [XXX] 2018, and a letter from a member of parliament in Jaffna. You also provided a photo of your injuries.\n[19] I\u2019ve reviewed that evidence and I found it to be consistent with the testimony that you\u2019ve given today.\n[20] You testified in detail about the detainments and abuses that you had to endure, specifically, the [XXX] detainment where you were at the market, the [XXX], 2017 detainment when you were coming back from the airport, and the [XXX], 2018 detainment when you were preparing for the memorial service.\n[21] I found your testimony in this regard to be credible. Therefore, I find that you\u2019ve established your subjective fear, on a balance of probabilities.\n[22] With respect to the objective evidence, it indicates that there\u2019s an ongoing risk for Tamils who are suspected of supporting the LTTE. These supporters, whether real or perceived, are still subject to abuses at the hands of Sri Lankan authorities, including arbitrary arrest and detention where torture and other human rights infringements are known to occur.\n[23] I further note that the objective evidence indicates that the majority of victims of enforced disappearances have been male.\n[24] COUNSEL: Sorry, can you lift your \u2026 your mask up?\n[25] INTERPRETER: Yeah, sorry.\n[26] COUNSEL: Thank you.\n[27] MEMBER: Thank you.\n[28] Item 1.8 indicates that the Sri Lankan military police and intelligence services have continued to practice torture, including other forms of sexual torture in the years of peace since the end of the armed conflict.\n[29] Those at a particular ongoing risk of torture includes Tamils with real or perceived associations with the LTTE at any level and whether or not it\u2019s current or historic.\n[30] Torture and sexual violence have occurred under the new government in known army camps throughout the north of Sri Lanka and there are secret camps that are still operating in unknown but diverse places throughout Sri Lanka.\n[31] I\u2019ve also found there to be evidence of detainments at airports. Item 1.4, specifically Section 8.2.5, indicates that there \u2026 arbitrary detentions still occurs for Tamils returning to Sri Lanka from abroad and that these individuals are monitored. More information can be found in Item 13.5.\n[32] I found this evidence to be consistent with the testimony that you gave today and what\u2019s in your narrative and therefore I find that your subjective fear has an objective basis. Therefore, I find that you\u2019ve established a well-founded fear within the meaning of Section 96, on a balance of probabilities.\n[33] Therefore, on a balance of probabilities, I find that those three detainments that I had mentioned earlier had occurred in the manner that you allege.\nState Protection:\n[34] I find your agent of persecution is the Sri Lankan police and military groups which are Federal institutions. Therefore, I find it objectively unreasonable for you to seek out protection and that State protection could not be seen as being reasonably forthcoming. I find the presumption of State protection is rebutted.\n[35] I\u2019ve also considered whether there is a viable internal flight alternative for you. Given that the agent of persecution is also the State, I also find that the claimant\u2019s IFA analysis fails at the first prong of the test and therefore an IFA is not available to this claimant, as you\u2019d be located by the police or authorities throughout Sri Lanka.\n[36] In conclusion I found you to be credible in relation to the material elements of your claim. You testified in a straightforward and spontaneous manner and you didn\u2019t embellish your story.\n[37] Therefore, on the basis of the totality of the evidence I accept your claim pursuant to Section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act and I find that you\u2019re a Convention refugee. Your claim is accepted.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n",

As such, his claim will be assessed against that country.\n[2] At the start of the hearing, the principal claimant was designated as the representative for the minor claimant.\n[3] In rendering my reasons, I have considered and applied the Guidelines on Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution.\nALLEGATIONS\n[4] The principal claimant has outlined her reasons for seeking Canada\u2019 s protection in her Basis of Claim (BOC) form2, as well as through her testimony. The principal claimant fears returning to Congo- Brazzaville because she fears further physical and sexual violence at the hands of Mr. [XXX] the minor claimant\u2019 s father.\nDETERMINATION\n[5] I find that the principal claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the Act.\n[6] I find that the minor claimant is neither a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the Act nor a person in need of protection pursuant to subsection 97(1).\nIdentity\n[7] The principal claimant\u2019s identity as a national of Congo-Brazzaville is established by her testimony and passport3 in evidence. The claimant\u2019s minor son\u2019s identity as a national of the US is established by his passport.4 I am satisfied of their identity by these documents.\nCountries of Reference\n[8] In order for a claim for refugee protection to be successful, the Act requires that a claimant must establish a claim against each of their countries of nationality.\n[9] The minor male claimant did not advance a claim against the US. Indeed, there is no evidence before me that he faces a risk of persecution or a risk to life or of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture, in the US. Accordingly, his claim for protection is rejected.\nCredibility\n[10] In refugee determination cases, there is a presumption that claimants and their allegations are truthful, unless there are reasons to doubt it. I found the principal claimant to be a credible witness and therefore believe what she alleged in support of her claim. She testified in a straightforward manner, offering spontaneous answers to my questions. In this case, there were no material inconsistencies or contradictions within the claimant\u2019s testimony that were not reasonably explained or that undermined her credibility with respect to her allegations.\n[11] I find the principal claimant\u2019s testimony credible and believed the allegations in support of her claim. She met the agent of harm in 2015 while she worked in her grandmother\u2019s restaurant. His bodyguard approached her asking for her phone number telling her Mr. [XXX] found her attractive. The claimant noted that she was aware that the agent of harm was the [XXX] of the President, a [XXX] She also knew that he had two [XXX]. She provided her phone number and Mr. [XXX] called her to set up a meeting. Over the course of 2015 to 2017 the agent of harm provided the claimant with an apartment in Pointe Noir and Brazzaville where he would come spend time with her. He also provided her with two bodyguards who would act as chauffeurs, run errands for her and monitor her. A few months into their arrangement the agent of harm started to physically and sexually assault her. She never sought protection from the police as she feared her assailant\u2019 s power over the police and that they would not take claims of domestic abuse seriously. In [XXX] 2017, the violence escalated to such a point that the claimant passed out and was brought to the hospital the next day by a maid. At the hospital she learned that she was pregnant and decided to leave for the US in [XXX] 2017.\n[12] The principal claimant returned to Congo-Brazzaville in [XXX] 2017 in order to get her older child that she had left with her mother, as she feared for her safety after the agent of harm had contacted her mother asking her whereabouts. The claimant met with Mr. [XXX] in [XXX] 2017 after he reached out to her. During that encounter, he threatened her and her children. During this encounter she found the agent of harm in a sexually compromising situation with the claimant\u2019s minor daughter. Fearing for her life and those of her children the principal claimant left for the US in [XXX] 2017.\n[13] The principal claimant submitted corroborative documents including identity documents, birth certificates and letters from the hospital5 consistent with her BOC6 and testimony. The objective country conditions evidence in the National Documentation Package (NDP) also substantiates the claimant\u2019s allegation concerning the prevalence of domestic abuse in Congo\u00ad Brazzaville. Based on the presumption of truthfulness, the claimant\u2019s testimony, and the corroborative evidence, I find, on a balance of probabilities, the principal claimant to be a credible witness who has established that she is the victim of domestic violence at the hands of her former partner.\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution and Risk of Harm\n[14] I find that the principal claimant has established sufficient credible evidence to demonstrate that she faces more than a mere possibility of persecution if she returns to Congo\u00adBrazzaville.\n[15] The agent of harm demonstrated his motivation in seeking out the principal claimant upon her return to the Congo-Brazzaville, as well as through ongoing inquiries as to her whereabouts with the principal claimant\u2019s mother. The principal claimant also testified that the agent of harm did not want her to have his child and fears severe repercussions should she return to the country. This demonstrates a prospect of further violence if the claimant returns to Congo\u00adBrazzaville.\n[16] I find that the claimant has a well-founded fear of persecution based on her membership in a particular social group based on her gender as a woman, which is an immutable characteristic as defined in the Ward case.7 As her fear of persecution is based on belonging to a particular social group, her allegations form a nexus to a Convention ground.\n[17] According to Country Reports 2013, domestic violence against women, which includes rape and beatings, is \u201cwidespread\u201d in the Republic of the Congo8 (US 27 Feb. 2014, 20). According to the report by APC and AZUR d\u00e9veloppement, the rate of domestic violence and incest across the country is [translation] \u201crather high,\u201d and \u201ctwo thirds of all cases of violence reported to the police and the gendarmerie concerns various forms of domestic violence\u201d (ibid., 5, 7).9\n[18] The objective evidence further highlights that among the human rights violations committed in 2013 in the Republic of the Congo, the US Department of State\u2019s Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2013 reports acts of discrimination and violence against women, including acts of domestic violence and sexual violence (US 27 Feb. 2014, 1). Amnesty International (AI) points out that [AI English version] \u201cserious human rights violations\u201d including cases of rape and other sexual violence occurred in 2014 in the Republic of the Congo (AI 2015). In correspondence sent to the Research Directorate, the Executive Director of AZUR d\u00e9veloppement, an association [in Brazzaville] located in nine departments in the country (AZUR d\u00e9veloppement n.d.) that aims to advance women\u2019s rights and fights violence against women (APC and AZUR d\u00e9veloppement Mar. 2015, 4), states that,\n[translation] [w]omen are subjected to various forms of violence daily, in particular, physical violence, such as beatings and injuries [\u2026]; sexual violence (rape, sexual harassment [\u2026]); [and] mental violence (insults, slander, verbal threats) (AZUR d\u00e9veloppement 14 Apr. 2015).\nAccording to the Congolese Minister for the Promotion of Women and Women\u2019s Integration into Development (Promotion de la femme et de l\u2019Int\u00e9gration de la femme au d\u00e9veloppement), women and children are subjected to sexual harassment and psychological violence in their family, at school, at work or in the street on a daily basis (Republic of the Congo 5 Mar. 2013, 3).10\n[19] Based on the claimant\u2019 s history of abuse by the agent of harm, the influential position of the agent of harm, and the objective evidence, I find that there is a serious possibility of persecution if the claimant were to return to Congo-Brazzaville.\nState Protection\n[20] I find that adequate state protection would not be reasonably forthcoming in this particular case. According to the objective evidence significant human rights issues in Congo\u00ad Brazzaville include (\u2026) violence against women and girls to which government negligence significantly contributed (\u2026). The government took limited steps to prosecute or punish officials who committed abuses, and official impunity was a problem.11\n[21] Though the objective evidence indicates that Congo-Brazzaville has some legislative framework for rape, Country Reports 2013 states that \u201cthe government [has] not effectively enforce[d] the law\u201d regarding rape and sexual harassment (US 27 Feb. 2014, 20-21). According to that same source, a Congolese women\u2019 s group stated that \u201cthe penalties for rape ranged from as little as several months\u2019 imprisonment to rarely more than three years,\u201d and local and international Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) have observed that \u201c[f]ewer than 25 percent\u201d of reported rape cases were prosecuted in 2013 (ibid., 20).12\n[22] The principal claimant testified that she never sought police protection given the high- level status of the agent of harm and that police would see this as a domestic matter, which is corroborated with the objective country evidence.\n[23] Given the objective evidence and the influential position of the agent of harm I find that there is no operationally effective state protection available to the claimant in this particular circumstance and that the presumption of state protection is rebutted.\nInternal Flight Alternative (IFA)\n[24] Based on the evidence before me, I find that the principal claimant would face a serious possibility of persecution throughout the country given the profile of the agent of harm with his political connections and as a colonel in the army. Documentary evidence points that military members can act with impunity and that given the agent of harm\u2019s position, resources at his disposal and motivation he demonstrated in seeking the principal claimant when she initially left him and then when she returned to the Congo- Brazzaville, I do not find that there is a viable IFA available to the principal claimant in this case.\nCONCLUSION\n[25] Having considered all of the evidence, I find that the principal claimant is a Convention refugee as set out in section 96 of the Act. Her claim is therefore accepted.\n[26] I find that the minor claimant, [XXX] is neither a Convention refugee as laid out in section 96 of the Act, nor a person in need of protection as per section 97(1) of the Act and reject his claim.\n(signed) Anike Marcotte\nAugust 20, 2020\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n2 Exhibit 2.\n3 Exhibit 4.\n4 Exhibit 1.\n5 Exhibit 6, and 7.\n6 Exhibit 2.\n7 Ward: Canada (Attorney General) v.

In addition, the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act requires the designation of a representative for all claimants less than 18 years of age. The tribunal designated [XXX] as representative for his minor child included in the claim, being [XXX].\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] The claimants\u2019 allegations are set out in a common Basis of Claim Form (BOC)1, The claimants\u2019 allegations are that the principal claimant and his wife fear persecution by the government and others because of the principal claimant\u2019s political opinion and involvement with ACT, a political opposition party.\n[4] The principal claimant is a 47-year-old man. He stated in his BOC and his oral testimony that he fears he and his wife will be detained, tortured and killed at the hands of state authorities and other members of different political parties for his political opinion and involvement with ACT, a political party in opposition to the ruling party.\n[5] Specifically, he stated how in 2007 when he was in hiding, his wife was attacked at their home when unknown people came looking for him. He also explained how his family had to move due to threats and from 2016 through 2019 he received threatening phone calls and messages to stop supporting ACT, an opposition party to the government. In 2019, [XXX] the associate claimant and brothers of the principal claimant also started receiving threatening text messages from unknown individuals warning them that the principal claimant should stop supporting ACT, the opposition political party\nDETERMINATION\n[6] The panel finds that the Claimants are Convention refugees pursuant to section 96 of the Act because they face a serious possibility of persecution by reason of the principal claimant\u2019s political opinion.\nANALYSIS\n[7] The determinative issue in this case is credibility.\nIdentity\n[8] The panel finds the identity of all the claimants as nationals of Tanzania is established by their testimony and the supporting documentation filed including their passports.2\nCredibility\n[9] When claimants swear to the truth of certain allegations, this gives rise to a presumption that those allegations are true unless there is valid reason to doubt their truthfulness. The panel finds no valid reason to doubt the truthfulness of the claimants\u2019 allegations, as found in their BOC.\n[10] The panel accepts their narratives, and find, on a balance of probabilities, that their alleged fear of persecution is consistent with the objective evidence available about present conditions in Tanzania. Further, the claimants have corroborated their allegations through documentation, including copies of the principal claimants\u2019 ACT membership documents, medical documentation, and supporting affidavits and letters from family members and individuals aware of the principal claimant\u2019s political activities.3\n[11] The panel finds the principal and associate claimants to be credible witnesses and therefore believe what they allege in support of their claims. They both testified in a straightforward manner and there were no relevant inconsistencies in their testimony or contradictions between the testimony and the other evidence before the panel which has not been satisfactorily explained.\n[12] Having accepted the claimants to be credible, the panel accepts they have a subjective fear persecution by reason of political opinion.\nNexus\n[13] There is a clear nexus between the claimants\u2019 fear of persecution in Tanzania and the Convention ground of political opinion. Accordingly, the claims will be assessed under s. 96 of IRPA.\nObjective fear\n[14] The claimants subjective fear is well-founded. It accords with the National Documentation Package (NDP) version September 30, 2020. The documentary evidence before the panel indicates that the current regime has escalated a campaign of intimidation, violence and arrests against political opponents, activist, and others since 2015.4 There are reports of people who are critical of the government going missing, some have returned badly beaten and others have been killed and the ruling party using militias to engage in violence and intimidation around election time.5\n[15] The panel finds that the minor claimant is also at risk by virtue of the principal claimant\u2019s political opinion.\n[16] Based on the evidence, the panel finds there is more than a mere possibility that the claimants will be persecuted if they return to Tanzania.\nState Protection\n[17] The panel find that it would be objectively unreasonable for the claimants to seek the protection of the state considering in their circumstances the state of Tanzania is the agent of persecution.\nInternal Flight Alternative (IFA)\n[18] The panel has considered whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for the claimants. Based on the evidence, the panel finds that there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout Tanzania because it is the government that the claimants fear.\nCONCLUSION\n[19] Based on the analysis above, the panel concludes that you are all Convention refugees. Accordingly, the panel accept your claims.\n(signed) Marshall Schnapp\nDecember 30, 2020\n1 Exhibit 2.1, 2.2, 2.3,\n2 Exhibit 1\n3 Exhibit 7.\n4 Exhibit 3, National Documentation Package (NDP), Tanzania, September 30, 2020.2.1\n5 Exhibit 3, NDP, Item 2.1.\n\n",

She provided a special power of attorney signed by the minor claimant\u2019s father on [XXX] 20203 giving her the power to take the minor claimant to Canada.\nDETERMINATION\n[6] The claimants are Convention refugees, as they have demonstrated a serious possibility of persecution in Venezuela on Convention grounds by virtue of their political opinion, namely their anti-government affiliation and activities, or their membership in a particular social group, namely the associate and minor claimants\u2019 familial relationship as the brother and daughter respectively of the principal claimant.\nIdentity\n[7] The claimants\u2019 personal identities as citizens of Venezuela have been established by the testimonies of the principal and associate claimants and the supporting documents, namely the principal, associate and minor claimants\u2019 valid passports issued by the government of Venezuela.4\n[8] I find on a balance of probabilities that personal identity and country of reference have been established.\nANALYSIS\nCredibility\n[9] In terms of the principal and associate claimants\u2019 general credibility, I have found them to be credible witnesses and I therefore believe what the claimants have alleged in their oral testimonies and their basis of claim forms. Their evidence was detailed and consistent, both internally and with their documentation. Throughout the hearing, the principal and associate claimants were articulate, responsive, and forthright. They were able to elaborate on their narratives and gave detailed explanations to the questions. Their claims were well\u00ad supported, and I noted no material inconsistencies or omissions such that the presumption of truthfulness could be rebutted.\n[10] I turn now to the findings as they relate to the principal and minor claimants.\nThe principal claimant and the minor claimant\n[11] Based on the credible testimonies and overall evidence, I make the following findings of fact as they relate to the principal claimant and the minor claimant:\na. The principal claimant is a member of the political party Conciencia de Pais, a political party that is in opposition to the regime. She participated in the party\u2019s monthly meetings of professionals and participated in the logistics to prepare demonstrations, such as preparing pamphlets and placards. The principal claimant testified that the regime knew of her membership in the political party Conciencia de Pais.\nb. The principal claimant is a [XXX] by profession. From [XXX] 2000 to [XXX] 2018, the principal claimant worked for the [XXX], which is a governmental organization. She provided documentary evidence in support of her claim that she worked for that organization. She was, for most of her tenure there, the [XXX]. Beginning in 2013, a new director and strong sympathizer with the regime was appointed as the head of the organization. She made it mandatory for employees to attend political meetings, marches, and events in support of the regime.\nc. The principal claimant\u2019s political opinion was known within the organization she worked for. The principal claimant was harassed and threatened by colleagues and the director for refusing to attend events and demonstrations in support of the regime. The principal claimant testified that there were lists of those who refused to participate. When the principal claimant refused to participate, she was called miserable; someone who is against the regime. She testified that she was perceived as a traitor to the regime.\nd. The principal claimant also had disagreements with the director. She testified that she refused to approve renovations in her laboratory because in her view the renovations were unsafe and used as a money laundering scheme. The director proceeded without her approval.\ne. While on a medical leave, there was a theft at the principal claimant\u2019s workplace: a chair, a box with supplies and laboratory equipment were stolen. She later found out that she faced criminal charges of \u201cunlawful embezzlement\u201d for the theft. She testified that this was done because of her anti-government political opinion and refusal to cooperate with the director in the renovation that she characterised as money laundering.\nf. As a result of the charges, the principal claimant required medical attention for stress. Her physician recommended a change of position to one with less supervisory responsibilities. Consequently, the principal claimant moved to another department as [XXX]. She testified that even with that change, the director and colleagues continued to harass her.\ng. The principal claimant finally resigned from the [XXX] to work for a private company. Her responsibilities included [XXX]. She required approval from the government before [XXX] and the government or her former director refused or delayed such approvals.\nh. The principal claimant attended several preliminary hearings in her legal proceeding, including a hearing on [XXX] 2018 when the judge dismissed the charges against her for lack of evidence. The principal claimant testified that the judge was immediately removed before signing the decision.\ni. On [XXX] 2019, while the principal claimant was leaving her house with her daughter, two men on motorcycles stopped and hit her window with firearms. Their heads were covered, and they said, \u201cprepare yourself for what is coming\u201d. The principal claimant, with the minor claimant, fled to her parent\u2019s house and remained there until she left Venezuela. The principal claimant did not go to the police because she had been trying to get justice for three years and none was forthcoming.\nj. The principal claimant left for Canada on [XXX] 2019.\nk. The principal claimant filed a statement from her parents dated [XXX] 2019 indicating that that they had gone to her apartment to recover documents and the principal claimant was still receiving threats through phone calls to her home. The principal claimants\u2019 parents stated that they remained indoors and were very anxious.\nl. The principal claimant also filed a lettedated [XXX] 2019, from the friend who looked after her apartment in Venezuela. The friend confirmed that she often heard calls while in the principal claimant\u2019s apartment but found it unwise to answer.\nm. On [XXX] 2019 the Court of Appeal of the Criminal Judicial Circuit of the Metropolitan Area of Caracas (Venezuelan Appellate Court) dismissed the charges against the principal claimant due to lateness in filing the appeal. The principal claimant testified that she remains fearful of returning to Venezuela. The principal claimant also fears for her daughter as she believes she is in danger because of her. The principal claimant testified that her daughter is at risk of being kidnapped as a means of revenge from the regime. The principal claimant believes that if she returns to Venezuela, she will be immediately detained at the border and charged. She testified that the regime does not forgive.\n[12] I find that the principal claimant is seen by Venezuelan authorities as opposing the regime and she faces danger because of it. I find that, because of her familial relationship with the principal claimant, the minor claimant also faces danger from the authorities and \u201ccolectivos\u201d. She was a victim in the [XXX] 2019 attack and the fact that she is the daughter of the principal claimant, who is wanted by the regime, puts her at an increased risk of violence and kidnapping as a means of retaliation against the principal claimant.\n[13] I turn now to the associate claimant.\nThe associate claimant\n[14] Based on the credible testimonies and overall evidence, I make the following findings of fact as they relate to the associate claimant:\na. The associate claimant was an active participant in anti-government activities starting in 2004 when he was a university student. He was part of the group that submitted the collection of signatures to request a referendum against Hugo Chavez Frias. He received threats through phone calls as a result.\nb. The associate claimant completed a bachelor\u2019s degree in [XXX] and a master\u2019s degree at the [XXX]. Despite his level of education, the associate claimant had difficulty finding employment in Venezuela. When he found employment, it was below his level of education and knowledge and in a different area of expertise than his degrees. Employers tried to force him to attend marches in support of the regime. When he refused, he was terminated. At his last employment in Venezuela, the associate claimant believes that his employer was making lists and taking pictures of people who refused to attend events in support of the regime. He believes that this information was shared with the \u201ccolectivos\u201d.\nc. In 2017, the associate claimant found employment in Buenos Aires, Argentina. He worked for 2 years, until his contract ended. After two years, he returned to Venezuela. Upon his return, the associate claimant was stopped and detained by the Venezuelan national guard for 9 hours because he was considered his sister\u2019 s accomplice. The officers hit him with weapons, took his clothes out of his luggage and took gifts he brought back. After his release, while still in Venezuela, the associate claimant felt he was being followed.\nd. Between [XXX] 2019 and [XXX] 2019, the associate claimant was confronted twice by men on motorcycles. The last confrontation resulted in the associate claimant being brutally beaten. One of the six assailants took a revolver and put it in his mouth, saying that the next time he was a dead man, and to tell his sister to return to Venezuela. The associate claimant left Venezuela a few weeks later for Canada.\n[15] I find that the associate claimant is seen as a political dissident and is being targeted as a result. I also find that the associate claimant is seen as an accomplice to the principal claimant\u2019 s actions and he is being targeted as a result.\nDocumentary evidence\n[16] The claimants also provided documents in support of their claims, including:\na. A psychological report dated [XXX] 2016 and made contemporaneously to the events, showing the hardship that the charges of embezzlement caused to the principal claimant.5\nb. Attestation that the principal claimant is a member of the Conciencia de Pai, an anti-government political party.6\nc. Documents relating to the principal claimant\u2019 s employment in Venezuela supporting her claim that she worked for the [XXX] a governmental organization.7\nd. Excerpts from court documents and decisions relating to the legal proceeding against the principal claimant. The documents include the decision of the Venezuelan Appellate Court of [XXX] 2019 dismissing the charges against the principal claimant. The documents support the claim that the principal claimant was unjustly charged of the crime of \u201cunlawful embezzlement\u201d in Venezuela.8\ne. A report from the principal claimant\u2019s lawyer in Venezuela providing the lawyer\u2019s position on the proceedings against her.9\nf. A 2019 medical report written by a psychologist in Ontario supporting the principal claimant\u2019s claim that she still suffers from serious psychological conditions because of what happened in Venezuela.10\ng. Statements by friends and family members supporting the claims that the principal and associate claimants were persecuted in Venezuela and are still at risk.11\n[17] There is no reason to cast any doubt on the veracity of these documents and as such I place great weight on these documents to support the claimants\u2019 allegations and overall claims.\nNexus\n[18] Based on the above facts, I find that, because of their refusal to support the regime, the principal and associate claimants were the victims of physical and emotional abuse by the authorities and those acting for them. As such, I find that both the principal claimant and associate claimant have a nexus to the Convention by virtue of their political opinion.\n[19] I also find that the minor claimant and the associate claimant have a nexus to the Convention as family members of the principal claimant. They were both attacked because of their relationship with the principal claimant. As such I find that both the associate claimant and minor claimant have a nexus to the Convention by virtue of their membership in a particular social group.\nSubjective fear\n[20] The principal claimant was harassed through degrading comments from the director of her former employer, a governmental organization, because she refused to participate in the regime\u2019s activities. She was persecuted through the laying of false charges against her, which remained unresolved for several years. This culminated in the attack on her and her daughter in [XXX] 2019 when she was in her car leaving her house.\n[21] The principal claimant fled to her parents\u2019 house on [XXX] 2019 and remained there until she left with the minor claimant for Canada the next month. She provided testimony that even after her departure from Venezuela, the authorities or \u201ccolectivos\u201d mandated by the authorities were still looking for her. Her brother\u2019s detention by the national guard when he returned from Argentina and the attacks on him between [XXX] 2019 and [XXX] 2019 are further evidence of that.\n[22] I find that the Venezuelan Appellate Court\u2019s dismissal of the principal claimant\u2019s charges against her does not diminish her subjective fear. The use of the penal system against her was one of several forms of persecution she experienced due to her anti-government political opinion. It does not mean that the government will not seek other ways to repress the principal claimant, such as detaining her upon entry into Venezuela or employing the \u201ccolectivos\u201d to threaten and harm her as they have done in the past.\n[23] The minor claimant also experienced an attack by armed masked motorcyclists while in the car with the principal claimant. She is at risk largely for the same reasons as the principal claimant and could be targeted by the government or those acting for the government as reprisal aimed toward the principal claimant.\n[24] The associate claimant was detained and interrogated because of his relation to his sister. He was called an accomplice of someone who has fled Venezuela. He was forced to flee after two brutal attacks by unknown assailants, assumed to be part of the \u201ccolectivos\u201d, between [XXX] 2019 and [XXX] 2019. During the last attack he received death threats while a revolver was placed in his mouth. He fled to Canada a few weeks later.\n[25] I find that the claimants\u2019 subjective fear is established by their credible testimonies and I believe what they have alleged, on a balance of probabilities.\nObjective Basis\nCountry documentation\n[26] The objective country reports are consistent with the claimants\u2019 evidence about the violence suffered by dissidents of the regime in Venezuela.\n[27] The National Documentation Package (NDP) for Venezuela, dated September 30, 2020, refers to the Human Rights Watch, World Report 2016: Events of 201512, which states as follows:\n[u]nder the leadership of President Hugo Chavez and now President Nicolas Madura, the accumulation of power in the executive branch and erosion of human rights guarantees have enabled the government to intimidate, censor, and prosecute its critics, leading to increasing levels of self-censorship.\n[28] Freedom House, in Venezuela, Freedom in the World 202013, notes that \u201cthe authorities have closed off virtually all channels of political dissent, restricting civil liberties and prosecuting perceived opponents without regard for due process.\u201d\n[29] The United Nations Human Rights Council, in its August 23, 2016 report prepared by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights14 also notes that \u201cfundamental guarantees for the exercise of freedom of expression and the right to freedom of opinion have been eroded, with an increase in attacks, censorship, arbitrary detentions, police surveillance, arbitrary interception of communications and abuse of power by State authorities\u201d.\n[30] Having been the subject of false charges, the principal claimant testified that she could again be subjected to false charges if she were to return to Venezuela. The United States, Department of State, in its Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2019, remarks on the practice of making false charges against political dissidents in Venezuela. It talks about corruption and political influence throughout the justice system. Reports from the International Commission of Jurists states that as many as 85 percent of all judges had provisional appointments and were subject to removal at will by the judicial committee. Provisional and temporary judges, who legally have the same rights and authorities as permanent judges, allegedly were subjected to political influence to make pro regime determinations.15\n[31] The May 17, 2017 Response to Information issued by the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada discusses the influence of \u201ccolectivos\u201d in Venezuela. It notes that \u201cmany of the country\u2019s \u201ccolectivos\u201d are becoming criminalized and violent, extorting the communities they often claim to protect [\u2026] the \u201ccolectivos\u201d have grown in power and influence, and in many cases have become linked to organized crime and have evolved into \u201cpartly criminal organizations\u201d. It further states that \u201cthe \u201ccolectivos\u201d have been supplied with weapons from the government and they have received training in urban warfare [\u2026] They act as enforcers in the barrios (neighbourhoods) and in general act to intimidate the population to discourage them from doing anything the government would dislike\u201d.16\n[32] The December 19, 2017 Response to Information Request issued by the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada supports the claimants\u2019 claims that employees who refuse to attend activities in support of the regime are punished for such refusals. It states that \u201c[t]here is no rule of law in Venezuela [ \u2026 ] there is little recourse for someone who refuses to participate in a rally during the election period [\u2026 ] if an individual works for a state enterprise and refuses to participate in a rally when the employer wants them to join, they will be accused of siding with the opposition [\u2026 ] it is rare that individuals will contact the police willingly to file a complaint because the police m Venezuela have a bad reputation and are known to commit robberies themselves\u201d.17\n[33] Country documentation also suggests that family members of opponents of the regime are at risk. The Office of the United High Commissioner for Human Rights observed that \u201cpersecution had extended to the families of opposition members, social activists or human rights defenders. Family members have been subjected to surveillance, threats, intimidation, and reprisals, solely on the basis of their family ties.\u201d18\n[34] As the claimants have established their subjective fear and an objective basis for that fear, I find that they have established a well-founded fear of persecution.\nState Protection\n[35] When making a refugee claim, a claimant must establish, on a balance of probabilities, that adequate state protection is not available. There is a presumption that state protection is available, and the onus is on the claimant to provide dear and convincing evidence to rebut such protection. A claimant is required to approach the state for protection if protection might reasonably be forthcoming or, alternatively, if it is objectively reasonable for the claimant to have sought protection. The evidence that state protection is not adequate must be reliable and probative. It must also satisfy the panel, on a balance of probabilities, that state protection is inadequate.\n[36] In this case, the agents of persecution are the state and state sanctioned \u201ccolectivos\u201d. The persecution the claimants would face should they return to Venezuela is at the hands of the authorities. Accordingly, I find there is no state protection available to the claimants.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[37] I have also considered whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for the claimants. The principal and associate claimants both testified that their employers were making lists of political dissidents. As a result, their names would have been included on those lists. The associate claimant was identified at the border as the brother of the principal claimant and he was detained as a result. I find on a balance of probabilities that both the associate and principal claimants are on lists of individuals known to be opponents of the regime and that the authorities have access to those lists. In addition, the evidence reviewed above confirms that the agent of persecution is the state and the persecution is nationwide. I find that there is a serious possibility of persecution for the claimants throughout Venezuela and therefore find that there is no viable internal flight alternative for them.\nCONCLUSION\n[38] Based on the totality of the evidence, I find all three claimants to be Convention refugees pursuant to s. 96 of IRPA. The principal claimant and associate claimant have demonstrated a serious possibility of persecution at the hands of the Venezuelan authorities and \u201ccolectivos\u201d because of their political opinion, namely anti-government affiliation and activities. The minor claimant and associate claimant have demonstrated a serious possibility of persecution at the hands of the Venezuelan authorities and \u201ccolectivos\u201d because of their membership in a particular social group, namely their familial relationship as the daughter and brother, respectively, of the principal claimant. I accept their claims.\n(signed) Jos\u00e9e Bouchard\nNovember 3, 2020\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), SC 2001, c 27, as amended.\n2 Exhibits 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3.\n3 Exhibit 5.3.\n4 Exhibit 1.\n5 Exhibit 5.1.\n6 Exhibit 5.1.\n7 Exhibit 5.1.
