        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2021 RLLR 105\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: December 16, 2021\nPanel: Kay Scorer\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Paul Vandervennen\nCountry: Ethiopia\nRPD Number: VC1-07067\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2022-01778\nATIP Pages: N\/A\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: I have considered your testimony and the other evidence before me and I\u2019m prepared to give you with my decision now.\nINTRODUCTION\n[2] These are the reasons for the decision in the claim of XXXX XXXX XXXX last name is spelled XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, a citizen of Ethiopia who is claiming protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[3] In coming to this decision, I\u2019ve considered and applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guidelines on Women Fearing Gender-Based Persecution.\nDETERMINATION\n[4] For the reasons that follow, I find that the claimant has established that she is a Convention refugee.\nALLEGATIONS\n[5] The claimant\u2019s allegations are contained in full in her Basis of Claim form and narrative, which can be found in Exhibit 2.\n[6] Briefly, the claimant is a Tigray woman who fears ethnic and political persecution in Ethiopia.\n[7] The claimant\u2019s parents have opposed the EPRDF government since they took power in Ethiopia and for the past five (5) years, the claimant\u2019s father has been an active member of the Arena Tigray Party, ATP. The ATP advocates for a quality and freedom of the Tigray people. The claimant\u2019s father has been involved with writing petitions to the prime minister and other high-ranking officials of the Ethiopian government and asking them to intervene in the ethnic clashes and genocide taking place in Ethiopia.\n[8] In about October 2020, the claimant\u2019s father was arrested.\n[9] The claimant was in New York at the time, as she worked as a flight attendant for Ethiopian airways.\n[10] When she returned to Ethiopia, she attempted to see her father but was denied access. Her father was not able to speak to anybody, including to his own lawyer.\n[11] The claimant approached the Superior Court of Justice in an area called Lideta, L-I-D-E-T-A. She spoke to a man who assisted others in filing legal documents. She told him about her father\u2019s situation and he helped her (inaudible) a very strong petition, citing the constitution, the penal code and universal conventions. The letter demanded that the police release the claimant\u2019s father.\n[12] She then served this letter on the police station, that was holding her father and thought that it would initiate his release. Unfortunately, the day after serving this document, two (2) police officers went to the claimant\u2019s home and told her that she was wanted for questioning. She was taken to the station, accused of helping the ATP and accused of communicating with the opposition in a diaspora, including monetary support from abroad, that she was facilitating through her work. She claim \u2014 the claimant was physically assaulted and kept detained for a few days, until she was released on bail. Immediately after that, she was scheduled to fly to Canada for work and she left just a few days later.\n[13] When she arrived in Canada, she defected from her crew, went to a shelter and immediately initiated her claim for protection.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[14] I find the claimant\u2019s identity as a national of Ethiopia is established, on a balance of probabilities, by her testimony and the other evidence before me, namely a copy of her Ethiopian passport, which can be found in Exhibit 1.\nNexus\n[15] I find the claimant has established a nexus to the Convention grounds of race, ethnicity, gender and political opinion.\n[16] Therefore, I have decided this claim under section 96 of the Act.\nCredibility\n[17] The claimant benefits from the presumption that her allegations are true.\n[18] In this case, I find no reason to doubt this presumption. The claimant testified in a spontaneous and forthcoming manner and there were no material inconsistencies between her testimony and the other evidence before me.\n[19] Ultimately, I found the claimant\u2019s testimony compelling and I believe what she has alleged.\n[20] The claimant also provided ample supporting documents to corroborate her allegations; including her work badges from XXXX XXXX; a copy of the legal petition that she served on the police station, to try and facilitate her father\u2019s release; a copy of a letter from the XXXX XXXX, indicating that she was being fired for defecting; supporting letters corroborating the events, as outlined in the claimant\u2019s forms; pictures of her protesting in Canada and holding anti-government signs; her bail document, confirming the requirements of release and political membership documents, corroborating her father\u2019s political affiliations.\n[21] All of this can be found in Exhibit 4 and 5.\n[22] I have no reason to doubt the authenticity of any of these documents. I assign them significant weight, as they help establish the central elements of the claimant\u2019s allegations.\n[23] I find the claimant has established, on a balance of probabilities, that she is a Tigrayan woman who was wanted by the Ethiopian authorities.\n[24] I find she has established that her father was an active member of an opposition party; that he was detained for a significant period of time; that the claimant was also detained when she attempted to help her father; that the claimant was accused by the authorities of using her XXXX XXXX XXXX to facilitate money transfers from the diaspora to political opponents and that the authorities have continued to date to visit the family in Ethiopia, to ask for information about her whereabouts.\nWell\u2013Founded Fear of Persecution\n[25] For a claimant to be a Convention refugee, the claimant must have a well-founded fear of persecution, due to a Convention ground. The Convention grounds are race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group and political opinion.\n[26] As noted before, I find the harm the claimant fears is by reason of her ethnicity as a Tigrayan, her actual and imputed political opinion and I find that these risks are exacerbated by her gender as a woman.\n[27] I find the objective evidence before me establishes that the claimant\u2019s fears of persecution are objectively well-founded.\n[28] The country condition evidence, which is in the NDP for Ethiopia found in Exhibit 3, supports the claimant\u2019s allegations as follows.\n[29] At Item 4.21 of the NDP, it details the deteriorating security and human rights situation in Ethiopia. It confirms the arrest of over 9,000 people, including anti-government critics. Other reports note that since the assassinations and alleged attempting coup of June 2019, the government has openly crackdown on dissent and opposition, using the Anti-Terrorism Proclamation to arrest, detain and charge people, including journalists and other political dissidents.\n[30] At Items 2.1 and 1.4, the evidence indicates that the current prime minister has introduced positive changes to the human rights climate by welcoming back political dissidents overseas and improving some press freedom and decriminalizing political opposition groups.\n[31] However, at Item 4.21, it confirms that the State continues to direct violence at actual and imputed government opponents, including through continued detention at government re-education camps, where detainees are actively enduring brainwashing.\n[32] At NDP 2.1, it confirms on the night of November 3rd, 2020, a war erupted between federal troops, including the Ethiopian defense forces and Amhara militia and the regional state of Tigray. Following the outbreak of this deadly conflict, Tigrayans living in the embattled area in Tigray and those living in other parts of Ethiopia, have become the target of severe violence, including air bombardment, drone strikes and artillery fire. Approximately 50,000 civilians have fled to neighbouring Sudan and more than 1.3 million civilians have been internally displaced. The active expelling and massacring Tigrayan civilian communities, including children, could be classified as war crimes and by some accounts, amounts to genocide. Tigrayans in other parts of the country also face ethnic profiling, mass detention, travel bans, arbitrary arrests, like the claimant herself has experienced, dismissals and forced disappearances.\n[33] In the claimant\u2019s own evidence, in Exhibit 5, a recent U.S. news report states that \u201cwitnesses say thousands of Tigrayans are being detained and their businesses closed, in a new wave of ethnic targeting by Ethiopian authorities over the eight (8) month conflict in the Tigray region.\u201d\n[34] Based on the totality of the evidence, including the claimant\u2019s specific profile as a Tigray woman, who\u2019s already come to the attention and interest of the authorities in Ethiopia, for her father\u2019s involvement with the ATP, I find the claimant would face a serious possibility of persecution, if she were to return to Ethiopia.\nState Protection and Internal Flight Alternative\n[35] There is a presumption that, unless in complete breakdown, states are capable of protecting their citizens.\n[36] However, I find the presumption in this case has been rebutted.\n[37] The agent of harm in this case is the State.\n[38] I find it would be unreasonable to request the claimant to approach the State for protection, when it\u2019s the State who has detained her and continues to threaten her.\n[39] Accordingly, I find there is no state protection available.\n[40] I find that the presumption has been rebutted.\n[41] In addition, the authorities in Ethiopia are in control of all of their territory.\n[42] As a result, I find the claimant faces a serious possibility of persecution throughout the country.\n[43] Therefore, I find there\u2019s no viable internal flight alternative for this claimant in all of Ethiopia.\nCONCLUSION\n[44] In conclusion, I find the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the Act and I therefore accept her claim.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2021 RLLR 104\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: November 30, 2021\nPanel: David Jones\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Kristina Cooke\nCountry: Hungary\nRPD Number: VC1-05525\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2022-01778\nATIP Pages: N\/A\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: So, this is the decision of the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada for the claim of XXXX XXXX who is a citizen of Hungary seeking refugee protection pursuant to Sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[2] I also reviewed and applied the Chairperson\u2019s guideline on women refugee claimants fearing gender related persecution.\nAllegations:\n[3] The claimant fears persecution if she were to return Hungary based on her Roma background. The claimant also left Hungary due to her fears from her ex-partner XXXX(ph) XXXX(ph).\n[4] Details of the claimant\u2019s allegations can be found in her Basis of Claim Form and Narrative, including the amendments found at Exhibit 6. The following is a summary of the claimant\u2019s allegations and testimony.\n[5] The claimant\u2019s parents were Roma. The claimant described her mother as light skinned Roma who is possibly half Roma.\n[6] In the 2013, the claimant met her ex-partner. The allegations describe numerous incidents where the claimant was a victim of physical abuse from her ex-partner throughout the entirety of their relationship.\n[7] The claimant also described numerous problems she experienced due to her Roma ethnicity. These include harassment and discrimination when she was at school, during employment, with public transportation, and in receiving healthcare,\n[8] Further, the claimant provided examples of violence she suffered due to her ethnicity. For example, in 2015, the claimant was attacked along with other Roma by skinned heads in Budapest when she was selling XXXX. Also, in 2015, the claimant began to save money in order to leave Hungary. The claimant only told her son her plans for leaving the country.\n[9] On XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018 the claimant left Hungary for Canada and claimed refugee protection.\nDetermination:\n[10] I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee.\nANALYSIS:\nIdentity:\n[11] The claimant\u2019s identity as a citizen of Hungary has been established, on a balance of probabilities, by the claimant\u2019s testimony and Hungarian passport which is located at Exhibit 1.\nNexus:\n[12] The allegations establish a nexus to a Convention ground for the claimant based on her ethnicity as Roma. The allegations may also support another nexus, but given my determination I find it unnecessary to assess an alternative nexus.\nCredibility:\n[13] I find that, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant has established her Roma ethnicity. In making that finding I\u2019m relying on the principle that a claimant who affirms to tell the truth creates a presumption of truthfulness unless there are reasons to doubt their truthfulness.\n[14] In this regard, the claimant was able to describe incidents of discrimination throughout her life. The claimant testified that in her primary school she and other Roma students had to sit at the back of the classroom, and how there was a lot of hatred directed towards the Roma students.\n[15] The claimant also described incidents of discrimination when trying to find employment at her workplace, and while she was on the bus, as well as trying to obtain healthcare. The claimant described why she believed that the country conditions for Roma are the same throughout the country.\n[16] The claimant also testified that she would be identified as Roma due to her appearance, and she gave detailed testimony about Roma burial practices.\n[17] Finally, the claimant was able to answer specific questions when asked without apparent embellishment. There were no relevant inconsistencies between the claimant\u2019s testimony and the other evidence. And as such, I find that the claimant was a credible witness.\n[18] The claimant also provided personal documents to support her claim found at Exhibit 4. These include medical records for the claimant. When asked why the claimant provided the documents she testified that she misunderstood what type of documents she needed to provide.\n[19] While I\u2019ve no reason to doubt genuineness of these documents, I find that they have no relevance in the hearing today and I give them no weight.\n[20] Nonetheless, the credibility of the claimant does allow me to find that the claimant has established, on a balance of probabilities, the facts alleged in her claim, including her Roma background and her subjective fear of returning to Hungary.\nObjective Basis:\n[21] The objective evidence supports the claimant\u2019s fears of returning to Hungary due to her Roma ethnicity. For example, a 2021 response to information request at Item 13.5 in the National Documentation Package for Hungary, which is found at Exhibit 3, indicates that Roma in Hungary face widespread discrimination regardless of residence, education, and social status.\n[22] The report notes that discrimination exists in areas \u2026 sorry. The discrimination exists in access to justice, housing, employment, education, and healthcare. The report also indicates that Roma are subject to violence, and that Roma women face multiple intersectional forms of discrimination based on ethnicity and gender.\n[23] Another example can be found at \u2026 in a 2021 US Department of State report found at Item 2.1. That report states that and I quote,\nHuman rights NGOs continue to report that Roma suffered social and economic exclusion and discrimination in almost all fields of life. According to an October 12th report prepared for the Council of Europe by the advisory committee on the framework Convention for the protection of national minorities, Roma face discrimination in education, employment, and access to housing and healthcare.\n[24] The report also indicates that significant human rights issues in Hungary include threats of violence by extremists targeting Roma.\n[25] Further, with respect to violence, a 2019 response to information report on extremist violence against Roma described how racist violence against Roma remain one of the most pressing issues in the country. The RIR also quotes reports that an increasing number of Hungary \u2026 Hungarian youths are joining far right wing and neo-Nazi movements.\n[26] The claimant also provided numerous country condition documents found at Exhibit 7. These include articles that highlight specific incidents of discrimination the Roma face in Hungary with respect to housing, education, employment, and family unity.\n[27] Further, other recent articles describe the anti-Roma hatred and violence from far right groups in the country.\n[28] I find that the claimant has established, in addition to the incidents of violence, that she has faced cumulative ethnic discrimination in all aspects of her life that amount to persecution.\n[29] Given there is no indication that the conditions have improved in the country for the Roma people, I find that the claimant would face more than a mere possibly of persecution if she were to return to Hungary.\nState Protection and Internal Flight Alternative:\n[30] I\u2019ve considered whether State protection is available to the claimant.\n[31] The objective evidence, including reports noted above, indicates that anti-Roma prejudice is present among police officers, and Roma are subject to ethnic profiling.\n[32] For example, a 2018 response to information request found at Item 10.1 states a number of sources who indicate that the police often fail to investigate and prosecute credible claims of hate crimes, and that Roma face continued hostility from police forces. This is similar to the claimant\u2019s belief.\n[33] The claimant testified that the police have an attitude that they don\u2019t care about what happens to the Roma people. The claimant said that the police knew skinheads were around and assaulting the Roma people selling produce and took no action. The claimant testified that she believed that the police were racist and did not help the Roma people.\n[34] Given the totality of the evidence, I find that there\u2019s no operationally effective State protection available to the claimant in her particular circumstances,\n[35] Further, given that there is insufficient evidence to show that there\u2019s a location in Hungary where the Roma do not face discrimination and violence and with the lack of State protection noted above, I find that there is no viable internal flight alternative available to the claimant as she would face more than a mere possibility of persecution anywhere in the country.\nCONCLUSION:\n[36] For the foregoing reasons I determine that the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to Section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, and the Board therefore accepts the claim.\n[37] Thank you. And, Madam Interpreter, whenever you\u2019re ready just, please go ahead.\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2021 RLLR 103\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: March 2, 2021\nPanel: Zonia M. Tock\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Ian Hamilton\nCountry: Sri Lanka\nRPD Number: VB9-08392\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2022-01778\nATIP Pages: N\/A\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n\nThis is the decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) concerning XXXX XXXX (the \u201cclaimant\u201d) who is a citizen of Sri Lanka and is making a claim for refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (the \u201cAct\u201d).[i]DETERMINATION\n\nI find that the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the Act as he faces more than a mere possibility of persecution should he return to Sri Lanka. The nexus between the claimant\u2019s allegations and the Convention is political opinion.ALLEGATIONS\n\nThe claimant\u2019s allegations are contained in his Basis of Claim (BOC) form and the attached narrative.[ii] In summary, the claimant alleges that the Sri Lankan government is targeting him due to a perceived connection to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). The claimant is an ethnic Tamil from Delft, which is an island off the coast of Jaffna. The claimant never supported the LTTE. However, in 2018, he began supporting the United Tamil Party and refused to support the Eelam People\u2019s Democratic Party (EPDP). As a result, the EPDP began accusing the claimant of being a member of the LTTE. The claimant was threatened and questioned numerous times. His movements were monitored, including his attendance at remembrance events, which resulted in him being accused of meeting with LTTE associates whenever he travelled to Vanni to visit his family. The claimant\u2019s cousin was also a supporter of the United Tamil Party and shared with the claimant that he was being threatened by the EPDP. In May 2019, the claimant was attacked while walking home late at night. And a few days after that, his cousin was murdered. The claimant believes that both attacks were perpetrated by the EPDP. As a result, the claimant decided to leave Sri Lanka. He travelled to South America in XXXX 2019, and made his way to Canada where he made a claim for protection. Identity\n\nThe claimant\u2019s identity as a national of Sri Lanka is established by the sworn statement in his BOC form[iii] and the certified copy of his Sri Lanka passport in evidence,[iv] as well as the numerous identity documents submitted in support of his claim.[v] Credibility\n\nThere is a presumption that sworn testimony is true unless there is sufficient reason to doubt its truthfulness. In this case, I found the claimant to be a credible witness. His testimony was consistent and forthright and was supported by the documentary evidence before me. The claimant explained that he had not been political prior to 2018; however, he decided to support the United Tamil Party because they promised freedom and support for the Tamil people after the war. According to the claimant, he refused to support the EPDP, who works with the army and has a very strong hold of Delft.I find it credible that the claimant would refuse to support the EPDP and anyone associated with the Sri Lankan government, given that he witnessed firsthand the treatment of Tamils by Sri Lankan authorities during the war. Thus, I find it is credible that his experiences led him to support the United Tamil Party which purports to help the Tamil people. I also find it credible that the Sri Lankan government would become suspicious of the claimant\u2019s activities since he refused to support the EPDP and instead, gave his support to the United Tamil Party.The claimant alleges that his cousin was killed by the EPDP and that he was assaulted by the EPDP. Although he does not have any confirmation that the EPDP were involved, he testified that he believes it was them due to the many threats received by both the claimant, and his cousin. I find it credible that the claimant fears the EPDP to the point of leaving Sri Lanka given that his cousin was also part of the United Tamil Party, he had also been threatened, and as per the evidence before me, the United Tamil Party also believes that the Sri Lankan government are responsible for the cousin\u2019s death.[vi] Therefore, I find it credible that the claimant would flee Sri Lanka after he was attacked, and his cousin was murdered.I have also reviewed the documentary evidence provided in this case, and I find that it serves to corroborates the claimant\u2019s allegations. I have before me evidence of the claimant\u2019s support for the United Tamil Party, letters of support, and evidence of his cousin\u2019s death.[vii]Based on the totality of the evidence before me, I accept the claimants\u2019 allegations as credible.Country Conditions\n\nIn 2019, Gotabaya Tajapaksa was elected in 2019. He was a former powerful war-time secretary of defense who was a key figure in the war against the LTTE. It is alleged that war crimes and crimes against humanity were committed by state forces under his control.[viii] The new president\u2019s strategy has been to militarize Sri Lanka to suppress any dissent.[ix] Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, the presence of security forces at checkpoints has increased and has been particularly severe in the Tamil Northern Province.[x] The evidence before me indicates that incidents of repression are on the rise and the government is using the pandemic to curtail freedom of expression by arresting critics.[xi]The evidence pertaining to the treatment of Tamils indicates that they are the most underprivileged ethnic group in Sri Lanka; they remain second-class citizens who continue to face harassment, mistreatment and human rights abuses.[xii] The United Nations (UN) Special Rapporteur indicated that he received frequent reports of intimidation and surveillance, particularly concerning memorial services.[xiii] This is consistent with the claimant\u2019s testimony that he was monitored when he attended memorial services in Vanni. The authorities are also reported to use extrajudicial executions, forced disappearances, custodial rape and torture which disproportionately impacts Tamils.[xiv] The extent of monitoring is reported to depend on one\u2019s ongoing involvement with politically sensitive issues, including protests related to disappeared persons and links to Tamil diaspora.[xv] As mentioned, the claimant attended memorial services in 2017, 2018, and 2019. Furthermore, three of his siblings have left Sri Lanka, one of whom is residing in Canada. Therefore, it is credible that Sri Lankan authorities perceive his connection to his siblings as a connection to Tamil diaspora. Given the current government\u2019s involvement in the war and the alleged crimes committed against the Tamils by the president, I find it credible that the current Sri Lankan government continues to target Tamils, particularly those it perceives as connected to the LTTE. Based on the evidence before me, I find that there is sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence to establish that the claimant has an objective basis for this subjective fear. As such, I find that he has a well-founded fear of persecution in Sri Lanka. State Protection and Internal Flight Alternative\n\nThere is a presumption that countries can protect their citizens. The claimant bears the burden of rebutting that presumption. However, in this case, the agent of persecution the claimant fears is the government of Sri Lanka; therefore, it would not be reasonable for him to seek the protection of that state. As such, I find that the claimant has rebutted the presumption of state protection as there is clear and convincing evidence before me that it would be unreasonable for him to seek the protection of the Sri Lankan government, given that the state is the agent of persecution.In terms of an Internal Flight Alternative (IFA), the authorities are in control of the entire territory. Furthermore, they have numerous checkpoints, which have increased in numbers due to the COVID-19 outbreak.[xvi] Given the government\u2019s control over the entire state, I do not find that a viable IFA is available in this case. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the above-mentioned reasons, I find the claimant is a Convention refugee, as such, his claim for protection is accepted.[i] Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n[ii] Exhibit 2.\n[iii] Exhibit 2.\n[iv] Exhibit 1.\n[v] Exhibit 4.\n[vi] Exhibit 4.\n[vii] Exhibit 4.\n[viii] Exhibit 3, National Documentation Package (NDP), Sri Lanka, September 20, 2020, Item 2.15.\n[ix] Exhibit 3, NDP, Item 2.15.\n[x] Exhibit 3, NDP, Item 2.19.\n[xi] Exhibit 3, NDP, Item 2.19.\n[xii] Exhibit 3, NDP, Item 13.1, Response to Information Request (RIR) LKA200298.E.\n[xiii] Exhibit 3, NDP, Item 13.1, RIR LKA200298.E.\n[xiv] Exhibit 3, NDP, Item 13.1, RIR LKA200298.E.\n[xv] Exhibit 3, NDP, Item 13.1, RIR LKA200298.E.\n[xvi] Exhibit 3, NDP, Item 13.1, RIR LKA200298.E.\n",

They are, therefore, Convention refugees under Section 96 of IRPA.\nIdentity\n[4] On a balance of probabilities, the claimants have established they are citizens of Iran based on copies of the passports in Exhibit 1.\n[5] Based on the testimony today and the documents on the file, including the three (3) claimants\u2019 Basis of Claim narrative, the Panel has noted no serious credibility issues. On a balance of probabilities, the Panel finds the following allegations to be true. The principal claimant is an accomplished XXXX XXXX in Iran. As an educated professional woman, she has endured many conflicts with the conservative theocratic regime. She has defended women\u2019s rights in many ways and has been harassed by Islamic authorities in her office and at the university where she was an associate professor. Among other things, her and her husband have also had to defend their two (2) children from the morality police, who have harassed and threatened them over the years, whenever they refused to comply with strict Islamic rules and regulations such as those concerning the dress code.\n[6] In or about May 2019, in particular, the principal claimant was detained, interrogated for hours, insulted and threatened and accused of encouraging women of being anti-regime and against Islam. And there was also another episode where she was helping out some protesters in 2019, during the anti-gas protest, or anti-regime protest relating to arising gas prices.\n[7] The principal claimant and her husband had sent both the associate claimants to Canada to study, to ensure their freedom from the deportations of the Iranian authorities. After the principal claimant\u2019s ordeal, they decided to visit the children in Canada. The principal claimant stay from XXXX to XXXX XXXX XXXX2019, and then returned. After Iranian security shot down innocent civilians in a Ukrainian flight from Tehran in January 2020, in the wake of serious public protest, the children in Canada lost communication with their parents and were very concerned. The principal claimant feared even more for her security as sh continued to assist women in her office. And when she was denied a raise to which she was entitled at the university because of her activism and perceived anti-regime position, she decided it was no longer safe for her to stay in Iran. She returned to Canada in XXXX 2020 and stayed. Her husband returned to Tehran\u2014he came back as well with her\u2014and then returned to Tehran in XXXX 2020, without her and informed her after that the Iranian authorities raided her office and have issues two (2) summons (inaudible) appear in court and they continue to seek her out.\n[8] Both associate claimants submitted separate narratives outlining the dangers that they and their mother face if they return to Iran and continue to oppose the subjugation of women and the violation of their rights by the authorities. All three (3) claimants decided that their lives are now at risk should they return to Iran and submitted their claims for refugee protection in August 2020.\n[9] The Panel finds that the evidence with respect to the claimants\u2019 imputed anti-regime opinion was internally consistent and plausible. There were no contradictions or omissions that go to the core of the claim. The allegations were supported by personal documents in Exhibit 5 and that the Panel finds credible. In addition to education and employment documents for the principal claimant, Exhibit 5 includes a support letter from the principal claimant\u2019s husband, explaining in detail the reason why it is no longer safe for his wife and children to return to Iran. The Panel accepts the evidence as establishing, on a balance of probabilities, the claimants\u2019 subjective fear of persecution because of their imputed anti-regime political opinion.\n[10] Okay, so now, the Panel is going to turn to the objective basis and the situation in Iran. The Panel examined the objective country specific documents in the April 16, 2021, National Documentation Package for Iran. The objective evidence supports the claimants\u2019 subjective fear of persecution because of their imputed anti-regime political opinion. The US Department of State 2020 Human Rights Report, that is item 2.1, notes that the Iranian regime engages in political motivated violence and repression to suppress dissent in political opinions, subject people to arbitrary arrest and detention as well as unfair judicial processes.\n[11] And then, just paraphrasing\u2014Significant human rights issues include executions for crimes not meeting the international legal standard of most serious crimes and without fair trials of individuals, including juvenile offenders, numerous reports of unlawful or arbitrary killings, forced disappearance and torture by government agents, as well as a systematic use of arbitrary detention and imprisonment, harsh and life-threatening prison conditions, hundreds of political prisoners, unlawful interference with privacy, significant problems with the indigence of the judiciary, particularly the revolutionary courts, severe restrictions on free expression, the press and the internet, including violence, threats of violence and unjustified arrest and prosecutions against journalists, censorship, etcetera, etcetera. And this is all just a quote from Item 2.1 of the NDP.\n[12] Okay, in other parts of Item 2.1, it gives more details about how the authorities commonly use arbitrary arrest to impede anti-regime activities, including by conducting mass arrest of people in the vicinity of any government activities, etcetera. This is found at page 15. Authorities held some detainees at times incommunicado, for prolonged periods without charge or trial and frequently denied them contact with family or to any access to legal representation. There is lots to say in Item 2.1 about political prisoners and detainees. Impunity remained a problem within all security forces. Human rights groups frequently accuse regular and paramilitary security forces such as the Basij, in committing numerous human rights abuses, including acts of violence against protesters and participants in public demonstrations. I think that is\u2014The Panel thinks that is a good enough summary of the dangers which the claimants have already experienced in opposing the regime in Iran.\n[13] Okay, the Panel finds that the objective country documentation for Iran establishes that the claimants\u2019 subjective fear of persecution because of their imputed anti-regime activity, is well-founded.\nBriefly, Turning to State Protection\n[14] As the agent of persecution in the government of Iran, the Panel finds it objectively unreasonable for the claimants to seek the protection of the Iranian state and the Panel finds that claimants have rebutted the presumption of state protection with clear and convincing evidence.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[15] The Panel also finds that the objective evidence establishes that the authorities in Iran operate similarly throughout Iran, and therefore there is no viable internal flight alternative available to the claimants.\nIN CONCLUSION\n[16] The Panel finds that the claimants face a serious possibility of persecution because of their anti-regime activities and imputed political opinion as opponents of the Iranian regime. They are therefore, Convention refugees under Section 96 of the IRPA, and their claims are accepted.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

The time is 11:47 a.m. This is the decision for the following claimant: XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, who claims to be a citizen of Sudan and is claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. The file number is TC1-08877.\n[2] Mr. XXXX, I have considered your testimony and the other evidence in this case, and I\u2019m ready to render my decision orally. I find that you are a Convention refugee on the grounds of your imputed anti-government political opinion pursuant to s. 96 of the IRPA.\n[3] The details of your claim are set out in your Basis of Claim form and are supplemented by your testimony at today\u2019s hearing. I should add that the details of your claim are also found in the amendments to your Basis of Claim form. In summary, you fear persecution in Sudan at the hands of the Sudanese coup d\u2019\u00e9tat leaders and the Sudanese security forces due to your imputed political opinion. You also allege that there is no state protection or internal flight alternative available to you in Sudan.\n[4] Your country of reference and personal identity as a citizen of Sudan has been established on a balance of probabilities by your testimony and the following supporting document filed in Exhibit 1, namely a certified true copy of your Sudanese passport that was submitted.\n[5] I find there is a nexus between what you fear in Sudan and one of the five grounds enumerated in s. 96 of the IRPA. Therefore, your claim is assessed under s. 96 of the IRPA and there is no need to conduct a s. 97(1) analysis.\n[6] In terms of your general credibility, I found you to be a credible witness with regard to the material issues in your claim. There were no significant inconsistencies or omissions between your Basis of Claim forms, your testimony, and the other evidence before me. You testified in a spontaneous, detailed manner. I therefore believe what you have alleged in support of your claim.\n[7] You testified today from 2010 to 2019 you lived outside of Sudan: first in India to attend university on a student visa, and then in the United Arab Emirates on a work permit that ended with the termination of your employment in 2019. Your university certificate and Indian student visa can be found in Exhibit 11 at pages 6 through 8. Your UAE E visa is found at Exhibit 11 at page 9. When I asked you why you did not live in Sudan after completing your studies abroad, you explained that your mother feared for your life if you returned to Sudan because your father and brothers were both targeted by the Sudanese regime because of their political opinions. You heeded her advice and stayed out of the country. I therefore find on a balance of probabilities you lived outside of Sudan from 2009 through 2019 as a non-permanent resident in India and the United Arab Emirates because you feared being targeted by the Sudanese authorities if you returned to Sudan and lived there.\n[8] You explained that while living outside of Sudan, you only returned to Sudan a handful of times, mostly to look after your mother who was suffering from cancer. This information aligns with the stamps in your passport. You explained that in XXXX of 2017 you were in Sudan to comfort your mother on her deathbed. Her dying wish was that you try to find your two brothers who had been arrested while protesting the Al-Bashir regime in 2013 and had not been seen or heard from since that time. You submitted a letter from your neighbours in Sudan with accompanying identity documents that attest to your brothers\u2019 arrest in 2013 while protesting. This letter is found in Exhibit 11 at page 20. The details of the letter correspond to the details in your Basis of Claim form and the testimony that you provided concerning your brothers\u2019 disappearance. I therefore find this evidence credible. After your mother\u2019s passing on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2017 \u2014 and you provided her death certificate at Exhibit 11, pages 15 through 16 \u2014 you saw to honour your mother\u2019s wish and you started looking for your brothers at different prisons and NISS centres in Sudan. Your testimony explained that on 26th of August 2017 you attended the NISS compound in the Shendi district in search of your brothers. When the NISS official said your brothers were not there and to stop looking for them, you accused the NISS of killing your brothers as they had killed your father who had been active in a Sudanese opposition party in the early 2000s. As a result, you were detained at the station for three days, physically assaulted, and interrogated about your alleged political activities against the Sudanese government and alleged affiliations with Darfuri movements because you are an ethnic Darfuri. Upon your release, you were made to sign empty documents. NISS officials told you to leave Sudan and that if you ever returned, they would fill in the documents with alleged offences and arrest you. You left Sudan a few days later and you never returned. This is confirmed by the stamps in your passport.\n[9] Your submitted evidence from your friend, XXXX (ph), who had accompanied you on your search for your brothers after your mother passed away and who picked you up from the NISS office in Shendi upon your release from detention. You explained when and how you obtain XXXX letter of support, and its accompanied by an identity document. The letter confirms the details in your BOC narrative and your testimony. I therefore find this letter credible. It can be found at Exhibit 12. The testimony about your detention, how it occurred, when and why it occurred, and what happened during it, all aligned with the details in your BOC narrative. You testified in a spontaneous, clear, and direct manner. I therefore find on a balance of probabilities you were detained by the NISS in August of 2017 while searching for your brothers who were arrested in 2013, that you were interrogated about suspected political affiliations against the Sudanese government, that you were threatened and instructed to leave the country.\n[10] You testified that you avoided involvement in politics in Sudan because you feared the regime\u2019s brutality if you spoke out. You explained that upon arriving in Canada in XXXX of 2019, you felt safe to begin raising your voice against the atrocities committed by the current head of the Sudanese military government, General Al-Burhan and General Hemetti. You have attended rallies in Montreal and Hamilton since arriving here. You post videos on your Facebook profile about protests against the Sudanese regime, including those that took place since the coup d\u2019\u00e9tat of October 25th, 2021, in Sudan. You showed me your Facebook account during the hearing and its contents confirm your testimony. You also submitted photographs of yourself attending protests against the Sudanese regime in Montreal and Hamilton in 2019 and 2021. The photos from these protests are found in Exhibit 11, pages 24 through 27. I therefore find on a balance of probabilities that since arriving in Canada, you have felt safe enough to actively voice your opposition to the Sudanese leadership and its security services as you allege.\n[11] I asked you whether you would continue to speak out against the Sudanese government if you return to Sudan. You testified that you would not because you fear the consequences of voicing your political opinions, especially given the physical and psychological injuries you sustained at the hands of the Sudanese authorities during your detention in August of 2017. I therefore find on a balance of probabilities that in addition to the Sudanese regime perceiving you to be a political opponent, you hold actual political opinions that opposed the current Sudanese regime.\n[12] I noticed that at the time you left the UAE you had a valid United States visitors visa. I asked you why you did not choose to make it an asylum claim in the United States and instead use that US visa in order to travel from the United States immediately to Canada. You explained that you were aware of the former Trump administration\u2019s attitude towards Sudanese asylum seekers at the time and you were worried you would not have a fair asylum hearing. I find this explanation reasonable. I also asked you why you did not seek asylum in Ireland or other parts of Europe, as your passport shows you had valid visas for those locations at the time that you left the United Arab Emirates for Canada. You explained that having done research online, you felt Canada would be the safest option for you, specifically given your profile as a person of colour. I accept that this is your genuine belief and the reason why you came to Canada instead of seeking refuge elsewhere.\n[13] I therefore find on a balance of probabilities that you have a subjective fear of persecution in Sudan because of your real and perceived political opinions. As a result, and as mentioned previously, this claim is being assessed under s. 96 of the IRPA, and I find that you have established a nexus to a Convention ground.\n[14] In addition to your credible testimony and the other evidence before me today, the objective evidence in this case supports your claim. With respect to your detention by the Sudanese security forces in August of 2017, the documentary evidence in the National Documentation Package, the NDP, is quite clear that the Sudanese authorities under the previous Al-Bashir government targeted real and perceived critics of the regime. Security forces detained such critics, often keeping them for days before releasing them without charge. Many were held even longer, facing maltreatment and torture during their detention. This is mentioned in NDP item 1.4 among other items in the NDP. NDP 1.11 also notes the risk you faced as a perceived political critic under the Al-Bashir regime given your identity as a Darfuri. In December of 2018 the regime still described the protests in Sudan as a plot engineered by Darfur rebels backed by the West. In a January 2019 report on \u201cThe Risk on Return for Darfuris in Sudan,\u201d the source states that Darfuris were being used as scapegoats and accused of instigating the uprising on instructions from foreign agents. I therefore find on a balance of probabilities that your subjective fear or persecution in Sudan at the time you left the country had an objective basis and was well-founded.\n[15] However, my risk assessment must be a forward-looking one, so I now turn to the evidence of whether the risk you faced in August 2017 in Sudan is indeed ongoing and forward-looking. In April of 2019 President Omar Al-Bashir was removed from office after decades of authoritarian rule in Sudan and replaced by a military council. Shortly after that, following negotiations between military leaders like Generals Al-Burhan and Hemetti and opposition groups, a transitional government led by a sovereign council of military and civilian members replaced the military council in August 2019. From that time until October of this year, 2021, positive changes were made with respect to human rights in Sudan, including opening space for political opposition and voices critical of the Al-Bashir regime and the improvement of other rights like women\u2019s rights. However, on October 25th, 2021, the military wing of the civilian-led transitional government commandeered by General Al-Burhan staged a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat in Sudan. The Sudanese army arrested key government officials, including President Minister Hamdok. When Sudanese civilians protested the coup, Sudanese military forces, including General Hemetti\u2019s Rapid Security Forces, used excessive and lethal force against peaceful protesters. The individuals who held leadership roles in Sudan state security forces under Al-Bashir, including those who controlled state security forces at the time of your arrest and detention in August 2017, now once again hold power in Sudan. This leads me to find on a balance of probabilities that the positive steps taken by the Sudanese civilian-led transitional government regarding, among other issues, treatment of real or perceived regime critics are not durable. I therefore find on a balance of probabilities that your subjective fear of persecution in Sudan has an objective basis, is well-founded, and is forward-looking.\n[16] While states are presumed to be capable of protecting their nationals, it\u2019s open to a claimant to rebut the presumption of protection with clear and convincing evidence. In this case, the agent of persecution is the state because the forward-facing persecution you would face in Sudan is at the hands of state authorities. Based on your personal circumstances as well as the objective country documentation, I find on a balance of probabilities that you have rebutted the presumption of state protection with clear and convincing evidence. Given that the state is the agent of persecution and there was no objective evidence that shows the state does not have control over the entire country of Sudan, I find on a balance of probabilities that you would face a serious possibility of persecution throughout Sudan, and therefore a viable internal flight alternative does not exist for you.\n[17] Having considered your testimony, the documentary evidence presented, and the objective evidence before me, I find there is a serious possibility that you would face persecution in Sudan at hands of the Sudanese security forces if you return there. For the aforementioned reasons, I conclude that you are a Convention refugee for pursuant to s. 96 of the IRPA, and I accept your claim. This concludes my reasons for decision.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013\n",

XXXX is not present. He has been informed of the decision.\n[2] XXXX XXXX XXXX, the claimant, seeks protection pursuant to s. 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. The claimant is a citizen of Hungary.\n[3] In coming to my decision, I\u2019ve taken into account specific cultural and social circumstances of the claimant as well as the chairperson\u2019s sexual orientation and gender identity and expression guidelines. The allegations of this claim are found in the claimant\u2019s Basis of Claim form and his testimony.\n[4] The claimant alleges the following. The claimant fears persecution on the basis of race as well as on the basis of membership in a particular social group, in this case sexual orientation, at the hands of society in general in Hungary. The claimant alleges that if he returns to Hungary, he would be subject to discrimination, harassment, and violence as a result of his Roma ethnicity. He also alleges that he would be subject to discrimination, harassment, violence, and the ostracization of his community because he\u2019s a gay man.\n[5] At the outset of the hearing, I identified credibility as a primary issue for the hearing to focus on. I also identified the availability of state protection as an issue to be addressed.\n[6] With respect to identity, on the file is a certified copy of the claimant\u2019s passport from Hungary. Through this document and his testimony, the claimant has established his personal identity and his citizenship of Hungary. The claimant has also submitted into evidence a certification of Roma ethnicity from the Toronto Roma Community Centre, and therefore I find the claimant has established his ethnic identity as a person of Roma origin.\n[7] With respect to credibility, a claimant testifying under oath or affirmation is presumed to be telling the truth unless there are valid reasons to reject the testimony. In this case, I find no such valid reason to disbelieve the claimant\u2019s testimony. The claimant\u2019s answers to the questions put to him at the hearing were forthright and spontaneous despite some nervous on the part of the claimant. The claimant\u2019s testimony was consistent with his Basis of Claim form. And the harassment and discrimination described by the claimant are consistent with reports found in the National Documentation Package for Hungary. There were no material inconsistencies in the claimant\u2019s testimony. And overall, I find the claimant\u2019s testimony to be credible and trustworthy. The claimant testified that as a Roma he has discriminate \u2014 experienced discrimination in education, in the provision of housing, in the provision of other public services, and in employment. The claimant further testified that he\u2019s been a victim of threats and violence in public at the hands of anti-Roma gangs. I find on a balance of probabilities that the claimant has experienced discrimination and harassment as a result of his Roma ethnicity in Hungary. I further find on a balance of probabilities that the claimant has faced violence or the threat of violence in Hungary at the hands of anti-Roma groups. Although discrimination by itself need not constitute persecution, pervasive discrimination when coupled with the threat of violence does equate to persecution in the case of the claimant.\n[8] The claimant testified that he became aware of his sexual orientation when he was about 17 years old. He did not discuss this with his family as the attitudes towards homosexuality in the traditional Roma community may be negative. The claimant testified that he told his family about his sexual orientation shortly before he left for Canada. His father\u2019s negative reaction to this discovery led to the breakup of the claimant\u2019s parents\u2019 marriage and was also the impetus for the claimant to decide he could no longer live in Hungary. As noted, I found the claimant overall to be credible and trustworthy.\n[9] As part of the evidence submitted by the claimant, his mother and a friend have both provided statements that confirmed the claimant\u2019s sexual orientation. In light of my findings on credibility and taking into consideration the supporting evidence, I find on a balance of probabilities that the claimant is a gay man. I further find on a balance of probabilities that the claimant has faced exclusion from his ethnic community and family as a result of his sexual orientation.\n[10] The claimant testified that that if he \u2014 he fears that if he were to return to Hungary, he will continue to face the same persecution as he has in the past. I\u2019m satisfied that the claimant has a genuine fear of persecution in the form of harassment, discrimination, and violence on the ground of his Roma ethnicity and his status as a gay man should he return to Hungary.\n[11] Having found the claimant to have a fear of persecution, I turn to the question of whether this fear has an objective basis. Reports from the National Documentation Package for Hungary confirm that persecution and harassment continue for the Roma population of Hungary. I find the claimant\u2019s fear of persecution on the basis of his ethnicity has an objective basis. Reports from the National Documentation Package for Hungary also note that while Hungary has relatively liberal laws concerning sexual minorities, Hungary is moving to an increasingly hostile atmosphere towards the LGBTQ population. Hate speech against this community is increasing as is violence. Both the media and the government are becoming increasingly hostile towards sexual minorities. On May 15th, 2019, the speaker of parliament in Hungary noted publicly that morally there is no difference between the behaviour of the pedophile and the behaviour and proponents of same sex marriage. I find that the claimant\u2019s fear of persecution on the basis of sexual orientation has an objective basis.\n[12] With respect to whether the claimant has an internal flight alternative, country condition reports confirm that persecution against the Roma population of the sort described by the claimant is widespread throughout Hungary and is in many instances tacitly approved of by authorities. In addition, as noted above, the increase in hostility towards sexual minorities in Hungary is also pervasive throughout Hungarian society. I find that the claimant would not be able to escape persecution on the grounds of race or sexual orientation in any place within Hungary.\n[13] With respect to state protection, there is a presumption that the state is able to protect its nationals. Such a presumption can only be displaced on clear and convincing evidence of the state\u2019s inability to protect its citizens. Such protection need not be perfect. Country condition reports for Hungary do indicate that the government has expressed a willingness to provide protection to all citizens. However, reports also suggest that this willingness has not necessarily translated into adequate protection. Reports say the hardening of anti-Roma attitudes in both the general population and state authorities in Hungary, corresponding to an increase in nationalist sentiment.\n[14] In many instances, authorities are unable or unwilling to protect Roma from extremist violence. The claimant\u2019s own testimony is that he did contact the police about attacks and threats. The claimant testified that at times the police were dismissive, but that even when they were not, no arrests or further investigations were made. The claimant\u2019s experience confirms \u2014 conforms to descriptions found in the National Documentation Package. Crimes against Roma may be reported, but ignored or dismissed without investigation. I find that given the claimant\u2019s Roma ethnicity and sexual orientation, the claimant has established that in his case there is clear and convincing evidence that the state is unable or unwilling to protect him against persecution.\n[15] Based on the evidence before me and the testimony of the claimant, I conclude the claimant has established a serious possibility of persecution on the Convention ground of race as well as the Convention ground of membership in a particular social group, in this case sexual orientation, if he were to return to Hungary. The claimant is therefore a Convention refugee pursuant to s. 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. His claim for protection is accepted. That concludes my reasons.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013\n",

The panel finds that there is a link between what the claimant fears and two of the five enumerated Convention grounds because of the claimant\u2019s ethnicity as a Tigrayan and his imputed political opinion. Consequently, his claim is assessed under Section 96 of the Act.\n[7] The panel finds that, on a balance of probability, the claimant\u2019s national and personal identity as a citizen of Ethiopia has been established by his testimony, and a copy of his Ethiopian passport and (inaudible), as well as Global Case Management System notes which can be found \u2026 all which can be found in Exhibit 1.\n[8] The panel also finds that, on a balance of probability, the claimant\u2019s ethnicity as a Tigrayan has been established by his testimony, and a copy of his kebele card which can be found at Exhibit 5.\n[9] With respect to credibility, the panel finds that the claimant was a credible witness in relation to the central issues with his claim.\n[10] The claimant testified in a direct and sincere manner, and did not try to embellish his claim. There were no omissions, inconsistencies, or contradictions between his statements provided in the Basis of Claim Form, amendment to the Basis of Claim Form, and accompanying forms, and his testimony at the hearing in relation to the central allegations of his claim.\n[11] The claimant testified that he and his family has been exposed to political violence in Ethiopia from his early youth due to his father\u2019s (inaudible) engagement in the Coalition for Unity and Democracy and subsequently in the Arena for Sovereignty Democracy or the Arena Tigray Party.\n[12] The claimant\u2019s parents are Tigrayan and Amharic. His father\u2019s ethnicity\u2019s Tigrayan and his mother\u2019s ethnicity\u2019s Amharic.\n[13] The claimant\u2019s ethnicity has been determined according to his father\u2019s ethnicity because in Ethiopia a child is supposedly the (inaudible) background of his or her father.\n[14] The claimant\u2019s father was arrested on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2020, (inaudible) of (inaudible) to the new Prime Minister as the coordinator of the Arena Tigray Party. Following his arrest, the claimant and his mother were threatened by the Oromo youth group Qeerroo, and subsequently by the police following the claimant\u2019s attempts to complain to the police about the threats he and his father received.\n[15] The claimant was physically attacked by the members of Qeerroo group in December 2020. His attempts to complain to police \u2026 to complain to the police the claimant was verbally threatened to live in harmony with the Oromo, and told that Tigrayans are the enemy of the State.\n[16] Out of fear from Qeerroo and the police, the claimant relocated to his uncle in another part of Addis Ababa, and applied for Canadian student visa.\n[17] The claimant left Ethiopia with the help of his uncle who organized the claimant\u2019s departure with the help of his friend Immigration officer at the airport. The claimant arrived to Canada XXXX XXXX XXXX2021.\n[18] The panel finds the claimant to be credible, on a balance of probabilities, on providing details about the series of events he and his family suffered in Ethiopia, and the reasons why he left Ethiopia and applied for refugee protection in Canada. The panel assigns significant weight to this part of the claimant\u2019s testimony.\n[19] The panel also notes that the claimant provided letters of support from his mother and from his uncle, as well as from Tigrayan Association in Toronto. The letters can be found at Exhibit 5.\n[20] The claimant also provided his education credentials, and photographs of his participation in demonstrations in Canada, both of which can be also found at Exhibit 5.\n[21] The claimant testified that he discovered the Tigrayan Association in Toronto soon after his arrival in Canada in XXXX 2021, from his friend.\n[22] The claimant provided explanation for the photographs he provided to the panel regarding his attendance at the protest in July this year in Toronto in Canada that were organized against the Ethiopian \u2026 Ethiopian Government on account of the ongoing armed conflict in Ethiopia between the State Government of Tigray and the Federal Government.\n[23] After reviewing the letters and all the other documents submitted into evidence, the panel finds them to be genuine and reliable, on a balance of probabilities.\n[24] The panel further finds, after reviewing the letters from the claimant\u2019s mother and his uncle, that they provide \u2026 provide further information on the events that unfolded following the claimant\u2019s departure from Ethiopia. Stating that the claimant\u2019s father is still in prison, and that his two siblings were forced to go into hiding. The panel assigns the documents full weight in assessing the claimant\u2019s credibility as it relates to his allegations of persecution in \u2026 in Ethiopia, and of \u2026 his activities in Canada.\n[25] The panel also questioned the claimant on his reluctance to claim refugee protection when arriving to Canada in XXXX 2021, as provided in the port of entry notes from XXXX XXXX XXXX 2021, when he did not seek asylum in the border and did so only following the decision of the border officers not to allow him entry to Canada.\n[26] The claimant explained that his uncle advised him not to seek asylum before finding a lawyer, and that he was following his uncle\u2019s advice.\n[27] The panel accepts the claimant\u2019s explanation as reasonable and finds it to be credible, on a balance of probabilities. The panel further finds that the claimant\u2019s reluctance to claim refugee protection before getting (inaudible) from the Canadian border officials does not impugn his credibility.\n[28] The panel finds that the claimant faces a forward-looking risk if he returns to Ethiopia based on his ethnicity and imputed political opinion. The panel is therefore satisfied that the claimant has established his subjective fear.\n[29] The panel further finds that the claimant\u2019s fear of being deported to Ethiopia in the present circumstances is a fear that is well-founded in the objective documents.\n[30] According to sources from the National Documentation Package for Ethiopia, hereinafter the NDP or the package, which can be found at Exhibit 3, there\u2019s, has been an escalating ethnic violence since the new Prime Minister and his appointment in 2018.\n[31] According to Item 1.5 of the NDP the security situation has deteriorated in parts of the country, and interethnic clashes have increased significantly, particularly in among other Amhara Tigray State borders. The same item provides information that anti-Tigrayan sentiment has become more overt since 2018, and hate speech against ordinary Tigrayans has increased in this time.\n[32] Counsel for the claimant provided objective evidence on the current situation in Ethiopia, and other articles that provide information on ethic profiling, arbitrary arrest, indefinite detention, and enforced disappearances of individuals of Tigrayan ethnicity, as well as mass detention of the ethnic Tigrayans during the ongoing armed conflict.\n[33] All of the new wave of mass detention in Ethiopia has not been acknowledged by State officials. The source also provides information that this practice is ongoing, and that \u2026 that hate campaign against Tigrayans has worsened. Providing further information on tens of thousand detained individuals of Tigrayan ethnicity, following the recapture of (inaudible) by forces from the Tigray People\u2019s Liberation Front.\n[34] The source on page 10 of Exhibit 7 provides information that arbitrary arrest also occurred in Addis Ababa, where the panel notes the claimant is from, and those arrested are held in detention without due process.\n[35] According to the Amnesty International those detained suffered torture and the general ill-treatment in detention, while forced disappearances, according to the source that can be found on page 13 in Exhibit 7, have become a common practice in the last six months.\n[36] The source reports Tigrayans have been stopped on the streets of Addis Ababa and arrested on the spot after the security forces inspect their identification documents. Those arrested and detained are taken to unidentified locations.\n[37] According to Human Rights Watch transferred of detainees has been organized by the Intelligence Services, the police, and the military. Family members of those detained are threatened and intimidated by the security forces.\n[38] The NDP also corroborates claimant\u2019s allegations about \u2026 by providing information on organized movement of young ethnic Oromo known as Qeerroo.\n[39] According to Item 1.8 Qeerroo\u2019s presence in Addis Ababa is reflected in its intimidation of ethnic Amhara\u2019s and other ethnicities, and the security forces were deemed as inefficient in curbing the violence caused by this organization.\n[40] Item 1.23 of the package describes Qeerroo as partly responsible for the Prime Minister and his appointment in 2018. (Inaudible) decree organization is not agreed on, and the Qeerroo are not in a legal opposition movement. The sources report of numerous (inaudible) activities of this group and orchestrated attacks on other non-Oromo ethnic groups in Ethiopia.\n[41] Item 4.5 of the NDP provides information that the (inaudible) side of the Qeerroo describes it as an Oromo group that struggle for freedom through democracy and self-determination rights. The central aim of the Oromo people and the Qeerroo struggle is described as the one of (inaudible) the nation and\/or country that guarantees freedom, democracy, equality, and fraternity among its people.\n[42] The source further provides that Qeerroo is symbolizing both the Oromo movement and its struggle for more political freedom and for greater ethnic representation in federal structures, as well as entire generation of (inaudible) assertive Ethiopian youth.\n[43] The source further states \u2026 states that as the Oromo movement has grown in confidence in recent years, so the role of Qeerroo in orchestrating unrest has increasingly drawn the attention of officials. As well the source further provides that many dispute characterization of the group as being a terrorist organization, few doubt the underground strength of the Qeerroo that has today.\n[44] The most recent response to information request from October 4th, 2021, which is called the Situation of Different Ethnic Groups in Addis Ababa, including access to housing, employment, education, and healthcare, particularly the Amhara, Oromo, Tigrayan, among other ethnicities, and their treatment by Oromo nationalist like Qeerroo that can be found at Item 13.12 of the NDP, provides information that Addis Ababa is a multi ethnic city with population of over five million inhabitants.\n[45] While the source states that Addis Ababa is a predominantly safe city for all ethnic groups and a dynamic place for opportunity for \u2026 of the \u2026 for an increase in (inaudible) or rural migrants, it also provides information that Addis Ababa is not safe for Tigrayans who have been targeted in Addis Ababa, due to their ethnicity and the war in the Tigrayan region.\n[46] The source further provides information that Tigrayans are ethnically profiled by the city and federal authorities in the \u2026 in Addis Ababa, as well as the Tigrayans are current the most targeted people or the only group that is persecution and harassed in Addis Ababa.\n[47] The source further states that general impression is that Tigrayans are losing their citizenship rights across Ethiopia.\n[48] The panel finds that the claimant\u2019s fear of persecution because of his imputed anti-government political opinion and his ethnicity has an objective basis and is well-founded.\n[49] Despite initial positive changes and the climate of reform after Prime Minister Abiy (inaudible) power, more recently there has been regression in the human right abuses and ethnic violence.\n[50] The claimant\u2019s imputed political profile and Tigrayan ethnicity make it more probable that he will face persecution if he returns to Ethiopia, especially in light of the recent escalating ethnic tension and the ongoing armed conflict.\n[51] Going to the issue of State protection. The panel finds adequate State protection would not be reasonably forthcoming in this particular case. That is because the claimant fears persecution at the \u2026 at the hands of State agents.\n[52] State agents are described as regularly detaining persons arbitrarily based on their ethnicity, and being responsible for grave human rights violations currently taking place in Ethiopia.\n[53] The panel also finds that the claimant faces a serious possibility of persecution throughout \u2026 throughout Ethiopia because the consensus opinion in the documentary evidence is that the Ethiopian security forces operate with impunity throughout the country.\n[54] The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that a viable internal flight alternative doe not exist for the claimant in Ethiopia.\n[55] In light of the foregoing, the panel finds that the claimant is a Convention refugee and accepts his claim.\n[56] And this matter is now concluded.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

You are claiming to be a citizen of Turkey and seeking refugee protection pursuant to s. 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. In assessing this claim, I\u2019ve considered the Chairperson\u2019s guideline 4, Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution. This is to ensure fairness and equity in the hearing process and this decision. I have considered your testimony and the other evidence in the case, and I am ready to render a decision in this matter orally. The written decision will be sent to you shortly and may be amended for spelling and grammar purposes.\nDetermination\n[2] I find that you are a Convention refugee on the grounds of membership in a particular social group, namely women fearing gender-related persecution and violence in turkey. I find that the claimant \u2014 that you have established that you face a serious possibility of persecution upon your return to Turkey. And the reasons for the decision are as follows.\nAllegations\n[3] You allege that you are a citizen of Turkey and of Kurdish ethnicity, that you have been in an abusive relationship with your ex-boyfriend, XXXX (ph), who is a supporter of the KP and the MHP, and you face persecution at his hands for your \u2013 for refusing to continue in the relationship with him. You also fear persecution from your family, in particular your father, for refusing to accede to a forced marriage to one of your cousins, XXXX (ph). You have stated that you cannot return to Turkey because if you do, you will be forced to marry your cousin, and if you refuse the marriage, you will be the victim of an honour killing by your father or your cousin\u2019s family. In addition, you have also claimed that if you are not the victim of an honour killing, the abuse by your ex-boyfriend will continue. Fuller details of your claim are contained in your Basis of Claim form as amended. You have alleged that there is not state protection for you and no internal flight alternative.\nIdentity\n[4] Your personal identity as a citizen of Turkey has been established by your credible testimony and a copy of your Turkish passport. I find on the balance of probabilities that your identity and country of reference have been established.\nNexus\n[5] I find that there is a connection between the persecution you have suffered and your membership in a particular social group, namely women fearing gender-related violence. Therefore, I find that there a link between what you fear and one of the five enumerated Convention grounds in s. 96 of the Act. I have therefore assessed your claim under s. 96.\n[6] Regards to credibility, I have found you to be a credible witness, and therefore I believe what you have alleged in your oral testimony in your Basis of Claim form as amended. You have described in specific detail your testimony regarding the threats that you\u2019ve received from XXXX and how he continues to stalk you online. Your testimony was coherent, consistent, spontaneous, and detailed. You described in detail his propensity for violence towards you and others, and his threats towards you are quite convincing, and there were no contributions. XXXX is a supporter of the ruling AKP or MHP party, comes from a wealthy Turkish family. He would use his connections in government and the police to find you anywhere in Turkey. These are corroborated by the letter from XXXX (ph) [inaudible] messages he sent you on social media. I attach full weight to these documents as I have no reason to doubt their authenticity, and they establish the allegations of persecution.\n[7] You have also described your father\u2019s overbearing and controlling behaviour, how he made decisions about almost everything in your life. You stated that he dictated where you schooled, the courses you took, where you worked, and even where you lived. If he knew of your relationship with XXXX, he would not have approved. His decision to marry (sic) your cousin was communicated to you while in Turkey. You believe that your father or XXXX family will kill you as a matter of honour if you refuse to accede to their request. Your father has [inaudible] the cousin in the past and she [inaudible] submit to the first marriage. All of these details were in keeping with your Basis of Claim narrative.\n[8] You\u2019ve also provided credible evidence \u2014 in support of your credible evidence \u2014 with reliable supporting documents, which are the letter from your mother, XXXX, and some other friends who are familiar with your personal circumstances, including the threats against you. These \u2014 I refer to Exhibit 5, 6, and 7. These documents corroborate the threats against you, they corroborate the allegations of persecution, I have no doubts to doubt \u2014 no reason to doubt the authenticity.\n[9] Based on my analysis above, I find on the balance of probability that you have established the allegations of persecution in Turkey.\nObjective Documentary Evidence in the NDP\n[10] The objective evidence from the NDP for Turkey clearly supports your credible evidence. Violence against women is a serious widespread problem both in rural and urban areas of Turkey. According to research undertaken by the Ministry of Family and Social Policy, it\u2019s six percent of women. So, they have stated that they have been subjected to physical or psychological violence by their parents or family. Approximately 70 percent of women reported they were physically assaulted by parents, family members, or neighbours. However, the actual figure may be even higher as violence against women is likely to be underreported for reasons including stigma, fear of reprisal, [inaudible] perpetrator, a lack of understanding on the part of women of their rights, language barriers, particularly for Kurdish women, and a lack of trust in law enforcement. Societal acceptance of domestic violence also contributes to underreporting.\n[11] In regard to honour killings, honour killings [inaudible] in the name of honour continues to take place. [inaudible] of the women killed by men in 2016 is 68 percent were killed by partners or former partners and [inaudible] by relatives. Family members sometimes pressure girls to [inaudible] preserve the family\u2019s reputation. However, given that I have found that you are being forced to marry your own cousin, I find on a balance of probability that you would be the victim of an honour killing in Turkey. Given, therefore, I find that there is an objective basis for your fear of your family and ex-boyfriend as violence against women is a serious widespread problem in Turkey and is often perpetrated by family members.\n[12] I am persuaded that your father is as controlling as you allege and that you\u2019re in a situation where you are going to be forced to marry someone other \u2014 or that you will be killed to preserve your family reputation. Accordingly, I find that your subjective fear of persecution on the grounds of your gender in Turkey is well-founded as it is supported by the objective evidence from the NDP. You have established on the balance of probability that you will be a victim of forced marriage or honour killing if you return to Turkey.\n[13] With regards to well-founded fear of persecution and risk of harm, given that you\u2019ve been abused by your \u2014 I think I\u2019ve already dealt with that. Let\u2019s see. Okay. Given that your ex-boyfriend has abused you in the past, I find that more likely than not he will continue to do so in the future if you were to return to your family in Turkey.\n[14] With regards to state protection, I have considered whether adequate state protection is available to you. There\u2019s a presumption \u2014 rebuttable presumption of state protection. Your documentation and the oral evidence credibly show that you were subjected to improper [inaudible] conduct by the police at some point, and the police have visited your home while in Canada at the instigation of XXXX to make you aware of his connections and to threaten you. Your subjective evidence in this respect is consistent with the objective evidence from the NDP for Turkey which reveals that \u2014 like I\u2019ve mentioned before, that \u2014 the high number of honour killings in Turkey. [inaudible] government media report, honour killings have plagued Turkey for decades. It is unclear if victims were Turkish citizens or if honour killings took place in refugee populations in the country. The objective evidence also shows that individuals convicted of honour killings can be sentenced to life imprisonment, but NGOs report courts can reduce actual sentences due to mitigating factors, which include anger or passion. Actions considered damaging can include extramarital sex, refusal of an arranged marriage, choosing one\u2019s own spouse without family approval, becoming a victim of rape, same-sex sexual acts, or liberal behaviour and dress. The police are also known not to adequately respond to victims of \u2014 victims\u2019 complaints, especially women. Your personal experience also demonstrates this. Accordingly, based on the totality of the credible subjective and objective evidence in this case, the Panel finds that \u2014 I find that the presumption of adequate state protection is rebutted on the balance of probabilities.\n[15] With regards to internal flight alternative, I considered whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for you in Istanbul. There are two prongs to the test and both must be met for a viable IFA. In that sense, the prongs are whether a proposed IFA is safe and the second is whether a proposed IFA is reasonable. In this case, I find on the balance of probabilities that there is no viable IFA for you. As indicated in both your subjective evidence and the objective evidence from the NDP, the conditions of institutional [inaudible] Turkey and the persecution of women exists throughout Turkey. You testified that XXXX is wealthy and has connections in government and the police. You described an incident where he got away from the police who had stopped him by a road check by simply making a call. While I do not find that your father can find you in Istanbul based on his profile, I believe you when you say that he can \u2014 that XXXX can get you through the police and his connection of wealthy friend in government, and also as he has demonstrated a continued interest to stalk you on the internet [inaudible] by changing your contact details. You\u2019re not expected to live in hiding in the IFA.\n[16] I\u2019ve also considered the fact that you\u2019ve been diagnosed with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. This will interfere with your ability to live a healthy life, thus making it difficult for you to successfully relocate in Turkey. Accordingly, I\u2019m satisfied on the balance of probability that you will face more than a mere possibility of persecution based on your gender anywhere in Turkey and there is no viable IFA in Turkey. So, for all of these reasons, I find that you have successfully established that you face a forward-looking serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground and there is no IFA for you.\n[17] My conclusion: based on the totality of the evidence and my analysis above, I find you to be a Convention refugee and I accept your claim. Congratulations.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013\n",

The claimant in this case requests refugee protection under Sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[2] The claimant\u2019s allegations are set out in his Basis of Claim form. In summary he\u2019s alleged to be a Chinese Uyghur male who seeks protection on the basis of ethnic persecution in China for his Uyghur ethnicity.\n[3] I find, sir, you to be a Convention refugee and my reasons are as follows.\n[4] First, on the issue of identity I\u2019m satisfied on a balance of probabilities that you\u2019ve established your personal identity and your citizenship. I base that on the copy of the passport that you presented. I\u2019m also satisfied on a balance of probabilities that you\u2019ve established your Uyghur heritage. I find this on a combination of factors including the name present in your passport which I know from experience gained in doing this job, points to being a Uyghur; the birthplace as noted in your passport, which similarly is the Autonomous zone in China; the fact that you testified today in the Uyghur language; you did present a identity card to the camera which I could not read and therefore can make minimal use of but the Arabic script on that card I, I do also have some experience with that that points in that direction; as well as your overall testimony today to point to your Uyghur ethnicity.\n[5] So on a balance of probabilities from the evidence before me largely gained from the passport and from your testimony and the language spoken I find in the circumstances that to be sufficient to establish on a balance of probabilities your Uyghur ethnicity.\n[6] I find that the persecution you\u2019ve alleged has a nexus through Section 96 of ethnicity and nationality along with elements of religion. I find that you would face on a balance of probabilities a serious possibility of persecution returning to China on the basis of your ethnicity. This was not a well documented case and I would expect more on a refugee claim with no disclosure from a claimant; however, in the circumstances in the particular circumstances of the country conditions in China, your testimony in appearing before the hearing and the particular circumstances of Uyghurs in China in the particular circumstances of this claim, it is sufficient. You testified about your past experience in China; your treatment in the past as a Uyghur; what you fear returning; the decisions you made in Malaysia; how you decided to make a refugee claim; and, the reasons why you have had limited contact with your parents in China which would explain some of the limited ability to get disclosure from that country.\n[7] This is supported by the objective country conditions in the NDP which point strongly to the mistreatment of Uyghurs by Chinese authorities as alleged by you, sir, and I do find sufficient objective evidence in the circumstances of this case to point to a serious possibility of persecution going forward in returning to that country.\n[8] On the issue of state protection given that it is the state authorities in China you fear, I find that it would be unreasonable for you to seek protection from them.\n[9] Finally, on the issue of Internal Flight Alternative, I find a lack of Internal Fight Alternative as there is evidence in the country conditions of mistreatment of Uyghurs throughout China and I find in the circumstances that there would not be a location in China where you would not face this serious possibility of harm.\n[10] So for all the above reasons I find you to have a well-founded fear of persecution under Section 96. For these reasons I find you to be a Convention refugee under the IRPA and I therefore accept your claim.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2021 RLLR 96\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: September 9, 2021\nPanel: Suraj Balakrishnan\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Naseem Mithoowani\nCountry: Sri Lanka\nRPD Number: TC1-02935\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2022-01778\nATIP Pages: N\/A\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] The claimant, XXXX XXXX, alleges that he is a citizen of Sri Lanka, and is claiming refugee protection in Canada pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).\nDETERMINATION\n[2] Having considered all of the evidence, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant has established that he would face a serious possibility of persecution in Sri Lanka because of his imputed political opinion in support of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] The specifics of the claim are set out in the narrative of the claimant\u2019s Basis of Claim Form, as amended (BOC).[i] The following is a summary of the claimant\u2019s allegations.\n[4] The claimant alleges to be a citizen of Sri Lanka. He fears persecution from Sri Lankan authorities because of his imputed political opinion in support of the LTTE.\nIDENTITY\n[5] The claimant\u2019s identity has been established, on a balance of probabilities, through his testimony, as well as documentation filed; namely, copies of his Sri Lankan passport,[ii] national identity card,[iii] and birth certificate.[iv]\nNEXUS\n[6] The panel finds that there is a nexus between the harms that the claimant fears and his imputed political opinion in favor of the LTTE. The claim will therefore be assessed pursuant to section 96 of IRPA. The test under section 96 is whether there is a serious possibility of persecution should the claimant return to Sri Lanka and the panel has found that the claimant has met that test.\nCREDIBILITY\n[7] When a claimant affirms to tell the truth, this creates a presumption of truthfulness unless there is evidence to the contrary. The claimant\u2019s testimony was consistent with his BOC, detailed, and forthright. When asked about details not set forth in his BOC, the claimant provided spontaneous detail.\n[8] The claimant testified that in 2000, the claimant, his father, and about 80-100 other males were detained and beaten by the Sri Lankan Army on suspicion of being an LTTE supporter. On June 15, 2019, the claimant was approached by Sri Lankan Army personnel at his shop, detained, and taken to a camp for questioning. The Sri Lankan authorities accused the claimant of using his shop to support a war memorial monument, which was raising funds in honor of the LTTE and Tamil families killed during a massacre in May of 2009. The authorities accused him of providing support by donating money and other items from his shop. The authorities physically assaulted the claimant. The claimant acknowledged that he had sold 100 bags of school supplies to one of two people shown by Sri Lankan authorities to the claimant, but told them that he was unaware what it would be used for and that it was not given for free. The claimant was released on June 19, 2019, but was requested to return on July 1, 2019 and then July 20, 2019. After being detained and beaten again on July 20, 2019, the claimant was released on the same day and instructed to return to the camp every two weeks. This prompted the claimant to leave Sri Lanka. Since leaving Sri Lanka, the authorities in Sri Lanka have followed up with the claimant\u2019s family inquiring about the claimant\u2019s whereabouts on multiple occasions.\n[9] The claimant produced extensive documentation in support of his claim. This includes (i) multiple letters of support from the claimant\u2019s family;[v] (ii) a letter of support from a neighboring shopkeeper;[vi] (iii) a letter of support from a Justice of Peace in Sri Lanka;[vii] (iv) documentation related to the claimant\u2019s shop, including a certificate of registration and bank statements;[viii] and (v) documentation from his interactions with U.S. border authorities on his way to Canada.[ix]\n[10] These submissions help corroborate key events in the claimant\u2019s narrative. There is no reason for the panel to cast doubt on the veracity of these submissions and as such the panel places significant weight on these submissions to support the claimant\u2019s allegations and overall claim.\n[11] In specific, the claimant established on a balance of probabilities that Sri Lankan authorities detained and beat him on two occasions because they suspected him of having supported a war memorial monument and, by extension, the LTTE.\nOBJECTIVE BASIS\n[12] The objective documentary evidence generally indicates that individuals suspected of supporting LTTE and politically sensitive memorials are targeted by authorities, and that those who are detained face mistreatment. An Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada Response to Information Request, citing other sources, notes that \u201cTamils, particularly in the North and East, reported that security forces \u201cregularly monitored and harassed\u201d community members, especially activists, journalists, and former or suspected former LTTE members.\u201d[x] The source goes on to note that:\nAustralia\u2019s DFAT states that Tamil community members reported monitoring by authorities of public gatherings and protests in the North and East, and \u201ctargeted surveillance and questioning of individuals and groups\u201d (Australia 4 Nov. 2019, para. 3.11). The same source reports that people connected to \u201cpolitically-sensitive\u201d war-related issues, such as \u201cmissing persons, land release and memorial events,\u201d are \u201cmost likely\u201d to be monitored (Australia 4 Nov. 2019, para. 3.11). Based on his visit to Sri Lanka from 18 to 26 July 2019, a UN Special Rapporteur indicated that he \u201cfrequently\u201d received reports of \u201cintimidation and surveillance\u201d in relation to peaceful protests, particularly concerning memorial services for disappeared persons in the North and East (UN 5 May 2020, para. 52). The same source provides the example of soldiers destroying and removing banners and decorations at a memorial ceremony held on 18 May 2019 by the Ampara branch of the Families of the Disappeared Organization at the Thrikovil Manikka Pillayar temple, as well as threatening to arrest and detain demonstrators (UN 5 May 2020, para. 52).[xi]\n[13] The UK Home Office notes that there is a \u201cshocking prevalence\u201d of torture and ill-treatment of detainees.[xii]\n[14] The claimant also produced country conditions documents, which, among other things, generally indicate that the situation in Sri Lanka has deteriorated for the Tamil minority since the election of Gotabaya Rajapaksa in 2019.[xiii]\n[15] Based on the claimant\u2019s testimony and the documentary evidence cited above, the panel finds that his fear of returning to Sri Lanka has an objective basis. The claimant has a well-founded fear of persecution in Sri Lanka.\nSTATE PROTECTION\n[16] The panel finds that the Sri Lankan government is the agent of persecution in this case. The country conditions cited above confirm that the state is in fact persecuting individuals like the claimant.\n[17] The panel therefore finds that the claimant has rebutted the presumption of state protection in Sri Lanka.\nINTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE (IFA)\n[18] The panel considered whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for the claimant. The agent of persecution is the Sri Lankan government. The documentary evidence cited above regarding the persecution faced by Tamils suspected of supporting politically sensitive memorials and the LTTE is not restricted to any one region of Sri Lanka, although exacerbated in the North and East of the country. The panel finds that there is a serious possibility of persecution for the claimant throughout Sri Lanka and therefore finds that there is no viable internal flight alternative.\nCONCLUSION\n[19] Having considered all of the evidence, the panel finds that there is a serious possibility of persecution by Sri Lankan authorities if the claimant returns to Sri Lanka. The panel finds the claimant to be a Convention refugee and accepts his claim.\n(signed) Suraj Balakrishnan\nSeptember 9, 2021\n[i] Exhibits 2 and 5.\n[ii] Exhibit 4.\n[iii] Id.\n[iv] Id.\n[v] Exhibit 5.\n[vi] Id.\n[vii] Id.\n[viii] Id.\n[ix] Id.\n[x] Exhibit 3, NDP 31 May 2021, Item 13.1, LKA200298.E, Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada, 17 August 2020.\n[xi] Id.\n[xii] Exhibit 3, NDP 31 May 2021, Item 4.11, Country Policy and Information Note.

        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2021 RLLR 95\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: July 22, 2021\nPanel: Robert Bafaro\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Daniel Martan Woods\nCountry: Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China\nRPD Number: TC1-01408\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2022-01778\nATIP Pages: N\/A\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: Now ready to give my decision. These are the reasons for the decision in the claim of XXXX XXXX XXXX, who claims to be a citizen of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, SAR, People\u2019s Republic of China, and is claiming refugee protection pursuant to s. 96 and 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[2] The allegations that form the basis for this refugee claim are set out in the claimant\u2019s Basis of Claim form and narrative, which is in evidence before me at Exhibit number 2. The claimant\u2019s allegations are also contained in the claimant\u2019s testimony, which he gave here this afternoon in response to a series of questions which I asked and posed to the claimant.\n[3] The claimant also provided a supplementary narrative, which is part of Exhibit 4, to further elaborate and explain the basis for his refugee claim, and that is found at page 57 and 58 of the materials at Exhibit 4.\n[4] In summary, the claimant is alleging a fear of persecution by the People\u2019s Republic of China because of his pro-democracy activism during the Umbrella Movement in Hong Kong in 2014 and also because of his pro-democracy and anti-government activities here in Canada. The claimant alleged that he has been attending protests, demonstrations, regularly every year, there are many people showing up, hundreds at least on average, speaking out against the national security law against Hong Kong government\u2019s implementation of this law, complaining and criticizing the Chinese Communist Party and its interference in the affairs of Hong Kong. He has been attending \u2014 he alleges he has been attending protests where people wave flags, calling for the independence of Hong Kong and condemning Hong Kong and the Chinese Communist Party for its repressive measures and excessive force used against pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong.\n[5] The claimant alleged that although he did participate in the Umbrella Movement protests, he was providing more or less logistical support, he was not in the front lines, he was not a public speaker at those protests or demonstrations, that he was providing more of kind of logistical support, water, towels, so to help protestors who were in need of assistance, if there was tear gas, they could wipe their eyes. So he was essentially providing them with support but not on the front lines. He was kind of working behind the scenes to support the protestors, and he alleged that he was not arrested during these protests and that his activism or his anti-government activism or pro-democracy activism, for the most part, has taken place here in Canada, where there have been many groups getting together in parks, outside of government buildings, outside of shopping malls, where they have been expressing their opinions against the national security law, condemning the Hong Kong police, condemning the Chinese government for its interference in Hong Kong affairs and trying to raise awareness in the public eye about how, essentially, life in Hong Kong has unravelled to such a degree that there is no longer any freedom of expression, freedom of the press, or freedom of assembly, and that as the claimant said in his own testimony, the situation is pretty dire and has become very much hopeless.\n[6] So, those are the main allegations that form the basis for this refugee claim. The determinative issue, as I outlined at the beginning of the hearing, was the claimant\u2019s credibility. In the Canadian refugee law, it is \u2014 there is a presumption that if a claimant gives sworn testimony, it is presumed that everything the claimant said was true unless there is persuasive evidence to the contrary. I find that in this case, based on the claimant\u2019s testimony, there was no \u2014 and all of the evidence before me, there was no persuasive evidence to the contrary. I find that there were no major contradictions or inconsistencies or omissions in his evidence or testimony or between his testimony and other evidence before me. The claimant\u2019s testimony here this afternoon was to a great extent consistent with the detailed allegations set out in his Basis of Claim form narrative at Exhibit 2 and the supplementary narrative he provided at Exhibit 4.\n[7] I found the claimant testified in a very straightforward manner, I did not find that he tried to exaggerate or embellish his evidence, even though, clearly, he had the opportunity to do so. For instance, he could have said that he was involved in many more demonstrations throughout the years in Hong Kong and he could have said he was arrested multiple times in Hong Kong, but he did not. He \u2014 I found that his testimony had the ring of truth because, in fact, he downplayed his activism in Hong Kong during the Umbrella Movement, saying he was not in the front lines, he was not actually a speaker, so he could have exaggerated and said those things, but he did not, and I think that speaks volumes in terms of establishing his credibility.\n[8] The claimant not only just relied on his own testimony to establish his claim, but he also provided documentation which I find corroborates core elements of his refugee claim. So, for instance, at Exhibit 4, he provided many photographs, social media postings, photographs of himself in a parking lot in Scarborough holding up a sign, calling for the independence of Hong Kong and on social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, WhatsApp, WeChat, as the claimant said, he shared a lot of information and sometimes he would put in his own editorial comments about what he was posting, but to a large extent, he was sharing information that was critical of the national security law that was condemning the Chinese government for its interference in Hong Kong affairs and this is reflected in the many social media posts that are part of the claimant\u2019s evidence in Exhibit 4.\n[9] The claimant also provided some documents, which I find is a very good indicator and a strong indicator of what might happen to him if he goes back to China. As the claimant said, after having been involved in all of these activities here in Canada against the Chinese government, these protests, these demonstrations, these group gatherings, sharing these critical \u2014 these anti-government commentary on social media, he actually received threats via social media and he has actually provided the social media postings that the claimant referred to in his testimony and they are a part of Exhibit 4 and specifically, there is a couple of postings on Facebook where they essentially say that the \u2014 threaten the claimant and say that he should stop posting fake news about \u2014 against China, and that if he does not, there is going to be consequences.\n[10] The claimant also provided photographs of the many protests and demonstrations that he has been attending with other people that are Hong Kongers that are supporting the cause of Hong Kong, and there is many photographs of him in front of the old city hall, in front of the criminal \u2014 old criminal courts here in downtown Toronto, in Markham, in Scarborough, Pacific \u2014 outside Pacific Mall, of demonstrations calling for a free Hong Kong, calling for the independence of Hong Kong and telling the Chinese authorities to stop persecuting Hong Kongers.\n[11] The claimant also provided his Hong Kong passport and his permanent residence identity card, which I find establishes, on a balance of probabilities, that he is who he claims to be, that he is a resident of Hong Kong, that that is where he was born and raised and that is where he \u2014 and it is with respect to China that he is still recognized as a citizen and of no other country. So, the claimant\u2019s personal and national identity was established to my satisfaction on a balance of probabilities.\n[12] And some of these other photographs that, again, demonstrate the high level of activism of the claimant and the many demonstrations and protests he attended here in Toronto are found at Exhibit 12 and then there is further photographic evidence at Exhibit 13 and there are photographs of the claimant himself, in fact, attending a protest just the other day, very recent photographs of protests at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, where there is a pretty large number of people assembled and it is clear that this is like a \u2014 some kind of a commemoration or peaceful kind of protest or to commemorate what has been happening in Hong Kong, they are all wearing t-shirts to commemorate the cause in Hong Kong.\n[13] So, in light of all of this evidence, I find that the claimant has established that he does have a valid subjective fear of persecution in Hong Kong. I also find that he \u2014 his subjective fear in Hong Kong at the hands of the Hong Kong police, at the hands of the Chinese authorities, since the national security law was passed in 2020, that his fear of persecution in the country is objectively well-founded. I find that there is a reasonable chance, a serious possibility that he would face persecution if he returned to the country based on his political opinions and his political activities against the government of Hong Kong. And I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to s. 96, as there exists a serious possibility of persecution should he return to Hong Kong, China, on account of his political opinion.\n[14] Clearly, I find that there is also a nexus between his subjective fear and one of the grounds set out in s. 96, under the 1951 Convention, that being the ground of political opinion. Considering that I find that the claimant is a credible witness and that he testified credibly coupled with the documentary evidence that he provided as well as the country documentation in evidence, which is before me, I find that the claimant has established a future risk of persecution should he return to the country, and I find that he faces a serious possibility of arrest, detention and \u2014 or even worse, state violence.\n[15] Now, one of the reasons why I find that the claimant\u2019s fear of persecution in Hong Kong is objectively well-founded and why I find that he has good grounds to fear persecution in Hong Kong has to do with the fact that he has been here in Canada since 2015, he has been involved in all these different anti-government groups, been attending all these protests, speaking out against the government on social media by sharing these posts, going to demonstrations where flags are being raised, calling for the independence of Hong Kong, that these activities are more likely than not have come to the attention of the authorities. And even in the evidence, which is before me here this afternoon, there is a very strong indication that the authorities in China already know about what the claimant has been doing here in Canada, he has received threats via social media telling him to stop spreading fake news about the Chinese government and that if he does not stop doing this, there is going to be consequences.\n[16] The \u2014 there is evidence in the National Documentation Package, and, I mean, this is a matter public knowledge, it is very well-known that the Chinese government, the Communist Party of China, that they spy on their nationals who are living abroad, they engage in espionage, they use sophisticated software to monitor and keep people under surveillance in order to suppress political dissent, and the objective country information supports this. I was reading in a report, it is the Department of State report on Hong Kong, item 2.1 in the NDP, and it says activists claim that the SAR increasingly used legal tools such as denial of bail and pursuing minor charges to detain pro-democracy figures. In one such case, the courts denied Jimmy Li (ph) bail for fraud charges, which is a civil offence. While in custody, security forces charged Li with foreign collusion under the national security legislation, a provision that is not well-defined, and then it goes on to say that the government of China is actually carrying out politically motivated reprisals against individuals who are not even inside the country, that are outside the country. It goes on to say that the national security law is not restricted to the Hong Kong area or its residence, but instead, claims jurisdiction over any individual regardless of location deemed to be engaging in one of the four criminal activities under the national security law. Suasions, subversion, terrorist activities or collusion with a foreign country or external elements to endanger national security.\n[17] In August, the national security forces reportedly issued warrants for six individuals, all residing abroad, one of whom had foreign citizenship and had resided outside of Hong Kong in mainland China for more than 20 years. Although reported in state-controlled media, the government refused to acknowledge the existence of the warrants. So, this is a good example of how the authority of the Chinese Communist Party extends even beyond the borders and territory of China and how they even monitor the activities of people that are outside the country and will engage in extra-judicial, a type of measures, in order to make these people be silent, to stop speaking out against the government and which, in this case, according to this report, suggests they are issuing warrants in absensia, when the person is not even in the country, calling for that person\u2019s arrest when they come back, so they can be prosecuted under the national security law.\n[18] And then it goes on to say that the law \u2014 there is a section in the Department of State report \u2014 deals with unlawful interference, with privacy, family, home or correspondence, and it says the law prohibits such actions, but there were reports that the Hong Kong government failed to respect these prohibitions, including credible reports that Chinese central government security services and the Beijing mandated office for safeguarding national security monitored pro-democracy and human rights activists and journalists in Hong Kong.\n[19] There is also \u2014 I also looked at a report, it is item 1.11 in the NDP, and it is a report on how the Chinese government treats its critics and how it treats people that engage in anti-government activity. And it basically confirms what the claimant has been saying, is that even though he is many miles away from China and he is here in Canada, and he has been participating in all of these anti-government activities, the Chinese government already knows about it and in this particular passage that I am going to read, it is clear that the government of China, the Communist Party of China, has the knowledge, the know-how, the technical expertise to be able to do that, and in this report, 1.11, and it is s. 8 that deals with internet, social media and bloggers. It says the Chinese government maintains a sophisticated censorship apparatus, including both automated mechanisms and human monitors to block online criticism of individuals, policies or events considered integral to the one-party system. Several social media and communication apps are inaccessible from inside China without circumvention tools and a crackdown on those tools was underway during the reporting period, websites and social media accounts are subject to deletion or closure at the request of Chinese censorship authorities, and internet companies are required to monitor and delete problematic content or face punishment. The cyber-security law passed during the reporting period requires network operators to immediately stop transmission of banned content, and what is interesting about this report that I have read is the claimant himself testified that he was using an app on his phone to communicate with people. This is the We app, which is a Chinese app, and he said that all of a sudden, without any warning, to his surprise, all of the content from his WeChat app had been deleted and it seems more likely than not that this is the work of the Chinese government, and \u2014 because they have the technical ability to do this and they regularly monitor online activities of people they consider to be a threat or they consider to be dissidents or anti-government.\n[20] And it goes on to say that with the rise of the internet, while the rise of the internet has created a non-traditional space for expression of political opinion in China, authorities have developed and applied increasingly sophisticated methods to limit online expressions of dissent. Chinese security apparatus invests heavily in monitoring controlling the internet with many foreign websites, including Facebook, Twitter, Google, and many foreign media sites blocked. Recent regulations have also cracked down on the use of virtual private networks, a means by which Chinese citizens and companies have gained access to banned sites by rooting their searches through a foreign server. And then it goes on to talk about, again, how powerful the security apparatus of the Chinese Communist Party is and how far it can extend. It goes on to say that the law states that the freedom of \u2014 freedom and privacy of correspondence of citizens are protected by law, but authorities often did not respect the privacy of citizens. In fact, the government passed new civil codes scheduled to enter into force on January 1st, 2021, that introduces articles on the right to privacy and personal information protection. Although the law requires warrants before officers can search premises, officials frequently ignore this requirement. The PSB, the Public Security Bureau, and prosecutors are authorized to issue search warrants on their own authority without judicial review. There continue to be reports of cases of forced entry by police officers.\n[21] And then finally, it says authorities monitored telephone calls, text messages, faxes, email, instant messaging and other digital communications intended to remain private. Authorities opened and censored domestic and international mail. Security services routinely monitored and entered residences and offices to gain access to computers, telephone, and fax machines. Foreign journalists leaving the country found some of their personal belongings searched, and in some cases, when material deemed politically sensitive was uncovered, the journalists had to sign a statement stating that they would voluntarily leave these documents in the country.\n[22] So, when you consider that the claimant has been engaged in these anti-government activities online, which are very heavily monitored by the Chinese government, I think that it is very highly likely that the government already knows about his activities here in Canada and they are keeping an eye on him and that if he goes back to the country, that it is very highly likely that he will be arrested and detained and interrogated and mistreated by the authorities because of his anti-government activities here in Canada, which he has been engaged in since 2015.\n[23] Now, the claimant has, in his testimony, often talked about the national security law and how he is against the national security law and how, essentially, it has unravelled the freedoms that used to exist in Hong Kong and has destroyed the democratic fabric which used to exist in Hong Kong when people could openly and freely express their opinions and views on any matter and the \u2014 there is a Human Rights Watch report that talks about the national security law and how it has changed the environment in Hong Kong. And it goes on to say Human Rights Watch highlights the criminalization of peaceful speech and activities under the national security law. [24] The national security law punishes four types of activities; suasion, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces all carrying a maximum sentence of life in prison. Article 35 also states that anyone convicted of crimes under the law will be deprived of the right to run for public office for life. The definitions of these crimes are very broad and vague. Subversion, for example, criminalizes any act that seriously interferes, disrupts, or undermines the functioning of the Chinese of Hong Kong governments, a definition that can readily include peaceful protests. Both the crimes of suasion and subversion make criminal acts that do not involve force or threat or force, meaning that peaceful actions such as speeches, advocating, these ideas can violate the law.\n[25] Mainland authorities have long used these vague crimes against people in China for promoting human rights. For example, the late Nobel Peace Prizer \u2014 prize winner Liu Ziobo (ph) was sentenced to 11 years in prison for inciting subversion after he organized a joint letter calling for political reforms. The economist Ilham Toti (ph) has been imprisoned for life for separatism because he spoke out for the equal treatment of ethnic Uyghurs. On the basis of this objective country evidence, I find that the claimant\u2019s profile as an anti-government and pro-democracy activist whose activities run counter to the interests of the Communist Party of China, means that he faces a serious possibility of being arrested, charged and detained under the national security law, should he return to Hong Kong, China.\n[26] I find that the national security law and its enforcement infringe the claimant\u2019s human rights by criminalizing peaceful speech and activities and that his arrest, detention, and prosecution under the law would amount to persecution for his political opinions. The United States Department of State report reports numerous cases in 2019 of human rights activists charged with subversion of state power or incitement to subvert state power in the mainland China, receiving significant prison sentences. As the national security law entrenches upon the previous degree of autonomy, rule of law, and human rights enjoyed by Hong Kong in the past, I find that the claimant additionally faces a serious possibility of these types of abuses faced by human rights activists in mainland China.\n[27] Finally, with respect to the issues of state protection and internal flight, since the agent of persecution in this case very clearly is the state, I find that adequate state protection would not be reasonably forthcoming to the claimant in his particular circumstances.\n[28] Finally, I have also considered whether the claimant would have a viable internal flight alternative in any other part of China or Hong Kong. On the evidence before me and given that the agent of persecution is the state, it is the Chinese government, it is the Hong Kong government, and that the state has effective control over the entire territory, both mainland China and Hong Kong, I find that there is a serious possibility \u2014 the claimant faces a serious possibility of persecution throughout China and Hong Kong.\n[29] For those reasons, I find the claimant does not have a realistic, attainable, or reasonable internal flight alternative anywhere in China.\n[30] In light of what I have said already, I conclude that the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to s. 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, and accordingly, I accept his claim.\n[31] I wanted to thank Madam Interpreter for her assistance. Thank you, everybody, for your participation in this hearing. This matter is now concluded.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013\n",

The details of the allegations, specifically of the problems that the claimant faced while living in the Czech Republic, are set out in his Basis of Claim form and amendment to that form.\n[2] In summary, the claimant is a twenty-nine-year-old man who was born in Germany on the XXXX XXXX XXXX, 1992. The claimant is a Czech citizen of Roma ethnicity. The claimant alleges that he suffered racism and discrimination while living in the Czech Republic due to his Roma ethnicity. On the XXXX XXXX XXXX, 2020, the claimant entered Canada and filed a refugee claim following his arrival.\nDetermination\n[3] After considering all of the evidence before me, I find the claimant is a Convention refugee because he faces a serious possibility of persecution in the Czech Republic. I make this finding based on the problems that the claimant faced, as a person of Roma ethnicity while living in that country, and the problems he\u2019s likely to face upon return.\n[4] The panel looked into whether the claimant can acquire German citizenship, given that he was born in that country. However, after examining the objective evidence and herein the claimant\u2019s testimony, I determine this is not a possibility. The claimant has been assessed only in regards to the Czech Republic. In terms of identity, I find the claimant is a citizen of the Czech Republic.\n[5] I rely on his passport and his sworn testimony. In terms of his ethnic identity, relying on the documentary evidence provided, as well as the claimant\u2019s oral testimony, I find that he is of Romani ethnicity. In terms of credibility, the claimant testified in a direct and straightforward manner. There were no inconsistencies between his oral testimony, his Basis of Claim form, or in any of the other evidence before me, and his oral evidence and the Basis of Claim form has consistency with the objective documentary evidence on country conditions.\n[6] When looking at subjective fear, I consider the previous trips to Canada, however, the claimant gave a reasonable explanation for why he did not file the claim on the previous trips, and I draw no negative inference. In terms of the objective basis for the claimant\u2019s fear, I rely on the documentary evidence provided by counsel on country conditions, as well as the information in the National Documentation Package.\n[7] Item 2.1 of the National Documentation Package for the Czech Republic indicates that hate crimes against Roma and minorities continue to be a problem in that country, and consistent with the claimant\u2019s evidence, it confirms that the Roma population in the Czech Republic faced discrimination in employment, education, housing, and healthcare.\n[8] I believe the claimant faced the problems which he described in his narrative and oral testimony, and I find that he faced these problems because of his Roma ethnicity. I find the cumulative acts of discrimination that he experienced rises to the level of persecution. The claimant also testified that he was physically attacked and described these attacks in his oral testimony and also in detail in his Basis of Claim form.\n[9] I find that the claimant faces a serious possibility of persecution in the Czech Republic should he return based on his Roma ethnicity. The claimant wrote in his narrative and also testified that he made attempts to seek protection from the police to no avail and the claimant believes this is because he is of Roma ethnicity, that\u2019s why the police did not investigate.\n[10] Having reviewed the evidence on country conditions, I am mindful of the strides and measures being taken by the Czech Republic to improve the situation of the Roma people. However, I find that the effective of these policies have not yet been adequately measured and reported on. Therefore, given the current conditions in that country, I find that the claimant would not face adequate state protection and that he has rebutted the presumption of state protection.\n[11] I also find he would not have a viable Internal Flight Alternative. I base this on the fact that the conditions that individuals of Roma ethnicity face exists throughout the Czech Republic. Based on the foregoing, I find that, as I stated, the claimant faces a serious possibility of persecution in the Czech Republic because of his Roma ethnicity. I therefore declare him to be a Convention refugee and accept his claim pursuant to Section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

The allegations are detailed in the claimant\u2019s Basis of Claim narrative found at Exhibit 2 as well as the amended Basis of Claim narrative inform found at Exhibit 5. In essence, the claimant alleged that he faces a risk of detention and cruel treatment from Sri Lankan authorities due to his perceived support of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, LTTE. The Panel finds that the claimant is a Convention refugee under s. 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. The Panel finds that the claimant has established his personal and national identity by way of the copy of his national identity card and birth certificate, seized by CBSA and copies are found in Exhibit 1. A colour copy of the national ID can also be found at Exhibit 4. The Panel also relies on the additional identity documents contained in Exhibit 7 provided by the claimant which includes the claimant\u2019s family registration card and (inaudible) record sheet. The claimant\u2019s testimony was consistent with regards to his personal details.\n[2] The claim alleged fears stem from the Sri Lankan authorities perception of him as a supporter of the LTTE group because he repaired of a figure of Tamil armed struggle and due to his profile as a young Tamil man. As such, the Panel finds that the claim has nexus to the Convention grounds political opinion, race and membership in a particular social group.\n[3] In assessing credibility, the Panel is mindful of the particular circumstances of the claimant that may impact his ability to give testimony. The claimant alleges that he suffered head injuries that impact his ability to immediately recall details, the claimant also provided reports for mental health professionals indicating that the claimant has been diagnosed with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX by family physician and that his symptoms results in emotional distress and difficulties in daily cognition such as concentration in memory. The Panel finds that the claimant is credible with respect to the core allegations of his claim, that he is a young Tamil man from the north, that he worked as a XXXX and then in that capacity he carried out repair XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX of a Tamil leader who engaged in arms struggle. As a result, the claimant was detained and mistreated by Sri Lankan authorities and the claimant made unsuccessful attempts to flee Sri Lanka.\n[4] In 2018, the claimant was targeted again after participating in ceremony commemorating the death of a local Tamil advocate. And later that year, he was attacked by a criminal organization and was subsequently arrested by authorities who accused him of being connected to the criminal organization and to the LTTE. The claimant did not provide any official documentation for operating his mistreatment from Sri Lankan authorities explaining that he did not receive any official documents and that one of the conditions of his release was that he would not seek out medical treatment. He provided a letter from his wife and father and brother and affidavits from his father and brother, corroborating the events in his narrative. The claimant also provided a letter from his former employer who corroborates the work that he did XXXX XXXX XXXX and that the claimant\u2019s family informed the employer that the claimant had been detained. When the employer inquired why the claimant was not attending work, the employer also corroborates seeing the claim when he was released from detention and described his injuries. The Panel provided photographs of his injuries as well at Exhibit 7.\n[5] So the Panel finds that the statements from the claimant\u2019s father, his brother and the former employee are probative in establishing the mistreatment that the claimant faced at the hands of Sri Lankan authorities. The claimant provided a letter from a relative whom he alleges that he hid with while arranging his exit from Sri Lanka. The letter is inconsistent the Basis of Claim narrative and as it indicates that the issues that forced the claimant into hiding stems from him fixing the statue to whereas the Basis of Claim indicates that the event that led to the claimant into hiding stemmed from his brother reporting a criminal group and then the police \u2014 and then the claimant facing harassment from Sri Lankan authorities. The Panel brought this inconsistency to the claimant\u2019s detention and the cream claimant that he stayed at his relative\u2019s house on more than one occasion and in submissions Counsel indicated that the event involving the statue could reasonably be interpreted as the reason why the claimant went into hiding because it was what initiated the claimant\u2019s mistreatment from Sri Lankan authorities.\n[6] And in assessing the explanations, the claimant\u2019s explanations results in a significant omission from the claimant Basis of Claim, that he hit with the relative on other occasions which the claimant did not mention in the Basis of Claim. And this suggests that a negative credit inference should be drawn. However, it\u2019s mitigated by the documented memory problems of the claimant that developed after his head injury. The Panel also questioned the claimant whether Sri Lankan authorities came to look for him at his relatives home and the claimant indicated that they did not. The Panel brought to the claimant\u2019s detention that the letter from his relative indicates that the Sri Lankan authorities did come to look for him when \u2014 and he was hiding in the attic. When that inconsistency was brought to the claimant\u2019s detention, he explained maybe the army did come to look for him but he has no knowledge of that because no one told him and he spent his time in the attic. The Panel does not draw a negative inference from this inconsistency. The claimant previously testified about spending time in the attic and that his family began to arrange his exit from Sri Lanka after authorities look for him at his family home, whereas the letter indicates that his family began to our arrange his exit from Sri Lanka when authorities came to look for at his relative\u2019s home.\n[7] So I find that the detail of whether the army looked for him at his relatives home or his family home or both, it\u2019s a minor inconsistent detail of the consistent allegations that the claimant\u2019s family arranged for him to leave the country because the authorities were seeking him out. The claimant\u2019s knowledge of where they were seeking him out is second hand knowledge. So the Panel does not expect a high degree of certainty and can expect some inconsistencies to arise between the claimant\u2019s account of events event and his relative\u2019s account of events. Overall, I find that these inconsistencies presented in the relative\u2019s letter do not and impugn the claimant\u2019s credibility. The Panel questioned the claimant\u2019s apparent ability to return to Sri Lanka twice without issue when he tried to flee the country in 2018. He alleged he was unable to complete his journey and the Panel asked the claimant about his failure to assert a claim for protection in Hong Kong or Singapore before returning to Sri Lanka.\n[8] Taking into account the claimant\u2019s experiences and his mental state, the Panel does not draw negative inference from the claimant\u2019s failure to claim in Hong Kong or Singapore. In the context of this claim, the claimant had recently faced mistreatment from Sri Lankan authorities and it\u2019s reasonable that he would follow the instructions of his agents to return rather than to ask authorities who are unknown to him in Singapore or Hong Kong for aid. Moreover, given the country documentation regarding corruption in Sri Lanka at Exhibit 3 Item 7.6, it is not implausible that the claimant\u2019s agent would be able to arrange for the claimant to return without issue from airport authorities once it was learned that the claimant would not be able to continue on his journey. Item 14.1 of Exhibit 3 speaks to mistreatment of Tamils that they face when returning to Sri Lanka. That document does not establish that Tamils returning to Sri Lanka from abroad are mistreated in all cases. So in assessing the claimant\u2019s test and in view of the totality of the evidence, the Panel considers these inconsistencies and the evidence to be limited, mostly to these single letter found at Exhibit 7 from the claimant\u2019s relative. And it does not impugn the claimant\u2019s overall credibility.\n[9] Overall, the claimant\u2019s testimony, it was fluid, unrehearsed and it contained spontaneous details tangential to the allegations and his Basis of Claim. The Panel accepts the claimant\u2019s allegations and finds on a balance of probabilities that he is considered a person of interest to Sri Lankan authorities because of their perception of him as connected to the LTTE. As such, the Panel finds that the claimant has a subjective fear of return to Sri Lanka. The claimant\u2019s subjective fear is based and grounded in the objective evidence, the objective evidence shows ongoing abuses against perceived supporters of the LTTE. Sources indicate that impunity for such abuses persist and that many persons who were alleged to have committed crimes, serious crimes against Tamil individuals are now in government positions. Suspected sympathizers of the LTTE are still subject to arbitrary arrest and there is ample evidence of Tamils being monitored abroad and being suspected of having links to the LTTE upon their return to Sri Lanka. Even returning Tamils who have a low profile and are only connected to the LTTE through a historical association such as the claimant have been targeted and Tamil returnees who claim refugee status abroad and returned to Sri Lanka are sometimes interrogated and detained at the airport. So I find that the claimant, if he were to return to Sri Lanka, he would continue to be suspected of having links to the LTTE because of his age, his ethnicity, his place of origins and his past detention. The Panel finds that the claimant has established that he would face a serious possibility of persecution based on his perceived support of the LTTE if he were to return to Sri Lanka, thus the claimant is well founded.\n[10] In terms of state protection, Amnesty International reports that Tamils continue to complain of ethnic profiling, surveillance and harassment by police who suspect them of having LTTE links, police continue to be accused of abusive practices against the Tamil population. Given this, I find that the claimant genuine in his ethnicity and his history and where he lives in the country would not have access to adequate state protection should he return to Sri Lanka? Moreover, the agents of persecution include the Sri Lankan army has a nationwide reach and which is in effect a state itself, I therefore find that the claimant would face a serious possibility of persecution throughout Sri Lanka. The objective evidence previously referred to shows that failed refugee claimants, especially Tamil men, face the possibility of interrogation upon return. So accordingly, I find that the claimant would not have a viable internal flight alternative if he were to return to Sri Lanka. And based on the above analysis, the Panel finds that the claimant is a Convention refugee under s. 96. The claim is accepted. That concludes the reasons.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013\n",

The principal claimant alleges that he and the associate claimants are citizens of Yemen who have lived most of their lives in Saudi Arabia with precarious foreign residency status. They have lost their right to residence in Saudi Arabia and are not at risk of deportation to Yemen. They fear for their lives if they have to return to Yemen because of their imputed political opinion as perceived supporters of the Saudis who are the enemies of the Houthis in Yemen.\n[6] The principal and associated claimants also have Turkish passports and identity cards. They claim, however, that the passports were improbably obtained by the principal claimant\u2019s father through a bribe to a Turkish official. The claimants have never lived in Turkey or used the passports and have no desire to settler there.\n[7] The minor claimant, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, did not submit any evidence of make any submission with respect to his country of citizenship in the United States. The Panel finds that the designated representative instructions in this regard were clear, voluntary, and informed.\n[8] So, the decision. It is a split decision. The Panel finds that the principal and the associate claimants are not Turkish citizens because their passports were obtained improperly. The Panel finds that the principal and associate claimants have established that they face a serious possibility of persecution because of their imputed political opinion if they return to Yemen and are Convention refugees pursuant to s. 96 of the IRPA.\n[9] Their claims are accepted.\n[10] The Panel finds that the minor claimant, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX does not face a serious possibility of persecution or a danger of torture or a risk to his life or cruel or unusual treatment or punishment pursuant to s. 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, should he return to the United States, so his claim is denied.\nIdentity\n[11] The Panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the principal claimant and the associate claimant are citizens of Yemen based on the copies of their Yemeni passports in Exhibit 1. The Panel finds that the principal and the associate claimants are not citizens of Turkey based on the documents in Exhibit 7. The Panel finds that the minor child, XXXX, is a citizen of the United States of America based on the copy of his US passport in Exhibit 1.\nCredibility\n[12] Based on the documents in the file and the testimony today, including the principal claimant\u2019s detailed Basis of Claim narrative, the Panel finds there is no serious credibility issues. On a balance of probabilities, the Panel finds that the following allegations are true. The principal claimant was born in Yemen but moved to Saudi Arabia when his father found work there. The associate claimant was also born in Yemen. The principal claimant did his postsecondary study in Yemen and left just before the war broke out between the Saudis and Houthis. He returned to Saudi Arabia to work in the field of XXXX XXXX XXXX and married the associate claimant.\n[13] Saudi Arabia increased restrictions on resident sponsorships for foreigners like the principal and associate claimants, and they began exploring potentially leaving Yemen if they ever lost their right to residence in Saudi Arabia.\n[14] They obtained a US visa to go to the US to study English in 2019. The minor claimant was born in the US in XXXX 2019. They returned to Saudi Arabia, and the principal claimant became concerned of the possibility of losing his Saudi employment due to increasing Saudization of the workforce.\n[15] Around this time, the principal claimant\u2019s father applied for Turkish citizenship for them through an investor program for the principal and associate claimants. They were issued Turkish passports in September 2019, valid until September 2029. The evidence in a legal opinion from a Turkish law firm in Exhibit 7 tab 1, in the father\u2019s letters in Exhibit 6 tab 8 and Exhibit 7 tab 2 indicate that the father obtained passports for his son and daughter-in-law, improperly. He is currently selling the properties that he bought in breach of the minimum three-year investment requirement under the Turkish immigration provisions.\n[16] The claimants decided to flee to Canada, they tried a second time to obtain a Canadian TRV, but again, were refused. They then returned to the US on their US visa and immediately travelled overland to the Canadian border to claim refugee protection in XXXX 2020.\n[17] The Panel accepts the reasonable the claimant\u2019s explanation for failing to claim asylum in the US for the particular circumstances of this claim in which the Panel finds that the claim raises no credibility concerns, and the claimants always intended to claim refugee protection in Canada and transited to Canada shortly after arriving in the US.\n[18] The Panel finds that the principal claimant\u2019s evidence with respect to the fear of return to Yemen was internally consistent and plausible. There were no contradictions or omissions that go to the core of the claim. The Panel accepts the claimants are unable to return to Saudi Arabia and are at risk of deportation to Yemen. The Panel also accepts that the principal and associate claimants do not have any status in Turkey.\n[19] The allegations were supported by personal documents in Exhibit 6 and 7 that the Panel finds credible. For example, Exhibit 6 includes important identity documents and a letter from the principal claimant\u2019s father explaining the Turkish passports. Exhibit 7 includes a termination of employment letter for the principal claimant\u2019s Saudi employer, and a legal opinion regarding the improper acquisition of Turkish passports, and updated information from the father as he terminates his investments in Turkey.\n[20] The Panel accepts the evidence as establishing, on a balance of probabilities, the principal and the associate claimants\u2019 subjective fear of persecution because of their imputed political opinion at the hands of Yemen authorities should they have to return to Yemen.\n[21] So, I now want to return to the objective basis. I will just quickly deal with Saudi Arabia. According to the objective documentary evidence for Saudi Arabia in Exhibit 3.2, the NDP package Saudi Arabia, Saudi Arabia does not grant citizenship to people in claimant\u2019s circumstances and does not offer permanent residence status for foreigners. I am satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, the claimants had only temporary status in Saudi Arabia as long as the claimant was employed or his father included the claimant as part of his sponsorship arrangements.\n[22] Turning to Yemen, the objective documentary evidence indicates that Yemeni citizens, such as the claimants, who have been living in Saudi Arabia, are likely to be regarded with hostility and suspicion by the current governing forces in militias or pro-Houthi armed groups operating in Yemen, and other forces allied with the former Saleh government, and those opposing the Saudi-led coalition forces, which view Saudi Arabia as an opposing power in current conflict. This is especially true in Sana\u2019a, where the claimants are from. Yemen is a site of an ongoing civil armed conflict involving Houthi rebels, primarily from the Northern region and forces loyal to the international recognized government.\n[23] The Panel has reviewed the totality of the documentary evidence in the Yemeni National Documentation Package and finds that those who are perceived as opponents of the current Houthi governing forces, including those perceived as supportive of the former regime and those aligned with Saudi Arabia, are at risk of violence from Houthi militias and other forces allied with the former Saleh government.\n[24] These risks include death, disappearance, detention, and kidnapping for ransom. UN group of experts documented the Houthis detaining anyone \u2018engaged in activities perceived as opposed to or not endorsing their war effort.\u2019 I can refer to item 2.1, the US Department of States Report which confirms the hostility, and civilian casualties, and damage to the infrastructure, and the dire humanitarian situation in Yemen. There is lots of information about the ongoing human rights issues in Yemen, beginning and throughout the DOS report.\n[25] If I look at item 2.4, which is the Human Rights Watch World Report on events of 2019. This is a quote \u2018Houthi forces, the Yemeni government, the UAE, and different UA,\u2019 just one second, this may not be the part that I want to include, no. I think I will just go back to the refer to the US DOS report, which points to unlawful or arbitrary killings, including political assassinations, forced disappearances, torture, arbitrary arrest, and detention, harsh and life-threatening prison conditions, political prisoners, arbitrary infringements on privacy rights, et cetera, et cetera. There is impunity for security officials, which remains a problem, in part, because the government exercises limited authority, in part, due to the lack of effective mechanisms to investigate and prosecute abuse and corruption. And non-state actors, including the Houthis, of course, commit significant abuses with impunity.\n[26] So, the Panel finds that the totality of the objective documentary evidence supports the conclusion that the claimants fear of returning to Yemen is well-founded and that they face a serious possibility of persecution including disappearance, arbitrary detention, torture, kidnapping for ransom, and death.\n[27] Turning briefly to state protection. The Panel finds that it would be unreasonable for the claimants to seek the protection of the state in the current circumstances. The central state of Yemen has either collapsed or lost control of large segments or territory, disregard for the rule of law is widespread, and impunity is pervasive throughout the country.\n[28] The internationally recognized government has been unable to secure the whole of the territory. Houthi rebels are reported to control most of the security apparatus and state institutions, and therefore, the Panel finds the claimants have rebutted the presumption of state protection with clear and convincing evidence.\n[29] In turning to the internal flight alternative, the Panel also finds that the harm feared by the claimants are not restricted to any particular area of the country. The conflict exists throughout the country and the militias and Houthis and other armed groups are present throughout the country. Therefore, the claimants face a serious possibility of persecution throughout Yemen, and there is no viable internal flight alternative.\n[30] So, in conclusion, the Panel finds that the principal and associate claimants are not Turkish citizens, because their passports were obtained improperly. The Panel finds that the principal and the associate claimants have established that they face a serious possibility of persecution because of their imputed political opinion if they return to Yemen, and they are, therefore, Convention refugees pursuant to s.96 of IRPA. Their claims are accepted.\n[31] The Panel finds that minor claimant, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, does not face a serious possibility of persecution or danger of torture or risk to his life or cruel or unusual treatment or punishment pursuant to s. 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act should he return to the United States, so his claim is denied.\n[32] So, thank you very much.\n[33] Okay, so thanks a lot and good luck.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013\n",

You are claiming to be a citizen of Colombia and are claiming refugee protection pursuant to s. 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. I have considered your testimony and the other evidence in the case and I am ready to render my decision orally. The written decision will come to you shortly and maybe amended to include specific citations to exhibits in case law as needed.\n[2] The Panel has determined that the claimant is a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection pursuant to s. 96 and 97(1) of IRPA. You allege that you are a citizen of Colombia and that you fear harm in Colombia from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, also known as FARC, dissidents who are targeting you because of your work with vulnerable communities who are victims of war. You allege that there is no state protection for you or an internal flight alternative.\n[3] Your personal identity as a citizen of Colombia has been established by our testimony and the supporting documents filed in Exhibit 1, namely your genuine passport from Colombia. I find, based on a balance of probabilities, that identity and country of reference have been established.\n[4] I find that there is a link between what you fear and one of the five grounds, namely membership in a particular social group as a social activist. I have therefore assessed the claim under s. 96.\n[5] I find you to be a credible witness. Your testimony was clear and consistent with the written narrative and evidence on file. You established that in 2018 you graduated from the XXXX XXXX XXXX with a diploma in XXXX. As a requirement for your graduation, you started a project in 2016 that involved interviewing migrants who moved to a city due to the increasing violence caused by the FARC. You established that after graduation you continued to work with the vulnerable communities of Caloto and Santander de Quilichao, particularly with victims of war.\n[6] You spoke passionately about your desire to give the people in these communities who are minorities a voice and how you have a personal connection to this cause because your family had also fled their community for the same reasons. You spoke spontaneously and in detailed and knowledgeable manner about the challenges faced by those displaced by FARC and what makes the specific communities you worked with vulnerable. You spoke with convincing clarity about the type of work you were doing that involved XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.\n[7] You established that the FARC considered you to be a social leader. You first received a call in 2016 warning you to be careful about what you wrote about in your school project. You continued to receive calls in 2017 warning you to stop and telling you they were aware of your activity. As a result, you stopped your project for two months. In 2019, you received multiple calls from FARC telling you to stop your work in the communities of Caloto and Santander de Quilichao. They threatened you to stop visiting these areas or working with former combatants and to leave the area. They called you a meddler and declared you a military target, informing you that they would double their surveillance on you. As a result, you stopped working completely.\n[8] I know that your claim is supported by the following documents: a letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (ph) certifying that she was a migrant who was interviewed by you as part of your graduation thesis from January 2016 to September 2017, letters from participants in your workshops that took place in Guapi and Cauca, letters from your family members, a letter from the organization XXXX XXXX XXXX that you had volunteered with, and a copy of your reports to the prosecutor\u2019s office and the Attorney General\u2019s office.\n[9] Accordingly, on the whole, in terms of your general credibility, I found you to be a credible witness and I accept \u2014 I therefore accept what you have alleged in your oral testimony and Basis of Claim form based on a balance of probabilities. Your subjective fear is established by your credible and corroborated testimony.\n[10] I also find that your claim is objectively well-founded. Item 7.37 in the NDP reports civilians in various parts of the country suffered serious abuses at the hands of the FARCs, FARC dissidents, and paramilitary successor groups and the human rights defenders, journalists, indigenous, and Afro-Colombian leaders and other community activists face pervasive death threats and violence.\n[11] Item 1.8 in the most recent NDP for Colombia States following. According to the Human Rights Watch, since the demobilization of FARC, community activists face death threats and violence, mostly from guerilla groups and successor groups, and perpetrators are rarely held accountable.\n[12] The Office of the Ombudsman identify leaders of victims and displaced persons and human activists are some of the most vulnerable groups due to their activities in the context of the armed conflict. Targeting these profiles are motivated by the drive to eliminate threats to their interests by social leaders who social and community involvement concerns issues such as land restitution and the return of displaced land to their people \u2014 displaced people to their lands.\n[13] I find that the objective evidence is consistent with your subjective fear. Therefore, based on the totality of evidence, I find, on a balance of probabilities, your fear has an objective basis and is well-founded.\nState Protection\n[14] There is a presumption of state protection unless the country is in a state of complete breakdown. This can be rebutted with clear and convincing evidence that the protection would not be reasonably forthcoming.\n[15] You testified that you attempted to seek state protection and were told that you were not \u2014 that there were not enough resources to protect you and that they would send someone to your area if possible. They also told you to call in case of an emergency.\n[16] The country conditions reveal item 7.37 in the NDP indicates that the FARC commonly kills without warning. Accessing state protection is really hard for those targeted by criminal groups due to a very high threshold for eligibility and a certain amount of public exposure is required for known leaders. Many community leaders do not receive threats or do not report them to the prosecutor, which is a requirement for them to receive protection.\n[17] Item 2.13 further states that demobilization of FARC was not accompanied by the mobilization and integrated presence of the state in the areas previously under its control. This inaction of the state allowed illegal armed groups and criminal groups to reorganize power around illicit economies. Defenders of human rights have become the targets of attacks, and they lack effective state protection. The delays, lack of political determination, and failure to allocate sufficient funds for the implementation of the peace agreement which prioritizes, among other things, the dismantling of these groups and the integrated presence of the state, is undoubtedly one of the key structural causes that keeps human rights defenders at risk.\n[18] These reports establish groups regularly target social and community leaders who they see as threats to their control over an area or population or threats to their interest. The report also discloses that there are swift and severe consequences for those who go to the police. The reports also establish an inability of the Colombian authorities to provide protection to those facing threats from gangs and guerilla groups.\n[19] I find that your experiences are consistent with the country documentation. Based on your personal circumstances and the country documentation, I find that you have rebutted the presumption of state protection and that it is not forthcoming to you.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[20] I have a considered whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for you. With respect to the first prong, I find that there is a serious risk of persecution or risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment in Colombia. You testified that you were declared a military target and that the FARC dissidents were able to locate you and informed you that they had knowledge of your whereabouts, activities, even the way you were dressed.\n[21] Items 7.1 of the NDP describes being a military objective means that one\u2019s life and physical integrity and freedom is endangered. The evidence also establishes they or any groups that are targeting you have the motivation to find you. You have filed police complaints and protection requests which is something all groups in Colombia take very seriously and try to respond to with severe consequences.\n[22] On the second prong, I find that you \u2014 it would not be reasonable in all the circumstances for you to reside in the IFA, because you testified that if you returned to Colombia you would continue to advocate for the rights of minorities and look for work as an anthropologist because it was what you went to school for. This would make it easy for you to be targeted and found by the members of the FARC dissidents.\n[23] The reports also disclosed that armed groups have reach throughout Colombia and can target individuals even in areas where they do not exert control. In fact, the peace process between the government and FARC has created a power vacuum in areas previously controlled by the FARC and led to a growth in new and less predictable armed groups operating. Accordingly, I find that you are a serious \u2014 that you face a serious possibility of persecution throughout the country. I therefore find that there is no viable internal flight alternative available to you.\n[24] Based on the totality of the evidence and my analysis above, I find the claimant to be a Convention refugee, and I accept your claim.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n",

In summary the claimants allege persecution in Ukraine on the basis the principal claimant and minor claimant\u2019s ethnic Roma identities.\n[4] I find that the claimants are Convention refugees within the meaning of Section 96 of the IRPA.\n[5] The claimants identities were established on a balance of probabilities by the certified true copies of the Ukraine issued passports in their names contained at Exhibit 1.\n[6] Based on \u2013 based on the consideration of the totality of the evidence including the claimant\u2019s testimonies I find on a balance of probabilities that XXXX XXXX and her sonXXXX XXXX XXXX are ethnic ROMA. The associate claimant, XXXX XXXX is Ukrainian but has testified to facing discrimination through his family relationship with the claimants.\n[7] I note that the principal claimant and her husband, the associate claimant, both testified at the hearing. The minor claimant who is currently 17 years old also provided testimony.\n[8] With regard to credibility I find that the claimants testified in a straightforward fashion with regards to the central elements of their claim. I find that the claimants overall testimonies were credible and I accept on a balance of probabilities that they have faced discrimination that would rise to the level of persecution and would continue to face a serious possibility of persecution on a forward looking basis should they return to Ukraine.\n[9] In their Basis of Claim forms and in their testimonies the claimants provided details regarding instances of discrimination Ukraine which I will summarize.\n[10] The principal claimant is of mixed Roma descent as her mother is Roma but her father is Ukrainian. The principal claimant testified about identifying as Roma and also being identified by other Ukrainians as Roma due to her darker complexion and physical characteristics.\n[11] The principal claimant testified about problems starting around the fall of 2018 after her aunt who was Roma stayed at their home for a week in September of 2018.\n[12] The claimant testified that this brought further attention to other Ukrainians that her family were Roma and they began receiving threatening phone calls from unidentified Ukrainians over the course of three months who subjected them to racist language and told them to leave their city and XXXX because they were Roma.\n[13] The principal claimant testified about blocking the numbers but continued to receive phone calls from other identified numbers until the call stopped. The claimant\u2019s home was also spray painted with graffiti on their door several times in October 2018 identifying their family as Roma and calling death to Roma.\n[14] The principal and associate claimants also testified about one of their neighbours who was an ultra nationalist Ukrainian that made derogatory remarks against the principal claimant and the associate claimant for marrying a Roma woman.\n[15] I find that the principal claimant\u2019s testimony to be detailed, spontaneous and credible and I except that she was identified as being Roma which led her family to face discrimination and threatening and racist calls in addition to discrimination by an ultra nationalist neighbour.\n[16] The principal and associate claimants were also subjected to physical attack. On December 16th, 2018 by nationalist Ukrainians in the parking lot of the grocery store. The principal claimant described being identified as Roma and the nationalist accusing her and her husband of eating food meant for Ukrainians and poisoning their city with their presence.\n[17] The claimants were taken by ambulance to the hospital where they were treated for multiple injuries. The principal claimant was hospitalized for five days and the associate claimant for three days. I heard evidence of the police ignoring the claimants complaints and closing the file without doing any investigation because they did not take their complaints seriously due to her being \u2013 due to the principal claimant being Roma.\n[18] The claimants provided medical reports dated December 16th 2018 found that Exhibit 5, page 2 to 8 confirming their admission to the hospital for the principal claimant and associate claimant noting their injuries including a brain concussion of median degree, numerous bruises to the body and blows and abrasions of soft tissues to the face, head and neck.\n[19] A police report was also provided at Exhibit 5, pages 10 to 11 stating that further investigation into the claimants statements was considered inadvisable due to the absence of evidence of witnesses. I am satisfied to the principal claimant\u2019s credible testimony and supporting documentation that she and her husband were both physically attacked and suffered injuries due to being identified as a Roma couple and that police did not investigate into their complaints.\n[20] The principal claimant also testified that she was attacked by two nationalists on April 4th, 2019 as she was making her way from a friend\u2019s house in their neighbourhood. The claimant was transported to hospital by ambulance where she was diagnosed with several injuries. A medical report provided at Exhibit 5, page 16 to 18 indicates the claimant sustained a brain concussion in addition to dislocation of her wrist joint and hematoma of her left eye which was stated as a result of a beating by attackers.\n[21] The principal claimant reported the incident to police who she indicated ignored her complaint and not \u2013 did not take down notes after hearing that she was beaten because she was Roma. A police report found at Exhibit 5, pages 20 to 21 indicates that the initiation of criminal proceedings was found inadvisable due to the impossibility to identity the attackers.\n[22] I\u2019m satisfied through the claimant\u2019s credible testimony and corroborating documentary evidence that the principal claimant was attacked by Ukrainian nationalists on more than one occasion and that the police did not investigate into the matter or take her complaint seriously due to the \u2013 due to the nature of the attack being against a Roma person.\n[23] The principal minor claimant also testified about the discrimination the minor \u2013 sorry, the principal and minor claimant also testified about the discrimination the minor claimant faced in February 2019 when he was accused of stealing at the school because he was Roma. The minor claimant testified about being identified as Roma from being picked up at the school by his Roma grandmother.\n[24] I heard testimony about the principal claimant speaking to the principal of the school when her son was later found to be innocent to complain about the incident only to be told by school authorities that where there are Roma students there will be problems.\n[25] I heard testimony regarding the minor claimant developing XXXX due to the problems he was having at school and how he was seen by a doctor. A medical letter dated February 28, 2019 found at Exhibit 5, pages 13 to 14 indicates that the minor claimant was seen by the XXXX XXXX XXXX for XXXX help in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX with his classmates and teachers on the grounds of his ethnicity. Medications and XXXX sessions were prescribed.\n[26] The minor claimant testified about continuing to have problems in school and the students making derogatory remarks behind his back due to his Roma ethnicity. I find the principal and minor claimants testimonies were credible and supported by the documentary evidence.\n[27] I find that the minor claimant was identified as being Roma and continue to face discrimination in his school.\n[28] The principal claimant testified about fearing for her life after the second attack against her and deciding to leave Ukraine permanently for Canada where the associate claimant\u2019s brothers are citizens. The claimants for Canada as soon as the principal claimant was able to obtain her visitors visa and left on XXXX XXXX, 2019.\n[29] I found the claimants testimony to be credible and lacking in embellishment. I find that the claimants provided documentary evidence to support their claims including medical letters and police reports corroborating the incidents that happened.\n[30] The claimants also provided letters from the Roma community group and photographs of the principal claimant with her extended Roma family supporting the principal\u2019s claimants identity which can be found at Exhibit 5. I find that these documents to be authentic and credible and corroborate the claimants testimonies.\n[31] I find that although the associate claimant is not Roma, he was identified as being part of a Roma family and also subjected to racist language and threats in addition to being physically assaulted.\n[32] Based on the testimony evidence before me I find that the claimants have experienced discrimination and attacks that would cumulatively amount to persecution. I find that the claimants have established a subjective fear of persecution.\n[33] Regarding the delay in claim, I heard evidence of the claimants arriving in Canada in XXXX 2019 but not filing refugee claim until around February of 2020. The principal claimant testified that they were not aware they could file a refugee claim upon arriving in Canada.\n[34] The claimants sought the assistance of an immigration consultant shortly after they arrived who advised that \u2013 who advised the associate claimant to make an application for a work permit to obtain status. The claimants testified about the consultant not asking them questions and not being aware about them being eligible for refugee claim until they spoke to their current legal counsel who was able to provide them proper legal advice.\n[35] I find that the claimants were honest and forthright with their explanations as to why they did not immediately seek refugee protection after first arriving in Canada. I accept that the principal claimant\u2019s testimony that they were not aware they could file a refugee claim or that they would have done so sooner and that they followed the advice of their immigration consultant who was unsuccessful with helping them obtain status which made the claimant seek further legal counsel and at which time they were able to learn that they could make a refugee claim.\n[36] I do not find the claimants delay in making a refugee claim in Canada negatively affects the claimants credibility as it relates to their fear of persecution in Ukraine.\n[37] Regarding the country documentation and objective basis evidence, the National Documentation Package for Ukraine indicates that Roma experience widespread discrimination in the country. The United States Department of State report at Item 2.1 of the NDP indicates that Roma and Ukraine continue to face governmental and societal and significant barriers against accessing education, health care, social services and employment.\n[38] It was noted that human rights activists remain concerned about the lack of accountability in cases of attacks on Roma and the government\u2019s failure to address societal violence and harassment against Roma.\n[39] Amnesty International report for 2020 and 2021 at Item 2.2 indicates that discrimination against Roma persisted and the past attacks were effective \u2013 were not effectively investigated. The minority rights group Europe 2019 report on Roma at Item 13.7 of the NDP contains multiple examples of police inaction our outright violence against the Roma people in Ukraine including the increasing prevalence of hate speech and violence by far right groups in the country.\n[40] Based on the claimants testimonies today I find that there has been systemic discrimination against the principal and minor claimants being Roma in Ukraine which also affected the minor claimant\u2019s education.\n[41] In addition, I find that the claimants were targeted and assaulted by nationalist Ukrainians on the basis of the principal claimant\u2019s Roma ethnicity. Likewise I find the associate claimant also faced discrimination and abuse due to his relationship with his wife because she is Roma and also his son, also because he is Roma.\n[42] Based on the testimony and evidence I find that the claimants have faced discrimination that cumulatively rise to the level of persecution.\n[43] Regarding state protection, the documentary evidence tells me that although there are attempts to make changes to improve the situation for Roma in Ukraine, problems still remain today.\n[44] In addition to the evidence mentioned above, Item 13.7 of the NDP indicates a number of incidences of violence and attacks against Roma, particularly in Roma settlements where police or local authorities fail to either prevent attacks or meaningfully investigate, contributing to further dehumanization of Roma in they public discourse and fostering a climate of impunity among far right groups. Item 13.7 also indicates that police themselves have been major perpetrators of violence against Roma.\n[45] Based on these country conditions and based on the claimants testimonies which I have found to be credible I\u2019m satisfied that state protection would neither be adequate nor forthcoming. There are multiple instances reported of Roma individuals seeking protection and being subjected to racist or discriminatory actions by police including the claimants own experiences dealing with police after they were attacked in Ukraine and no follow up or investigation conducted. As such I find the claimants have met their onus and rebutted the presumption of state protection.\n[46] I also find that there is no Internal Flight Alternative available to the claimants as the problems with discrimination and the response by the police and authorities appear to be nationwide based on the evidence cited above.\n[47] In conclusion, having considered all of the evidence I find that XXXX XXXX, her husband XXXX XXXX and their son, XXXX XXXX are Convention refugees and have established a serious possibility of persecution. I accept their claims. Thank you.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2021 RLLR 89\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: May 13, 2021\nPanel: Gregory Israelstam\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Adam Wawrzkiewicz\nCountry: Hungary\nRPD Number: TC0-03571\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2022-01778\nATIP Pages: N\/A\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: These are my reasons. XXXX XXXX XXXX the claimant, seeks protection pursuant to s. 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. Mr. XXXX came to Canada with his spouse, XXXX (ph) XXXX, on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2019. XXXX XXXX was found ineligible to have the claim heard by the Refugee Protection Division because she had made a prior claim for protection in 2001.\n[2] The allegations of the claim can be found in the claimant\u2019s Basis of Claim form, and in his testimony. The claimant alleges a fear of persecution on the basis of race and membership in a particular social group at the hands of society in general, and from the former spouse of XXXX XXXX in particular.\n[3] The claimant alleges that should be return to Hungary, he would be subject to persecution in the form of denial of occupational opportunities on the basis of his Roma ethnicity. He would also be subject to persecution by being at increased risk of violence at the hands of nationalist gangs, of being at increased risk of harassment by police, and finally of being at increased risk of violence at the hands of XXXX former spouse.\n[4] At the outset of the hearing, I identified credibility of a major issue for the hearing to focus on. A second issue is whether there was clear and convincing evidence that the state was unable or unwilling to protect the claimant.\n[5] With respect to identity, on file at Exhibit 1 is a certified copy of the claimant\u2019s passport. Other identification documents from Hungary can be found at Exhibit 4. In addition, the claimant has submitted a statement form the Roma Community Centre in Toronto, identifying the claimant as a member of the Roma community. For these documents and his testimony, the claimant has established his personal identity, his citizenship of Hungary, and his Roma ethnicity.\n[6] With respect to credibility. The claimant testified at the hearing, as did his spouse, XXXX XXXX. A claimant testifying under oath is presumed to be telling the truth unless there are valid reasons to disbelieve that testimony. In this case, I find no valid reason to reject the claimant\u2019s testimony. My assessment of credibility takes into account the claimant\u2019s level of education, as well as other social and cultural factors that may affect his testimony. I have also taken into account situational factors such as the stress of refugee proceedings and the difficulties of communication through an interpreter.\n[7] The claimant was straightforward in his testimony. There were no material inconsistencies or contradictions in his testimony, and the testimony was consistent with both his Basis of Claim form, and the testimony of the witness, XXXX XXXX. The claimant submitted documentation at Exhibit 4 that corroborates elements of his allegations related to the violence that the claimant has suffered at the hands of XXXX ex-spouse. The claimant testified that he has been denied educate \u2014 excuse me, employment opportunities because of his Roma ethnicity. He testified that his membership in the Roma community has made it difficult for him to get work, and he recounted and incident where Roma workers where refused payment for the work they had completed. When they complained to the employer, the employer taunted them saying that if they were unhappy, they should go to the police, because the police would not believe them, as they were Roma.\n[8] The claimant testified that he has suffered violence and harassment at the hands of police. He testified that in 2010, while trying to get medical help for his ill sister, the police stopped him, accused him of coming to town to steal, hit him, and made him leave town. The claimant testified that the police used anti-Roma racial epithets during that incident. The claimant testified that another incident of police harassment occurred in 2006. The police accosted the claimant and his spouse XXXX, accusing XXXX of being a prostitute and making anti-Roma comments. The claimant testified that in 2011, he was attacked by a nationalist gang on a streetcar. He was physically assaulted, and subject to anti Roma abuse and epithets before the gang forced him off the streetcar. The claimant testified that he did not feel that going to the police about this incident would be productive. His experience with the police had been negative to that day. The claimant testified that his fear of violence at the hands of right-wing extremists has become more acute after this incident, as such violence is now encouraged by politicians and police tend to turn a blind eye towards violence against the Roma community.\n[9] The claimant testified that XXXX former spouse attacked the claimant and XXXX in their home in 2016, injuring both of them with a broken beer bottle. Both the claimant and XXXX XXXX testified that they went to the police, but the police had told them that because they had chosen the Roma lifestyle, the police would not do anything to assist them. The claimant and XXXX XXXX testified that XXXX former spouse approached them again in 2019, while the claimant and XXXX were living at a shelter. XXXX former spouse threatened to kill them. The claimant and XXXX testified that the police again were reluctant to take a report or intervene, and that they were asked to leave the shelter as a result of this incident. The claimant testified that this incident was the impetus for his decision to flee Hungary and make a claim for protection in Canada.\n[10] The claimant submitted police record from XXXX XXXX time in Canada, showing that she had been the complainant in a member of incidents that resulted in charges against her former spouse. As noted, I find the claimant to be overall credible and his documentary evidence to support his allegations. I find on a balance of probabilities that the claimant has suffered assault and harassment, both at the hands of police, and at the hands of right wring, nationalist gangs. I find on a balance of probabilities that the claimant has been attacked and threated by XXXX former spouse. Finally, I find on a balance of probabilities that the claimant has approached the police for protection against these attacks and threats, but that the police did not offer assistance or protection. I find that the claimant does fear future persecution based on his race, his Roma ethnicity, as well as his membership in a particular social group being the family member of a person subject to domestic violence.\n[11] Having found the claimant has a subjective fear of persecution, turn to the question of whether this fear has an objective basis. Items 13.5 and 13.6 of the national documentation package for Hungary, dated April 16th, 2021, support the claimant\u2019s allegation that Roma in Hungary are subject to widespread discrimination in the field of employment, these Items also note that the Roma community is increasingly becoming victim to right wing nationalist violence in Hungary. Item 5.2 of the national documentation package for Hungary notes that Roma women are at increased risk of being subjected to gender-based domestic violence and have considerably fewer resources at their disposal to escape violence. This risk of violence is exacerbated by the poverty of many in the Roma community, as well as police reluctance to be responsive to complaints of domestic violence against Roma.\n[12] I conclude that the claimants do have an objective basis for their fear of persecution, and that their fear is well-founded.\n[13] With respect to state protection, the claimant testified that he does not believe that the police would be able to help him escape threats of violence from either gangs or from XXXX XXXX former husband. Again, Items 13.5 and 13.6 of the national documentation package for Hungary support the claimant\u2019s testimony. Police will often take complaints against violence against Roma less seriously and not investigate violence against Roma complaints. These items in the national documentation package also note that anti Roma racism is pervasive throughout Hungarian society and is on the increase. This racism exists at the level of both the government and the police. While former protection against discrimination and violence are legislated, the reality is that the Roma community is substantially excluded from participating in many areas of Hungarian society and faces increasing levels of violence. I conclude that there is clear and convincing that the state is unable or unwilling to protect the claimant against persecution.\n[14] With respect to whether the claimant has an internal flight alternative, given the pervasiveness of anti-Roma racism in Hungary, I find that there is no reasonable internal flight alternative within Hungary, particularly with respect to the claimant\u2019s persecution on the basis of race.\n[15] Here is my conclusion. Based on the evidence before me, the testimony of the claimant, and the testimony of XXXX XXXX, I conclude that the claimant has established a serious possibility of persecution on the Convention grounds of race and membership in a particular social group if he were to return to Hungary. And I am going to ask the interpreter to please interpret the next two sentences. The claimant is therefore a Convention refugee, pursuant to s. 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. His claim for protection is accepted.\n[16] CLAIMANT: Thank you very much.\n[17] MEMBER: Do you have any questions, sir?\n[18] CLAIMANT: They will send my wife back home?\n[19] MEMBER: That\u2019s something you should probably talk about with your counsel.\n[20] CLAIMANT: Thank you.\n[21] UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: Thank you very much, thank you, thank you.\n[22] MEMBER: I\u2019d like to thank you for answering all of my questions today.

The address I have is XXXX XXXX XXXX.\n[29] CLAIMANT: Yes.\n[30] MEMBER: And the postal code is XXXX XXXX XXXX\n[31] CLAIMANT: Yes.\n[32] MEMBER: Excellent. All right, so that\u2019s everything, thank you again, please have a good rest of your day and stay safe.\n[33] INTERPRETER: Thank you very much.\n[34] MEMBER: Goodbye everybody.\n[35] INTERPRETER: Goodbye everyone.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013\n",

        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2021 RLLR 88\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: August 17, 2021\nPanel: Andrew M Rozdilsky\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Peter G Ivanyi\nCountry: Romania\nRPD Number: TC0-02861\nAssociated RPD Number(s): TC0-02862\nATIP Number: A-2022-01778\nATIP Pages: N\/A\nREASONS FOR DECISION\nINTRODUCTION\n[1] The claimant, XXXX XXXX, and the female claimant, XXXX XXXX XXXX claim refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).[i]\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] The claimants detailed allegations are set out in their Basis of Claim forms. In summary, the claimants allege persecution by the Romania society and police because of their Roma ethnicity. The claimants have suffered numerous forms of discrimination throughout their lives up until they left Romania, including their very limited education, the claimant having Grade 3 and the female claimant Grade 2, and in employment. The claimants have three children who remain in Romania fearing that they would not to be allowed to travel and enter Canada. The claimants claim to be Corbeni Roma and that they faced not only discrimination but also abuse by racist Romanians and police, the claimant alleging that he lived in fear every day, Romanians could beat him or members of his family because of their ethnicity. The female claimant alleged that Roma women face a difficult life and do not have rights such as other Romanian citizens, that there is no protection, medical insurance, that they pay fees to be treated at clinics and bribe doctors and nurses for treatment. It is difficult to find jobs, Romanians are not hiring Roma and they are not educated. The claimants have no chance to be accepted in Romanian society and because of their ethnicity face verbal and physical abuse by racist people, and police curse and threaten them. They are thrown out of stores, restaurants and pools, face humiliation from security, and face racist slurs, beatings, abuse, harassment and are thrown from buses.\n[3] In more detailed allegations the claimant alleged that he stopped schooling after three years as his parents, fearing the assaults and humiliation he faced by schoolmates and being forced to sit at the back. The female claimant stopped after Grade 2, having been beaten at school, abused, and humiliated by classmates.\n[4] The claimant alleged that they are afforded no protection by Romanian authorities, they face verbal and physical abuse, sexual touching, security harassment and being accused of theft.\n[5] Police provide no protection and abuse or instigate violence against Roma, and there are incidents where Roma houses are burnt. There is no protection for Roma students who are abused by teachers and ignore them in class.\n[6] The claimant alleged that in 2012, the claimants were at a local bazar in Bragadiru, were stopped by police and accused of stealing chickens and cheese they bought but made no complaint out of fear.\n[7] The claimant alleged that in 2017, he and the female claimant were travelling on a bus and were harassed and humiliated by Romanians, called dirty Gypsies and that they smell, his wife being reduced to tears. They were defended by some on the bus and got off at the first opportunity and ran away.\n[8] In 2018, the claimant was at City Hall in Cornetu and asked for a small lot to build a house for his family but was rejected because he is Roma and had no money to pay as a bribe as other Roma did. No complaint was made against the mayor, fearing revenge.\n[9] In 2018, the claimant\u2019s uncle was hit by a drunk driver and killed and was verbally abused after being struck. The driver was never arrested and bribed local police despite having threatened to kill other Roma.\n[10] In 2019, the claimant alleged that a Roma woman with two children was beaten badly in Zalau by a Romanian driver. Police were called and were rude to her because she was a \u2018gypsy\u2019.\n[11] The claimant alleged that doctors charge Roma patients, ask for extra money besides fees and demand bribes, refusing to provide care if they are not paid. They have no medical insurance as they have no permanent jobs and cannot afford fees for insurance. There is no protection against racism and discrimination and there are no jobs in Romanian companies because they are uneducated, and they can only get work street cleaning or cleaning rich people\u2019s homes and are paid half what Romanians are paid. They do not have the same rights as Romanians. They live in squalid living conditions without water and heating, gas, garbage disposal, have no social assistance or medical insurance. They are not hired because Romanians say they stink. They left Romania out of fear for their lives, and the lives of their family and want a better life for their children who are not safe and do not have the same rights as Romanians, live in poor living conditions, no hot water, and an overcrowded small house with no heat so they use firewood. Many Romanian authorities are racist, they are not allowed to enter stores, restaurants, public places and are beaten. The claimant does not want his children to be discriminated against and face persecution as Roma. The claimants left Romania on XXXX XXXX, 2019.\n[12] The female claimant alleged that Roma in Bolintin were expelled from the village they lived in for 45 years after a Romanian was killed in a conflict with a Roma and that 26 Roma houses were burnt, for which no one was arrested or punished, and no compensation was paid until after an international court judgement after 2009. The female claimant\u2019s house was burnt down in 1991, they were thrown out of the village and never returned under threat of being killed.\n[13] In 1994, the female claimant\u2019s paternal aunt went to her father\u2019s village after being on the street for three years after losing her home. Local villagers demanded that relatives of local residents leave, claiming that they were criminals from Bolintin, and threatened to burn down the female claimant\u2019s aunt\u2019s father\u2019s family home. Police told the female claimant\u2019s family to do as they were told.\n[14] The female claimant alleged her aunt\u2019s husband was shot in 2000 and died of his injuries three days later. In 2011, her father was called by police to the police station, beaten and questioned regarding a fictitious offence but never made a complaint as he was beaten by police.\n[15] In 2002, the female claimant\u2019s mother and father were assaulted by Romanian peasants and beaten, being accused of wanting to steal.\n[16] In 2011, the female claimant\u2019s father\u2019s cousin was ran over intentionally by a Romanian who previously had threatened to kill all Roma. The family complained with the case ongoing, but the killer remains free.\n[17] In 2013, the female claimant\u2019s grandfather died of natural causes, but the priest refused bury him in the local cemetery.\n[18] The female claimant\u2019s brother was found to be a Convention refugee in Canada.\nDETERMINATION\n[19] The panel finds that there is a serious possibility that the claimants will face persecution because of their ethnicity as Roma if they were to return to Romania and are, therefore, Convention refugees pursuant to section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[20] In making this determination, the panel has considered the counsel\u2019s post hearing writing submissions, claimants\u2019 testimony, and documentary evidence.\nIdentity\n[21] The claimants\u2019 personal identity as a citizen of Romania has been established, on a balance of probabilities, by their testimony, the claimants\u2019 passports, and Romania ID cards.[ii]\nNexus\n[22] The panel finds that the claimants fear persecution for reasons of their Roma ethnicity and have established that their fear of persecution is for a Convention reason, namely their ethnicity as Roma and accordingly their claims were assessed under section 96.\nCredibility\n[23] The panel finds the claimants to be credible witnesses. They provided credible evidence establishing their Roma ethnicity. Further, they provided evidence from the Roma community in Canada corroborating their claims to be Roma. The claimants provided supporting letters from Roma Community Centre[iii] in Canada, and photos of their family[iv] in Romania. They gave evidence in relation to them being Corbeni Roma and in addition provided reliable and trustworthy documentation establishing their Roma ethnicity. The claimants gave their evidence regarding their Roma ethnicity in a straightforward and forthright manner. Further, they described the photographs showing their living situation in Romania and their children. The panel found overall that there were no inconsistencies in the claimants\u2019 testimony. The panel found the claimants\u2019 testimony to be credible and the documents in support of their allegations to be reliable and trustworthy.\n[24] The claimant further gave consistent testimony with their BOC narratives regarding their personal experiences in Romania prior to their departure. The panel finds the claimants\u2019 evidence regarding their experiences in Romanian to be credible.\nObjective Basis\n[25] In the Ward judgement, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that for treatment to amount to persecution, it must be a, \u201csustained or systemic violation of basic human rights, demonstrative of a failure of state protection.\u201d[v]\n[26] The panel finds the claimant\u2019s own evidence regarding their personal experiences as Roma in Romania and the objective documentary evidence[vi] regarding the situation of Roma in Romania supports a finding that the claimants fear of persecution were they to return to Romania is well-founded and that they face a serious possibility of persecution because their ethnicity as Roma.\n[27] The NDP item 2.1 reports:\n[T]here were reports from nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and media that police and gendarmes mistreated and abused Roma, primarily with excessive force, including beatings. Amnesty International, the European Roma Rights Center, the Romani Center for Social Intervention and Studies (CRISS), and the Civic Union of Young Roma from Romania reported several instances of police abuse against Roma, in the context of enforcing movement restrictions imposed during the COVID-19 crisis.\nE-Romnja, an NGO that works to advance the rights of Romani women, stated police often discouraged Romani women and girls from filing complaints.[vii]\n[28] An RIR at NDP item 13.4 reports:\nThe US Department of State\u2019s Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2014 indicates that Roma face systemic discrimination by society, which affects them in the areas of education, housing, health, and employment.\n\u201cnegative attitudes and stereotypes about Roma are deep-rooted, resilient and prevalent\u2026\u201d The same source indicates that \u201cpervasive racism and racist violence continue to distance many Roma families and groups from the greater society.\u201d\nCountry Reports 2014 indicates that although the law forbids discrimination based on ethnicity, the government did not effectively enforce these prohibitions and Roma \u201coften experienced discrimination and violence.\u201d[viii]\n[29] The NDP item 13.5 reports:\nIn Romania, in 2014 it was argued that \u201cAnti-Roma rhetoric emerges from politicians across all three major political parties \u2013 the left, the right and the Liberals\u201d,160 including through statements made during TV interviews and online.[ix]\n[30] The NDP item 13.5 reports:\nNegative attitudes and behaviours towards the Roma population and its labour market participation are constantly encountered in the public sphere. According to the FRA report from 2018, Roma from Romania felt more discriminated against (in 2016 than in 2011) due to being Roma when looking for a job and at work in the past five years.[x]\n[31] A careful review of objective documentary evidence corroborates the claimants\u2019 evidence of ongoing and systemic discrimination suffered in education, access to healthcare, and threats to their life, amounting to persecution. Therefore, the claimants fear to return to Romania as an ethnic Roma is objectively well-founded.\nState Protection\n[32] The police have been regularly charged for applying double standards in their investigation for crimes involving Roma individuals. Some cases of genuine contempt have been reported where police officers clearly suggested that attacks on Roma were their own fault. Roma are also discouraged by police officers from filing criminal reports.\n[33] The claimants related their own experiences in relation to the experiences of them and their families in seeking state protection credibly at the hearing and in their BOC narratives.\n[34] Taking all of these factors into account, including the objective evidence together, the panel finds that there is clear and convincing evidence on a balance of probabilities that adequate state protection is not reasonably forthcoming to the claimants in Romania.\nInternal Flight Alternative (IFA)\n[35] The panel have also considered whether there is a viable internal flight alternative exists for the claimants. The documentary evidence above shows that anti-Roma sentiments are prevalent throughout Romania. The panel finds that there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout Romania. The panel finds that there is no viable internal flight alternative is available to them because of their Roma ethnicity and in the particular circumstances of these claimants.\nCONCLUSION\n[36] For the foregoing reasons, in the particular circumstance of these claims, the panel finds that the claimants have established a serious possibility that they will face persecution because of their ethnicity as Roma if they were to return to Romania and are, therefore, Convention refugees pursuant to section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[i] The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), S.C. 2001, c.27, as amended, sections 96 and 97(1).\n[ii] Exhibit 1, Claim Referral Information from CBSA\/IRCC.\n[iii] Exhibit 7, Disclosure personal-counsel \u2013 January 21, 2021.\n[iv] Exhibit 9, Disclosure personal-counsel January 26, 2021.\n[v] Canada (Attorney General) v.

        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2021 RLLR 87\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: November 2, 2021\nPanel: Avril Cardoso\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Jordana Rotman\nCountry: China\nRPD Number: TC0-01847\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2022-01778\nATIP Pages: N\/A\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: This is the decision for XXXX XXXX XXXX You are claiming to be a citizen of China and are claiming refugee protection pursuant to Sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. I have considered your testimony and the other evidence in the case and I am ready to render my decision orally.\nDetermination\n[2] I find that you are a Convention refugee on the ground of religion for the following reasons.\nAllegations\n[3] You allege the following. You were introduced to Christianity while working in Suriname in June 2017 from fellow Chinese ex-patriots. You returned to China and continued your Christian practice. In July 2018, while at a house church service, the PSB raided the home. After being interrogated and warned, you decided to leave China. With the aid of a smuggler, you came to Canada and claimed protection.\n[4] You allege if you return, you face persecution. You allege that there is no state protection for you or an Internal Flight Alternative.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[5] I find that your personal identity as a citizen of China has been established on a balance of probabilities by your testimony, your RIC, passport and marriage certificate contained in Exhibits 5 and 6. I find that there is a link between what you fear and the Convention ground of religion and your claim is therefore assessed under Section 96.\nExclusion\n[6] You resided in Suriname from XXXX 2014 to XXXX 2015. From XXXX 2015 to XXXX 2017 and again from XXXX 2018 to XXXX 2018, I have considered whether you are excluded from protection under Article 1E of the refugee Convention. I find that you do not have status substantially similar to Suriname nationals, nor did you previously have such status or access to such status. To obtain permanent status, you testified that you require residence for five years and a stable job. The evidence establishes that you resided in Suriname on a temporary basis subject to renewable residence permits. If you allowed a permit to expire, you would not be allowed re-entry and had to reapply. In support of your testimony, you submitted your Suriname residence permit, foreigner\u2019s registration and the judicial decision to extend your stay until XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018. The federal court has held that where the country a claimant has taken up residence is tentative, they do not fall within the ambit of Article 1E. I therefore find that you are not excluded.\nCredibility\n[7] In terms of your general credibility, I found you to be a credible witness and I therefore believe what you have alleged in your oral testimony and in your Basis of Claim form. Your overall testimony was spontaneous, detailed, forthcoming and without embellishment. It was entirely consistent with your narrative. I find that you were introduced to Christianity in June 2017 while living in Suriname. Your testimony was detailed and most compelling. You described in detail what transpired at the house church service, explained how you were taught to pray and related the story of David and Goliath which you explained touched you briefly.\n[8] You testified that at the time you were scared because of an event which transpired and you were afraid of going out. You said that you learned God would protect you as you saw David prevail against Goliath with God\u2019s support and you slept peacefully when you returned home that evening. In support of your testimony, you submitted a letter from a fellow house church member in Suriname, contained in Exhibit 6. I find that you continue to practice your faith at the house church when you returned to China in XXXX 2017. You testified that the services were held at Mr. XXXX home and he was a group leader. You said there were 10 members and identified the pastor. You described your baptism in great detail and explained the meaning of baptism to Christians. I note that the baptism process outlined in the True Jesus belief, disclosure contained in Exhibit 7. You also submitted a baptism certificate from the pastor in China contained in Exhibit 6. I find that you were questioned by the PSB on July 22, 2018 and accept this event as declared in your narrative.\n[9] You testified that you were able to exit China and did not encounter issues going through security. I find this is reasonable as you do not indicate that the PSB detained or charged you and it is therefore unlikely that your name would have been recorded. When asked why you needed to obtain a Canadian visa in August 2018 when you were in possession of a valid US visa, you testified that the smuggler advised you to do so as Canada embraced freedom of religion. I draw no negative inference against your credibility as you relied on an agent to leave China and you left China in XXXX 2018, only weeks after you were interrogated by the PSB. I find that your delay in claiming protection for 14 months is reasonable. You relied on advice from the agent, as well as your sister, who lives in Canada. You explained that the smuggler told you that without identity documents, your claim would fail and you would be deported to China. When asked if your sister helped to obtain legal advice in Canada, you said she made some telephone calls and was informed that you should expect a hearing in three to five months, and since you did not have your identity documents, your claim would be unlikely to succeed.\n[10] I find that you are a genuine Christian. You provided detailed and spontaneous testimony about your activities at the church you attend in Canada, which is materially consistent with the letter provided by the church you attend and can be found at Exhibit 6. You also testified about the 5 rules and 10 beliefs of True Jesus adherence spontaneously and in detail. Your testimony about the meaning and impact of your faith in your life was most compelling.\n[11] You explained that before you became a Christian, you consumed alcohol and did not listen to your parents and felt alone. You testified that you learned that you should be inspired by the Holy Spirit and not alcohol. You should listen to your parents in accordance with the 10 commandments and most importantly you learned that you can depend on God and pray to God for solutions. You said your faith has made you an easygoing person. I therefore find that your subjective fear is established by your credible testimony and corroborating documents.\nObjective Basis\n[12] Your fear of being deported to China in the present circumstances is a fear that is well-founded in the objective documents. The US Department of State report in 2.1 writes about the state in position of draconian restrictions on freedom of religion or belief. Authorities continue to imprison citizens for reasons related to politics and religion. The US International Religious Freedom Report writes about the 2019 to 2024 campaign of Sinicization to bring all religious doctrine and practice in line with CCP doctrine, the government offered financial incentives to law enforcement to arrest religious practitioners and to citizens who reported illegal religious activity. There are multiple reports of harassment and threats in Fujian province where you lived, this is in 12.1.\n[13] The US Commission on International Religious Freedom 2021 report says that Chinese authorities harassed, detained, arrested and imprisoned members of protestant house churches who refuse to join the state sanctioned three self patriotic movement, this is in 12.2. A request for information report writes that authorities have repeatedly stated that one of the aims of the new regulations is to eliminate independent house churches compelling most of them to become part of the (inaudible) in 12.28. Your Counsel has also submitted objective country condition evidence which supports a well-founded fear. There is a report that the True Jesus Church in Hanon, Province has been forcibly demolished by Chinese authorities. This is contained in Exhibit 6.\nState Protection\n[14] There is a presumption of state protection unless the state is in a condition of complete breakdown. This presumption may be rebutted with clear and convincing evidence. In this case, the agent of persecution is the state. As the persecution you would face should you return to China is at the hands of the authorities, accordingly, I find there is no state protection available to you.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[15] I have also considered whether a viable Internal Flight Alternative exists for you. I find that there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout China and therefore no Internal Flight Alternative is available to you as the state is the agent of persecution and will be motivated to find you.\nCONCLUSION\n[16] Based on the totality of the evidence, I find you to be a Convention refugee and I accept your claim.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

The claimant\u2019s allegations are detailed in her narrative attached to her Basis of Claim form.\n[3] The claimant alleges that she fears attack, discrimination and gender-based violence from criminal organizations, Bulgarian society and racist groups as well as police in Bulgaria. The claimant alleges that she experienced widespread discrimination in Bulgaria throughout her life due to her Roma ethnicity. She alleges she experienced mistreatment in school, housing, employment and public spaces.\n[4] She alleges that she was attacked in July 2018 by a group of skinheads. The police were called and the attackers fled. However, the police were rude and dismissive and did not investigate the attack. She alleges that she went to the hospital for treatment after the attack and the staff at the hospital were reluctant to touch her because of her Roma ethnicity.\n[5] She alleges that in 2019 her husband started a business of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and that she helped with the business. She alleges that in May 2019, men from a criminal organization began to extort the business.\n[6] In July 2019 the men returned accompanied by police and beat the claimant and other Roma workers while the police stood watch. She alleges that one of the men informed them that they would be returning in 2 weeks for more money and if the business could not pay then the claimant would be forced to work as a prostitute.\n[7] The claimant alleges that she went to the hospital for her injuries where she was made to wait and the hospital staff was hesitant to touch her. She alleges that she approached the prosecutor\u2019s office and was told that her complaint would not go far and that the office could not guarantee her safety.\n[8] She alleges that she decided to flee Bulgaria with her family however due to a lack of funds their trip was delayed and the claimant and her husband temporarily located to Lom while their son went to stay with relatives in the city of Montana, Bulgaria. Fearing the risk of the claimant being forced into prostitution and due to insufficient funds, the claimant\u2019s husband and her son travelled to Germany while the claimant left Bulgaria for Canada without them.\n[9] The panel finds that the claimant has established her identity as a national of Bulgaria based on a certified copy of her passport contained in Exhibit 1. The panel finds that the claimant\u2019s alleged fear stem from her Roma ethnicity and has a Nexus with the Convention ground race.\n[10] The claimant testified she is Roma because her parents are Roma and she comes from a Roma family. She said she is identifiable as Roma from her accent, her appearance and from the fact that she spends her time in public with other recognisably Roma people.\n[11] She testified that she belongs to the sub-group Kalderashi (ph) which she testified holds 3 days weddings and distinguish them from other Roma groups. She provided a letter from the Roma community centre attesting to her Roma identity. The officer states that he interviewed the claimant on December 1st 2020 and states that she has a Roma appearance, she speaks Bulgarian with a Roma accent and that she is knowledgeable about customs and traditions and celebrations of the Roma people. He also states that he has met her Roma relatives in Canada.\n[12] The panel finds that the claimant has established her Roma identity on a balance of probabilities. The claimant testified to an experiencing widespread discrimination for her entire life in Bulgaria. She testified that she grew up in a Roma ghetto that lacked paved roads, garbage collection and running water, indoor plumbing and electricity.\n[13] She testified she left school after grade 6 due to the treatment she faced from Bulgarian students and teachers and she states that Bulgarian students beat the Roma students and teachers assigned guilt to the Roma students including herself. She testified about trying to find farm work from Bulgarians as it is a field that she was capable but she was chased away by Bulgarians due to her ethnicity.\n[14] The claimant testified she experienced 2 physical attacks due to her Roma identity. She testified in detail about both events and she testified the first attack was carried out by skinheads whom she identified as such due to the insignia on their clothes and she testified that she beat her and other Roma individuals who were present with batons and chains.\n[15] She testified that the second attacks was carried out by a criminal organization extorting her husband\u2019s business and she testified that the agents of persecution made derogatory remarks stating that Romas would not be able to operate businesses without paying them.\n[16] She testified that the police were present for the attacks and merely supervised and that the attack was accompanied by threats to force her into prostitution. She testified that both events, after both events she required medical attention and the hospital she was made to wait until Bulgarians who arrived after her were treated before she was treated and she testimony that the staff of the hospital did not want to touch her.\n[17] The claimant provided ambulatory records for her and her husband. The first 2 are dated XXXX XXXX 2018 and state that the claimant and her husband were beaten causing various injuries such XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.\n[18] The second 2 reports are dated XXXX XXXX 2019 and they indicate that the claimant was beaten and her husband was beaten and it states that their injuries and symptoms include XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX The panel accepts the documents and gives them full weight in establishing that the claimant and her husband were attacked in July 2018 and July 2019.\n[19] The claimant testified that she attempted to access state protection after each attack and after the 1st attack the police suggested that Roma individuals including the claimant who were attacked did something to provoke the attack.\n[20] After the attack she did not want to approach the police- oh after the second attack she did not want to approach the police because members of the police were present for the attack so she approached the prosecutor\u2019s office on a relative advice and she was told that filing a complaint would make things worse for her.\n[21] So, the claimant provided her parents and her siblings positive RPD decision and her mother\u2019s Basis of Claim form and narrative. The narrative details similar but separate instances of discrimination, physical attacks, extortion, threats of sexual trafficking, perpetuated by ethnic Bulgarians.\n[22] The panel finds that the claimant\u2019s parents and siblings are similarly situated to the claimant and gives weight to the narrative for the purpose of corroborating the treatment that Roma individuals in similar circumstances of the claimant face in Bulgaria and I find that the discriminatory acts including acts of violence and threats of forced prostitution amount to persecution as they threaten the claimant\u2019s life.\n[23] The claimant alleges that she decided to flee Bulgaria in XXXX 2019 and she did not leave Bulgaria until XXXX 2019. The claimant provided or she explained that she wanted to leave immediately but lacked the funds and needed to apply for a passport. So, she and her husband relocated to the city of Lom and sent their son to the city of Montana with relatives. She describes staying in hiding in Lom and leaving only their home only when necessary in order to avoid detection from the criminal organization that attacked her in July 2019 for failing to pay the extortion fees.\n[24] The panel accepts the explanation for the delay because the claimant could not have reasonably left the country without a passport or without the funds to do so. The panel finds that in the circumstances the claimant\u2019s delay in leaving Bulgaria was not extended and does not indicate a lack of subjective fear.\n[25] The claimant entered Canada and XXXX 2019. Her claim was not referred until January 2020. The claimant explained that she did not make a claim at the airport because she was not aware that she could make a claim at the airport. She testified that she later learned from her father that she could have made a claim at the airport.\n[26] She testified that she started to take steps to make a claim for asylum soon after arriving and she testified that she wanted to use the same lawyer her parents had used but after 2 months of the lawyer stating that he was too busy she found a different lawyer.\n[27] The panel accepts the explanation for the delay. It is reasonable that the claimant would want to use the same lawyer as her family members who had a successful claim. The panel finds that the claimant did delay her claim in an attempt to use the same lawyer as her family members however in these circumstances its not indicative of a lack of subjective fear.\n[28] So, in summary the panel accepts the allegations as they are stated in the claimant\u2019s Basis of Claim narrative. The claimant\u2019s testimony was consistent, transparent and spontaneous. There were no major discrepancies between the claimant\u2019s testimony and her Basis of Claim.\n[29] As such the panel has no reason to doubt the veracity of her allegations. On a balance of probabilities, the claimant is a Roma individual who faced widespread discrimination including physical attack and threats of sex trafficking Bulgaria.\n[30] Based on her testimony I find that the claimant experienced systemic and persistent discrimination in multiple areas of her life, most notable the racist attacks, threats of sexual exploitation and a lack of access to state protection and the panel finds that these acts during the claimant\u2019s life does amount to persecution.\n[31] The claimant was attacked by skinheads on one occasion and extorted and threatened and attacked by a criminal organization and extorted, threatened and attacked by a criminal organization. She \u2013 when she reported the incidents to authorities, she did not receive protection. She was prompted to flee the country when the criminal organization threatened her into sex work. As such the panel finds that the claimant has established her subjective fear of persecution upon returning to Bulgaria.\n[32] The national documentation package of r Bulgaria contains the 2019 United States Department of State Report at 2.1 which reports crimes involving violence or threats or violence against Romani individuals is a significant Human Rights issue in Bulgaria.\n[33] The same source states that government actions to prosecute and punish officials who committed Human Rights abuses were insufficient and that impunity remained a problem. The same report states that the Bulgarian House Committees finding that physical abuse of detainee by police was widespread and disproportionately affected Romani suspects.\n[34] The report states that societal intolerance and violence against the Roma persisted in Bulgaria with political and government actors sometimes condoning and prompting the mistreatment of Romani individuals. The media described the Roma using discriminatory, denigrating and abusive language. Nationalist parties routinely resorted to strong anti- Roma slogans and rhetoric with many documented incidences of hate speech and that can be found at page 2 of item 2.1.\n[35] Item 2.4 is a report from Freedom House and its states that Roma and other ethnicity minorities are particularly vulnerable to trafficking for sexual and labour exploitation. The report states that the government efforts to combat trafficking shelter victims and punish perpetrators have not matched the scale of the problem and item 7.1 states that despite significant efforts the government of Bulgaria does not meet the minimum standard for the elimination of trafficking.\n[36] There are few prosecutions for hate crimes according to the report. This is from item 2.1 at page 28. One such example of widespread impunity occurred in the city of Gabrovo where Roma houses where vandalised and set ablaze during protests against the Roma population. The protests forced most of the Romani residents to flee the city and hide for days in the woods. Authorities including the Deputy Prime Minister publicly supported the protest.\n[37] So, the panel finds that Roma individuals are targeted for mistreatment including discrimination, hate speech, physical attacks by non-Roma individuals in Bulgaria including the police and government actors. As such the panel finds that the claimant has a forward-facing risk of persecution and an objective basis for her claim. The panel finds that the claimant has a well-founded fear of persecution in Bulgaria.\n[38] States are presumed to be capable of protecting their own citizens. The panel notes Bulgaria is a member of the EU and is a functioning democracy with a judiciary and a police force. As such the presumption of adequate state protection is stronger and requires a higher burden on the claimant to present clear and convincing evidence to rebut the presumption.\n[39] In this case the panel finds that the claimant rebutted this presumption of state protection on a balance of probabilities with both the objective evidence of state protection for Roma people and her credible evidence that she reported the incidents to police and to the prosecutor\u2019s office and they both responded by failing to investigate.\n[40] The panel does not require that the claimant approach any higher authorities or oversight authorities and doing so is guided by Csoka 2016 FC1220 at paragraph 25 where the court states that it is the police that have the mandate to provide protection.\n[41] Item 13.6 of the National Documentation Package states that when individuals from marginalised groups file a report with the police it is not unusual for authorities to treat them with disregard and to refuse to register the crime. There is evidence that some positive actions have been taken by the Bulgarian at to address violence targeting the Roma population.\n[42] However, the evidence does not establish that these steps have led to operational, effective state protection for the Roma population at this time or that they would have a positive impact for the claimant in her circumstances. Because the public climate in Bulgaria is incompatible with government commitments to combat discrimination against Roma.\n[43] NDP 13.1 discusses the different strategies that the government has undertaken and explains that they have not resulted in positive impacts for the Roma population. Thus, the panel finds that on a balance of probabilities there is clear and convincing evidence that Bulgarian state would be unable to provide the claimant with adequate state protection. I therefore find the state is unwilling or unable to protect the claimant.\n[44] I find there is no Internal Flight Alternative available to the claimant because of the country condition evidence which reveals that discrimination amounting to persecution of Roma by society, police and government actors is spread throughout the country.\n[45] There is no evidence before me that there is a safe haven anywhere in Bulgaria for Roma people and that societal discrimination and the evidence indicates that societal discrimination appears throughout the country. As such I find there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout Bulgaria and therefore a viable IFA does not exist.\n[46] Having considered the totality of the evidence the panel finds that the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act and accept the claim.\n[47] That concludes the reasons.\n[48] CLAIMANT: I want to express my thanks to all of you.\n[49] MEMBER: Thank you for your testimony today. Thank you, Mr. Interpreter, for your work.\n[50] CLAIMANT: I do have a question.\n[51] MEMBER: Sure yeah?\n[52] CLAIMANT: I would like to know how would I be able to bring my husband and child because I haven\u2019t seen them for 2 years so would it be any possible, any document that would facilitate their arrival.\n[53] MEMBER: So, I \u2013 that\u2019s very. I\u2019m very sorry that you\u2019ve been away from your family for so long. I suspect that you and your lawyer will be having a conversation on that topic soon after this hearing. Okay I\u2019 sorry I\u2019m not really able to give you any answer because I\u2019m not legal Counsel and I don\u2019t want to do that but yeah you will be taking to your lawyer about that.\n[54] CLAIMANT: The decision is it going to be mailed because I\u2019m planning to move to another place soon.\n[55] MEMBER: It will be mailed so please tell your Counsel your new address and he\u2019ll be able to update the Refugee Board when you move so it will go to the correct address.\n[56] CLAIMANT: I could provide this right now if it\u2019s possible.\n[57] MEMBER: Well, if you provided it right now then the it would be sent \u2013 the decision would be sent there and it might get sent there next week when you are still at your old address.\n[58] CLAIMANT: Okay by the end of month of March I\u2019m moving.\n[59] MEMBER: Okay then so I think your lawyer will update for April 1st the new address because the decision might come to you before then and he\u2019ll be receiving a copy as well just in case.\n[60] CLAIMANT: Okay.\n[61] MEMBER: Is there anything else?\n[62] CLAIMANT: No but I\u2019m thanking you so much.\n[63] MEMBER: Okay so take care. Thank you Counsel for the well-prepared file. Thank you again Mr. Interpreter.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

Letheren\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): John Savaglio\nCountry: Pakistan\nRPD Number: TB9-34953\nAssociated RPD Number(s): TB9-35006 \/ TB9-35018 \/ TB9-35025\nATIP Number: A-2022-01778\nATIP Pages: N\/A\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: So these are the reasons for the claims made by XXXX XXXX, file number TB9-34953, who\u2019s the principal claimant, the associate claimant, XXXX XXXX, TB9-35006, and the minor claimants XXXX XXXX, TB9-35018, and XXXX XXXX XXXX TB9-35025.\n[2] XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX are citizens of Pakistan. The minor claimant, XXXX XXXX, is also a citizen of the United States of America. They\u2019re all claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[3] XXXX (ph), sorry, XXXX XXXX is the minor claimants\u2019 father and he\u2019s the designated representative for these minor claimants. These claims are being held together in accordance with the Refugee Protection Division rule number 55.\n[4] Your personal and national identities were established on a balance of probabilities by your testimony and the certified true copies of the passports that were included in the file. They demonstrate that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX are citizens of Pakistan. XXXX XXXX is a citizen of Pakistan as well as United States.\n[5] Your allegations are fully set out in your basis of claim forms which are Exhibits 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4. You allege that you\u2019re Shia Muslims. For the past 14 years the principal claimant, you\u2019ve run a successful business and your financial situation allow you to make large donations to the imambargahs in your home area in Gujranwala. And that you\u2019ve helped and managed and administer the Shia religious Majalis in your imambargah.\n[6] You\u2019ve also made many charitable donations to insist in improving the welfare of the poor in your community. You testified that your donations to the poor were given irrespective of the religion of the people. You were well-respected by many people in your business community, and because of your connections within the business community, you were able to assist many Shia leaders to get permission for religious ceremonies in Gujranwala.\n[7] You testified that your activities drew negative attention from the radical Sunni in your community who accused you of spreading Shia Kafir among the vulnerable Sunni. You allege you were attacked and injured by men who identified themselves as soldiers of the Lashkar-e-Jhangvi or LeJ when you were working in your office in Gujranwala.\n[8] You and your family then moved to Rawalpindi for protection, and when your family were travelling in your car coming home from the market, shots were fired at you. You made police reports about both of these incidents but protections were not forthcoming, and as far as you learned, the police never did investigate these incidents.\n[9] The threats from the LeJ members continued until you left Pakistan, and you\u2019ve learned from your father that the LeJ have come to see him looking for you, and to give you warning not to return to Pakistan. And this happened after you had moved to Canada.\n[10] You believe that you cannot safely return to Pakistan with your profile as a prominent financially-stable Shia Muslim who\u2019s active in your Shia community.\n[11] I find that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX are convention refugees as you have established a serious possibility of persecution should you return to Pakistan. For the principal claimant, XXXX XXXX, this is based on the grounds of section 96 of your religion as a Shia Muslim. The associate and the minor claimant, XXXX XXXX XXXX are members of a particular social group as they are family members of a prominent Shia who was targeted because of his religion.\n[12] The minor claimant, XXXX XXXX, is not a convention refugee or a person in need of protection, as she has not established that there\u2019s a serious possibility of persecution on a convention ground or that on a balance of probabilities she would be personally be subjected to a danger of torture, or face cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or risk to her life if she returned to the United States.\n[13] Therefore the following reasons apply to my assessment of the remaining claimants. I found you, the principal claimant who provided testimony, to be a very credible witness. I did not find any inconsistencies between your testimony and the documents.\n[14] Your evidence demonstrates for the past 14 years you have run your own business XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX The business has been successful and your financial situation has allowed you to make large donations to your imambargahs in your home area in Gujranwala.\n[15] Because of your prominence in your community you\u2019ve helped to manage and administer the Majalis in your imambargah. You\u2019ve made many charitable donations to assist in improving the welfare of your community. You testified that your donations to the poor were given irrespective of their religion. You were well-respected by many people in your community both Sunni and Shia members.\n[16] Your evidence is that your aim at doing the work in your imambargah and in your community was to reduce the misconceptions about Shia, and to present a peaceful image for both Shia and Sunni to live together. You promoted the peaceful relationships between the two groups in your community by organizing a number of religious ceremonies and, and inviting lecturers into your community to explain more about the commonalities between these groups as opposed to their differences.\n[17] As a result of this community involvement you were targeted by the LeJ. Members of the LeJ attacked you in your Gujranwala office. You were beaten and you were accused of spreading the Shia Kafir to the vulnerable Sunni. After you moved to Gujranwala \u2014 from Gujranwala to Rawalpindi and ended your religious and community activities, you continued to be threatened. Shots were fired at you and your family as you travelled through the city.\n[18] The LeJ made further threats to you and your family, and you had supporting documents submitted at Exhibits 4 and 5 to corroborate your allegations. You disclosed supporting letter from your imambargah in Pakistan and that document corroborated your allegations about your donations and your involvement, along with the threats you received.\n[19] You submitted police reports (indiscernible) reports, hospital records, and also you submitted many documents supporting your business activities. You had affidavits from several people who you had helped by making donations, and affidavits from your family members confirming your experiences, and that your father had been threatened since you left Pakistan.\n[20] These documents demonstrate your continued practice of the Shia faith in Canada. They also demonstrate the persecution you experienced. So I find on a balance of probabilities that these documents corroborate your testimony and support your allegations that you were targeted in Pakistan by the Lashkar-e-Jhangvi due to your profile as a well-established Shia businessman with significant prominence in your home community in Pakistan.\n[21] You established your credible evidentiary basis for subjective fears in returning to Pakistan. Based on your credibility of your allegations and because of your profile, I find that you, your wife and children became targets of the LeJ. The evidence demonstrates that you continue to be targeted even after you left Pakistan.\n[22] It established that you will continue to be an active Shia member if you were to return to Pakistan, and the feature if you would continue to demonstrate the importance to you of making donations and to assist those who are less fortunate. You expressed how important these activities are to you, as they integral to your beliefs.\n[23] Your testimony and the documentary evidence that we have demonstrates that well-founded fear of persecution and there\u2019s a serious possibility that you and your family will be subjected to death threats and violence at the hands of Islamic extremists if you returned to Pakistan.\n[24] The evidence establishes that there\u2019s been an increase in killings of Shias by militant groups, and targeted killings of Shia Muslim professionals and officials and prominent businesspeople in Pakistan. The risks you would face are corroborated by the package of country condition documents that are submitted at Exhibit 3; the national documentation package for Pakistan.\n[25] Item 7.12 of that national documentation package describes the LeJ as a band Sunni militant group, a Sunni terrorist outfit being one of the most violent extremist organizations in Pakistan. It\u2019s been responsible for the killing of hundreds of Shias since its formation in 1996, and the group has been behind some of the most violent attacks of Shia Muslims in the recent years.\n[26] Item 1.8 of the national documentation package reports that the militant groups responsible for some of the most \u2014 are responsible for most of the attacks against Shias, are including the LeJ, and that sectarian violence against Shia continues to be a growing threat in Pakistan. There are reports of targeted killings of Shia professionals and officials, including doctors, politicians, prominent businesspeople, which is a profile that I find the principal claimant fits within.\n[27] Item 12.5 indicates that Shia have traditionally represented the highest proportion of casualties in sectarian violence throughout Pakistan, noting that Shia faced threats from many militant groups including the LeJ. The Shia community is very large in Pakistan, and so not all Shias from Pakistan have a well-founded fear of, of persecution.\n[28] However, the national documentation package supports your claim that due to the principal claimant\u2019s prominence as a successful professional who\u2019s made significant donations and being very active in the Shia community, you have a profile that would be likely attractive to the extremists like the LeJ.\n[29] Your evidence demonstrates on a balance of probabilities that you\u2019ve established a well-founded fear of persecution should you return to Pakistan.\n[30] I find that you\u2019ve also rebutted the presumption of state protection in your case. I accept that you contacted the police, that protection was not forthcoming. You filed reports to the police, your brother checked, checked back with the police and you\u2019ve learned that nothing has ever been given as far as information with respect to the steps of the investigation into the incidents you reported.\n[31] The objective documentary evidence in the national documentation package shows that the government has been criticized for failing to protect Shia Muslims from attacks and for allowing militant groups to operate with impunity, failing to investigate and punish those responsible for the violent attacks against Shias in Pakistan. It describes the authorities as often being indifferent, incompetent, and even complicit in the violence against Shias.\n[32] Item 7.12 states that if someone is threatened by the LeJ, asking for protection from police is not effective because the Shia community is too large and the police cannot provide security to everyone. The courts are also ineffective because many of the witnesses don\u2019t come forward to testify out of fear, and therefore they release suspects due to lack of evidence.\n[33] In light of all this evidence I find there\u2019s a preponderance of objective documentary evidence that there\u2019s a clear and convincing evidence before me that the state is unable and unwilling to provide you with adequate protection.\n[34] I considered whether it was safe for you to live in another area of Pakistan, and I suggested Lahore could be a viable alternative. I accept your evidence about the importance for you to be able to practice your faith and continue to contribute to your community.\n[35] You testified that through these actions, through your business transactions, through your need to register or your rental documents and other documents with the police you would be identified, and that those working in government administration, many of whom could be sympathizers to the LeJ would identify you and you would be discovered.\n[36] Item 1.8 of the national documentation package indicates that armed militant groups such as the LeJ have a wide geographic reach in Pakistan. Item 7.2 reports that the LeJ is responsible for violence throughout Pakistan, and that likely there\u2019s no internal flight alternative available to those at risk of being targeted, or who have already been targeted by such groups.\n[37] The LeJ continued their threats even after you left Gujranwala, and since coming to Canada. This demonstrates that they have a continued interest in finding you and that they would find you and harm you if, if you returned to Pakistan.\n[38] Even if you were able to relocate for a short period of time in Lahore, your active faith and your, and your donations, your activities in your community would again make you a prominent figure in this community and this would create a serious possibility that you would eventually be found and persecuted in the future.\n[39] It would be unreasonable for the Board to expect you to restrict your religious practices and your freedom to assist your communities just because of your fear of this group. The LeJ has been persistent in its search for you, demonstrated a continued motivation, and I find that they have the capacity to find you, given their reach and influence in Pakistan.\n[40] The associate claimant and the minor claimant are also Shia. The associate claimant and the children may not have the same heightened profile as the principal claimant, but they are also at risk. In the past you were, you were with the principal claimant in a vehicle when you were under attack. The LeJ soldiers have indicated that they would harm all of you as a family.\n[41] You\u2019ve credibly demonstrated on the evidence that there\u2019s a serious possibility that you also would face risk if you returned to Pakistan and throughout Pakistan, including Lahore.\n[42] The Board therefore finds that on a balance of probabilities the claimants\u2019 lives would be at risk throughout Pakistan. The Board\u2019s determined that the claimants have no viable internal flight alternative in Pakistan, including Lahore.\n[43] Based on this analysis I conclude that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX are convention refugees and I accept your claims.\n[44] The minor claimant, XXXX XXXX, is neither a convention refugee nor a person in need of protection. Her claim is therefore rejected by the Board.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

I have considered your testimony and the other evidence in the case, and I am ready to render my decision orally. You are claiming to be a citizen of Iran and are claiming refugee protection pursuant to Sections 96 and 97.(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nDetermination:\n[2] I find that you are a Convention refugee on the grounds of your religion for the following reasons.\nAllegations:\n[3] Your allegations are set out in your Basis of Claim form, which is found in Exhibit 2. In summary, you allege that you are a citizen of Iran who was born Muslim but converted to Christianity after coming to Canada in XXXX 2019. You alleged that you faced a number of problems with the Iranian regime that began during your university years in the late \u201870s. You alleged that you were opposed to the regime after the revolution and that you had become politically active.\n[4] You were detained for one week in 1981 and questioned about your activities and your friends\u2019 activities. You also allege that you had difficulties as a woman and struggled to find employment due to your political activities and gender. Furthermore, in March 2019, you allege you were arrested and detained for one night for violating the dress code.\n[5] Your husband posted your bail the next day to have you released. He testified that you struggled a lot and experienced intense inner turmoil. In or around 2014, 2015, you began attending a yoga class. In this class, you met other Christians who would talk to you about Christianity and Jesus Christ. The yoga instructor also provided you a book on peace that included quotes from the Bible and Jesus Christ.\n[6] You became interested in Christianity but could not explore further in Iran. You came to Canada in XXXX 2019 to visit your sister and started attending a Christian church here. Since May 2020, you have been attending a church online that has Bible studies in Farsi. You wish to be baptized, but because of the COVID-19 pandemic, you have unable to. You fear that if you return to Iran, you would be arrested and killed for converting to Christianity.\nIdentity:\n[7] Your identity as a national of Iran has been established on a balance of probabilities by your testimony and the supporting documents filed in Exhibits 1 and 5, such as your passport.\nCredibility:\n[8] In terms of your general credibility, I find that you are a credible witness and therefore, believe what you have alleged. You were straightforward and forthright in your oral testimony. While you could not remember the name of the church, you were able to tell me your pastor\u2019s name. You testified that you attend church twice a week online and that you were introduced to this church through a friend named XXXX (ph).\n[9] You were able to tell me about the service, your favourite passage from the Bible and what it means to you, how you celebrated Easter and the meaning of the holiday, as well as what it means to you to be a Christian and the peace and calm you have found since converting. I have also considered the documentation you filed, including the assessment from the psychotherapist where you talked about the difficulties you faced in Iran and its impact that it has had on your mental state.\n[10] You have been diagnosed with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and I have considered the report in assessing your credibility today. You also provided a letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX (ph) who confirms that you have been attending his church online since May 2020 and describes you as an enthusiastic member of the Farsi speaking Bible study which meets weekly.\n[11] You provided an email from a friend in Iran who describes your political activities in university and how you have talked to him about Christianity for the past few years. You also provided the bail receipt confirming your husband posted your bail on March 26, 2019 after you had been arrested for dress code violations in Iran. Therefore, based on your credible testimony and the documentary evidence provided, I find on a balance of probabilities that you have converted to Christianity and that you have established a subjective fear of persecution.\nObjective Evidence:\n[12] The objective documentation supports your allegations and the risks you face on return to Iran as a Christian convert. The objective evidence in the National Documentation Package talks about the persecutory treatments of Christians and in particular, Muslims who have converted to Christianity.\n[13] Items 12.1 and 12.15 of the National Documentation Package state that Iran is an Islamic Republic and Islam is the official state religion. The law prohibits Muslim citizens from changing or renouncing their religious beliefs and the only recognized conversions are from another religion to Islam. Apostasy from Islam is a crime punishable by death and Christin converts face harassment, interrogation, and arrest from the government and are forced to practice in secret. Additionally, I have considered the evidence in the National Documentation Package on the human rights situation for women in Iran.\n[14] Item 2.1 says that amongst a significant human rights abuses in Iran, there is a harsh governmental restriction on the rights of women.\n[15] Item 2.5 states that women face discrimination and personal status matters and talks about the dress code in Iran and harsh sentences for women who protest compulsory hijab laws.\n[16] I find this evidence regarding the treatment of women also heightens the risk you faced in Iran, not only as a Christian convert, but as a woman. Therefore, based on this documentary evidence, I find that you have an objectively well-founded fear of persecution due to your religion that is only exacerbated by your gender.\nState Protection:\n[17] I find that state protection would not be available to you were you to seek it in Iran. There is a presumption that absent to complete (inaudible) are capable of protection their citizens, however, there are agents of the state themselves are sources of persecution presumptuous of state protection may be rebutted without exhausting all avenues or recourse in the country.\n[18] In this case, the agent of persecution is the state that bans conversion to Christianity and restricts freedom of religion. Therefore, I find that you have rebutted the presumption of state protection and that adequate state protection would not be available to you in Iran.\nInternal Flight Alternative:\n[19] I have also considered whether a viable Internal Flight Alternative exists for you, however, given that Iran is in control of all of its territories and the persecution of Christians is state wide, I find that you face a serious possibility persecution throughout Iran and there is no viable Internal Flight Alternative for you.\nConclusion:\n[20] Based on the totality of the evidence, I find that you are a Convention refugee and your claim is therefore accepted.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

The claimants are citizens of Venezuela and claiming refugee protection pursuant to Section 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, I will call this the IRPA.\n[2] The facts and events alleged in support of this claim are set out in the claimant\u2019s respective Basis of Claim forms, BOC forms, found at Exhibit 2. In summary, the claimant\u2019s fear of harm in Venezuela from the government (inaudible) due to their political opinion. This panel has determined that the claimants are Convention refugees pursuant to Section 96 of IRPA.\n[3] I find that the claims have a nexus to the Convention based on political opinion. I have analysed the claims under Section 96 of the IRPA. In making this assessment, the panel has considered all of the evidence including the oral testimonies and the documentary evidence. The claimant\u2019s identities were established on a balance of probabilities by the certified true copies of their Venezuelan issued passports contained in Exhibit 1.\n[4] With regards to credibility, I find that the principal claimant testified in a straightforward fashion with regards to the central elements of his claim. The associate claimant agreed with her husband and spoke regarding details of her claim. The panel finds that the claimant\u2019s overall testimony was credible.\n[5] The principal claimant described being persecuted in Venezuela due to his political opinion. The claimant\u2019s provided testimony regarding their activities with the opposition parties. Regarding Un Nuevo Tiempo and Voluntad Popular providing supporting documents including the proof of membership letters, membership cards, searchable QR membership codes and affidavits of those who they organized and protest with. I put full weight on these documents that corroborate the events and find that the profile of political opinion is established.\n[6] In July of 2019, the principal claimant was permanently removed from his job by order of Mayor Willy Casanova. He was removed without receipt of any payment of his social benefits for being an opponent of the government. He provided sworn declarations from two colleagues in support of the fact of the circumstances of the firing. The panel puts full weight on these documents and finds that the claimant was fired on account of his perceived opposition of the government.\n[7] The claimant testified how during the lead up of the December 6, 2020 parliamentary elections, the principal claimant and his wife shared the news that they should boycott. They spread the word that the abstention votes and a week before the elections, they were reported to the communal council. They were visited by several members of the Counsel led by Jennifer Goodoi (ph) who was the main coordinator of the PSUV in the Cristo Duranza (ph) parish, accompanied by the Yeanina Echevaria (ph) and Marisol Calvejar (ph). They were threatened by those female members in front of the home and they were threatened that the next time SEBIN would attend. They were told to leave and not return because traitors like them had to be jailed or eradicated.\n[8] On December 3, 2020, they bought air tickets to travel to Canada. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the earliest tickets they could secure were for XXXX XXXX 2020 leaving from Bogota, Colombia. On December 5, 2020, they bought a ticket from Rioja to Bogota leaving on XXXX XXXX 2020.\n[9] On Sunday, December 6, 2020, it was the day of the elections. There was a large abstention of the vote. The Sunday night of the election, the woman of the community council returned to the home. They threatened the claimants that they would be stripped of their home, deprived of their freedom. The panel finds that the claimants were credible in describing the ongoing threats against him and his wife by the community council who identified him as being in opposition to the current government.\n[10] At dawn on Monday, XXXX XXXX they paid a friend 500 US dollars to take them by highway to Colombia. The border was closed due to COVID-19. They left the country through back roads called las trochas where there is no immigration or security. These roads are very dangerous and frequented by Colombian guerilla, but they risked it to leave the country. They were alerted by friends in the early morning of XXXX XXXX 2020 that a black SEBIN van looked for them and that their house was raided. They provided an affidavit that corroborates this fact. I put full weight to this document.\n[11] They stayed in a hotel until their flight to Bogota arrived. On XXXX XXXX they travelled to Bogota where they stayed in a further hotel and then on XXXX 2020, they flew to Canada where they were met by family, specifically their daughter and her husband. On March 15, 2021, they were informed by a neighbour in Venezuela, XXXX XXXX (ph), that the community council who had visited before arrived with Colectivos, who were motorized and armed, and took possession of their home. They gave their home to a family from the community council. The claimants provided further documents corroborating these facts.\n[12] The panel accepts that the claimant and his wife have lost their family home, as was threatened by the communal council when they were identified in opposition of the government. The panel finds that the claimants face threats in Venezuela due to their political opinion, that these incidents did occur and on a balance of probabilities are likely to occur on a forward-looking basis. The panel finds that the claimants have established on a balance of probabilities a subjective fear in Venezuela.\n[13] On the matter of objective basis, the evidence before me on a balance of probabilities supports an objective basis for the claimant\u2019s fear upon return to Venezuela. Country documents corroborate that the Venezuelan government targets those who are opposed to the Maduro regime.\n[14] The objective evidence at Item 1.6 of the National Documentation Package for Venezuela indicates that security forces in Venezuela have perpetrated a number of violent acts against demonstrators, actual or perceived opposition members and activists, elected officials and students and that Venezuelan authorities have implemented measures aimed at suppressing and punishing the expression of dissenting views. They\u2019ve targeted victims by reason of their actual or perceived opposition to the government.\n[15] It is also noted at Item 2.13 of the NDP that people have been charged with vague and ambiguous criminal offences such as defamation, high treason and incitement to violence, which has resulted in the criminalization of public opinion and the criminalization of criticism and a violation of legal principles and standards. The documentary evidence at Item 2.13 also indicates persons are arbitrarily detained and held as political prisoners by the regime, including citizens from every walk of life who were exercising their fundamental right to peaceful protest and demanding respect for the rights protected by the constitution which were denied to them by the government of President Maduro.\n[16] This panel finds that the claimants have established an objective basis for their claims and that their fears are well-founded.\n[17] Regarding state protection, the United States Department of State report for 2020 indicates that there is a pervasive corruption and impunity among all security forces and in other national and state government officers in Venezuela, including at the highest levels. It was noted that the government has taken no effective action to combat the impunity that\u2019s prevalent in all levels of the civilian bureaucracy and the security forces.\n[18] Amnesty International report in 2020 indicates that most victims of human rights violations continue to Jack access to truth, justice, reparation and that the victims and their families were often subjected to intimidation. In this case, as the claimant\u2019 s fears are of serious harm from the state including SEBIN and the Colectivos, based on the documentary evidence, this panel finds that on the balance of probabilities, the claimants would not be able to avail themselves of the protection of the authorities in Venezuela because adequate state protection would not be available to the claimant. The assumption that claimants would be able to receive adequate state protection in Venezuela from the state is contradicted by the country conditions evidence. The panel is satisfied that the claimants have rebutted the presumption of state protection.\n[19] The panel further finds that the claimant\u2019 s fears is actually of serious harm at the hands of the state and the current actions taken by the state against political opposition is nationwide, as referenced in the evidence cited above, and therefore, there is no Internal Flight Alternative available throughout Venezuela for these claimants.\n[20] In conclusion, I find that the claimants have established serious possibility of persecution in Venezuela based on a Convention ground, namely the claimants\u2019 political opinions. The claim for refugee protection is therefore accepted.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2021 RLLR 82\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: November 4, 2021\nPanel: Erin Doucette\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Tshiombo Achille Kabongo\nCountry: Ethiopia\nRPD Number: TC1-07766\nAssociated RPD Number(s): TC1-07767 \/ TC1-07768 \/ TC1-07769\nATIP Number: A-2022-01778\nATIP Pages: N\/A\nREASONS FOR DECISION\nIntroduction\n[1] XXXX XXXX XXXX (principal claimant), his wife, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (associate claimant) and their children, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (female minor claimant), and XXXX XXXX XXXX (male minor claimant), claim to be citizens of Ethiopia and claim refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).[1]\n[2] Their claims for refugee protection were heard jointly, pursuant to Rule 55 of the Refugee Protection Division Rules (RPD Rules).[2] The minor claimants relied on the Basis of Claim (BOC) narrative of the principal claimant. The panel appointed the principal claimant as the minor claimants\u2019 designated representative.\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] The details of the claimants\u2019 allegations are fully set out in their BOC forms as amended.[3] To summarize, the principal claimant alleges a fear of persecution from the Ethiopian authorities based on his imputed anti-government political opinion and activity in support of the Raya ethnicity and because of his ethnicity as Tigrayan. The associate claimant and minor claimants allege a fear of persecution based on their membership in a particular social group as the family of the principal claimant. They allege that state protection is not available to them nor is there anywhere safe to relocate within Ethiopia.\nDETERMINATION\n[4] The panel finds that the claimants are Convention refugees pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA. The claimants face a serious possibility of persecution based on the principal claimant\u2019s imputed anti-government political opinion, activity, and Tigrayan ethnicity.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[5] The personal identities of the claimants are established on a balance of probabilities by their Ethiopian passports.[4]\nCredibility\n[6] A claimant\u2019s sworn testimony is presumed truthful unless there are reasons to doubt the veracity of their allegations.[5] The presumption of truthfulness is rebuttable and a claimant bears the burden of establishing their claim.[6] In assessing credibility, the panel is mindful of the many difficulties faced by the claimant in establishing a claim, including nervousness, cultural factors, and the setting of the virtual hearing room. The claimants relied on an Amharic interpreter during the hearing.\n[7] In assessing the principal and associate claimants\u2019 testimony, the panel has taken into consideration the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX both dated October 3, 2021.[7] The respective assessment reports document self-reported sleep disruption and self-reported memory and concentration problems. The XXXX recommends that questions be posed to the claimants in a sensitive manner and that frequent breaks be provided. In light of the XXXX recommendations, the panel offered to repeat questions if required and encouraged the claimants to let the panel know if they required a break, so that breaks could be arranged as needed.\n[8] The principal claimant testified in a straightforward manner and there we no material inconsistencies or omissions between his testimony and the other documents in evidence that were not reasonably explained. Overall, the panel finds the claimants credibly established their allegations on a balance of probabilities.\nPrincipal claimant credibly established profile as Tigrayan\n[9] The panel finds that the principal claimant has credibly established his ethnicity as Tigrayan as alleged.\n[10] A Tigrayan speaking interpreter was provided for the hearing, as this is the mother tongue of the principal claimant, and they did speak in Tigrayan on the recorded. However, the associate claimant, who is not Tigrayan, does not speak Tigrayan. It was determined that the mutual language of communication between the principal claimant and the associate claimant is Amharic, which the interpreter speaks as well. The hearing proceeded in Amharic; nevertheless, it was confirmed on the record that the principal claimant speaks Tigrayan.\n[11] The principal claimant has provided a copy of his kebele identification card which confirms his ethnicity as Tigray.[8] The panel finds that the principal claimant\u2019s kebele is a reliable document in credibly establishing the claimant\u2019s ethnicity as Tigrayan because its details and appearance are consistent with the objective documents regarding identity cards issued in Addis Ababa and as such the panel has no reason to doubt the genuineness of this document.[9]\n[12] The panel also gives weight to the affidavit from the principal claimant\u2019s father and kebele from the principal claimant\u2019s sister in credibly establishing his ethnicity as Tigrayan.[10] These documents confirm the ethnicity of the principal claimant\u2019s father and sister as Tigrayan as well. These documents do not present credibility concerns, as such the panel finds them to be reliable and gives them weight in credibly establishing the principal claimant\u2019s ethnicity as Tigrayan as alleged.\nThe principal claimant has credibly established his allegations of imputed anti-government political opinion\n[13] The panel finds on a balance of probabilities, that the principal claimant has credibly established imputed political opinion and activity perceived as anti-government which brought him to the attention of the Ethiopian authorities.\n[14] The claimant explained that he was employed with XXXX XXXX a government owned national XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. During work meetings management attempted to recruit employees to the Prosperity Party. The principal claimant explained that during these meetings he voiced his opposition to the Prosperity Party. He also testified that his manager and party members asked him on separate occasions to join the Prosperity Party and he refused.\n[15] The panel finds that the claimant did not embellish his testimony and was clear that although he held an anti-government opinion, he was not himself politically active other than belonging to a committee dedicated to supporting the Raya people.[11] He explained that his mother is of Raya ethnicity and his one brother still lives in the city of Alamata, in the Rayan area, which is not formally recognized by the government nor surrounding Tigray and Amara regions. He said that his committee activities came to the party recruiters\u2019 attention, and they asked him to recruit people from his committee to the party, which he also refused to do. He also provided a letter of support form his friend and colleague who was aware of his committee activities.[12] He testified in a detailed and spontaneous manner about the committee and his activities and there were not material inconsistencies and omissions. Any concerns raised by the panel were reasonably explained by the principal claimant.\n[16] The panel finds on a balance of probabilities that the claimant has credibly established an imputed political opinion based on having voiced his opposition to the government of the day, the ruling Prosperity Party and for refusing to join and aid in recruiting people to the party.\nThe principal claimant has credibly established allegations of police persecution in Ethiopia\n[17] The panel finds that the principal claimant has credibly established his allegations of police persecution in Ethiopia because of his perceived political opinion. The claimant testified in a straightforward and genuine manner about his arrest and detention in Ethiopia from XXXX XXXX 2019. His testimony was consistent with his BOC. He testified that he was interrogated and beaten during his detention. He was never officially told why he was arrested or detained, but that during his interrogation comments were made about his anti-government political opinions. The panel accepts his testimony on a balance of probabilities as credible.\n[18] The principal claimant also provided documentary evidence to corroborate that he was arrested and detained and released on bail as alleged. He provided a letter from his sister and while the letter does not expressly say that she witnessed his arrest, the panel finds the claimant\u2019s explanation for this clarification reasonable noting that they reside in the same home which has been credibly established by comparing the addresses on their respective kebeles which the panel finds genuine.[13] The details in his sister\u2019s letter are consistent with the claimant\u2019s evidence and BOC. The panel finds this document to be reliable in credibly establishing the claimant\u2019s allegations of arrest and detention by the Ethiopian authorities and subsequent release on bail.\n[19] The letter from the principal claimant\u2019s friend and former colleague, contained some material additions as compared to his BOC and BOC amendment.[14] Specifically, the principal claimant does not mention in either his BOC or BOC amendment the name of his friend or that this friend paid his bail, witnessed the state he was in when released and drove him home. The principal claimant acknowledged that he did not include this information and explained that he did not know he had to. The panel does not find this to be a reasonable explanation noting these details are material to his allegations, especially concerning the bail conditions under which he was released. Furthermore, the BOC instructions clearly state that the claimant is to provide such evidence that may support their claim. Rule 11 of the Refugee Protection Division Rules also applies to material aspects of the claim.[15] Nonetheless, the letter from his sister and the medical documentation, discussed below, remedy any credibility findings in relation to these omissions not reasonably explained.\n[20] The panel finds that the medical documentation provided corroborates the injuries the principal claimant alleges he sustained while being detained by Ethiopian authorities from XXXX XXXX 2019.[16] While the report does not indicate the accident or injury history, the objective medical findings are consistent with the injuries the principal claimant alleges he received at the hands of the Ethiopian authorities while being detained. The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the medical report credibly establishes the principal claimant\u2019s allegations of arrest, detention, and physical abuse by the Ethiopian authorities as alleged.\nThe principal claimant has credibly established his ability to leave Ethiopia after his arrest and detention while released on bail conditions\n[21] The panel finds on a balance of probabilities that the claimant has reasonably explained how he was able to leave Ethiopia by airplane despite having been arrested and released on bail conditions. He testified that he bribed a security agent with $50,000 Birr. The panel finds that, as an airline employee, the principal claimant, would on a balance of probabilities have knowledge of this as an option for airport exit. He explained that he asked around to learn that he could do this. Furthermore, the objective documents credibly establish that bail conditions do not necessary prevent someone from exiting Ethiopia by air.[17]\nThe principal claimant has credibly established his allegations of forward-facing persecution from the Ethiopian authorities\n[22] The principal claimant has credibly established a forward-facing fear or persecution from the Ethiopian authorities. He explained that one of his bail conditions was that on the first of every month of the Ethiopian calendar he was to report to the police station. Since he absconded and essentially reneged on his bail conditions the police have come to his home looking for him, questioning his family members, and have deposited summons notices.[18] The police notices are consistent with the information reported in the letter from the principal claimant\u2019s sister and with the country documents specific to delivery methods and appearances of police summons.[19] The panel finds that the principal claimant has credibly established his allegations of forward-facing persecution from the Ethiopian authorities on a balance of probabilities.\n[23] In light of the foregoing, the principal claimant has credibly established his subjective fear as related to his imputed political opinion. He has also credibly established his profile as an ethnic Tigrayan.\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution\n[24] The panel finds that there is an objective basis for the claimants\u2019 subjective fear. In making this finding the panel gives weight to the following:\n[25] While the US DOS report reflects some of the positive changes in the human rights climate in Ethiopia as a result of Prime Minister Abiy\u2019s assumption of office, it also notes that as a result of a lack of institutional capacity, often the government was impotent in prosecuting officials who committed human rights abuses resulting in impunity.[20] However, more recently Amnesty International acknowledges that recurrent unrest and violence led to increased political polarization along ethnic lines, and largely prevented the realization of political and human rights reforms initiated in 2018.[21]\n[26] The security and human rights situation in Ethiopia deteriorated as Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed struggled to maintain order amid growing unrest and political tensions. The rights landscape was defined by ongoing abuses by government security forces, attacks on civilians by armed groups, deadly violence along communal and ethnic lines, and a political crisis.[22]\n[27] While the DFAT report notes that violence based on ethnicity is not common in Addis Ababa, where the claimants resided in Ethiopia before they left, it does note that anti-Tigrayan sentiment has become more overt since 2018 and hate speech against ordinary Tigrayans has increased in this time.[23]\n[28] More recent country condition updates; however, reflect the deteriorating conditions in Ethiopia, for Tigrayans throughout the country more broadly.[24] After the outbreak of the armed struggle between the Tigray region and the federal government in early November 2020, anti\u00ad Tigrayan sentiments in Ethiopia increased. According to various sources, both confidential and open, there have been cases of ethnic profiling of people with a Tigrayan background even in Addis Ababa.[25]\n[29] Counsel provided updated and reliable country condition documents that are consistent with the objective documents with respect to risks to Tigrayans outside Tigray and specifically in Addis Ababa.[26]\n[30] With regards to actual or imputed political opinion, Abiy\u2019s ruling Prosperity Party (a reconfiguration of the ethno-regional coalition that ruled Ethiopia since 199) has partly reverted to authoritarian tactics, jailing opposition leaders and limiting media freedom in the face of growing regional and intercommunal violence.[27]\n[31] A January 2020 revision of the Anti-Terrorism Proclamation (ATP) law improved upon the previous ATP, but has continued to draw criticism from many groups, including Amnesty. International, that it could be used against those critical of the government noting provisions that restrict rights to freedom of expression.[28]\n[32] Lastly, the US DOS report confirms torture and abuse of detainees, arbitrary arrests and deplorable detention center conditions consistent with the principal claimant\u2019s allegations.[29]\n[33] In light of the foregoing, the panel finds that there is an objective basis for the principal claimant\u2019s subjective fear. The principal claimant has credibly established a well-founded fear of persecution from the Ethiopian authorities based on his imputed political opinion. His forward\u00ad facing risk is further augmented by his profile as an ethnic Tigrayan. The associate and minor claimants face a serious possibility of persecution in Ethiopia based on their membership in a particular social group as family members of the principal claimant.\nState Protection\n[34] The claimants have rebutted the presumption of state protection. The panel finds that state protection would not be available to the claimants if they were to seek it in Ethiopia noting the state is an agent of persecution which the claimants have credibly established on a balance of probabilities.[30]\n[35] In coming to this finding, the panel notes the following country condition information related to state protection which confirm ethnic profiling of Tigrayans by police, that arbitrary arrests and detentions occur, and that due process rights and rights to a fair trial are not generally respected all of which are occurring in a rapidly devolving political climate heightened by increased ethnic tension and violence throughout Ethiopia.[31]\nInternal Flight Alternative (IFA)\n[36] The panel considered whether a viable IFA exists for the claimants in Ethiopia. However, when considering the totality of their personal evidence and the objective documentary evidence, and the fact that they are from Addis Ababa, which until recently was considered low risk for ethnic violence, the panel finds that a viable IFA in Ethiopia does not exist for the claimants. Simply put, they face a serious possibility of persecution anywhere in Ethiopia based on the principal claimant\u2019s imputed political opinion, the credibly established forward-facing risk of persecution from the Ethiopian authorities and the principal claimant\u2019s profile as an ethnic Tigrayan.\nCONCLUSION\n[37] Having considered the totality of the evidence, the panel finds that the claimants, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX are Convention refugees pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA.\n[38] Their claims are accepted.\n(signed) Erin Doucette\nNovember 4, 2021\n[1] Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), SC 2001, c 27, as amended.\n[2] Refugee Protection Division Rules, SOR\/2012-256, Rule 55.\n[3] Exhibits 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, and Exhibit 9.\n[4] Exhibit 1, Exhibit 5.\n[5] Maldonado v.

It is 4:30 p.m., and we are back on the record. I am now prepared to deliver my decision and reasons for that decision in the matter of XXXX XXXX.\n[2] XXXX XXXX the claimant, is a citizen of Hungary. He seeks protection pursuant to s. 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. The claimant travelled to Canada with his wife. However, she is not part of this claim. As she made a previous claim for protection in Canada in 2012, she is not eligible to make a claim for protection now.\n[3] The allegations of this claim can be found in the claimant\u2019s basis of claim form and in his testimony. The claimant fears persecution on the basis of race at the hands of society in general in Hungary, and right\u00ad wing nationalist groups in Hungary in particular. The claimant alleges that if he were to return to Hungary, he would be subject to persecution in the form of denial of occupational opportunities on the basis of his Roma ethnicity, as well as persecution in the form of increased risk of violence, also on the basis of his Roma ethnicity.\n[4] At the outset of the hearing, I identified credibility as the primary issue for the hearing to focus on.\n[5] With respect to identity, on file at Exhibit 1 is a certified copy of the claimant\u2019s passport from Hungary. At Exhibit 4 are other identification documents, as well as a letter from the Roma Community Centre of Toronto, dated February 25th, 2021, attesting to the claimant\u2019s Roma ethnicity. Through these documents and the claimant\u2019s testimony, the claimant has established his personal identity, his citizenship of Hungary, and his Roma ethnicity.\n[6] With respect to credibility, a claimant testified under oath is presumed to be telling the truth unless there exist valid reasons to disbelieve the testimony. In this case, I have no valid reason to reject the claimant\u2019s testimony. The claimant left school in Grade 8, and my credibility assessment takes into account his level of education, as well as other social and cultural factors. I have also taken into account situation factors inherent in the stress of refugee proceedings, as well as any potential difficulties involved through communication with an interpreter.\n[7] The claimant was straightforward in his testimony. There were no material inconsistencies or contradictions in his testimony, and his testimony was generally consistent with his Basis of Claim form. The claimant submitted written documentation in Exhibit 4 in the form of medical reports as well as police reports that confirmed that the claimant, consistent with his testimony, had been the subject of assault and that he had reported these assaults to the police. In his testimony, the claimant was able to provide considerable detail in a spontaneous fashion regarding specific instances of harassment, discrimination, and violence mentioned in his basis of claim form. I find that overall, the claimant was a credible witness. The claimant testified he was denied educational opportunities while living in Hungary. He testified that he was segregated at school with other Roma students, and that he and the other Roma students at school were not allowed to participate in school trips or sports events. He testified that Roma students were often subject to abuse and violence at the hands of other students, and that complaints by Roma students and their parents would be dismissed by school officials\n[8] INTERPRETER: Sorry.\n[9] MEMBER: As noted above, I find the claimant to be a credible \u2014 I am sorry. I find the claimant\u2019s testimony to be credible. I find on a balance of probability that the claimant did experience discrimination in education as a result of his Roma ethnicity. With respect to employment opportunities, the claimant testified that he had applied for a number of jobs while living in Hungary, only to find himself rejected once the employer found out about his Roma ethnicity. In his Basis of Claim form, the claimant described going to an employment centre in his home city of Miskolc to seek employment in January 2019. The claimant was told that there were no jobs available for Roma. I find on a balance of probability that the claimant has faced discrimination in employment as a result of his Roma ethnicity.\n[10] The claimant\u2019s allegations are supported by country condition reports that outline discrimination in education and employment against members of the Roma community. While individual instances of discrimination do not necessarily constitute persecution, the effect of a cumulative pattern of discrimination in different contexts have been found by the Federal Court of Canada in a case called Ola (ph) v. Canada to constitute persecution, taking into account the individual effect on a claimant.\n[11] In the case of the claimant, the discrimination the claimant faces must be viewed in light of the violence that the claimant alleges he has suffered as a result of his Roma ethnicity. The claimant described a number of instances where he or his spouse personally suffered violence. These include an incident in March 2016, where the claimant and his wife were on the way to a movie when he was attacked by a group of men dressed in black clothes. The claimant testified that his assailants yelled anti-Roma slurs and told the claimant and his wife they did not belong in Hungary. The claimant described another incident in May 2019, when his pregnant wife was attacked by a group of men who knocked her to the ground, called her a \u201cstinking gypsy\u201d, and repeatedly kicked her. The claimant described a third incident that was the impetus for the claimant\u2019s decision to leave Hungary. In December 2019, the claimant and his wife were attacked while shopping by a group of men armed with bats, chains, and knives. The claimant was stabbed in the hand defending himself. The claimant testified that his assailants yelled anti\u00ad Roma slurs at himself. At Exhibit 4, the claimant submitted documentary evidence of the medical attention needed and the specific injuries suffered during these attacks. I find on a balance of probabilities that the claimant has suffered multiple instances of violence on the basis of his Roma ethnicity. I find that the cumulative effect of the discrimination suffered, and the violence experienced by the claimant does constitute persecution. I find the claimant does have a fear of persecution if the claimant were to return to Hungary.\n[12] With respect to whether there is an objective basis for this fear, Item 13.5 of the National Documentation Package for Hungary, dated September 1st, 2020, supports the claimant\u2019s allegation that Roma in Hungary are subject to widespread discrimination in the field of education and employment. Item 13.14 of the National Documentation Package notes that attacks against Roma and other minorities by far-right and neo-Nazi militias are on the increase in Hungary. I conclude that the claimant has an objective basis for his fear of persecution.\n[13] With respect to state protection, the claimant testified that he does not believe the police would be able to help him escape the threat of violence. The claimant testified he has reported each of the incidents he has described to the police, and none have resulted in any arrests. Item 13.6 of the National Documentation Package for Hungary supports the claimant\u2019s allegation that the state cannot protect victims of assault directed against the Roma community. Although Hungary may have formal legal protection against hate\u00ad motivated violence, Item 13.6 cites Amnesty International to conclude that Roma continue to be inadequately protected against hate crimes and that the police response to such crimes is generally not adequate. I conclude that the evidence in the National Documentation Package indicates that the claimant could not reasonably expect to receive state protection against persecution.\n[14] With respect to whether the claimant had an internal flight alternative within Hungary, the country condition reports mentioned above highlight the pervasiveness of anti-Roma racism throughout the country. I find that the claimant has no reasonable internal flight alternative within Hungary.\n[15] My conclusion is this: based on the evidence before me and the testimony of the claimant, I conclude that the claimant has established a serious possibility of persecution on the Convention ground of race if he were to return to Hungary. The claimant is therefore a Convention refugee pursuant to s. 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. His claim for protection is accepted.\n[16] That concludes my reasons. Sir, do you have any questions?\n[17] CLAIMANT: No, I don\u2019t have \u2013 I don\u2019t have questions\n[18] MEMBER: All right. I would like to thank you for answering all of my questions today. I know that answering some of them may have brought back difficult memories. I would like to thank your counsel for his representation of you today, and I would like to thank the interpreter for making sure we could all understand each other.\n[19] If there is nothing else, we can conclude the hearing.\n[20] COUNSEL: There\u2019s nothing from us. Congratulations, Mr. XXXX.\n[21] Thank you, Laslo.\n[22] INTERPRETER: Thank you very much. Congratulations as well.\n[23] MEMBER: Thank you, everybody. Please stay safe and have a good rest of your evening.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2021 RLLR 80\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: November 25, 2021\nPanel: Rupinder Nirman\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Marianne B Lithwick\nCountry: Mexico\nRPD Number: TC0-02951\nAssociated RPD Number(s): TC0-03020 \/ TC0-03037\nATIP Number: A-2022-01778\nATIP Pages: N\/A\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] The principal claimant, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and the minor claimant, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, the female claimant, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX claim to be citizens of Mexico, and are claiming refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).[1]\nJoined Claims\n[2] These claims were joined in accordance with Rule 55 of the Refugee Protection Division\n(RPD) Rules.[2]\nDesignated Representative\n[3] The principal claimant, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX was appointed the designated representative of the minor claimant.\nALLEGATIONS\n[4] The facts and events alleged in support of the claim are set out in the claimants\u2019 Basis of Claim (BOC)[3] forms. To summarize, the principal claimant fears for his and his family\u2019s life by the hands of few corrupt police officers. The principal claimant started a XXXX in 2008, and four people came to the PC\u2019s business and asked for derecho de suelo (payment to carry on a business). The PC was injured by one of the police officers in 2011. In 2012, the PC moved to Pachuca, Hidalgo, while his family remained in Mexico City. For four years, nothing happened, and the PC returned to Mexico City in 2018 and restarted the business. The PC was again threatened. In 2018, the PC\u2019s wife and daughter was outside their home and some men attempted to kidnap the PC\u2019s daughter.\n[5] In XXXX 2019, the PC came to Canada. While in Canada, his wife and daughter saw people following them. The PC went back to Mexico and brought his entire family back on XXXX 2019. The claimants filed for refugee protection on February 5, 2020.\nDETERMINATION\n[6] Having considered the totality of evidence, I find that the claimant is a person in need of protection as he would be subjected personally to a risk to his life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or to a danger of torture should he return to Mexico under section 97(1) of the IRPA.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[7] The claimants\u2019 personal identities and Mexican nationality was established based on certified true copies of their Mexico-issued passports in Exhibit 1 and their testimony. I am satisfied, based on a balance of probabilities, that the claimants have established their identity.\nNexus\n[8] The PC ran a business and was targeted by corrupt police officer for extortion. The police officer demanded money for running the business. When the PC did not pay them, they targeted him and his family. The claimants were not targeted by reason of his race, nationality, political opinion, religion, or membership in a particular social group. I find, therefore, that there is no nexus to a Convention ground and that the claimant does not have a well-founded fear of persecution pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA. The claimant\u2019 s allegations are more properly assessed under subsection 97(1) of the IRPA.\nCredibility\n[9] I find that the claimants were credible. The principal claimant provided details of the harm that he and his family experienced in a credible and consistent manner. He provided direct answers to the questions asked, with additional and spontaneous details. He was not overly pensive about his answers, nor was evasive when questioned. Furthermore, his evidence was free of material omissions or inconsistencies, and his testimony was consistent with his narrative.\n[10] In presuming the claimants to be truthful, I find that there is no foundation to rebut that presumption and I accept all of the evidence of the claimant.\n[11] The principal claimant stated that his problem started in 2008 when he was to pay derecho de suelo, a payment to carry on a business by four unknown people. The principal claimant did not pay the money to carry on his legitimate business. At that time that the principal claimant did not know that the people who threaten them were actually police officers. However, he later learned that truth. The principal claimant answered in a detailed and a straightforward manner without any embellishment. Therefore, I find on a balance of probabilities that the problems that the PC alleges did actually happen.\n[12] In 2011, the PC was seriously injured by the police officer because he was not paying his dues to run the business. The PC was hit so hard that he lost one of his testicles due to the injury. The panel did not go into the detail of the injury as it was a sensitive and emotional topic. However, the claimant answered in detail about the circumstances that led to the police officers injuring the PC. The PC answered in a straightforward manner without any embellishment, and as such I find on balance of probabilities that he is a credible witness.\n[13] The PC was asked about the incident in 2018 and 2019 when his wife and daughter was threatened to be kidnapped. The PC described the incident in detail and they were in line with his narrative. Therefore, on a balance of probabilities, I find the PC\u2019s daughter and his wife were also threatened by the police officers for not paying the bribe money.\n[14] The claimants provided corroborating evidence such as daughter\u2019s school documents, supporting letter from friends and family, medical documents, psychiatric assessment, etc., in Exhibits 4 and 5. I give weight to these documents and they corroborate the claimants\u2019 testimonies.\nReavailment to Mexico\n[15] The PC came to Canada in 2019 by himself. I asked the PC that why did he go back if he was safe here in Canada. The PC stated that he thought that he was the problem and the police officers will not go after his family. However, while the PC was in Canada, there was an attempted kidnapping on the PC\u2019s daughter. The PC stated that he went back to discuss with his wife the next steps, whether to move or leave the country. They decided to leave the country. The panel, on a balance of probabilities, find the PC\u2019s response reasonable, and the panel is not making a negative inference regarding his reavailment. The PC was genuinely thought that his family would be safe without him, and once they were attacked his instinct was to go back and be with them.\nThe claimant faces a personalized risk, not faced generally by others\n[16] I find that the clamant has established, on a balance of probabilities, that he and his family faced the above incidents occurred as alleged. I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimants\u2019 faces a personalized risk that is different from the risk faced generally by other citizens of Mexico. I find that the claimant has established, on a balance of probabilities, that he faces a risk to life that is specific to him because of his reluctance to break the rules and pay the extortion money to the corrupt police officers. Accordingly, this claim is assessed under s. 97 of the Act.\nObjective Evidence\n[17] The evidence establishes, on a balance of probabilities, on objective basis for the claimant\u2019s risk to life if he was to return to Mexico. The reading of the NPD, along with the claimant\u2019s testimony shows that the corrupt police officers often collude with the cartel to extract money from the businesses.\n[18] The NDP item 2.1 reports:\nSignificant human rights issues included: reports of the involvement by police, military, and other government officials and illegal armed groups in unlawful or arbitrary killings and forced disappearance; torture by security forces; harsh and life-threatening prison conditions in some prisons; arbitrary arrest and lengthy pretrial detention; violence against journalists and human rights defenders; serious acts of corruption.\n[19] The NDP item 7.15 further states about how police help cartel to track people in Mexico.\nThe Assistant Professor stated that a large debt or a personal vendetta could motivate a gang to track someone outside their area, and that gangs can use \u201ccorrupt law enforcement agents\u201d to obtain information about people they pursue.\n[20] The NDP item 9.5 reports the following on corruption by the Police and Police in collusion with Carte in Mexico:\nWhile both Mexico and the international community have been aware of the gravity of this crisis for some time, little attention has been directed at how the acts of corruption described, in part, here-notably, bribery of public officials and law enforcement officers by organized crime and the collusion it fosters contribute to atrocity crimes.\n[21] The claimant has established an objective basis for his claim and his fears are objectively well-founded.\nState Protection\n[22] There is a presumption that a state is capable of protecting its citizens, except in situations where there is a complete breakdown. The PC was asked why he did not go to the police. The PC stated in a straightforward manner that the police officers told the PC that if he reported to the police, it would actually be reporting to one of them. The PC stated that the people who threatened and beaten him were police officers, and he did not want to take chances, and put his family\u2019s life at risk by reporting to the police officers.\n[23] The country documentation for Mexico indicates that, while Mexico does have laws in place which criminalizes official corruption, and even though, some corrupt police officers have been arrested, \u201cthe government did not enforce the law effectively.\u201d[4] State agents that commit crimes, including the police, continue to enjoy impunity.[5]\n[24] The NDP item 10.2 reports:\nSimilarly, an article by KPBS, a San Diego news service (KPBS n.d.), states that \u201c[t]he federal government has said infiltration by organized crime is a problem in many police forces in Sonora and around the country\u201d\nThe US Department of State\u2019s Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2019 observes that \u201c[t]here were credible reports of police involvement in kidnappings for ransom, and federal officials or members of the national defense forces were sometimes accused of perpetrating this crime.\u201d\n[25] Based on my review of the objective evidence, and also in consideration of the claimants\u2019 own particular circumstances and the profile of the agent of persecution, I find that the preponderance of the evidence is clear and convincing and rebuts the presumption of state protection in the claimants\u2019 particular circumstances. I therefore find, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimants have rebutted the presumption of state protection with clear and convincing evidence.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[26] I have also considered whether a viable Internal Flight Alternative (IFA) exists for the claimants in Mexico. The police officers have shown a continued interest in the PC and his family. The PC stated that if he moves with his family to another state, the police will have resources to locate him. The NDP item 14.2 corroborates claimants\u2019 claim and stated the following:\nAccording to the website of San Luis Potosf\u2019s Executive Secretariat of the State Council for Public Security (Secretariado Ejecutivo del Consejo Estatal de Seguridad P\u00fablica), Plataforma M\u00e9xico is a national network that houses forensic databases used by public security personnel, administered by the federal General Coordination of the Secretariat of Public Security (Coordinaci\u00f3n General de Secretar\u00eda de Seguridad Publica) (San Luis Potos\u00ed n.d.).\n[27] Having considered all the evidence, I find that there is a serious possibility of risk to life throughout Mexico for the claimants in their particular circumstances, including in the IFA locations. A viable IFA does not exist for the claimants in Mexico.\nCONCLUSION\n[28] Having considered the totality of evidence, I find that the claimants are persons in need of protection as they would be subjected personally to risk to their life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or to danger of torture should they return to Mexico under section 97(1) of the IRPA.\n[29] Their claims are, therefore, accepted.\n(signed) Rupert Nirman\nNovember 25, 2021\n[1] Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c.27, sections 96, 97(1)(a) and 97(1)(b).\n[2] Refugee Protection Division Rules (SOR\/2012-256), Rule 55.\n[3] Exhibit 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3.\n[4] Item 2.1\n[5] Ibid., at item 7.18.\n",

I have found that you are a Convention refugee on the basis of your religion, as a Shia Muslim who is persecuted because of your religion in Pakistan. And here are, the following are my reasons.\n[2] So, this is the claim made by XXXX XXXX, file number TC0-01196. You\u2019ve established both your personal identity and your citizenship as a citizen of Pakistan through your documents and in particular, the certified true copy of your passport. The allegations that you made were set out fully in your Basis of Claim form at Exhibit 2. As well as the amendments you made to that form at Exhibit 4.\n[3] You allege that you are a Shia Muslim. You had some success, financial success as an XXXX when you worked in the U.A.E. where you worked for many years. And even though you were unable to openly practice your Shia faith in the U.A.E., you remained dedicated to your Shia faith and your community. And you made large donations to your Imam Bargah for its expansion back in Pakistan. You gathered donations from other members of the Shia community in the U.A.E. and with those, you were able to again make further large donations in 2018.\n[4] This resulted in some suspicion by the Government of the U.A.E. And you were questioned by the U.A.E. Intelligence about your Shia activities and you were ordered to leave the U.A.E. in July of 2019. And that you and your family did leave in, XXXX of 2019.\n[5] So, I find that although you lived in the U.A.E. for many years, your residency there was temporary. And you didn\u2019t have a status in the U.A.E. that was substantially similar to that of its nationals. So, I therefore find that the circumstances of your claim do not engage any exclusions under Article 1-E of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[6] So, according to your allegations and the testimony you gave today, you moved to Pakistan in XXXX of 2019. You became very engaged in your Shia community. And you were appointed as the XXXX XXXX of the Imam Bargah. You became very popular with the religious leaders and with members of your community. And you became very well known throughout your community.\n[7] This attracted the attention of the Sunni extremists and in particular, members of the Lashkar-e-Jhangvi who threatened you to the point where you feared for your life. And you left Pakistan in XXXX of 2019. You feel you can\u2019t return to Pakistan with your profile as a prominent Shia who is very active in your community. And that because of this prominence and the interconnectedness of members of the LeJ and other Sunni extremist groups, you wouldn\u2019t be safe anywhere in Pakistan. You would not be provided adequate state protection.\n[8] I found that you were a very credible witness. I didn\u2019t find any inconsistencies between your testimony and what you have in your Basis of Claim form and the documents you filed. It did demonstrate that you worked in the U.A.E. as an XXXX for many years. And that you were able to provide XXXX XXXX to your Imam Bargah in the form of very substantial donations on your own. And then very substantial donations over a period of time through the donations you collected through other members of the Shia community in the U.A.E.\n[9] You sent that money to Imam Bargah in Sialkot (ph) which is a city in the Punjab Province. And you helped to maintain the Imam Bargah to expand it and to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Of Imam Bargah. A great deal was done by your donations to assist this Imam Bargah.\n[10] After you returned to Sialkot, you were assigned the role of the XXXX XXXX XXXX of your Imam Bargah which involved XXXX XXXX and in these events you explained that it was a bit unique the type of Majaliss and organizing that you did. ln that you had both Sunni and Shia speakers who came together that you explained to speak about the common believes of the Sunni and Shia. And to attempt to moderate the differences between these two (2) Muslim sects in Pakistan.\n[11] You wanted to work towards the education of the people. And to try to debunk some of the misconceptions that the Sunnis have about Shia. You testified how important it was to you to do this because in the 80s and 90s, you didn\u2019t have so many difficulties being a Shia and being a minority in Pakistan. You explained that through all this work that you did, you became very well known. And a prominent member of your Shia community. You were out in your community often, talking to the members. And you became a face that was recognizable.\n[12] So, as a result of all of this involvement, you were targeted by the anti-Shia extremist group the Lashkar-e\u00ad Jhangvi or the LeJ. On one (1) evening after the Majaliss on September 10th, 2019 your car was stopped by armed men. You were beaten and assaulted by these men who told you that they had received from reports from their supporters, from the people who support and who believe in them, about your work. And the work that you were doing in the area. And they were accusing you of influencing impressionable Sunni. And trying to convert the Sunni to be Shia. And they called you a Kafir, and that you were spreading the Shia Kafir.\n[13] So, after this happened and you were hospitalized, your family and the leaders of the Imam Bargah suggested that you should be leaving Sialkot. And so, you and your family moved to an area of Rawalpindi. But the same day, you said around 4 o\u2019 clock on September 11th, you received a call from a group identifying themselves again as the LeJ. They called you a Kafir and said you were on their hit list and they would shoot you the next time they saw you in Pakistan.\n[14] You reported this call to the police. And the police said you should take your own precautions, provide your own safety because they couldn\u2019t do anything to assist you as they didn\u2019t have enough information about the men who attacked you. In order to try to have some safety, you turned off your phones. And you tried to keep yourself hidden while you were in Rawalpindi.\n[15] On the same day, September 11th, 2019 your parents told you that some armed men attended at their home. They did some damage to their home. They explained they were trying to find you to make an example of you. And that they would, to tell you, warn you, that they would find you. And if they did, they would kill you. Your brother reported this incident to the police. And they told him to tell you, you should just leave Pakistan as it appeared that the LeJ were intent on finding you and that they would kill you.\n[16] So, you left for Canada in the next few days. Your family has reported that neighbours have told them that from time to time these same extremists have come around your neighbourhood in Sialkot asking for you. And that as recently as April 4th 2021 some people came around asking about you. Said they still planned to kill you if you returned to Pakistan.\n[17] So, all of your supporting documents which are at Exhibits 5 and 6 corroborate your allegations. You disclosed letters from your Imam Bargah which corroborated the work that you did. The donations you made. And the persecution you experienced. You also submitted police reports, FIRs, and hospital reports which corroborated your testimony. You have many affidavits from several individuals who confirmed your involvement with the Shia community in Pakistan. As well as the threat and harms that you experienced by the LeJ. The affidavits from your brother confirm that members of the LeJ continue to ask about you and continue to threaten you. So, your documents do demonstrate as well that you continue to practice your Shia faith in Canada. Given the COVID restrictions, it\u2019s not how you would ordinarily practice, but you are a member of the Shia community.\n[18] So, I find on a balance of probabilities that these documents corroborate your testimony and support your allegations. That you were targeted in Pakistan by the LeJ due to your profile as an established Shia, prominent in your community. You\u2019ve established a very credible evidentiary basis for your subjective fears of returning to Pakistan.\n[19] And based on your credibility and your allegations, that you became a target of the anti-Shia extremist group, the LeJ, and that this continues. And also, your evidence is corroborated and supported by the documentary evidence that we have in our National Documentation Packages. They demonstrate that you have a well-founded fear of this persecution. That there is a serious possibility that you would be persecuted by the LeJ if you were to return to Pakistan.\n[20] The evidence in the NDP demonstrates there have been increased killings of Shia by militant groups. Targeted killings of Shia professionals and officials and those who are prominent members of the community. It also establishes the risk that you would face, especially at exhibits throughout the National Documentation Package. Such as at Item 1.8 that reports that militant groups are responsible for most of the attacks against Shia. And that groups such as the LeJ have continued to be growing and they are a growing threat. There are reports about targeting killings of professionals, Shia professionals and officials. And those who have a profile such as yours, to be prominent. Persons such as engineers who are perceived to be a financial influence. And could be influential throughout the Shia community.\n[21] Item 12.5 indicates that Shia have traditionally represented a higher proportion of the casualties of the sectarian violence throughout Pakistan. And in particular, by anti-Shia militant groups. Even though the Shia community is a very large community in Pakistan and not all Shias from Pakistan have a well-founded fear of persecution, the NDP does support your claim that due to your prominence and being someone who is now targeted, you would continue to likely be more, there\u2019s a very high reason to anticipate that you would be targeted if you returned to Pakistan. So, I find that this objective evidence demonstrates on a balance of probabilities that you\u2019ve established a well-founded fear of persecution should you return to Pakistan.\n[22] You\u2019ve rebutted your presumption of state protection. You indicated that even though you registered the incident that happened with the first information report, you were told that the police would not be naming the LeJ even though they had clearly identified themselves to you. When you made further complaints about the threats at your parents\u2019 home and the phone calls that you received, you were just told by the police to take your own precautions. That they couldn\u2019t help you. And that perhaps in the end they suggested you should leave the country as it appeared that this group was motivated to kill you. And that they couldn\u2019t provide you with the safety you needed.\n[23] This is also supported in the objective documentary evidence we have in the National Documentation Package. Which demonstrates that the government has been criticized for failing to protect the Shia community from their attackers. And for allowing militant organizations to operate with impunity. They failed to investigate or punish those that are responsible for violent attacks against Shias in Pakistan.\n[24] As well, Item 7.12 states that if someone has been asking for some protection from extremist organizations, the police are not effective. They cannot provide security. And courts are not effective. And often, as you indicated, these groups seem to be able to get their members released from courts due to what is often called lack of evidence. So, I find that both your testimony and the evidence, that there\u2019s a preponderance of evidence to demonstrate that you have clear and convincingly demonstrated that the state is unable and unwilling to provide you with adequate state protection.\n[25] At the beginning, l suggested that you may have an internal flight alternative within the city of Lahore. But I accept your testimony about the influence and the interconnectedness of these extremist groups. As well as their connections within the police and other government organizations. They have a presence throughout and are connected throughout Pakistan.\n[26] Item 1.8 of the National Documentation Package indicates that armed militant groups such as the LeJ have wide geographic reach. Item 3.18 confirms what you were testifying about, the need to register any rental agreement you have with the police. As well as any kind of various interactions you would have with government officials. Just in doing your daily business.\n[27] And Items 7.9 and 7.10 discuss how the police and government in Pakistan work together with these extremist organizations. They continue, the LeJ continue to make threats even though you moved from your original location in Sialkot. And they also have demonstrated that they are continuing, have a continuing interest in finding you. And have indicated that if they were to find you, they would kill you.\n[28] They\u2019ve therefore demonstrated their motivation to continue to locate you. Regardless of where you would be in Pakistan. You\u2019ve indicated that even if you were to move to Lahore, you may only be protected for a short time. Because due to the importance of practicing your faith, being part of Imam Bargah and being a part of your community, you would eventually be located.\n[29] There\u2019s a serious possibility that those within Lahore who support a group such as the LeJ would be able to inform them where you are. l find that it is unreasonable to expect you to restrict your religious practice or restrict any of your freedom because you fear this group.\n[30] So that, l therefore find that on a balance of probabilities, your life would be at risk throughout Pakistan. You have no internal flight alternative that is viable for you, including Lahore. You also would have no state protection.\n[31] So, therefore based on all of my analysis, all of your testimony, the evidence that we have, I conclude that you are a Convention refugee. And I accept your claim.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

Green\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Matthew Moyal\nCountry: Iran\nRPD Number: TB9-28949\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2022-01778\nATIP Pages: N\/A\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: I have considered the evidence before me and I am now ready to render a decision orally. The claimant XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX seeks refugee protection pursuant to Sections 96 and 97.1 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[2] The allegations on which the claimant relies can be found in his Basis of Claim form, Exhibit 2. I will not repeat all of the allegations here however the claimant is a 21-year-old man who was born in Iran on XXXX XXXX 2000. During his third year of high school the claimant met a girl of the Baha\u2019i faith with whom he became friends. The claimant later learned that this girl had problems within her family, specifically her mother was deceased and her father was in prison and that she faced eviction because of her Baha\u2019i faith. The claimant spoke to their local (inaudible) trying to find a resolution however he was accused of being impure and told that his relationship with this individual would cause problems for him.\n[3] The claimant subsequently spoke to his father who gave him permission for the girl to move into the family\u2019s home in the basement or cellar. This caused immense problems for the claimant and his father. Amongst those problems his father was taken and arrested in 2018. The claimant was also taken and interrogated on more than one occasion. Both the claimant and his father received bail however they continued to have problems.\n[4] On XXXX XXXX 2018, the claimant traveled to Canada for studies but his family continued to have problems in Iran. After returning to Iran to support his father during his court case, the claimant was again taken by the intelligence service. He was interrogated and physically assaulted. He was asked about his time in Canada, his association with Baha\u2019i and accused of spying. The claimant like his father was subsequently charged by the authorities with supporting and collaborating with the Baha\u2019i cult with a view to promoting non-Islamic religion in the Islamic republic of Iran.\n[5] The claimant subsequently fled to Canada again on XXXX XXXX 2019 and since his return to Canada he has received a 20-year sentence in (inaudible). His father\u2019s case is ongoing due to delays in that court case.\n[6] On the basis of your imputed political opinion I find that you face a serious possibility of persecution for a Convention ground pursuant to Section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. In terms of your identity I find that you are a national of Iran. This is established by your sworn testimony and the identity documents on file, in particular your passport.\n[7] I found the claimant to be a credible witness. His claim is well supported by numerous documents including the bail documents for him and his father, the summons for him and his father, the court order that he received with the 20-year sentence, and the letter from the lawyer who represented the claimant and his father in Iran. I have no reason to doubt the genuineness or trustworthiness of these documents. I find that the claimant has a subjective fear. He returned to Canada immediately after realizing that his life was at risk in Iran.\n[8] In terms of the objective basis for the claimant\u2019s fear, item 2.1 of the National Documentation Package for Iran, Exhibit 3, indicates that the governments human rights record remained extremely poor and worsened in several key areas. There were reports of forced confessions often extracted through torture. There were significant human rights abuses otherwise. The government often charged citizens with vague crimes such as anti-revolutionary behaviour, corruption on earth, waging war against God and crimes against Islam. The law in Iran provides for prosecution of persons accused of instigating crimes against the state or national security or insulting Islam, and that is the situation in which the claimant found himself.\n[9] In terms of the situation of Baha\u2019i, this is also well documented.\n[10] Item 2.1 indicates that such individuals were charged with spreading propaganda against the regime through the Baha\u2019i faith. Persons of Baha\u2019i origin face discrimination and persecution in that country. The Baha\u2019i faith is not a recognized religion. The authorities believe that it contradicted the tenets of Islam and this explains the problem which the people of the Baha\u2019i faith continue to face in that country.\n[11] Taken together I find that the claimant\u2019s allegations that were put forth are objectively supported and I find that he does in fact face a serious possibility of persecution should he return to that country. In terms of whether he would have adequate state protection, given that the agent of persecution is the state, I find that adequate state protection would not be reasonably forthcoming. Therefore the claimant has rebutted the presumption of state protection.\n[12] In terms of whether or not he would have a viable Internal Flight Alternative, item 1.7 of Exhibit 3 indicates that there is nationwide capacity of the centrally organized state security services which would make it difficult or unlikely for someone facing official attention to internally locate. So I find that you do not have a viable Internal Flight Alternative.\n[13] In conclusion then I find that you will face as I state, a serious possibility of persecution in Iran for which you do not have adequate state protection or a viable Internal Flight Alternative. I therefore declare you to be a Convention refugee and accept your claim.\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

Gilbert\nCountry: Slovakia\nRPD Number: TB9-27381\nAssociated RPD Number(s): TB9-27444\nATIP Number: A-2022-01778\nATIP Pages: N\/A\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] The claimants, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, are seeking refugee protection from Slovakia pursuant to ss. 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (\u201cIRPA\u201d).[1]\n[2] The principal claimant, XXXX XXXX, is the mother of XXXX XXXX, the minor claimant. The principal claimant was appointed to be the designated representative of the minor claimant.\nDETERMINATION\n[3] The panel finds the claimants to be Convention refugees on the grounds of their ethnicity, being members of the Roma community.\nALLEGATIONS\n[4] The details of the claimants\u2019 allegations are more fully set out in the principal claimant\u2019s Basis of Claim form (\u201cBOC\u201d).[2] In short, the claimants are of Roma ethnicity and have faced discrimination in relation to their education, employment, housing and health care. The claimants were assaulted on one occasion by skinheads and were unable to obtain police assistance.\n[5] The claimants fear returning to Slovakia because they believe they will continue to be persecuted and discriminated against due to their Roma ethnicity.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[6] The claimants\u2019 personal identities as citizens of Slovakia have been established by the claimants\u2019 testimony and the certified true copies of their Slovakian passports on file.[3]\n[7] The claimants\u2019 ethnicity as members of the Roma community has been established by the claimants\u2019 testimony, a letter from the Roma Community Centre in Toronto dated October 15, 2020,[4] and the claimants\u2019 use of an interpreter of the Romani dialect, Romungro, for their BOCs.\n[8] The panel finds on a balance of probabilities that the claimants are who they say they are, that they are of Roma ethnicity and that the country of reference is Slovakia.\nCredibility\n[9] The determinative issue in this claim is credibility. In making this assessment, the panel has considered all the evidence, including the oral testimony, documentary evidence entered as exhibits, and counsel\u2019s written submissions.\n[10] Both claimants testified and the panel found them to mostly be credible witnesses. The claimants\u2019 testimony was consistent with one another, for the most part consistent with the BOCs and with the documentary evidence. The claimants responded to all questions put to them by the panel, were able to provide details when asked and were forthcoming with information.\n[11] Unlike in other claims from members of the Roma community, these claimants did not raise any issues about the quality of their housing. The claimants resided in a mixed ethnic neighbourhood in the city of Poprad. However, the claimants did express a sense of insecurity in their housing situation. They were harassed by a racist neighbour and their home was vandalized with racist graffiti. The principal claimant reported to her XXXX how she feared letting her sons go outside owing to the danger to them from non-Roma members of the community and to feeling stressed if they did not return from school right away.\n[12] The principal claimant testified about the racist names she would be called and the way she would be mistreated in public spaces. The principal claimant described an incident that had occurred to her, her husband, and the associate claimant when they were disembarking from a bus in Poprad in May 2019. The family were physically attacked by a group of skinheads and verbally assaulted. The principal claimant\u2019s description of this incident was consistent with her BOC and in response to questioning from the panel, she was able to spontaneously provide additional details.\n[13] The principal claimant provided detailed testimony of her unsuccessful job search efforts and discriminatory experiences with potential employers and provided specific examples, as requested by the panel. The principal claimant was unable to secure any employment while she resided in Slovakia and depended upon welfare benefits and her husband\u2019s income from seasonal work.\n[14] The principal claimant did not attempt to embellish her evidence in relation to her treatment in the health care system. Although she described a discriminatory birthing experience and delays in being able to see doctors, the principal claimant was forthright in admitting that she received good care from the neurologist who was treating her for chronic back problems.\n[15] The associate claimant testified about his school experiences in Slovakia, including the substandard education he received and limited opportunities to advance due to his Roma ethnicity. The associate claimant is now seventeen years old and continues to attend school in Toronto. The associate claimant convincingly explained how he had seen his older brother attacked and was scared for his own life, especially now that he was older and a more likely target for skinheads in Slovakia.\n[16] The principal claimant\u2019s eldest son fled to Canada in XXXX 2017 and made a successful refugee claim on the basis of his ethnicity as a member of the Roma community. He had been attacked at school and in the community on three occasions and although he attempted to obtain assistance from the police, he was unable to. This is corroborated by a copy of the decision submitted by the claimants.[5] The principal claimant\u2019s eldest son was in a motor vehicle accident in Toronto on XXXX 2018 and was seriously injured, resulting in his anticipated hospitalization in a near vegetative state for the remainder of his life. This is also corroborated by a letter from the Toronto Rehabilitation Institute submitted by the claimants.[6]\n[17] The panel was concerned that the claimants had both returned to Slovakia from Canada and had not made a claim for refugee protection during one of their previous stays in Canada. The claimants first travelled to Canada together in XXXX 2018 in order to tend to their son and brother in the immediate aftermath of his accident. The principal claimant returned to Slovakia in XXXX 2019 and the associate claimant made two subsequent trips between Canada and Slovakia before he returned for the last time in XXXX 2019 with the principal claimant.\n[18] The principal claimant was questioned about her return to Slovakia. She explained that she needed psychiatric assistance that she was unable to obtain while she was in Canada and she knew that she would be legally allowed to return to Canada to visit her son as she had an Electronic Travel Authorization that enabled her to do so. The principal claimant testified that she did not make a claim for protection while she was in Canada the first time as she was focused on her son\u2019s care. Further, the principal claimant had received advice from the community that her claim might not be successful as she herself had not experienced any violence in Slovakia and she did not want to run the risk of being unable to return to Canada in the future.\n[19] The claimants submitted a XXXX XXXX of the principal claimant dated August 19, 2020, completed by a doctor at XXXX in Toronto.[7] The report indicates that the principal claimant was seen by the psychiatrist three times, starting on May 28th. The report indicates that the principal claimant\u2019s mental health deteriorated following her son\u2019s accident and in the immediate months following, she was experiencing suicidal ideation, and in an acute anxiety state when not with her son. The principal claimant has been diagnosed with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX for which she has been prescribed medication. The claimants also submitted medical documentation from Slovakia indicating that the principal claimant saw a psychiatrist there in April and May 2019.[8]\n[20] The claimants submitted an affidavit from the associate claimant\u2019s father (and the principal claimant\u2019s husband) who described his decision-making authority and rationale in relation to his son\u2019s travels to and from Canada and his concerns about his education.[9] Basically, he did not want his son to miss school and attract the attention of child protection authorities. The claimants also submitted travel documents indicating that the associate claimant\u2019s travels, aside from his initial short visit to see his brother immediately following the accident, coincided with school holidays.[10]\n[21] The panel finds that in consideration of the claimants\u2019 circumstances, the minor claimant\u2019s young age and dependence on his parents, and the principal claimant\u2019s XXXX state, the claimants\u2019 returns to Slovakia and failure to claim in Canada are reasonably explained.\n[22] The principal claimant\u2019s eldest brother fled to Canada in XXXX 2012 and made a successful refugee claim on the basis of his ethnicity as a member of the Roma community and sexual orientation. This is corroborated by a copy of the decision and BOC submitted to the board.[11] These documents indicate that while in Slovakia, he was mostly resident in Poprad and was the victim of several physical attacks at school and in the community due to his ethnicity and that although he sought police assistance, he was in turn victimized by the police. The principal claimant testified that her family members\u2019 experiences in Slovakia have contributed to her fears and belief that protection is not available to her in Slovakia.\n[23] The panel finds that the claimants have established on a balance of probabilities that they suffered from discrimination in their education, housing, employment and health care, that they were subject to a general atmosphere of insecurity and that they were violently assaulted due to their ethnicity in Slovakia on one occasion. The panel finds further that these cumulative experiences amounted to persecution and that there is a serious possibility that the claimants would suffer from discrimination amounting to persecution if they were to return to Slovakia.\n[24] Given the credible testimony by the claimants and the corroborating documentary evidence, the panel believes what the claimants have alleged in support of their claims and finds that their subjective fear of persecution on the basis of their Roma ethnicity is established, on a balance of probabilities.\nObjective Basis: Slovakia\n[25] A review of the National Documentation Package for Slovakia indicates that members of the Roma community in Slovakia suffer social and economic exclusion and discrimination in almost all fields of life, including employment, education, health care, housing, loan practices, restaurants, hair salons, religious services and public transportation. The segregation of Romani children in schools, frequent misdiagnosis of Romani children as disabled, and inferior quality of education provided to Romani children continues despite policies and laws aimed to eradicate the inequality in the education system.[12]\n[26] Multiple sources indicate that the Roma population faces significant poverty and poor health outcomes. Recent government reports reveal that the life expectancy for Roma individuals is seven years below the general population. Roma settlements are described as suffering from a lack of basic facilities and infrastructure. Almost half of Roma households live in dwellings without a toilet, shower and bathroom and half live in neighbourhoods without a public sewage system. Many houses are built illegally, and Roma families face forced evictions.[13]\n[27] It is estimated that 70% of Roma job seekers from marginalized communities are unemployed. Additionally, the average wage for Roma individuals is 40% lower than non-Roma individuals and the employment situation is characterized by high job uncertainty and instability. The at-risk-of-poverty rate of Roma people in Slovakia is 87% compared to 13% in the general population.[14]\n[28] Based on the country condition evidence, the panel finds the claimants\u2019 fear of return to Slovakia to have an objective basis. The claimants have established a well-founded fear of persecution in Slovakia.\nState protection and internal flight alternative\n[29] States are presumed to be capable of protecting their own citizens, except in situations where the state is in a state of complete breakdown. To rebut the presumption of state protection, a claimant has to provide clear and convincing evidence of the state\u2019s inability or unwillingness to protect its citizens. The more democratic the state\u2019s institutions, the more the claimant must have done to exhaust all the courses of action open to him or her.\n[30] In Slovakia, there are numerous instances of high-level politicians and public officials making derogatory comments and hate speech about the Roma community creating an environment of state sanctioned mistreatment of the Roma population.[15]\n[31] The United States Department of State Report on Human Rights Practises for 2020 in Slovakia indicates that violence and threats of violence against Roma and other ethnic and racial minorities, including by security forces, is a significant human rights issue.[16] Another source documents numerous instances of the police attacking Roma settlements in the past ten years in Slovakia with apparent impunity.[17]\n[32] The claimants attempted to obtain state protection through the police following the attack on them in May 2019. Despite having the ability to investigate the attack further as there were bystanders and cameras in the vicinity, the police did not pursue the matter further and when the claimants followed up, the police denied ever having received a report from the claimants.\n[33] The panel finds that in this case, there is no state protection or viable internal flight alternative available to the claimants. The country information and the claimants\u2019 own experiences are clear and convincing evidence that rebuts the presumption that adequate state protection is available to the claimants in Slovakia. Additionally, there is a serious possibility of the persecution throughout the country as the climate of racism and targeting of members of the Roma community exists throughout Slovakia.\nCONCLUSION\n[34] Based on the totality of the evidence, the panel finds the claimants to be Convention Refugees and therefore their claims are accepted.\n(signed) L.

        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2021 RLLR 76\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: December 21, 2021\nPanel: Lesley Stalker\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Daniel Etoh\nCountry: Nigeria\nRPD Number: VC1-06497\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2022-01594\nATIP Pages: N\/A\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: This is a Bench decision in the refugee claim of XXXX XXXX XXXX. Ms. XXXX is a citizen of Nigeria. When she initially filed her claim, she also filed a claim on behalf of her son. I am going to switch from third person to first person. Your son, XXXX XXXX XXXX was born in the US and as a citizen of that country. Both you and your son were seeking refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. At the outset of the hearing, your Counsel advised that you would not be advancing any allegations of persecution or harm on behalf of your son against the US and that you would therefore be withdrawing your claim on behalf of your son. And so, the hearing focussed just on the risk that you would face in Nigeria.\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] You set out your allegations in your Basis of Claim form and in the updated narrative, which the Board received on December 10, 2021. In effect, you say that you were at risk on two (2) counts. The first was at the hands of your former mother-in-law, XXXX. You say that XXXX seeks to kill you and to take your son away from you, and that her anger stems from the fact that you had a relationship with her husband and with her son. You also say that you are at risk of persecution in Nigeria because you are a bisexual woman.\nDETERMINATION\n[3] I find that you are a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the Act because you are a bisexual woman.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[4] The first question is whether I am satisfied that you are who you say you are and I am. I find that you have established your identity through your testimony and your Nigerian passport, a certified true copy of which is on file.\nNexus\n[5] The next question is whether your claim has a nexus or a Convention to any of the grounds, which are set out in the refugee Convention. These grounds include political opinion, religion, race, nationality, and particular social group. And I find that your fear of harm as a bisexual woman has a nexus to the Convention ground of particular social group. I therefore assessed that element of your claim under section 96 of the Act. Your fear of harm at the hands of your former mother-in-law does not have a nexus to any of the grounds in the refugee Convention. Rather, her actions are more in the nature of a personal vendetta against you, and I find that that aspect of your claim should be assessed under section 97 of the Act.\nCredibility\n[6] When assessing your credibility, I start from the Maldonado principle. This principle says that sworn testimony is presumed to be true unless there is good reason to doubt its truthfulness or its reliability. Overall, I found you were a credible witness. Your testimony accorded with the information in your Basis of Claim form and the revised narrative. You were born into a Muslim family in Nigeria. In your narrative, you describe a lengthy history of sexual and domestic violence dating back to childhood. You say the traumatic and unhappy childhood led you to become sexually active at a very young age. You entered a series of casual relationships sometimes with older men. One of these older men was known to you as the Colonel. While you were in a sexual relationship with the Colonel, you met XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, a man who was closer in age to you.\n[7] In time, you came to know that XXXX was, in fact, the son of the Colonel. XXXX mother, XXXX, was incensed by you having a relationship with her husband and with her son. She threatened you and said that she would kill you if you had any kind of relationship with either of the men in her family. You took her threats seriously as she was politically very well connected and appears to have been wealthy. Her political connections relate to her being the daughter of the former Nigerian President, Obasanjo. In 2013, you and XXXX married in secret. He then left the country. This meant that you were quite vulnerable and you were run over by a motorcycle shortly after XXXX cautioned you that he had received a word that his mother was determined to harm you and that his mother had found out about the secret marriage. Your uncle was shot for no apparent reason while standing next to you.\n[8] You fled to Dubai to get away from the risks posed by XXXX. In Dubai, you entered a relationship with a woman, XXXX, and with a man. Your husband found out about the relationship with the man and threatened to break off the marriage. To make a long story short, you persuaded XXXX to give you another chance. The two (2) of you went off to the United States on visitor\u2019s visas. Shortly after arriving in the US, you learned you were pregnant. XXXX was angry. He refused to believe that the child was his and he walked away from the marriage. You gave birth in the US. You were unable to work there because you did not have status. You were living a very precarious lifestyle. After an unhappy and abusive marriage, you decided to try and regularise your status. You came to Canada and claimed refugee status here.\n[9] So far, this story has focussed on your relationships with men. But in your narrative, you referred to sexual relationships with women dating back to your senior year of high school. Those were less relationships than sexual exploration, but you described the intimacy with female classmates in your senior year of school. You testified that XXXX, the friend and partner in Dubai, was your first real female lover and you said that relationship lasted approximately eight (8) months. You spoke movingly about your current partner, XXXX, with whom you have been living for close to two (2) years. You described how you met XXXX and the evolution of your relationship from a casual acquaintance to flat mates and then lovers. You said that your son, XXXX, who is now six (6) loves XXXX dearly and that the daycare treats her as XXXX second mom.\n[10] You corroborated your account with many documents. Some of the documents were very difficult to read due to the poor quality of the image, but I was able to read them and to glean the most important information. The documents include the following. One (1), affidavit of your mother. Your mother confirms that you and she had a difficult relationship for many years. She corroborates many elements of your narrative including the fact that you tried to tell her that you were being sexually abused by a relative when you were a child, your secret marriage to XXXX, your former mother-in-law\u2019s anger towards you, your former mother-in-law\u2019s attacks on you and on your maternal uncle, and your former mother-in-law\u2019s demands and threats that you handover your son.\n[11] Your father\u2026two (2), your father, your sister and your brother also filed affidavits. Each of these affidavits confirms many aspects of your narrative. In particular, your father describes an incident relatively recently in which your former mother-in-law sent thugs to his home demanding that you surrender your son to her. Three (3), your maternal uncle filed an affidavit confirming that he was shot while standing beside you. He says that, when the police were asked to investigate, the police arrested him on false charges of robbery and he attributes this, both the shooting and the police refusal to investigate to XXXX influence in Nigeria. You filed an affidavit from XXXX, the woman whom you say was your female lover in Dubai and finally, six (6), you filed an affidavit from XXXX, your current partner in Canada.\n[12] You filed a number of other documents, which corroborate your account, but I don\u2019t feel it\u2019s necessary to review them in detail here. I have no reason to doubt the truthfulness of any of these documents, which are detailed and speak frankly about some of the difficulties that you and they have had over the years. I noted that none of the affidavits from your family refer to your relations with women. I asked you about that and you said that they do not know you were bi. You explained that, in Nigeria generally and in the Muslim community in particular, same-sex relationships are unthinkable. In the Muslim community, they are haram or taboo. You said it would be impossible to tell your family about this, at least at this stage of your life. You hoped to tell your parents about your relationship someday, but are not yet at a stage where you can do so comfortably. You said that one (1) sister in the UK knows that you were bi. The other sister is a devout Muslim and you cannot bring yourself to tell her of your\u2026about your sexual identity.\n[13] In addition to these written documents, your partner, XXXX, testified about your relationship. XXXX spoke comfortably and easily about your relationship and the role you play in her life. I asked her whether her family in Nigeria knows about her relationship with you and she said she cannot tell them due to the enormous stigma and shame attached to any kind of same-sex activity. In view of your credible testimony, the many corroborative documents that you have filed and the credible testimony of your current partner, I accept the allegations that you have set out in your BOC and your revised narrative. More specifically for the purpose of this claim, I am satisfied that you are a bisexual woman who has had relationships with women as well as men since your teenage years.\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution\n[14] In the next section, I focus on the risk that you would face in Nigeria as a bisexual woman. The first question I must consider is whether you have established a subjective fear and harm in Nigeria if people learn that you are bisexual. I find that you have. You said\u2026you described witnessing two (2) men who were outed in effect in Nigeria. You were a child at that time. You said the men were dragged naked from the home where they had presumably been engaged in same-sex relation. They were beaten by the mob. You said that you did not see the outcome. Your mother forced you inside. You said that, in Nigeria, it\u2019s not uncommon for such mob incidents to result in burning or killing of the victims of the violence and your mother did not want you to see that. You stated that you would face not only persecution, but prosecution in Nigeria, that you could be arrested and sentenced to 14 years imprisonment and that in parts of the country, in particular the north, which is subject to Sharia law, you could be sentenced to death.\n[15] I considered whether the fact that you failed to claim refugee status in the US detracts from your subjective fear of persecution. You said that you had been in the US for a number of years, but did not know that you could claim refugee protection. A Sudanese man told you about that possibility and gave you the contact information of a clinic. But when you sought advice from the clinic, you were told that the deadline for filing the claim had passed. And in the circumstances, I find that your failure to claim asylum in the US does not detract from your subjective fear of harm. So, in short, I find that you have established a subjective fear of persecution in Nigeria.\n[16] The next question I must consider is whether your fear is well-founded and I find that it is. Same-sex sexual activity is a criminal offence in Nigeria. The country reports in the Immigration and Refugee Board\u2019s National Documentation Package on Nigeria says that Nigeria\u2019s federal criminal laws prescribed up to 14 years in prison for same-sex sexual activities. And these reports also note that persons convicted of same-sex activity in states, which are governed by Sharia law may be sentenced to death by stoning. The 2019 report of the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association, IGLHRC, found at item 6.2 of the NDP says that Nigeria is one (1) of the most homophobic countries in the world. This reflects both the severity and comprehensiveness of Nigerian legislation that criminalises same-sex relationship, but also reflects the discriminatory and violent treatment meted out to LGBTI persons who are subject to arbitrary arrest, blackmail, physical and psychological abuse by the police, kidnappings, extortion, harassment, sexual attack, subjection to conversion therapies, pressure to marry, and involuntary outing by family and society alike.\n[17] The Response to Information Request at tab 6.7 of the NDP describes how bisexuality is perceived in Nigeria. The RIR quotes the executive directive of the Women\u2019s Health and Equal Rights Initiative where the executive director states that any sexual orientation that has not had heterosexual is considered unnatural, demonic and immoral in Nigeria. Bisexuality is usually conflated with homosexuality or lesbianism by heterosexual communities, and bisexuals who are discovered engaging in same-sex activity may be lynched, beaten, arrested, ostracised and disowned by family and community. A person who was outed for engaging in same-sex sexual behaviour will be seriously ostracised by their family, harshly excommunicated and threatened.\n[18] I also note that the country reports indicate that the situation for lesbian or bisexual women is particularly dire. The RIR referred to above refers to a passage or a report by IGLHRC. The report says that lesbian and bisexual women experience subtle and explicit pressures that all women in Nigeria face. These pressures include marriage, child rearing, sexual harassment, threats of rape, assault and a lack of legal support. And so, as a bisexual woman who has already experienced gender-based violence and discrimination, I find that you face a double risk. As stated by the RIR report, bisexual women face overlapping and intersecting spheres of discrimination in Nigeria. Nigeria is described as a patriarchal and sexist country in which women are disproportionately affected by gender-based violence, sexism and patriarchy.\n[19] Having considered your testimony and the objective country reports, I find that you have established a well-founded fear of persecution.\nState Protection and IFA\n[20] The next question is, whether you can seek protection from the state? In the event that you face persecution on the basis of your sexual orientation, I find that you cannot. Indeed, the state is one of the actors or agents of harm. As noted above, same-sex sexual behaviour is criminalised in Nigeria and the police harass and extort members of the LGBTQ community. I therefore find that there would be no state protection available to you. And in terms of whether you can avoid persecution as a bisexual by relocating to another part of Nigeria, the country reports confirm that the laws which criminalise same-sex sexual activity apply throughout the country as do the homophobic attitudes that have been described above. I therefore find that you would not have a viable internal flight alternative too. Having found that you have a well-founded fear of persecution on the basis of your sexual orientation, I have not considered whether you would also require protection from your former mother-in-law.\nCONCLUSION\n[21] Having considered the totality of the evidence, I find that you are a Convention refugee because of your membership in a particular social group, namely your identity as a bisexual woman. I therefore accept your claim.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

The claimant also fears further abuse from her uncle.\n[4] Details of the claimant\u2019s allegations can be found in her Basis of Claim form. The following is a summary of her allegations and testimony.\n[5] The claimant was raised by a single mother in Korea and as a result faced harassment in her childhood.\n[6] The claimant was also sexually abused by her uncle when she was a minor in Korea.\n[7] The claimant came to Canada in 1996 and studied in in Toronto from 1996 to 1999.\n[8] On XXXX XXXX, 2003, the claimant returned to Canada as a visitor.\n[9] The claimant\u2019s last valid TRV expired on November 15, 2004, and she remained in Canada.\n[10] The claimant described taking a long time to figure out her sexual orientation and how she has tried to escape, conceal, and hide herself from the world. The claimant described not having any relationships with women but that she has gone on a couple of dates with women. The claimant identified her sexual orientation as bisexual.\n[11] The claimant has suffered from mental health issues, and she is currently being treated for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The claimant has attempted suicide on a at least two occasions in the past.\n[12] In December 2019, the claimant applied for refugee protection.\nDETERMINATION\n[13] I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[14] The claimant\u2019s identity as a citizen of South Korea has been established by her testimony and passport located at Exhibit 1.\nNexus\n[15] The allegations support a nexus to a Convention ground for the claimant based on her particular social group, namely her sexual orientation as a bisexual.\n[16] The allegations and country condition documents support that the claimant\u2019s risks arise from the intersection between her sexual orientation, her gender, and her mental health issues.\nCredibility\n[17] I find that the claimant is a credible witness.\n[18] In making that finding I am relying on the principle that a claimant who affirms to tell the truth creates a presumption of truthfulness unless there are reasons to doubt their truthfulness.\n[19] In this regard, the claimant testified in a consistent and straightforward manner that was consistent with her basis of claim form and supporting documents. The claimant was able to speak about her fears if she returned to Korea due to her sexual orientation. The claimant described how she is coming to terms with her sexual orientation and how does not like men, how she only dated one man and that was 22 years ago, and how she feels comfortable with women. The claimant testified that she has been introduced to the 519 and has been volunteering with the group since 2020. The claimant also described her ongoing fears from her uncle who abused her as a child and who is still in contact with the claimant\u2019s mother in Korea. The claimant described not be open about her sexual orientation with her mother. Further, the claimant described her previous suicide attempts as well as an incident when she was a child and her mother attempted to kill herself and the claimant. The claimant also spoke positively about her improvements from treatment and medication she now receiving. There were no relevant inconsistencies in her testimony or contradictions between her testimony and the other evidence.\n[20] The claimant also provided documents to support her claim found at exhibit 5. For example, the claimant provided documents including her membership card and volunteer information supporting her involvement with the 519. The claimant also provided approximately 60 pages of medical reports from the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in Toronto supporting the ongoing treatment the claimant has been receiving for her mental health. The reports also indicate that prior to the claimant\u2019s refugee application the claimant described herself as bi-sexual to her mental health professionals. I have no reason to doubt the genuineness of the documents submitted by the claimant and since they relate to the claimant\u2019s sexual orientation and her difficulties expressing her identity and the predate the claimant\u2019s application for refugee protection, I place significant weight on these documents to support the allegations and overall claim.\n[21] I find that the claimant has a subjective fear of returning to Korea even though she last arrived in Canada in 2003, she was without status in Canada since November 2004, and did not apply for refugee protection until December 2019. The claimant explained that during that time that she did not have any knowledge of applying for refugee protection and she was afraid of being forced to return to Korea. The claimant explained that she had not met many people in Canada. The claimant also said she decided she could not live any longer without saying that she wanted to have a relationship with a woman and that she needed to overcome her fears. The claimant testified that she never received treatment for her mental health issues before 2019. I do not make any negative credibility findings against the claimant for her lengthy delay. When making that finding, I am taking into consideration that the claimant has suffered trauma throughout her life. The claimant also suffers from significant mental health issues and that has led to her being socially isolated for most of her time in Canada.\nObjective Basis\n[22] The objective evidence supports the claimant\u2019s fear of returning to Korea.\n[23] As background, the US Department of State Report at item 2.1 located in the National Documentation Package for the Republic of Korea located at exhibit 3, describes the Republic of Korea (South Korea) as a constitutional democracy governed by a president and a unicameral legislature. The report lists few significant human rights issues in the country, but it does highlight corruption and laws criminalizing consensual same-sex sexual conduct between adults in the military. The report also indicates that many members of the LGBTI community keep their sexual orientation or gender identity secret due to fear of stigmatization.1\n[24] The 2021 Human Rights Watch report at item 2.2 opens by stating that: \u201cthe South Korean government, a democracy, largely respects most political, civil, and socio-economic rights but significant human rights concerns remain. Discrimination against women is pervasive, as is discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people, and racial and ethnic minorities.\u201d The report goes on to indicate that while the \u201cLGBT rights movement in South Korean grew but hostility and severe discrimination persisted.\u201d The report also described that discrimination against women is widespread and how there is a 35% wage gap between men and women.2\n[25] A report from Rainbow Action against Sexual Minority Discrimination found at item 6.4 indicates that LGBTI persons face discrimination and harassment in employment and education. The report also describes that the police in Korea do not aggregate hate crimes based on sexual orientation so only few cases can be known through the media. The report provides examples including an example of women being murdered because of her lesbian relationship. Further, the report states with respect to violence against LGBTI persons that \u201cpolice investigators said the perpetrators committed crimes because they thought that victims are not likely to report to the police.\u201d3\n[26] Finally, an Amnesty International report at item 6.3, while focused on LGBTI people in South Korea\u2019s Military, states that:\n\u201cInterviewees stated that LGBTI people in South Korea face pervasive discrimination and many hide their sexual orientation and\/or gender identity from their families. Same-sex couples are not recognized under the law or by the judiciary. \u201cConversion therapy\u201d, which claims to change a person\u2019s sexual orientation, based upon the incorrect assumption that homosexuality is a mental disorder requiring treatment, is common according to one interviewee who experienced it.\nThough criminalization is only applicable within the military and therefore to a small segment of society, the fact that approximately half of the population goes through compulsory military service early in life means that criminalization has a significant impact. Criminalization creates an environment where discrimination is tolerated, and even encouraged, based solely on who someone is. Many former and current soldiers consider this to be toxic.\nHomophobic and transphobic individuals can view this law as tacit permission to target LGBTI people inside and outside the military. Discrimination and harassment can and does extend to South Korean organizations and events supporting LGBTI rights.\u201d4\n[27] With respect to the claimant\u2019s mental health issues, a UN report found at item 2.9 describes concerns about \u201clarge number of individuals in mental health facilities were involuntarily hospitalized, that the grounds for involuntary hospitalization were broad and included circumstances in which the detained persons did not present a threat to themselves or others, and that procedural safeguards against involuntary hospitalization were inadequate.\u201d5\n[28] A 2020 BTI Country Report at item 1.6 states that \u201cMental health issues are not currently well addressed in Korea, as can be seen by the large numbers of suicides; the country has the second-highest suicide rate in the OECD.\u201d The report indicates that the social welfare system is far below OECD standards. In addition, the report also states that discrimination remains a major problem in South Korea, particularly for women and LGBTI people. As an example, for women the report notes that South Korea has the largest gender pay gap in the OECD and was ranked 115 out of 149 countries evaluated in the world.6\n[29] The claimant also provided country condition documents to support her claim. For example, at exhibit 5 is a report from the Lesbian Counseling Center in South Korea that states, when discussing the invisibility of sexual minority women in South Korea, that:\n\u201cHowever, this serious invisibility has not worked as protection for sexual minority women. Sexual minority women of ROK have been tormented by multilayered discrimination and violence under sexism, homophobia and transphobia which have intensified one another. Moreover, this tendency has grown stronger as society in general has become more used to assuming diverse types of gender non-conforming women simply as lesbians (or just as perverts). Even regardless of self gender identification or expression (for example, even cisgendered women not looking a bit masculine), people have been treated as erratic and deviant if they do not get married to opposite gender after certain age and\/or are being involved in special relationship with person of their own gender. In this way, we can see the entanglement of issues of discrimination against women who go against the grain and the ones against lesbians.\u201d7\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution\n[30] I find that the claimant has established that she faces a serious possibility of persecution from the cumulative effect of the risks and discrimination she would face in South Korea based on her gender, sexual orientation, and her mental illness.\n[31] It is well established that cumulative discrimination and harassment can constitute persecution. When determining whether cumulative discrimination and harassment constitutes persecution, it is necessary to evaluate the claimant\u2019s personal circumstances and vulnerabilities including age, health, and finances.\n[32] In this case, the claimant has only basic employment experience. The claimant is currently working part-time in a XXXX XXXX XXXX The claimant testified her previous employment has included as a XXXX and a XXXX. The claimant testified she has no family or friends to support her in Korea. Further, the claimant has described how her family has been a source of trauma both due to the sexual abuse from her uncle, from her mother who attempted to kill her in a suicide attempt, and from society when growing up because she came from a single parent household. The claimant also has numerous well documented mental health issues. While the claimant\u2019s health is improving with the treatment she has been receiving, the claimant has attempted suicide previously and testified that due to the poor treatment of mental health issues in South Korea and her lack of finances, she believes she would be unable continue treatment if she were to return.\n[33] The claimant\u2019s personal circumstances, and her lack of support, makes her particularly vulnerable to the cumulative risks, discrimination, and harassment described in the objective evidence. As such, I find that the claimant has established a well-found fear of persecution were she to return to South Korea.\nState Protection\n[34] It is presumed that states can protect their citizens. This presumption can be rebutted with clear and convincing evidence of the state\u2019s inability to protect its citizens.\n[35] The issue is whether the South Korean authorities can reasonably be expected to provide the claimant with adequate protection if she were to return to South Korea. The documentary evidence reviewed above provides a somewhat mixed view when it comes to state protection in South Korea.\n[36] It does show that South Korea is a democratic country with substantially effective police, civil authorities, an independent judiciary, and human rights organizations. However, it also highlights, for example in a Kaleidoscope Australia Human Rights Foundation report found at item 6.1, that while the National Human Rights Commission Act prevents discrimination against based on their sexual orientation that there are no specific laws in Korea punishing such discrimination nor laws providing remedy to victims of discrimination or violence against LGBTI persons. The report notes that discrimination against LGBTI persons exist in laws with respect to the military, adoption, censorship, and there is no same-sex marriage in the country.8\n[37] The country conditions noted above indicate that the environment in South Korea is one where discrimination against LGTBI persons and women is tolerated and when considering all the cumulative risks the claimant faces, the objective evidence presents clear and convincing evidence that rebuts the presumption that the South Korean authorities would be able to provide adequate protection to this claimant in the future. As such, I find that there is no state protection available for the claimant in South Korea.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[38] I have also considered whether there would be an internal flight alternative available to the claimant.\n[39] The claimant testified that her risks based on her sexual orientation would be the same anywhere in South Korea.\n[40] The objective evidence, as noted previously, highlight how the claimant faces a serious possibility of persecution based on her intersection as a woman, a member of a sexual minority, and a person with mental health issues. I find on a balance of probabilities that while there may be parts of South Korea, where one of those factors may have a lesser risk, the evidence as a whole indicates, including the claimant\u2019s own experiences, that the claimant would still face a serious possibility persecution anywhere in South Korea.\n[41] I find that there are no viable internal flight alternatives for the claimant in South Korea as there is insufficient evidence that areas exist in the country where conditions for the claimant in her particular circumstances would be significantly improved.\nCONCLUSION\n[42] For the foregoing reasons I determine that the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to s. 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act and the Board therefore accepts the claim.\n(signed) David Jones\nDecember 10, 2021\n__________________________\n[1] National Documentation Package, Korea, Republic of (South Korea), 30 April 2021, tab 2.1: Republic of Korea.

You believe you are at risk in both countries from family members, the state and civil society.\nDETERMINATION:\n[5] In my determination I find that you are a Convention refugee in accordance with Section 96 as you have established a serious possibility of persecution.\n[6] I note that Canadian jurisprudence and the gender guideline makes it clear that RPD members are to consider the interplay between multiple grounds of persecution advanced by a claimant. I find the persecution you face has separate and intersecting connections to the convention on account of your membership in particular social groups based on both sexual orientation and HIV status.\nIDENTITY:\n[7] With respect to identity, I find that your identity as a national of Malawi is established by the passport and other identity documents in evidence at Exhibits 1 and 5.\nCOUNTRIES OF REFERENCE:\n[8] With respect to countries of reference in your claim, you through your counsel have agreed that you also have access to citizenship in Zambia.\n[9] I note that this position is consistent with the country conditions evidence before me, specifically the National Documentation Package for Zambia at Tab 3.3, which indicates that a person born in Zambia to a parent with Zambia citizenship also has access to Zambian citizenship.\n[10] Because a refugee claimant must demonstrate that they have a well founded fear of persecution in all countries of nationality before they can receive refugee protection in Canada, I must assess your claim with respect to both countries of reference in your claim these countries of reference are both Malawi and Zambia.\nCREDIBILITY:\n[11] With respect to credibility, I find you to be a credible witness and I believe what you have alleged in support of your claim.\n[12] I note as well that you have provided significant corroborative documentary evidence in relation to both aspects of your claim and I find that through your testimony and the supporting documents at Exhibits 5 and 6 you have established on a balance of probabilities both your sexual orientation and your HIV status.\nOBJECTIVE EVIDENCE:\n[13] To establish your status as a convention refugee you had to show that there was a serious possibility that you would be persecuted if you were removed to either of your countries of nationality and I find that you have met that burden.\n[14] As noted just a moment ago, I accept that you have established that you are a lesbian woman with a HIV diagnosis.\n[15] In my view it is important to assess the objective evidence relating to the prospective or forward facing risk for you in each country with the express acknowledgement that your claim engages inter-related grounds of persecution and that each increases the risk of persecution in relation to the other. In other words, they are not truly separate or separable.\n[16] First with respect to Malawi, the country conditions evidence reflects a nation in which state institutions are deeply impacted by corruption, where the law criminalizes sexual minorities and where person\u2019s living with HIV are mistreated by civil society, state and medical system actors.\n[17] Sources in the National Documentation Package from Malawi at Chapters 2, 5 and 6 and your own documents at Exhibit 5 confirm that consensual same sex activity is illegal and the law does not prohibit discrimination against LGBTI persons.\n[18] Sexual minorities risk mob attacks, routine violence and discrimination in almost all aspects of life, according to a Human Rights Watch report that is located at Tab 6.1 of the NDP.\n[19] As well, very recently the Malawi Parliament in amending the penal code to expand criminalization of same sex sexual activity to women as well.\n[20] I find that the risk you face in Malawi is further magnified by your HIV status. The country conditions documents, also demonstrates severe stigma, ostracism and discrimination for persons living with HIV, including in accessing and receiving medical care.\n[21] I find that your HIV status alongside rapid, official and social homophobia in Malawi amounts to persecution and I find there is a serious possibility of persecution for you if you were to return to Malawi.\nSTATE PROTECTION MALAWI:\n[22] I also find there is clear and convincing evidence before me to rebut the presumption of adequate state protection in Malawi. According to the sources already cited, you fear state actors with good reason, given the criminalization of homosexuality and the fact that you are a lesbian. The presumption of state protection in Malawi has been rebutted.\nINTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE MALAWI:\n[23] I have also considered whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for you and given the illegality of your sexual orientation in Malawi I find that you face a serious possibility of persecution throughout the country.\n[24] Second with respect to Zambia, the country conditions evidence it Exhibit 5 is similarly clear about the National Documentation Package for Zambia and your documents at Exhibit 5 is similarly clear about the existence of laws criminalizing same sex, sex acts and a context of social and state sponsored homophobia.\n[25] In Zambia sexual minority persons living with HIV are further stigmatised in relation to healthcare and have been expressly excluded from the countries national framework for addressing HIV. Both persons with sexual minority identities and persons living with HIV are severely mistreated and stigmatised in all aspects of life in Zambia and the risk of persecution is even greater for persons with both of these identities, that is persons that are both sexual minorities and living with HIV.\n[26] Because of your identification as a lesbian and your HIV diagnosis, I find there is a serious possibility of persecution for you if you were to return to Zambia.\nSTATE PROTECTION ZAMBIA:\n[27] With respect to state protection I find it would be objectively unreasonable for you to seek protection in the state for Zambia, given the current legislation and the fact that the government is an agent of persecution. The presumption of state protection has been rebutted in Zambia as well.\nINTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE ZAMBIA:\n[28] And finally I have considered whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for you in Zambia. I find that it does not, on the evidence before me I find there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout the country, since the laws apply across the country and you cannot be expected to hide from the state.\nCONCLUSION:\n[29] So for the reasons I have just outlined I conclude that you are a Convention refugee in accordance with Section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. I accept your claim.\n[30] So that is the end of my decision and just before we leave today Miss XXXX I want to say thank you very much for your testimony and good luck to you.\n[31] CLAIMANT: Thank you, thank you so much for accepting me.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2021 RLLR 73\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: October 20, 2021\nPanel: Isis Marianne van Loon\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Juliette Ukpabi\nCountry: Iran\nRPD Number: VC1-02405\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2022-01594\nATIP Pages: N\/A\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: This is the decision in the Refugee Protection Division in the claim of XXXX XXXX as a citizen of Iran who is claiming refugee protection pursuant to Section 96 and Subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. In rendering my reasons, I have considered and applied the Chairperson\u2019s guidelines on women refugee claimants fearing gender related persecution as well as the Chairperson\u2019s guidelines on proceedings before the IRB involving sexual orientation and gender identity and expression.\n[2] Your allegations are set out in your Basis of Claim form and by your testimony, the following is a very brief summary. You are a lesbian and you fear persecution in Iran as a result.\nDETERMINATION\n[3] I find you are a Convention refugee as you have established a well-founded fear of persecution based on a Convention ground.\nIDENTITY\n[4] Your identity as a national of Iran is established by your testimony and the supporting documentation on file including a certified true copy of your passport in Exhibit 1.\nCREDIBILITY\n[5] The presumption before me is that your testimony is true; however, this could be rebutted in appropriate circumstances if there were inconsistencies or contradictions, omissions or undetailed testimony and the Presumption does not apply to inferences or speculation for which there is no evidentiary basis. You provided in Exhibit 4 credible documentation in support of your claim.\n[6] There are text exchanges between you and your father where you are asserting your right to make your own decisions and he is stating that you don\u2019t have that right and that you need to return and get married. Your father states in these exchanges that in awhile you\u2019re going to run out of money and you\u2019ll come begging and he threatens to kill you if you don\u2019t return. You reply that he should stop threatening you and said that you would rather die in a corner of a street than have your father or someone else that he has chosen for you control your freedom, your life, and your right to decided.\n[7] There are also exchanges between your uncle XXXX and your father. Your father accuses XXXX of using black magic on you to make you turn against him and XXXX tells your father that you are able to decide for yourself. Your friend XXXX writes from Iran and states that you came out as a lesbian when you were about 13. She further describe a situation that you would face in Iran where you would have to marry and would risk persecution if your sexual orientation were ever exposed and XXXX included a copy of her passport.\n[8] There is a letter from the Centre for Newcomers which confirms your attendance at various LGBTQ+ events and workshops and you provide copies of certificates of completion for some of these workshops. Your uncle XXXX letter confirms that he sponsored you to Canada as he was aware of the daily abuse that you were enduring and your lack of safety in Iran. He found a school and a place for you to live and he was able to convince your father to let you come to study.\n[9] At the time, your uncle was unaware of your sexuality but you came out to him after your father began to pressure you to return to marry a man of your father\u2019s choosing. Your uncle actually \u2013 threat, was threatened by your father and your uncle describes the religious intolerance of your family in Iran and states that as a lesbian woman, you have no place in Iran and you would be persecuted and he provided a copy of his photo ID. I found these documents were relevant and they corroborate your allegation that you are a lesbian.\n[10] Furthermore, your testimony was straightforward and forthcoming. You spoke without hesitation and in detail. There were no inconsistencies between your testimony or contradiction between your testimony or the other evidence before me. I found you to be a credible witness and therefore I believe what you have alleged in support of your claim. I find that the persecution that you face has a nexus to one of the five convention grounds, that of your membership in a particular social group as a lesbian, a member of the LGBTQ+ community. Therefore, I have assessed your claim under Section 96.\n[11] I could equally have analyzed your claim on the basis of your gender alone as a woman from Iran, but it wasn\u2019t necessary to do so given the former. In order to be considered a Convention refugee, you have to demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution. This includes both a subjective basis, an objective basis, and it has to be forward looking. Based on your testimony, supporting documents, and the country condition documents, I find you have a well-founded fear of persecution for the following reasons: You told me how you had to hide yourself when you were in Iran. You could never speak about your sexuality with anyone but that one friend, the one person in Iran who knows about your sexuality. You tried your best to act appropriately, you said you did everything right so that no one would suspect you, you tried to conform to what a girl should be and act like, you never disobeyed, you never did anything rebellious because you were scared to death. You said from the moment that you discovered your sexual orientation and in light of the view of Iranian people about LGBTQ people, you hid yourself and until this day, no one in Iran but that one friend and your uncle who lives here in Canada knows about your sexual orientation because you were too frightened to tell them.\n[12] Two months before you finished high school in Canada, your father called and told you that he had found you someone to marry. You refused and he insisted. You explained to me that if you don\u2019t go back and marry this man in Iran, your father perceives it as ruining his reputation in the community and inaudible honour as a man. You said that when he first told you you had to return, you tried to drag it out, you said you couldn\u2019t get a flight, the pandemic and so on, but you hadn\u2019t even actually checked. You just said it to put him off. You dragged it out until June when you were supposed to graduate but in the meantime, you had searched online for help and you applied for asylum and continued to refuse your father\u2019s demands and you eventually blocked him from contacting you.\n[13] For a while you heard nothing but then you received e-mails in October 20. They were basically death threats. Your father told you you were going to run out of money and that your uncle would stop supporting you and then you were going to have to come back to Iran. So I find that you have induced sufficient credible evidence to establish a subjective fear of persecution if you were to return to Iran. You told me that your father and in fact the whole Islamic Republic believes that a father owns his children, especially when you are talking about his girl, his female children. You have no say and no choice in Iran, you cannot make a decision of your own because based on Islamic beliefs, women are only half that of men.\n[14] You described to me your first job at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, how happy you were to have this job because you had not even been allowed to go to the grocery to shop on your own in Iran, and you had never been allowed to work. When you were informed that you had got the job, you were so excited that you said you were walking on clouds, it was one of the happiest moments of your life and you have been there now since XXXX 2020 and you\u2019re now being promoted and how hard you worked to get that promotion. You also spoke about how happy you were simply to have a savings account as you had never been allowed to have one in Iran. You told me about coming out to your uncle. You said you gathered all of your courage and it was extremely hard, you were unable to look in his eyes and you felt like what you were saying was wrong and sometimes you said you still feel wrong for being like this referring to your sexuality but you said your uncle is an amazing man and he accepted you, He said \u201cIt\u2019s okay, I don\u2019t care who you are going to love as long as you\u2019re happy\u201d and you said that is what you had wanted to hear your entire life. I asked you what would need to change in Iran for you to live there safely, and you had no shortage of things that needed to change. You said the whole government needs to go, it\u2019s under the Islamic Republic, and it\u2019s run by religious leaders. You said that Islam is really involved with the law, everything is based on Islam and Sharia law. For you to be able to live freely as a lesbian in Iran, they would have to separate religion from the law so that they wouldn\u2019t judge and punish people based on religion.\n[15] You said LGBTQ+ people are criminals based on Sharia law, you don\u2019t have an identity of your own, and it is considered a form of sickness. If you are perceived or exposed as homosexual, you need to go in front of a judge and defend yourself and convince them that you are not, and if you can\u2019t do that, you will be punished and the punishments range from flogging to the death penalty. You said because of the way the country is run, the people have developed the same ideas and opinions as the religious leaders about the LGBTQ community and socially LGBTQ people are not accepted in Iran and the country documentation is consistent with your testimony on this. The U.S. Department of State confirms human rights abuses including crimes involving violence or threats of violence targeting lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex persons, and the criminalization of LGBTI status or conduct. The law criminalizes consensual same sex activity punishable by death, flogging, or a lesser punishment. The UK home office reports that the Islamic penal code criminalizes same sex sexual relationships and it confirms punishments ranging from lashes to the death penalty.\n[16] LBGTI persons face a variety of abuse by government authorities including beatings, verbal assaults, rape, sexual assault, and torture. Furthermore, not only are LGBTI persons who openly express their sexual orientation and\/or gender identity or expression likely to face mistreatment and persecution from state actors, they will also face discrimination and ill treatment from societal actors which by its nature and repetition is likely to amount to persecution. According to the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission, in present day Iran, lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender individuals suffer from human rights violations and are denied the basic freedom of being who they are. Abuses are perpetrated by the Iranian government, the judiciary, and by non-state actors such as schools, communities, and families. No one is held accountable for these serious violations of basic rights. So I find the treatment of LGBTI people in Iran amounts to persecution and accordingly, I conclude that your fear of persecution in Iran is well-founded.\nSTATE PROTECTION AND INTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE\n[17] States are presumed to be able to protect their citizens; however, in this case, the agent of persecution is the state and the persecution would face is at the hands of the authorities so accordingly I find there is no state protection available to you and the presumption of state protection is rebutted. The state is in control of all of its territories and therefore I find there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout Iran and there is no viable Internal Flight Alternative where you could safely relocate in the country available to you in your particular circumstances.\nCONCLUSION\n[18] Based on the totality of the evidence, I conclude that you are a Convention refugee. Accordingly, I have accepted your claim.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2021 RLLR 72\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: April 30, 2021\nPanel: David Jones\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Robert William W Young\nCountry: Moldova and Romania\nRPD Number: VC1-01442\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2022-01594\nATIP Pages: N\/A\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: So, this is the decision of the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada for the claim of XXXX XXXX, who is a citizen of Moldova and Romania, seeking refugee protection pursuant to Sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[2] I have also reviewed and applied both the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline on Proceedings Before the IRB Involving Sexual Orientation and Gender, Identity and Expression, and the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline on Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution.\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] The claimant fears persecution due to her sexual orientation as a lesbian if she was to return to Moldova or live in Romania. Details of the claimant\u2019s allegations can be found in her Basis of Claim form and attached narrative. The following is a brief overview of her allegations and testimony.\n[4] The claimant is a citizen of both Moldova and Romania. The claimant lived in Moldova and has only visited Romania a few times. Around 2012, while in high school, the claimant started to identify to herself as a lesbian. In 2014, the claimant moved to the capital of Moldova. In 2015, the claimant started dating her girlfriend, XXXX. The claimant described, in her allegations, numerous accounts when she was harassed and physically assaulted due to her sexual orientation, including two (2) incidents when she was assaulted by strangers that required her to receive medical treatment.\n[5] In the summer of 2018, the claimant went to visit her family when her parents discovered a message from her girlfriend. The claimant\u2019s parents were furious because of her sexual orientation and the claimant left and returned to the capital. The claimant has not spoken with her father since then. Towards the end of 2018, the claimant\u2019s mother warned her that her father wanted to organize a corrective rape. Around April 2019, the claimant\u2019s mother warned the claimant that her dad was looking for her in the capital. The claimant went into hiding by staying with friends. On XXXX XXXX XXXX 2019, the claimant arrived in Canada. In August 2019, the claimant applied for refugee protection.\nDETERMINATION\n[6] I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[7] The claimant\u2019s identity as a citizen of both Romania and Moldova has been established on a balance of probabilities by her testimony, as well as her Romanian passport and Moldovan identify card located at Exhibit 1. Given the claimant has two (2) countries of reference, she needs to establish a claim against both countries.\nNexus\n[8] The allegations establish a nexus to a Convention ground for the claimant based on particular social group, both based on the claimant\u2019s sexual orientation as a lesbian and as a woman facing gender-based violence.\nCredibility\n[9] I find that the claimant was a credible witness. In making that finding, I am relying on the principle that a claimant who affirms to tell the truth creates a presumption of truthfulness, unless there are reasons to doubt their truthfulness. In this regard, the claimant testified in a consistent and straightforward manner that was consistent with her Basis of Claim form, narrative, supporting documents and the witness.\n[10] The claimant was also able to speak clearly about her relationship with XXXX, of first when she started identifying as a lesbian, the conditions for sexual minorities in both Moldova and Romania. She was able to answer questions about the physical attacks she received, and she was able to explain the risks to living openly as a sexual minority in either country. Including the risks of physical violence and discrimination with respect to housing and employment. The claimant was also able to answer specific questions when asked. The claimant provided her partner XXXX as a witness. The witness was also able to testify clearly about her relationship with the claimant, the conditions in Moldova, why she believes the conditions are the same in Romania, and I found that the witness was credible as well.\n[11] The claimant provided documents to support her claim. For example, documents found at Exhibit 4, include, medical reports describing injuries received by the claimant; a statement from her partner, XXXX, supporting the claimant\u2019s allegations; photographs of injuries the claimant and her partner received. In addition, Exhibits 5 and 6 contain additional medical reports, copy of the claimant\u2019s lease agreement. I have no reasons to doubt the genuineness of these documents. And since they relate to significant aspects of the claimant\u2019s allegations, including her sexual orientation and the physical assaults that occurred because of her sexual orientation, I place significant weight on these documents to support the claimant\u2019s allegations and overall claim.\n[12] I find that given the claimant\u2019s credibility and supporting documents, the claimant has established, on a balance of probabilities, the facts alleged in her claim. Including her sexual orientation as a lesbian and her subjective fear of being persecuted if she were to return to either Moldova or Romania.\nObjective Basis\u2014Moldova\n[13] The objective evidence supports the claimant\u2019s fears of returning to Moldova. The country condition documents found in both the National Documentation Package, which is located at Exhibit 3.1 and those provided by the claimant at Exhibit 4, indicate that societal attitudes against sexual minorities is widespread and pervasive in the country.\n[14] For example, a 2019 US Department of State report found at Item 2.1 in the National Documentation Package States that,\n[As Read] The law prohibits employment discrimination based on sexual orientation, but societal discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity continued. The LGBTI community reported verbal and physical abuse. In most cases, police were reluctant to open cases against perpetrators. According to a survey conducted by the Anti-Discrimination Council in 2018, the LGBTI community had the lowest societal acceptance rate of any minority group.\n[15] The 2017 report on the Human Right Situation of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex People found at Item 6.1 indicates that derogatory public statements and violence directed towards LGBTI people continued. The report describes an incident where a lesbian woman reported to the police that her mother verbally and physically attacked because of her sexual orientation. The police registered the report as the victim being the instigator and police also contacted child protection services about the victim\u2019s child and disclosing the victim\u2019s sexual orientation and stating that she was mentally unstable.\n[16] The victim provided country condition documents related to Moldova to support her claim that are found at Exhibit 4. These documents include a 2020 version of the US Department of State report for Moldova that indicates that conditions have not improved since the 2029 (sic) report and states that,\n[As Read] The LGBTI community remained among the groups that were most vulnerable to hate speech and were subjected to the most aggressive and violent speech registered by authorities.\n[17] Exhibit 4 also has a 2017 news article that describes how the situation of LGBT rights in Moldova, and notes that while there are pride marches that are protected by police and laws protecting LGBT people from discrimination, LGBT people are subject to bias-motivated violence. The article notes that Moldova is one (1) of the most homophobic countries in Europe, where two (2) thirds of Moldovan society believes that LGBT people should be kicked out of the country and only one (1) percent would be ready to accept an LGBT person as a family member. The article also quotes the president of Moldova who stated, \u201cI never promised to be the president of the gays.\u201d In relation to his open opposition to a proposed pride parade.\n[18] I note that numerous reports from both the NDP and the claimant\u2019s documents indicate that sexual minorities face discrimination with respect to housing, employment and obtaining medical treatment in Moldova. The claimant\u2019s own experience with being a victim of physical attacks and having to change her residence, both of those on more than one (1) occasion, unfortunately demonstrate examples of the societal attitudes in country conditions in Moldova noted above.\nObjective Basis\u2014Romania\n[19] The objective evidence also supports the claimant\u2019s fears of resettling in Romania. As with Moldova, societal attitudes towards sexual minorities indicate widespread intolerance and hate. See for example a 2019 European Commission report found at Item 2.7 in the National Documentation Package for Romania, which is found at Exhibit 3.2 and the 2018 UN Report at Item 2.9.\n[20] A US Department of State report from 2020 at Item 2.1 states that significant human rights issues include a lack of investigation and accountability for violence against women. The report also indicates that while discrimination based on sexual orientation is prohibited by law, societal discrimination against LGBTI persons was common. Further, the report indicates that police not only do not adequately respond to violence against LGBTI person, on some occasions, police approve the violence. Finally, the report states that,\n[As Read] A survey carried out by the EU\u2019s Fundamental Rights Agency reported and revealed that 15 percent of respondents experienced physical or sexual attacks motivated by the victim\u2019s sexual orientation or gender identity during the past five (5) years. Out of respondents who described the most recent physical or sexual attack, only four (4) percent reported the incident to authorities because they are LGBTI. As many as 28 percent of respondents indicated fear of homophobic reaction, transphobic reaction, or both from police as a reason for not report physical or sexual attack.\n[21] The claimant provided country condition documents related to Romania to support her claim that are also found at Exhibit 4. These documents include a 2017 news article highlighting that only 36 percent of Romanians believe that LGBT should have the same rights as heterosexuals. The article also describes incidents of the police failing to intervene or receiving complaints from LGBT individuals who experience violence and abuse (inaudible).\n[22] Exhibit 4 also contains a 2019 European Commission report that states that, \u201cThere is a hostile atmosphere towards LGBT persons in Romania, which renders them targets of violence.\u201d That report also indicates that discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation is very widespread. Further, the report quotes a survey indicating that only seven (7) percent of respondents would accept a homosexual as a relative, only 12 percent as a colleague and states that, \u201cThese extremely low levels of societal acceptance contribute to significant discrimination and stigmatization against LGBT persons in key areas of life.\u201d\n[23] Further, Exhibit 4 contains a 2020 news article that similarly states that,\n[As Read] Violence against women in the LGBTQ community is still heavily overlooked and dismissed by authorities. That is when they do not inflict it themselves as it regularly happens.\n[24] Based on the totality of the evidence before, I find that the claimant has established a well-founded fear of persecution for her. In her particular circumstances and in light of the cumulative risks of discrimination and harassment that the claimant would face if she were to return to Moldova or resettle in Romania based on her membership in a particular social group as a lesbian. I also find that the claimant\u2019s risks are heightened because of the risks she faces from her father.\nState Protection\n[25] Based on the evidence noted in the country conditions above, indicating that authorities both in Moldova and Romania are often indifferent and sometimes hostile towards sexual minorities, I find that there is no operationally effective state protection available to the claimant in these circumstances. For example, the report at Item 2.6 in the National Documentation Package for Moldova states that,\n[As Read] LGBT person s in Moldova face difficulty getting access to justice, with police officers appearing to be primarily concerned with the victim\u2019s sexuality, rather than any crime committed against them. In the same report Amnesty found that gay men may be the subject to blackmail and extortion by corrupt police officers at known gay meeting points who exploit for fear of exposure.\n[26] And with respect to Romania, the report at Item 2.7 states that,\n[As Read] Although the LGBTI minority is explicitly protected by Anti-Discrimination Law, it remains the group most under attack, being subject of legislative proposals aiming to restrict LGBTI rights and the target of acts of aggression during NGO organized events. These attacks remain uninvestigated and have attacked no sanctions, suggesting that authorities are liable for reluctant indifference (which) would be tantamount to official acquiescence to, or even connivance with, hate crimes.\n[27] As such, the claimant has rebutted the presumption of state protection.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[28] For the reasons below, I find that the claimant does not have an internal flight alternative. When determining whether an internal flight alternative exist in Moldova or Romania, I must find both that a claimant would not face a serious possibility of persecution in a proposed internal flight alternative and that conditions in that part of the country are such that it would be objectively reasonable in all the circumstances. Including those particular for the claimant to seek refuge there. The objective evidence noted above previously supports the finding that there is a serious possibility of persecution that would exist for this claimant throughout either country.\n[29] As noted above, the objective evidence indicates that there is deep-rooted prejudice against the LGBTQ community in both Moldova and Romania. That the intolerance exists throughout both countries. There is no evidence in either the country condition documents, the claimant\u2019s testimony or the witness testimony to indicate that there is a place in either country where the conditions for sexual minorities are significantly better.\n[30] Based on the totality of the evidence, I find that the claimant has established that there is no viable internal flight alternative available to her as I find that the claimant would face a serious possibility of persecution throughout Moldova or Romania due to the prevalence of violence against the LGBTQ community.\nCONCLUSION\n[31] For the reasons above, I determine that the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to Section 96 of the Act, and the Board, therefore, accept her claim. Given that I am granting protection under Section 96 of the Act, I find it unnecessary to consider the claim under Section 97.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

I have considered your testimony and the other evidence in the case and I\u2019m going to give you my decision orally. You will, however, receive a written transcript of this decision in the mail. Throughout the hearing and in in making my decision, I have considered and applied Chairperson\u2019s Guidelines Guideline 9 as this case involved sexual orientation, gender identity and expression as well as Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 4 which relates to gender-based persecution as that also relates to the nature of the allegations and the availability of a viable IFA.\n[2] The decision I have reached is a positive one (1) and I accept your claim. I find that you are a Convention refugee, and my reasons follow.\n[3] You are a citizen of Morocco and are claiming refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[4] To summarize your allegations which are set out in full in your Basis of Claim form at Exhibit 2. You are a 24-year-old woman originally from Rabat who identifies as a lesbian. Starting around the age of 13, you noticed that you were attracted to girls. Your family lived in various countries as you grew up due to your father\u2019s job and when your family returned to Morocco when you were 15 years old, you began to attend what you\u2019ve described as a liberal minded French high school. The school was a bit more open than society, but you still didn\u2019t feel safe being open about your sexuality other than to a few friends of yours. Your first same-sex relationship was with a classmate at this school who was named XXXX and you were about 18 years old. You mostly hung out with her in her bedroom and would play video games and do other activities. Due to the criminalization of same-sex relationships, you two (2) were very careful when you went out together in public. You intended to go to school abroad because you felt the need to escape Morocco in order to not live-in fear or in secret. You came to Canada as a student in 2015, the same year that you graduated from high school; and have been on student visas in Canada since then.\n[5] You filed for refugee protection in late 2020. You explained that you did so then because you knew that you liked living in Canada, that you could see yourself with a future here and because going back to Morocco was not an option for you given your sexual orientation. You have not told your father that you are a lesbian as you are afraid of his reaction and his possibly rejecting you. Recently, your mother asked you if you would be interested in dating women and when you told her you would, she moved on with the conversation and did not ask you any further questions which led you to believe that she wasn\u2019t really ready or open to talk about that yet. You fear that if you return to Morocco, you will face persecution, possibly even arrest as well as other risks due to your sexual orientation.\nIdentity\n[6] Your identity as a national of Morocco is established by your testimony as well as documents including your passport that has several visas in it which is Exhibit 1. You testified about the information in your identity documents is consistent. I have no reason to question their authenticity and so I\u2019m satisfied of your identity.\nCredibility\n[7] There is a presumption that sworn testimony is true unless there are valid reasons to doubt their truthfulness and, in your case, I find there was no serious reasons to doubt the truthfulness of your testimony. Your testimony that was direct and spontaneous. You didn\u2019t exaggerate or tailor your evidence. There were no material inconsistencies or contradictions. You testified about coming to realize your sexual orientation and about how it felt being with a girl versus being with a boy. You credibly talked about your first same-sex relationship in Morocco when you were still in high school and how XXXX went on to study in France. You also testified about a young woman named XXXX (ph) that you dated for about a year and a half in Canada and how your relationship ended, and she returned to Malaysia. You are no longer in contact with either of these women and so I accept that you are not able to get a declaration from them or have them testify on your behalf. You testified about a dating app for women that you used and how you met XXXX (ph) who you casually dated for a while in 2020 but that due to the pandemic, that ended, and you found it difficult to socialize or date since.\n[8] You provided corroborating evidence to support your testimony in the form of a photograph of yourself at a pride event in Vancouver with some friends of yours. You also provided a letter from XXXX XXXX who has been your friend since you arrived in Canada in 2015. In his letter, he attests to you taking a while to tell him about your sexual orientation despite his telling you almost immediately about his being gay. He also attests to you attending a pride event with him and to his socializing with you and XXXX. He also explained how COVID has affected your ability to socialize and date in Canada. I accept that you\u2019re a lesbian and that you have a subjective fear of persecution in Morocco due to your sexual orientation. In addition to which I accept that you found it difficult to live in that society as a result of your agnostic beliefs and being a woman there. Your claim has a nexus to a Convention ground by reason of your membership in a particular social group due to your sexual orientation therefore, I have assessed the claim under section 96 of the Act.\n[9] The objective evidence in the National Documentation Package as well as the reports and articles that you provided at Exhibit 3, corroborate your fear of persecution on the basis of your sexual orientation. Sexual relations between people of the same sex are illegal in Morocco. There are no laws to protect LGBT persons against discrimination or hate crimes nor are they protected against being terminated from their employment on account of their sexuality. LGBT individuals also risk physical, societal and institutional violence and I\u2019m citing NDP Item 6.3. More recently, members of the LGBT community have also faced internet-based abuse through online attacks against individuals who are presumed to be gay or lesbian who have been outed by people trolling same-sex dating sites which has led to their being ostracized by their family and community, expelled from housing, by relatives or landlords and dismissed from their employment and there, I refer to NDP Item 6.5. A research report by the IRB in 2013 cites one (1) source as saying that convictions for homosexuality are rare and that the criminal code provisions are infrequently enforced, and that homosexuality is tolerated in Morocco. That\u2019s NDP Item 6.1. However, the same report cites an NGO which estimates that since independence in 1956, more than five (5) thousand individuals have been prosecuted for violating the criminal code provisions around same-sex relations. It also refers to lesbians being at risk of imprisonment, discrimination and violence in addition to being shunned by families or forced into heterosexual marriage.\n[10] The US State Department report notes that 122 individuals were prosecuted for same-sex sexual activity in 2019. That\u2019s NDP Item 2.1 and there is also a 2019 report by the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association found at NDP Item 6.2 which documents individuals being arrested and imprisoned for being gay quite recently. The article you disclosed at Exhibit 4 page 11 also lists numerous incidents of violence and arrest of individuals for being gay or lesbian. I also note that you provided a 2020 article by a lesbian woman from Morocco who stated much as you did that \u201cmy misogynist and oppressive Muslim society taught me one (1) thing, keep your sexuality and non-conformity to yourself, do not risk your safety and do not bring shame to your family\u201d. And that was at Exhibit 4, page 9. I\u2019m satisfied on the evidence before me that you would face a serious possibility of persecution in Morocco on account of your sexual orientation.\nState Protection\n[11] A state is presumed to be capable of protecting its citizens and to rebut this presumption, a claimant must establish on a balance of probabilities with clear and convincing evidence that the state\u2019s protection is inadequate. In this case, it is the state that is the agent of persecution and you cannot be expected to seek the protection of a state where that state permits and even enables the persecution of LGBT individuals. I find that there\u2019s clear and convincing evidence that the state is unwilling to protect you.\n[12] And finally, turning to internal flight alternative. For an internal flight alternative or IFA to be viable in a section 96 analysis, there must be no serious possibility of a claimant being persecuted there. Further, the conditions in the IFA must be such that it would not be unreasonable in the circumstances for a claimant to seek refuge there. The IFA is not viable of either of these two (2) conditions are not met. Based on the evidence before me, LGBT, anti-LGBT laws and attitudes exists across the country. It is well established that being compelled to conceal one\u2019s sexual orientation constitutes a severe interference with your fundamental human rights and that a claimant cannot be compelled to do so in order to avoid the serious possibility of persecution. As such, I find that you would be unable to live safely elsewhere in Morocco and therefore there is no viable internal flight alternative.\n[13] Having considered all of the evidence, I find that there is a serious possibility of persecution if you return to Morocco and so I accept your claim under section 96 of the Act.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

I note that you have a high school education, you left Barbados at age 17 and you\u2019ve lived for almost a year in a shelter before being able to find a stable residence.\nAllegations\n[4] Your allegations are set out in your Basis of Claim form and in your testimony. The following is a very brief summary. You fear persecution in Barbados as a lesbian who presents in a masculine manner.\nDetermination\n[5] I find that you are a Convention refugee as you\u2019ve established a well-founded fear of persecution based on a Convention ground.\nIdentity\n[6] I find that your identity as a national of Barbados is established by your testimony and the supporting documentation on file which includes a copy of your birth certificate and a Barbados national identity card in exhibit 4. This identity card is a photo ID card. As well you have provided a number of Facebook posts that date back to 2017 and 2018 in the name of XXXX XXXX which show photos of yourself. I find on a balance of probabilities that your identity is established.\nCredibility\n[7] The presumption before me is that your testimony is true. However this can be rebutted in appropriate circumstances if there are inconsistencies, contradictions, omissions or undetailed testimony. You provided documents to support your claim in Exhibit 4. We reviewed numerous photos of you with two different former girlfriends. You were able to describe in detail what the occasion was, where the photos were taken, and who was in the photos. You have the Facebook profile pictures dated and I note that those use the pronoun his as in XXXX XXXX updated his profile picture going back to 2017. As you\u2019ve described, you are seen in these photographs with what would traditionally be considered male clothing as well as more traditionally male hairstyle as you have alleged. I found you overall that you were straightforward and forthcoming, you were able to provide details when I asked you about different things that you had told me about. I didn\u2019t see any relevant inconsistencies in your testimony or contradictions with the other evidence before me. I found you overall to be credible and therefore I believe what you\u2019ve alleged in support of your claim.\n[8] Your narrative and testimony corresponds to the ample objective evidence about conditions in Barbados pertaining to members of the LGBTQ community and accordingly I really have no reason to doubt the central elements underpinning your claim for protection. So I accept that you are lesbian who presents in a traditional male manner and wears traditional male clothing and that you\u2019ve experienced bullying, harassment, and threats of violence as a result of this.\n[9] I find the persecution you face has a Nexus to one of the five Convention grounds that of your membership in a particular social group as a member of the LGBTQ community as a lesbian who presents as male and therefore I\u2019ve assessed your claim under Section 96.\nWell-Founded Fear\n[10] In order to be considered a Convention refugee, you must demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution, including both a subjective and an objective basis for that fear. Based on your testimony, your supporting documents and the country condition documents, I find that you have a well-founded fear of persecution for the following reasons.\n[11] You came out to your parents at 17 years of age with the support of a friend who is also LGBTQ. Your family with the exception of one brother became abusive. You experienced homophobia on a daily basis, in the media, and both in public and at home where you were harassed, bullied, and threatened with violence. You were warned by police that if you didn\u2019t start to dress like a girl you would be sent to a reformatory. You witnessed an openly gay man that you knew being assaulted by a crowd because of his sexuality. You with your best friend who was also LGBTQ began to look for alternatives and you talked to a bisexual friend who\u2019d moved to Canada. The two of you were able to arrange a vacation in Canada with the help of your friend\u2019s mother. You had no intention of returning to Barbados and instead planned to claim asylum in Canada. The friend who came with you returned to Barbados where he later became suicidal and addicted to drugs. You included a newspaper article about this friend, with the headline \u2018Mom fears son will kill himself\u2019 which discusses his addiction after he pleaded guilty to possession of cannabis.\n[12] You stated that you have experienced bullying and harassment for much of your life due to the way that you present yourself. So I\u2019ve accepted that you are a lesbian who presents as male. I note that you are young, you were a minor when you left Barbados, you\u2019ve had challenges in establishing yourself in Canada and you spoke of your passport being lost or stolen. It took you some time to find resources needed to initiate your refugee claim which you did on June 27th of 2019. And as I\u2019ve said previously, given the country condition documents as well as your credible testimony I accept that you subjectively fear persecution in Barbados.\n[13] You described for me what it was like for you growing up in Barbados and what would happen to you if you return to your home country. You said life would be depressing whereas in Canada you\u2019re able to freely be yourself, you can get a job and you can focus more on being you. That you didn\u2019t have to worry about what people were thinking about you. You said in Barbados that there are a lot of negative things that make you a dark person, is that you feel like you don\u2019t wanna be yourself anymore because people hate you and they come at you.\n[14] I asked you about how you identified yourself and you said that you identified as a guy, but it was fine to refer to you as she or he because it doesn\u2019t matter when you know somebody is not coming at you in a disrespectful way. However, for people who are being disrespectful this is a problem for you. And I asked why you identified as a lesbian, you said simply because I like girls, that is how I feel.\n[15] Your allegations of the treatment that LGBTQ people in Barbados receive is consistent with country documents. The country documents in the NDP indicate that same-sex activity is against the law although the law is rarely enforced. Further the documentary evidence points to strong societal discrimination against sexual minorities, including persons in the LGBTQ+ community who are sometimes victims of violence.\n[16] The United States country report on human rights practices for Barbados in 2019 at Item 2.1 of the NDP for Barbados indicates that, there are significant human rights issues in Barbados including criminalization of consensual same-sex sexual activity. Civil society groups have reported that LGBTI persons faced discrimination in employment, housing, access to education and health care. The activist stated that while many individuals were open about their sexual orientation or gender identity, police disapproval and societal discrimination made LGBTI persons more vulnerable to threats, crime, and destruction of property. LGBTI women were particularly vulnerable to discrimination and unequal protection under the law. In one case a school prevented a transgender student from dressing as a woman. And I note that here you yourself told me that people tried to prevent you from dressing as a man.\n[17] An IRB Response to Information Request at NDP 6.1 reported homosexual acts are illegal. There\u2019s a maximum sentence of life imprisonment and it\u2019s illegal for both male and female same sex couples according to a country reports quoted in this report; discrimination against LGBT individuals was one of the most serious human rights problems in Barbados. Persons in the LGBTQ community in Barbados face stigma and discrimination often manifested in forms of property damage, ostracism, verbal abuse from strangers and family alike, unjustified denial of employment, denial of housing, rejection and abandonment by family and friends and society at large. Many LGBT couples are forced to hide their relationship to avoid mistreatment. There were reported incidents arson, rape of both males and females, attempted suicide, homelessness, verbal abuse, depression and assault. I\u2019m satisfied that you\u2019ve established that the harm you experienced and fears if you were to return to Barbados amounts to a serious harm that is a denial of a core human right and that you face a serious possibility of experiencing that harm if you were to return to Barbados given your profile as a lesbian who presents as male.\nState Protection\n[18] I find the presumption of state protection is rebutted with clear and convincing evidence as follows. At NDP 6.1 police in Barbados have been denounced as discriminatory and their treatment of victims who are LGBT and most members of the LGBT community do not report matters to the police out of fear of negative repercussions or facing ridicule. LGBT individuals have faced disapprobation by police officers and some police are well trained, however, others can be very dismissive of gay men and trans women and justice is very rarely served in these case and many charges are dropped due to many years of waiting or of missing reports. Based on the objective evidence I find that adequate state protection would not reasonably be forthcoming to you in Barbados.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[19] Now an internal flight alternative exists whether it would be some place safe that you could relocate in your home country. However, Barbados is a very small island, the States in control of the island. I\u2019m satisfied that there\u2019s no viable internal flight alternative for you in Barbados given the law criminalizing consensual same-sex activity exists throughout the country. And as well that homophobia permeates the society.\n[20] Based on all the evidence before me, I find you\u2019d face a serious possibility of persecution if you were to return to Barbados and I therefore conclude that you are a Convention refugee; accordingly I am accepting your claim.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- HEARING CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

However, this could be rebutted in appropriate circumstances, such as inconsistencies, contradictions, omissions or undetailed testimony. The presumption does not apply to inferences or speculation for which there is no evidentiary basis.\n[8] You provided a number of credible documents to support your claim. There are, I believe it\u2019s in Exhibit 10, messages between friends in Nigeria showing your attempts to locate your former partner, XXXX (ph), Exhibit 10 has a statutory declaration from your wife, stating that you\u2019re currently separated and confirming that were involved in a same-sex incident in July of 2016 and that you denied it at the time. She said that you had relocated to Lagos, as a result of the harassment, due to rumors in the community and in March 2017, you confessed to her. She said that men claiming to be police detectives have come to ask questions about you, to her residence in Nigeria. She said that after living in Canada for two years now, she\u2019s gone to counselling and she better understands the complexity of gender identity and sexual orientation. She states that you are a good father and that she has vowed to ensure that no matter what her own feelings are, your children would be able to continue to have a relationship with you. And in fact, your wife and children are accepted as refugees on March 16th of last year. She has included her photo ID, as well as the cover page of her RPD decision. There\u2019s an affidavit from XXXX XXXX confirming that you\u2019ve known each other for over two years and have been in a relationship. XXXX speaks of your strong bond and states that you\u2019ve been very supportive in his journey to heal, after the trauma he endured in Nigeria, due to his bisexuality. He described his joy when you were able to find a place in the same building, so that you could be close together. There are number of documents and photos showing your involvement first in Montreal\u2019s LGBTQ Centre and then the 519 in Toronto in Exhibits 5, 6, 9, 10 and 12. These include photos of 2019 Pride, where you\u2019re pictured with your current beau, XXXX. There\u2019s a XXXX XXXX showing you\u2019ve been diagnosed with XXXX and it\u2019s in the severe range with disassociated features and that this is consistent with you having experienced threats, harassment and violence, that\u2019s Exhibit 9. Exhibit 11 has a letter from your neighbour in Lagos who confirms that two detectives have come in early 2019 and again, of August 2020, wanting to contact you about an ongoing investigation. There\u2019s a second letter from a friend that you lived with in Montreal confirming that you attended many programs and events at the Montreal LGBTQ+ Community Centre. Both of these letters are accompanied by photo ID.\n[9] So, I found these documents relevant and they serve to corroborate your allegations that you are a bisexual man currently involved with another man here in Canada.\n[10] I found you to be straightforward and forthcoming. There were no inconsistencies between your testimony or contradictions with other evidence before me. You didn\u2019t appear to embellish your description of events and actions, even when it might have appeared favorable to your claim to do so. And your narrative corresponds to the ample objective country evidence about conditions in Nigeria, with respect to members of the LGBT community.\n[11] Accordingly, I have no reason to doubt the central element underpinning your claim for protection. I\u2019ve accepted that you are LGBT, as a bisexual man and that you have, yourself, experienced threats, harassment and briefly detention.\n[12] Given the foregoing, I accept that you subjectively fear persecution on that basis in Nigeria.\nNexus\n[13] I find the persecution you face has a Nexus to one of the five Convention grounds, that of membership in a particular social group, as you are a member of the LGBTI community, a bisexual man.\n[14] And therefore, I\u2019ve assessed this claim under section 96.\nWell-Founded Fear\n[15] In order to be considered a Convention refugee, you have to demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution. This includes both a subjective and an objective basis for that fear and I\u2019ve already accepted your subjected fear.\n[16] Based on your testimony, supporting documents and the country condition documents, I find you have a well-founded fear of persecution for the following reasons.\n[17] You said in your narrative that you first experimented with another boy at age 12 and then after that, you were deeply ashamed. You met and married your wife in 2005. You have three children who were born in 2005, 2006 and 2015. You have since separated with your wife. You met a man named XXXX XXXX in 2012 at a corporate event, you became close. In mid-July of 2016, you met at a hotel in Abuja, this time XXXX had booked the hotel and you were not in the corporate hotels you normally work with, which would have guaranteed your privacy. You were exposed by a room service worker who walked in and found you close together and called the manager. The manager believed the worker, who was alleging that you were having a gay affair and more people came, as they heard the arguments. You were afraid of mob violence, so you urged the manager to call the police. You were taken into custody and detained for several hours by police. You spoke with the DPO, the senior officer told them it was a mistake. You told them about your identity, your respected position in the community and at work and that you are a member of the Lagos police community relationship committee. You explained to me that these committees are very important to the police, as they raise money and assist them to find funds for various activities and machines that they need. You were able to talk the officers into releasing you, after you paid money, fairly extensive sum, worth about 300 Canadian, under the table. You later returned to the station to negotiate avoiding a court case and after that, the police occasionally returned to collect money and the guys are giving you a briefing about the case. However, after this event, rumors in the community started and led to harassment of you and your family. You don\u2019t know exactly how these rumors came about but you thought that a police officer from the station likely told someone in the close-knit community. You\u2019ve tried but were unable to locate XXXX since that time. You went to the U.S.A. in XXXX of 2016 to cool off you said, the pressure and the emotion had been too much, and you needed to go somewhere to think things over and to try to get your life together. You didn\u2019t want to go back to Nigeria, but you had your children, and you hadn\u2019t told your wife and you felt you had to go back home. Your wife and your children began to experience harassment in the community, due to the rumors about your sexuality. When your wife asked you, you initially denied that you were bisexual. You took your family to the U.S.A. in XXXX of 2017 to get away. You said that you felt like you had to tell the truth to your wife, and you put her through a lot, and you couldn\u2019t keep denying it. So, while in the U.S.A., you told her that you did have an affair with another man. You said initially she was surprised. She\u2019d known you for so many years, she didn\u2019t think you would be involved in this way and you\u2019d been denying it all along and then she was disappointed, and she felt betrayed and her heart was broken. You told her that you wanted to try and work on it but then somebody from Nigeria called and told her she\u2019d been expelled from the church because of this and then she got mad, and she said she\u2019d had enough. She took the children and returned to Nigeria. You told her that you couldn\u2019t go back with them. You said you hadn\u2019t been sleeping, you were afraid and whenever somebody phoned, you thought it was the police and you just felt that you couldn\u2019t go back. You said that she should stay in the U.S. with you, but she said no. You\u2019ve been separated since then and she\u2019s told you that she doesn\u2019t want to have anything to do with a romantic relationship with you anymore. Your passport expired in December 2018 and you\u2019d overstayed the six months allowed for your U.S. visa. Your relatives in Nigeria told friends and relatives in the U.S.A. and they were threatening to get you deported. You contacted an American lawyer, and you were told that you would have to pay 7,000 dollars U.S., which you couldn\u2019t afford in order to get status in the U.S. Fearing deportation under the Trump-era policies, you crossed into Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2018 to claim asylum. Since coming to Canada, you became actively involved first in the Montreal LGBT Centre and after moving to Toronto, the 519 LGBT Centre and in Toronto, you met XXXX in September of 2018. Initially, you and XXXX were just friends but this developed into a relationship over time and the two of you are still together as a couple, living in the same house. As I mentioned, XXXX provided an affidavit in which he corroborated the history of your relationship. You told me that XXXX works nights and you offered to wake him up if his testimony was helpful.\n[18] As I found you to be credible and as XXXX provided a credible affidavit, I did not find it necessary to wake him but appreciated that we could do so, if we needed to.\n[19] Now, in order to assess an objective basis of a well-founded fear, a claimant can rely on the treatment of similarly situated persons as well.\n[20] And I would suggest that XXXX experience in Nigeria would fit this category. He was exposed and assaulted, as you testified and ended up in the hospital. In his affidavit, XXXX says that you\u2019ve been very supportive in his journey to heal, after the trauma that he experienced in Nigeria, with regards to his bisexuality. You told me that for those who are there in Nigeria, who are of the LGBT community, it is really, really bad. You said people don\u2019t want to have anything to do with you. They say bad things about you. Family members won\u2019t have anything to do with you. You\u2019re outcast. Everybody hates you. And then you start to feel really badly about yourself. For any small thing, you could be mobbed or attacked and that you\u2019ve even seen news reports of people who were killed or lynched, just on suspicion of being LGBT.\n[21] The objective country documentation is consistent with your testimony of fearing persecution in Nigeria. Homosexuality and bisexuality are against the law. Engaging in same-sex sexual relations is illegal and can result in prison terms of up to 14 years. Furthermore, the chances of getting a fair trial, once arrested or prosecuted, are considered non-existent, this is according to NDP 6.2 and 6.7. Item 6.2 states, Nigeria is a homophobic country. There was a 2017 report on Human Rights Violations based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression in Nigeria, documenting a total of 247 victims and 210 violations. In January, the organization issued another report showing the results of a survey on social perception in LGBTI people in the country. It revealed that the vast majority of Nigerians, 91% do not believe that people are born homosexual, 83% would not be willing to accept a family member who was homosexual, 90% support the Same-Sex Marriage Prohibition Act, which is what I referred to earlier, criminalizing it, and think that Nigeria would be a better country without homosexuals and 56% say homosexuals should be denied access to public services.\n[22] Another survey at NDP 6.5 found that 55% of the LGBT responded and surveyed, had been physically or sexually attacked or threatened with violence, either at home or in the workplace in the past 10 years. The harsh laws enforced in Nigeria and its effects on the LGBT people have been widely documented. In fact, Nigeria has been cited as one of the most homophobic countries in the world. Not only due to the severity of comprehensiveness of its legislation that criminalizes same-sex relations, but also for the discriminatory and violent treatment given to LGBTI people in the form of arbitrary arrest, blackmail, physical and psychological abuse by the police and kidnapping, extortion, harassment, sexual attacks and subjected to the conversion therapies, pressure to marry and involuntary outing by family and society members.\n[23] Accordingly, I conclude that your fear of persecution in Nigeria is indeed well-founded.\nState Protection and Internal Flight Alternative\n[24] In this case, one of the agents of persecution, a major one, is the State. The persecution would face, if returned to Nigeria, is at the hands of the authorities.\n[25] Accordingly, I find there is no state protection available to you and the presumption of state presumption has been rebutted. I note that you were actually the one who asked for the police to be called, as you feared mob violence but from that point forward, there were rumors in the community, that most likely came from the police and you were mistreated, and they kept returning. So, there was always that threat hanging over you, if you didn\u2019t continue to pay those bribes.\n[26] Now, the State of Nigeria is an agent of harm and has control over all of its territories. Furthermore, as the documents have shown, the general population is another significant agent of harm and homophobic attitudes and actions are prevalent throughout Nigeria.\n[27] Therefore, I find there is no viable internal flight alternative, where you could safely relocate in Nigeria.\nCONCLUSION\n[28] You have established a well-founded fear, there is no adequate state protection and no viable internal flight alternative, therefore, I conclude that you face a serious possibility of persecution, if returned to Nigeria, on the basis of your membership in a particular social group, as an LGBTI individual.\n[29] Based on the totality of the evidence, I conclude you are a Convention refugee.\n[30] Accordingly, I\u2019m accepting your claim.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2021 RLLR 68\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: June 9, 2021\nPanel: Kerry Cundal\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Albert Chiu\nCountry: Cameroon\nRPD Number: VB9-10003\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2022-01594\nATIP Pages: N\/A\nREASONS FOR DECISION\nINTRODUCTION\n[1] This is the decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) in the claim of XXXX XXXX XXXX as a citizen of Cameroon who is claiming refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (the \u201cAct\u201d)1.\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] The claimant fears returning to Cameroon because he fears persecution due to his sexual orientation. The claimant left Cameroon in XXXX 2011 and entered Canada with a study visa. The claimant provided further details in his Basis of Claim2 (BOC) form, some of which are highlighted in this decision. The panel has reviewed and applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9: Proceedings before the IRB Involving Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression in this decision.3 In particular, the panel is mindful of the socio-cultural context of a sexual minority who has lived in a country where same-sex activities are criminalized, and societal violence continues today against sexual minorities in Cameroon.\nDETERMINATION\n[3] The panel finds that the claimant has established that he is a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the Act for the reasons that follow.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[4] The panel finds that the claimant\u2019s identity has been established on a balance of probabilities by a copy of his Cameroonian passport.4\nCredibility, Well-Founded Fear of Persecution and Risk of Harm\n[5] The claimant testified in a straightforward manner consistent with his supporting documents. Accordingly, the panel finds that he is a credible witness. The claimant submitted corroborative documents including identity documents, education documents, supporting letters and photos with same-sex partners and photos of injuries he suffered due to a homophobic attack he suffered in Cameroon before he left for Canada.5 The claimant provided detailed testimony regarding his first same-sex intimate experience with XXXX in junior high school. He also provided detailed and consistent testimony regarding the attack against him and XXXX and the subsequent detention for two days by the police. He testified that he fears that he will be put in jail, suffer further mistreatment, or be killed if he returns to Cameroon. He testified that he had to be very careful in Cameroon about hiding his sexual orientation as even family members of sexual minorities may face abuse. He testified that he had a student visa to come to Canada and then he subsequently had a post-secondary work permit after he graduated from the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX He testified that he has never visited Cameroon since he left in 2011 and over the years, he has become more open about his sexual orientation in Canada. He provided detailed testimony regarding same-sex relationships he has had in Canada. He testified that he works in XXXX XXXX XXXX and travels to Fort McMurray, Alberta for work. He testified that he still keeps a low profile about his sexual orientation at work. He testified that he has family in Quebec, but he chose to come to Edmonton because he is still uncomfortable around people from his Cameroonian community in Canada and their mentality against sexual minorities.\n[6] The SOGIE guidelines at section 8.5.11.1 indicate: An individual with diverse SOGIE may reasonably delay making a claim for refugee protection based on SOGIE out of a fear of reprisal for themselves or family members. A reasonable delay may also arise out of an individual\u2019s reluctance to reveal their SOGIE to a spouse or other family member, or in their realizing or accepting their SOGIE.6 When the panel asked the claimant about his delay in making in a refugee claim in Canada, he explained that he was stressed about his situation in Cameroon given the attack and detention he suffered before he left Cameroon. He testified that he had a study visa and then a post-secondary work permit and was able to stay in status in Canada. He testified that through friends who are also sexual minorities he learned more about the refugee process and he was also able to gain support through the Mennonite Newcomers Centre and the Edmonton Pride organization. He testified that while he was studying at the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX he saw more and more examples of support, including events for sexual minorities on campus.\n[7] When the claimant was asked how he identifies his sexual orientation, he testified that he is bisexual, and he prefers sex with men. The SOGIE guidelines indicates at section 2.6: There is no standard terminology that adequately captures the diversity within and between the evolving concepts of sexual orientation and gender identity and expression across cultures and societies7. Further, section 3.1 states: Depending on factors such as race, ethnicity, religion, faith or belief system, age, disability, health status, social class and education, individuals with diverse SOGIE recognize and act on their SOGIE differently. An individual\u2019s self-awareness and self-acceptance of their SOGIE may present as a gradual or non-linear process. There is no standard set of criteria that can be relied upon to establish an individual\u2019s identification as an individual with diverse SOGIE.8\n[8] The objective evidence supports the claimant\u2019s fear of returning to Cameroon and indicates that section 347 of the penal code in Cameroon criminalizes same-sex activities and provides up to five years in prison for sexual activity with a same-sex partner.9 Further, the objective evidence indicates that authorities arbitrarily arrest and abuse sexual minorities in Cameroon.10 The evidence indicates that homophobia is pervasive in Cameroon and there are daily attacks on sexual minorities including harassment, assaults, extortion and murders.11\n[9] Based on the totality of the evidence, the panel finds that the claimant has established a nexus to a Convention ground, namely membership in a particular social group as a sexual minority. Further, the panel finds that the claimant faces a serious possibility of persecution if he returns to Cameroon. Given that the claimant faces a forward-looking serious possibility of persecution in Cameroon due his sexual orientation and the application of the SOGIE guidelines, the panel finds that the claimant\u2019s delay in making a refugee claim does not undermine his subjective fear or his credibility.\nState Protection and Internal Flight Alternative (IFA)\n[10] Given that the state is an agent of harm in this case and the criminalization of same-sex activities, the panel finds that there is no state protection for the claimant in Cameroon in his particular circumstances as a bisexual man who prefers men to women. Furthermore, given that the state is the agent of harm and the criminalization of same-sex activities applies throughout the country, the panel finds that it is neither safe nor objectively reasonable in all of the circumstances, including the claimant\u2019s particular circumstances for him to relocate anywhere in Cameroon. Accordingly, the panel finds that there is no viable internal flight alternative.\nCONCLUSION\n[11] For the forgoing reasons the panel finds that the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the Act and the Board therefore accepts his claim.\n(signed) Kerry Cundal\nJune 9, 2021\n_______________________________________\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act,S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n2 Exhibit 2.\n3 Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (IRB) Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9: Proceedings before the IRB Involving Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression (SOGIE), Ottawa, Canada, May 1, 2017.\n4 Exhibit 1.\n5 Exhibits 4 to 10.\n6 Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (IRB) Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9: Proceedings before the IRB Involving Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression (SOGIE), Ottawa, Canada, May 1, 2017.\n7 Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (IRB) Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9: Proceedings before the IRB Involving Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression (SOGIE), Ottawa, Canada, May 1, 2017.\n8 Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (IRB) Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9: Proceedings before the IRB Involving Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression (SOGIE), Ottawa, Canada, May 1, 2017.\n9 Exhibit 3, National Documentation Package, (NDP), Cameroon, May 31, 2021, Item 6.1, Response to Information Request, CMR200309.FE.\n10 Exhibit 3, National Documentation Package, (NDP), Cameroon, May 31, 2021, Item 6.1, Response to Information Request, CMR200309.FE.\n11 Exhibit 3, National Documentation Package, (NDP), Cameroon, May 31, 2021, Item 6.1, Response to Information Request, CMR200309.FE.\n",

My assessment was based on your testimony, as it relates to your sexual orientation and your past same-sex relationships.\n[14] I found you to be a generally credible witness.\n[15] There were some inconsistencies, which I considered peripheral and they do not go to the heart of the claim and they obviously do not overcome your otherwise credible testimony today.\n[16] So I don\u2019t draw any negative inferences from those inconsistencies.\n[17] You testified how you came to realization as a bisexual, when you were 15, about your attraction towards women and how you identify as bisexual. However, you find women are more attractive for you than the man.\n[18] I\u2019ve put a lot of weight into your testimony about your relationships in Nigeria, in particular your first same-sex partner, XXXX (ph). You detailed today how you lost touch with her when she moved to Kano State.\n[19] You detailed also about your second and most lengthy relationship with XXXX (ph), who you met in XXXX and you were together for 13 years, both living in Lagos State.\n[20] You indicated that even though your family knew about XXXX, they all considered her to be your best friend rather than \u2014 nobody knew about your relationship, romantic relationship.\n[21] However, you and XXXX had to break up your relationship in 2018, when she was pressured into marriage and she moved to Abuja. She simply stopped answering your calls, as per your testimony today.\n[22] At that time, you started dating a man and due to constant pressure from your family, you also decided to get married. Your marriage was planned for February 1st, 2020. You started having second thoughts.\n[23] You decided to go to Canada, see your brother and do some wedding shopping in XXXX 2019. While in Canada, you made up your mind that you would not be happy with a man and your true identity would come out eventually. Moreover, you wanted to be happy and free and live the life in Canada as a free woman.\n[24] You talked to your mother. She was disappointed in you and she cried a lot, as per your testimony.\n[25] And you also had a talk with your ex-fianc\u00e9, who went as far as threaten you with death, if you returned.\n[26] Your brother advised you to seek refugee protection in Canada, which you did but the application process was delayed due to the pandemic.\n[27] At the start of the hearing, you also indicated that you had a relationship in Canada with XXXX (ph), who you met in shelter. Your friend, XXXX (ph), introduced you to her. You became good friends. You dated but XXXX didn\u2019t want to commit to a serious relationship. In 2021, she moved to Montreal. You missed her a lot so you decided to go visit her in Montreal in October this year and tell her about your love, hoping that she would reconsider. However, it did not happen. You returned to Toronto heartbroken. Since then, you tried calling XXXX but she would not pick up your calls.\n[28] At the hearing, I asked if it was okay to call XXXX and ask her about you and XXXX. You provided XXXX phone number. She agreed to be on the record. XXXX testified that she introduced XXXX to you. That you asked XXXX to help ask XXXX out but she wouldn\u2019t interfere. XXXX also testified that she knows you two (2) dated but doesn\u2019t know about your current relationship because she hasn\u2019t talked to XXXX in a while and XXXX who now lives in Montreal.\n[29] I find that testimony really corroborated and really helped to further \u2014 really helped with increasing your credibility and so I discarded those minor inconsistencies and omissions that were noted throughout your testimony, thanks to my talk with XXXX.\n[30] You also indicated that in Canada, you belong to LGBTQ societies, such as MCC and 519. You find them to be helpful.\n[31] You\u2019re still in love with XXXX. You\u2019re hoping she would still come around.\n[32] Unfortunately, you\u2019re not on good terms with your brother, as his wife is not supportive of you. So since you moved out, you have not talked to him. Hopefully that will change in the future.\n[33] In support of your allegations, you presented documentary evidence in Exhibit 5, 6, 7 and 8.\n[34] In particular, I see here a XXXX XXXX, this speaks to past trauma and your current vulnerable state of mind; letters from your mother and your sister; letters from MCC and 519 about your membership and attendance; screenshots of your communication via WhatsApp with XXXX, your same-sex partner in Canada. There\u2019s also a copy of your wedding invitation; photos with your fianc\u00e9 in Nigeria, as well as photos of you with your same-sex partners in Nigeria.\n[35] I gave the documents lots of weight. They corroborate your written and oral testimony.\n[36] I find, on a balance of probabilities, you are a credible witness. I\u2019m satisfied you would face persecution at the hands of the Nigerian authorities and general public, for being involved in a same-sex relationship.\n[37] I find you have established your subjective fear.\n[38] The overall objective evidence supports your claim for Convention refugee protection based on membership in a particular social group, namely sexual orientation as a bisexual woman.\n[39] According to NDP on Nigeria in Exhibit 3, in particular Item 2.1, the Nigerian government commits significant human rights issues, including unlawful and arbitrary killings, extrajudicial killings, forced disappearances, torture, arbitrary detention, substantial interference with rights of peaceful assembly and freedom of association, in particular for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex LGBTQ persons.\n[40] Item 2.8 further states that Nigerian law criminalizes same-sex conduct, as well as public show of same-sex amorous relationships, same-sex marriages and the registration of clubs, societies and organizations that support LGBTQ.\n[41] The Same-Sex Prohibition law effectively renders illegal all forms of activities supporting or promoting LGBTQ rights. According to this law, anyone convicted of entering into a same-sex marriage or civil union, may be sentenced for up to 14 years of imprisonment. Following passage of this law, LGBTQ persons reported increased harassments, threat against them based on their perceived sexual orientation or gender identity. News reports on LGBT advocates report numerous arrests.\n[42] According to Human Rights Watch, the law had become a tool used by police and members of the public to legitimize human rights violation against LGBTQ persons such as torture, sexual violence, arbitrary detention, extortion, violations of due process rights.\n[43] With respect to societal treatment, Item 6.2 renders that Nigeria has been cited as one (1) of the most homophobic countries in the world, not only due to the severe incomprehensiveness of its legislation, that criminalizes same-sex but also for discriminatory and violent treatment of LGBTQ people in the form of blackmailing, physical, psychological abuse by authorities and the public, kidnappings, extortion, harassment, sexual attack subject to conversion therapies. Pressures to marry and involuntary outing by family and society members.\n[44] I also note that under the SOGIE Guideline section 5.11, being compelled to conceal one (1) SOGIE identity, constitutes a serious interference with fundamental human rights, that may therefore amount to persecution, when a claimant cannot be expected to conceal their sexual identity as a way to avoid persecution in their country of reference.\n[45] You have testified today to this extent citing that while in Nigeria, you had to conceal and keep secret your sexual orientation, as a bisexual woman.\n[46] In summary, I\u2019m satisfied that based on your identity, as a bisexual woman, there\u2019s a serious possibility you would be subjected to hate crime, mob violence, imprisonment, torture and even death.\n[47] Based on all the evidence before me, I find you have established a well-founded fear of persecution, on account of your identity, as a bisexual woman in Nigeria. You fear police, authorities, Nigerian community, as same-sex relationship is criminalized in Nigeria.\n[48] I find it would be objectively unreasonable for you to seek protection of the authorities in Nigeria, in your particular circumstances.\n[49] So adequate state protection is not available for you, as you fear the State.\n[50] A viable internal flight alternative is also not available for you because the federal laws of Nigeria, criminalizing same-sex relationships, are applicable throughout the country.\n[51] So a viable internal flight alternative does not exist for you in your particular circumstances.\n[52] Having considered all of the evidence, I find there is a serious possibility you would face persecution in Nigeria pursuant to section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[53] I find you to be a Convention refugee.\n[54] Your claim is accepted.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

You\u2019re a citizen of Ghana. You\u2019re a bisexual man who was introduced to same sex relationships by your uncle when you were 15-years old. You had to live your entire adult life in Ghana concealing your true feelings and identity for fear of ostracism and violence should you live openly.\n[7] In April 2019, you were caught with your same sex partner, attacked by a mob, and had to go into hiding before fleeing the country.\n[8] You allege that as a bisexual man, if you return to Ghana, you will face persecution from State police and security agencies and\/or from members of the community.\n[9] You allege further that there is no State protection for you nor is there any internal flight alternative.\nNexus to Section 96 or Section 97:\n[10] I find that there is a link between what you fear and one of the five Convention grounds, specifically your membership of a particular social group as a bisexual man. Therefore, this claim has been assessed under Section 96.\nIdentity:\n[11] Your personal identity as a citizen of Ghana has been established by your testimony and the supporting documents filed in the exhibits, including a certified true copy of a Ghanian passport with a Canadian TRV. I therefore find, on a balance of probabilities, that identity and country of nationality have been established.\nCredibility:\n[12] In terms of your general credibility I found you to be a credible witness, and I therefore accept, on balance of probabilities, what you\u2019ve alleged in your oral testimony and in your Basis of Claim Form.\n[13] Your testimony and evidence are presumed to be true.\n[14] In support of your claim you provided documents in Exhibit Number 5 confirming the attack against you because of your same sex relationship. You also submitted a XXXX XXXX confirming a diagnosis of XXXX because of the attack against you and the strain of having to conceal your sexual orientation in Ghana for so many years. The panel finds these documents to be credible and persuasive, on a balance of probabilities.\n[15] Your testimony about your relationship with your former partners was detailed, straightforward, seemingly unrehearsed and unexaggerated, responsive to questioning and was in keeping with your Basis of Claim Form, and there were no significant inconsistencies or omissions.\n[16] Your testimony about how you felt in Ghana as a consequence of having to live your life concealing your true identity for the safety, and the contrast of that life with your life in Canada where you finally feel secure was also detailed and convincing and seemingly unexaggerated.\n[17] I therefore believe what you\u2019ve alleged in support of your claim, and I find the following to be credible. That, on a balance of probabilities, you are a bisexual man from Ghana.\nPersecution Risk:\n[18] The objective documentation supports your allegations that individuals in your circumstance face persecution.\n[19] Ghanian law penal code Sections 104(1)(b) of the 1960 Criminal Offences Act criminalizes sexual acts between mutually consenting people of the same sex. Senior Government Ministers and religious leaders have engaged in openly hostile rhetoric against the practice of and the legalization of same sex behaviour. NDP 6.6 pages 18 to 21.\n[20] Rather than protecting LGBT victims of crime, Ghanian police sometimes either threaten with arrest or arrest LGBT victims of crime themselves when they attempt to report crimes to them. NDP 6.6 page 25.\n[21] Homophobic views are widespread in society. LGBT persons are not only not accepted, they are often believed to be or accused of being an intrusion western values into Ghanian society. Leaders have referred to homosexual acts as abominable acts and sins against the world. NDP Item 6.6, Item 6.1(9) at page 28.\n[22] LGBTQ persons also face police harassment and extortion attempts. NDP Item 2.1.2(0) page 24.\n[23] Therefore, I find that there is a serious possibility you could face arrest, imprisonment, or serious physical harm from the authorities or members of the community should you return to Ghana.\n[24] Based on the evidence, you\u2019ve established an objective basis for your subjective fear. Therefore, I find that you have a well-founded fear of persecution.\nState Protection:\n[25] I find that adequate State protection would not be available to you were you to seek it in Ghana.\n[26] The objective documentary evidence indicates that homosexuality is criminalized throughout Ghana. The authorities often do not provide adequate protection or access to justice to victims of crime with diverse SOGIE, and the police themselves are often violators of the rights of LGBT citizens.\n[27] In light of the above country documentation, I find that the claimant has rebutted the presumption of State protection. Based on your personal circumstances, fearing persecution from the police and community, as well as the objective country documentation, I find that adequate State protection would not be available to you in Ghana.\nInternal Flight Alternative:\n[28] I\u2019ve also considered whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for you.\n[29] The country documentation indicates that the situation for individuals in circumstances such as yours is the same throughout the country, and that you would face a serious possibility of persecution or risk to life anywhere in Ghana should you live openly as a bisexual man, which is your fundamental right. As such, I find there is no viable internal flight alternative for you in Ghana.\nCONCLUSION:\n[30] Based on the totality of the evidence, I find the claimant to be a Convention refugee as he faces a serious possibility of persecution because of his membership of a particular social group as a bisexual man. Your claim is therefore accepted.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

You allege that you have been charged with crimes relating to a workshop that you attended that was organized by an LGBT group in Uganda.\nDECISION\n[9] I find that you are a refugee, pursuant to Section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, as there exists a serious possibility of persecution should you return to Uganda on account of your membership in a particular social group, which is as a gay man.\nIdentity\n[10] I find that your identity as a national of Uganda is established by the documents provided, primarily the certified copy of the passport, as well as your Ugandan identity card and driver\u2019s licence, which are given in Exhibits 1 and 4.\nCredibility\n[11] I find you to be a credible witness and therefore believe what you have alleged in support of your claim.\n[12] You testified in a straightforward and direct manner and there were no relevant inconsistencies in your testimony or contradictions between your testimony and the other evidence before me. You testified credibly regarding your same-sex relationships that you had been in, including providing details of the relationship genesis and how they grew, as well as how you kept these mostly hidden from the public.\n[13] You explained and provided details with your interactions with LGBT organizations in Uganda, including the GALA Initiative and Sexual Minorities Uganda, also referred to as SMUG.\n[14] In regard to the event precipitating your departure from Uganda, you testified that you were participating in an LGBTQ workshop hosted by GALA when you were attacked by several men after you departed. When you tried to go to the police to inform them of the incident and for protection, they counter-accused you of unlawful assembly and continued to harass, target, and threaten you after this incident, as well as you allege that you were harassed, targeted, and threatened by others in the homophobic community after this knowledge of your participation in this event came out. After speaking with a SMUG safety protection officer, you were advised to leave the country for your own safety, at which time you prepared your visa application for Canada.\n[15] I note that you were forthright about being in two relationships with women in Uganda, and that you have two children born of these. You stated that you were pressured by family to enter into these relationships, and that you maintained your long-term same-sex relationship with XXXX while you were engaged to XXXX. You explained that you were never interested in the relationships with women, and that it was only to appease your family that you entered into them.\n[16] I accept this explanation. It is reasonable. And I therefore do not hold any negative credibility inference regarding your sexual orientation because of these relationships.\n[17] Overall, apart from that, your testimony was internally consistent and was in line with the objective evidence. I do note you have provided documentary evidence to corroboration the allegations of this claim, and after reviewing the documents you have provided, I have no reasons to doubt their authenticity.\n[18] In particular you have provided an affidavit from your ex-partner, XXXX, along with photographs of the two of you together. You testified there were many years between the two photographs and it appears to be so based on the general aging of the both of you. You have also given letters of support from GALA Initiative and SMUG \u2013 Sexual Minorities Uganda, indicating your participation in their events and activities, as well as their knowledge of your sexual orientation and the targeting that you faced.\n[19] You have given the release on bond from the police after your arrest to corroborate your arrest. As well as a letter of support from friends in Canada attesting to their knowledge of your sexual orientation and your participation with LGBTQ organizations, as well as a letter of support from your current same-sex partner.\n[20] I therefore find on a balance of probabilities that you are a gay man that has been in same-sex relationships in Uganda and in Canada, that you have been targeted for your work with LGBTQ organizations in Uganda, and that your subjective fear is established.\nObjective Basis\n[21] Given that there are no serious credibility issues with respect to your allegations, coupled with the documentary evidence set out below, I find that you have established a prospective risk and a well-founded fear of persecution in Uganda.\n[22] This risk is corroborated by the National Documentation Package for Uganda in the April 16th version in Exhibit 3. Item 2.1 of the NDP states that consensual same-sex sexual conduct is criminalized, according to a colonial era law that criminalizes \u201ccarnal knowledge of any person against the order of nature\u201d. This provides for a penalty of up to life imprisonment. Attempts to \u201ccommit unnatural offences\u201d as laid out in law are punishable with seven years of imprisonment, and the government of Uganda does enforce these laws. Although the law does not restrict freedom of expression or peaceful assembly for those speaking out in support of the human rights of LGBTI persons, the government does severely restrict such right. Further, the law does not prohibit discrimination against LGBTI persons in areas such as housing, employment, nationality laws, or access to government services.\n[23] Item 6.1 states that authorities typically consider merely being a homosexual as a breach of the sodomy laws, and simply violating social norms can create a presumption of sodomy. Historically, some officials have had a much broader understanding of the \u201cunnatural acts\u201d than the courts have actually defined, and this has been used to justify harassment, arrests, and incarceration of sexual minorities, regardless of whether they have engaged in illegal sexual acts or not. And, further to this, Ugandan authorities typically identify homosexuality itself as a breach of the law, regardless of an individual\u2019s sexual practices.\n[24] 6.2 notes that the homophobic views are widespread in Ugandan society and are openly promoted in government and in religious areas.\n[25] I therefore find the objective basis for this claim has been established.\nNature of the Harm\n[26] I have considered your claim under Section 96 of IRPA as I conclude the risk you describe constitutes persecution based on at least one of the grounds in Section 96, specifically membership in a particular social group as a gay man. I find you are at risk of harassment, discrimination, arrest, physical harm, and imprisonment for your sexuality, as well as an inability to live freely as a sexual minority.\nState Protection\n[27] I find that it would be objectively unreasonably for you to seek the protection of the state in light of your circumstances, as the agent of persecution is the state. Homosexuality, as noted above, is criminalized throughout Uganda. Additionally, the country evidence indicates that authorities do not provide adequate protection or access to justice to victims of crimes who are LGBTQ and police themselves are often seen as principal violators of rights against this community.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[28] I have examined whether a viable Internal Flight Alternative exists for you. Based on the evidence on file, I find that you face a serious possibility of persecution throughout the entirety of Uganda. Again, the laws condemning same-sex acts and relationships are consistent throughout the country and there is no part of Uganda where you would not face persecution or where you would be able to live freely. I therefore find there is no Internal Flight Alternative available to you.\nCONCLUSION\n[29] In light of the preceding, I conclude that you are a refugee pursuant to Section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act and accordingly I accept your claim.\n[30] COUNSEL: Thank you very much, Madam.\n[31] CLAIMANT: Thank you very much, Madam Member.\n[32] MEMBER: You are very welcome. Thank you, Madam Interpreter for being available and being patient here today. It is appreciated. Thank you, Counsel. And Mr. XXXX, I wish the best for your future.\n[33] CLAIMANT: Thank you very much, Madam Member.\n[34] MEMBER: And have a great day, everyone.\n[35] INTERPRETER: Thank you.\n[36] CLAIMANT: I thank you.\n[37] MEMBER: Bye.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

File number TC0-03936. Hearing date is December 16, 2021. My name is Warren Chin, and I have considered your testimony and the other evidence in this case and I am ready to render my decision orally. The claimant is claiming to be a citizen of Pakistan and is claiming refugee protection pursuant to Section 96 and subsection 97.1 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nDETERMINATION\n[2] I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee on the grounds of his sexual orientation. Considering there is a nexus between what he fears and Section 96, namely on the grounds of his inclusion in a particular social group, I have assessed his claim under Section 96.\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] The claimant\u2019s allegations are found in his Basis of Claim form, which are found in Exhibit 2. In summary, the claimant alleges persecution from extremist groups, members of his external family, and the police due to his sexual orientation as a gay man.\n[4] The claimant alleges that he was married as arranged by his family due to increasing pressure from them. The claimant alleges that he had an affair with his same sex partner which stemmed from 2004 in the UAE, which continued after his wife and his family returned to Pakistan in 2017.\n[5] The claimant alleges after he returned to Pakistan on or about XXXX of 2019, he reunited with some former same sex partners, XXXX and XXXX, where they engaged in intimate acts. The claimant was caught by XXXX father and the altercation was overheard by members of the community. The claimant later learned that a Fatwah had been issued ordering the claimant to be killed for indecent acts contrary to Islam, and that he would be sought and killed by his family as well as the police.\n[6] The claimant\u2019s family subsequently went into hiding in Lahore. The claimant decided to flee to the United States and did so in XXXX of 2019. He went to Dubai to wind up his business and transited through Pakistan where he stayed for two days and then went to the United States. In July of 2019, the claimant learned that Muslim extremists had visited the home of XXXX, and harmed XXXX parents.\n[7] The claimant arrived in Canada in XXXX of 2020 and made a claim shortly thereafter. The claimant alleges that he will be harmed or killed anywhere throughout Pakistan and he will not be protected.\nIDENTITY\n[8] The claimant\u2019s identity has been established on a balance of probabilities as a national of Pakistan by his testimony and the supporting documents, namely the certified copies of his passport and national ID card, which are found in Exhibit 4.\nCREDIBILITY\n[9] I do find this claimant to be an overall credible witness and I therefore believe what he has alleged in support of his claim. He testified in a straightforward manner. He spoke naturally and didn\u2019t embellish his story. He gave spontaneous details and there were no relevant inconsistencies in his testimony, or contradictions between his testimony and the documentary evidence before me which have not been explained in a satisfactory manner.\n[10] In support of his claim he provided a copy of the Fatwah and an affidavit from his same sex partner XXXX, as well as affidavits from the claimant\u2019s spouse and another close friend. After review of these documents I find that they are materially conformed to the claimant\u2019s allegations.\n[11] After coming to Canada the claimant had three same sex relationships which were causal in nature. In support of his activities in Canada, the claimant disclosed photographs of the claimant attending night clubs and photographs of the individuals who he claims to have had relationships with. He also disclosed letters from the executive director of the 519, and also a coordinator, as well as several donation slips. That can be found in Exhibit 8. I find that these documents also conform to the claimant\u2019s allegations in respect of his sexual orientation, and that the same sex activity continues to the current date.\n[12] I did have concerns with the claimant\u2019s national ID card indicating an address in Lahore which was before the precipitating event which caused the claimant and his family to go into hiding of June 2019. The claimant explained that he used his in-laws address who had a home in Lahore in order to prevent the inconvenience of having to change it from the Pakistani embassy in Dubai. I accept this explanation as reasonable.\n[13] I also had concerns about the claimant having seemingly reavailed himself of the protection of Pakistan after returning to Pakistan in XXXX of 2019 before travelling to the United States in XXXX of 2019. The claimant explained that his daughter was sick and during counsel\u2019s questioning on this matter, the claimant explained that he had intentions to stay in the United States to possibly make a claim which the claimant understood to be a long-term endeavour. I accept that the claimant being a father would take a risk to see his children one last time before permanently relocating to another country despite the threats made against him.\n[14] On the basis of the documentary evidence combined with the claimant\u2019s testimony, I accept the claimant\u2019s allegations as set out in his Basis of Claim form. In particular, I find that the claimant is a homosexual male who has a Fatwah ordering in the claimant\u2019s name, which would subject him to serious harm or persecution if he were to be discovered in Pakistan on account of his sexual orientation.\nOBJECTIVE BASIS\n[15] I also find that the objective country condition evidence supports the claimant\u2019s allegations. The objective evidence indicates that it\u2019s not uncommon for Pakistani men to live a dual life.\n[16] The objective evidence states that most gay men spend their life in guilt carrying a burden of sins. In their society they only have two options. One is to come out of the closet and live a horrible life in being bullied, and the other is to conceal their sexuality for the rest of their lives and people usually choose the second option. They get married. They start a dual life. One for family and society, and the other for their own satisfaction.\n[17] While sex between males is common, homosexual identity is not. So strong and widespread cultural, religious, and sexual intolerance of homosexuality means that it is not widely discussed or acknowledge in Pakistan. This is consistent with the claimant\u2019s testimony in respect of his dual life, and in my view is a valid reason for his heterosexual marriage in 2008 in Pakistan.\n[18] I also note that the objective evidence indicates that there are state sanctions against homosexuality in Pakistan. The objective evidence indicates that the Pakistan Penal Code does not specifically refer to homosexuality but deals with this in its\u2019 description or definition of actions that go against the natural order, specifically Section 377 states that whoever voluntarily has carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any man, woman, or animal, shall be punished with imprisonment for life, or with imprisonment of not less than two years and not more than ten years and shall also be liable for a fine. This definition is usually read as prohibiting non-heterosexual sexual activity. There are also grave consequences in Sharia law that\u2019s evidenced by the objective evidence before me.\n[19] Regarding the punishment for homosexuality, there is consensus among leading Sunni schools of thought, and most Islamic scholars that homosexual acts are a major sin and may be punishable by death. The IRB has noted in its\u2019 report covering events between 2017 and 2019 indicate that according to sources, under Sharia law, homosexuals face the death penalty in Pakistan.\n[20] The objective evidence goes on to state that Islamic scholars who consider that the punishment of homosexuality is the death sentence and that married men who are offenders face a mandatory death sentence as opposed to unmarried men who would be subjected to floggings. This information can be found in Exhibit 3, item 6.8 and paragraph 3.3 to 3.4, and paragraphs 5.2. I find that the claimant\u2019s subjective fears has an objective basis.\nSTATE PROTECTION\n[21] The claimant\u2019s agent of persecution is the state and general society and the objective evidence indicates that most hate crimes against the LGBTQ people in Pakistan often go unreported or are out of the public spotlight. It also indicates that where gay men or lesbians are murdered, the family doesn\u2019t often report the motive of the crime in order to not dishonour the family or they simply state that it was an honour killing or a suicide.\n[22] USIDHR report dated 2018 notes that crimes against the LGBTQ community often go unreported and that police generally take little action when they do receive reports. During the recent years there have been reported cases of individuals who are arrested for crimes against members of sexual minorities.\n[23] The objective evidence similarly states that regarding the obstacles for sexual and gender minorities to report incidents to the police, it states that having ones\u2019 sexual orientation or gender identity revealed might increase risks and threats to the safety and the life of the individual.\n[24] At a state level the Pakistani government has been vocal at the international level being vocal about the human rights council and various UN meetings in respect of its\u2019 refusal to embrace SOGI in respect of various human rights claims. Given the objective evidence noted above, I find it objectively unreasonable for the claimant to seek out any state protection and that state protection cannot be seen as being reasonably forthcoming, therefore I find the presumption of state protection is rebutted in this instance.\nINTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE\n[25] Given that the claimant\u2019s agent of persecution is the state and in consideration of the objective evidence as stated above, I find that the claimant has established on a balance of probabilities that he would not be safe throughout Pakistan if he were forced to return. The first prong of the Internal Flight Alternative analysis is not met, and therefore an Internal Flight Alternative is not available to this claimant.\nCONCLUSION\n[26] I therefore find on a balance of probabilities that the claimant would face a serious possibility of persecution if returned to Pakistan on account of his sexual orientation, and therefore on the basis of the totality of the evidence I accept the claimant\u2019s claim pursuant to Section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. I find that he is a Convention refugee. Sir, your claim is accepted.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

In summary, you both allege persecution at the hands of the homophobic community in the Bahamas for your sexual orientation as gay men. You also allege to be in a common law same-sex relationship with one (1) another for approximately three (3) and a half years.\nDECISION\n[5] I find that you are refugees pursuant to Section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act as there exists a serious possibility of persecution should you return to the Bahamas on account of your membership in a particular social group as gay men. My reasons are as follows.\nIdentity\n[6] I find that your identities as nationals of the Bahamas is established by the documents provided. In particular, the certified copies of the passports and national identity cards in Exhibit 1. I also note that for the principal claimant, the USA biometrics showed variations of your name, which appear to be spelling errors and as you explained, you have no knowledge of why this would be inputted incorrectly. I also note the current passport does show stamps that match these dates with the fingerprints. In the other biodata, input is correct. It matches the passport and birth certificate. I also note the birth certificate shows your parents\u2019 name and birthdate. And so, I accepted the principal claimant, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX identity as it is given in the passport.\nSubjective Fear\n[7] I note that neither claimant sought asylum after travelling to the United States. As the principal claimant explains, your trips to the USA were primarily for work supply trips for your job. Both claimants, you have stated that you were unaware of the ability to claim in the United States was even an option to you. Again, I accept this explanation in your circumstances and therefore, it does not raise significant concerns with respect to subjective fear or credibility.\nCredibility\n[8] I find you both to be credible and in particular, when considering the evidence, you have submitted to corroborate your allegations, I do find that, on a balance of probabilities, you are both gay men in a genuine same-sex relationship. To corroborate your allegations, you have provided significant documentation, and this includes a number of letters of support from both of you, from friends of both claimants, the principal claimant\u2019s brother, as well, and these letters attest to the author\u2019s knowledge of your sexual orientations and of your genuine relationship with one (1) another. You have also provided a number of screenshots of text message correspondence between you both, which indicates an authentic and ongoing relationship. And this is further corroborated by evidence of email transfers, which indicates the financial interdependence of your relationship. You have also given photographs of the both of you in the Bahamas, on vacation and in Canada and these are dated, labelled and take place over the course of several years of your relationship and they do appear to also show a natural and comfortable relationship with one (1) another. I therefore find that your subjective fear is established.\nObjective Basis\n[9] Given that there are no serious credibility issues with respect to your allegations coupled with the documentary evidence set out below, I find that you have established a prospective risk and a well-founded fear of persecution in the Bahamas. The risk is corroborated by the National Documentation Package, the NDP for the Bahamas, the April 30th, 2020, version given in Exhibit 3.\n[10] Item 6.1 of the NDP indicates that,\n[As Read] The Bahamas shares the same strong anti-gay attitudes as other Caribbean islands and that homophobia has permeated throughout cultural attitudes and is expressed in religion and in music.\nIn the British Caribbean, hypermasculinity is valued and openly gay men are seen as betraying manhood and it is culturally acceptable to exert physical violence against men who betray these gender norms. This also includes physical and psychological attacks and killings.\nSources further indicate that members of the LGBTQ community are generally afraid to be open about their sexual orientation or their gender identity in the Bahamas and are unable to live out freely.\nMembers of the LGBTQ community are often perceived as having a \u201cnefarious international agenda\u201d in order to spread homosexuality and are marginalized from employment and other social and civic spaces.\n[11] Item 2.1 indicates that, the Bahamian constitution does not include protection against discrimination based on sexual orientation. I, therefore, find on a balance of probabilities that the objective fear is also established.\nNature of the Harm\n[12] I have examined your claim under Section 96 of IRPA as I conclude that the risk you describe constitutes persecution based on at least one (1) of the grounds in Section 96. In this case, for your membership in a particular social group as gay men and in particular, in a same-sex relationship.\n[13] So, the risk you face is of being subjected to social abuse, discrimination, and inability to live freely. As well as mistreatment and violence at the hands of the homophobic community in the Bahamas.\nState Protection\n[14] I find there is clear and convincing evidence before me that the state is unable or unwilling to provide you with adequate protection. As you stated in your narratives, you had made attempts to seek the protection from police and that these were not followed up with by authorities, and there was no positive outcome.\n[15] This is corroborated by the NDP as well. Item 6.1 states that,\n[As Read] While homosexuality itself was decriminalized in the Bahamas in 1991, there continues to be a significant stigma against homosexuality that persists.\nThere is no official mechanism to document and monitor human rights violations against the LGBTQ community and there is no recourse available to victims of discrimination, based on sexual orientation.\nAuthorities in the Bahamas have not developed policies to counteract homophobia and across the region, there is a major problem of crimes against the LGBTQ community, remaining unsolved.\n[16] The evidence indicates that this lack of resolution to solve these crimes is due to either discrimination or incompetence or a general apathy in the police force. Further, crimes that are investigated face difficulties as the community itself and at times, friends and families of victims do not provide sufficient information to resolve matters.\n[17] Item 1 also indicates that in the judiciary, there is a pattern of believing the person to be straight over the person perceived to be LGBTQ, and in cases of murder of LGBTQ persons, the accused often goes without conviction and uses a penal code justification of force against a person in situations of extreme necessity, which includes forcible unnatural crime. And this causes the statute to be used to discriminate against LGBTQ people and to justify killings in response to alleged advances. I, therefore, find the presumption of state protection, in this case, is rebutted.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[18] I have examined whether a viable internal flight exists for you. Based on the evidence on file, I find that you both face a serious possibility of persecution throughout the Bahamas as the anti-LGBTQ attitudes and homophobic community is prevalent throughout the country. Therefore, there is no part of the Bahamas where you would be safe. And so, there is no internal flight alternative available to you.\nCONCLUSION\n[19] In light of the preceding, I conclude that you are refugees, pursuant to Section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. Accordingly, I accept your claim.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

Now, in the event that written reasons are provided, they may be edited for spelling and grammar, and applicable references to documentary evidence, as well as case law may also be included.\n[2] XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is claiming refugee protection pursuant to Sections 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[3] The complete story alleging the basis of the claimant\u2019s fear is captured in the claimant\u2019s very detailed Basis of Claim Form and amendments, which can be summarized as follows:\n[4] Claimant alleges that he fears returning to Mexico because he will face persecution or harm based on his sexual orientation.\n[5] Growing up as a child in a Catholic family in Merida in the State of Yucatan, Mexico, the claimant alleges that at an early age he realized that he was gay, but could not freely express his homosexuality in a society that he described as homophobic.\n[6] The claimant alleges that he has been forced to supress his attraction to other men because he never felt safe or comfortable to do so. As well, he was urged by his family to participate in masculine activities such as sports.\n[7] The claimant maintains that he was often the subject of ridicule in school where he was accused of exhibiting feminine behaviours.\n[8] When he was eight years old the claimant disclosed in confession his preference for males to his priest who told him that there was something terribly wrong with him, and that if he was gay he would go to hell.\n[9] Based on pressures from family, school, and church, the claimant alleges that he considered suicide, but did not have the courage to act on that impulse.\n[10] Although there were constant rumours about the claimant\u2019s sexual orientation, he never admitted to being gay.\n[11] In January of 2004, claimant enrolled in an XXXX program. After graduation in 2009, he began to work at the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX It was there that the claimant alleges he learned that although there were prohibitions against discrimination based on sexual orientation, homophobic views among managers and employees were still prevalent.\n[12] Based on the culture the claimant felt at XXXX, he left in 2010 and took a position at XXXX in Merida, Mexico where he alleges he confronted the same homophobic attitudes.\n[13] In July 2017, the claimant began to attend therapy from a XXXX XXXX XXXX.\n[14] In October of 2010, the claimant alleges he was invited to a party by his manager, Did not want to attend, and is because of his refusal to attend his co-workers came to his home and physically assaulted him. The claimant called police who attended and were told by the claimant\u2019s attackers that he had inappropriately touched them, and according to the claimant he was told by the police that he deserved what he got. He received medical treatment for his injuries. Filed a complaint with the company but received no response.\n[15] Upon the recommendation of his psychologist in January 2019, the claimant quit his job and in February 2019 traveled to Toronto, Canada where he attended a one month English as a second language program. While in Canada, the claimant observed that the Canadian society appeared to be far more accepting of the LGBTIQ community, and extended his visitor\u2019s visa until January 2020.\n[16] The claimant alleges that he was unaware that his sexual orientation was a ground to make an application for refugee protection, and was only in October 2019, when he happened to run into a Spanish speaking man that he learned that the individual was also gay, and connected him to Culture Link who assisted the claimant in obtaining legal services and making his application for refugee protection in January of 2020.\n[17] Counsel, this is the part that I think you may want to interpret to the claimant.\n[18] For the following reasons, on a balance of probabilities, the panel finds that the claimant would face a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground and therefore the panel finds that the claimant is a Convention refugee and has a well-founded fear of persecution should he return to Mexico.\n[19] I will \u2026 I will now, hopefully briefly, provide the reasons for making this determination.\n[20] On a balance of probabilities, I find that the claimant is a citizen of Mexico. The claimant established his citizenship by providing a copy of his passport issued by the Government of Mexico.\n[21] The hearing was conducted by video-conference, thus, I did not have an opportunity to review the original passport or other documents. However, I note that there are no concerns raised by any of the officials who had access to the original documents.\n[22] In assessing this claim I focused on the credibility of the claimant\u2019s allegations. The risk of harm he might face upon his return to Mexico because of his sexual orientation.\n[23] I\u2019m cognizant of the difficulties that any claimant faces in establishing a claim. These include the cultural factors, the stress of responding to oral questions through an interpreter, and this is compounded by the fact that this hearing was held remotely using Microsoft Teams, which claimant and counsel had agreed to.\n[24] I also considered the Chairperson\u2019s guidelines on sexual orientation, gender identity and expression when conducting this hearing and assessing the facts in this case, such as the social, cultural context in which the claimant found himself.\n[25] Given the sensitive nature of some of the allegations, my questions were hopefully asked in a sensitive and respectful manner.\n[26] I also considered the psychological assessments that were provided by both Dr. XXXX XXXX(sic) in Mexico, and those of Dr. XXXX XXXX conducted here in Toronto.\n[27] For the following reasons I find the determinative issue in this case to be credibility and the claimant\u2019s sexual orientation. As well, discussed were the issues of State protection and internal flight alternative, the claimant\u2019s delay in making his claim, and the risk of persecution or harm the claimant would face should he return to Mexico.\n[28] In assessing the claimant\u2019s credibility, an issue which is identified in any matter which comes before the Board, I was mindful of the Maldonado decision, which in part says that when a claimant swears to the truth of certain allegations this creates a presumption that those allegations are true unless there is reason to doubt their truthfulness.\n[29] I found that the claimant testified in a credible manner. His \u2026 there were no relevant inconsistencies in his testimony or contradictions between the testimony and other evidence that was before me. Find that the claimant testified in a spontaneous and detailed fashion.\n[30] Regarding the claimant\u2019s sexual identity. I \u2026 I note that it is difficult to definitively establish an individual\u2019s sexual orientation. However, on a balance of probabilities, I find that the claimant has established that he his a \u2026 a homosexual male. This finding is based on the claimant\u2019s testimony, his detailed personal feelings and experiences, the relationships that he identified, as well as the letters and photographs that the claimant provided.\n[31] Also, I accept the explanations for the lack of witnesses. Among them the claimant\u2019s initial partner in Canada, as well as his psychologist in Mexico.\n[32] Regarding the delay in claim, I accept that the reasons for this delay were precipitated by his lack of understanding of the system. I do have some concerns that he might not have raised the issue earlier on in his stay of Canada. However, on a balance of probability, I accept as reasonable his explanation for the delay.\n[33] Regarding the risk of persecution or harm that the claimant fears, I \u2026 I note that the Federal law prohibits the discrimination of LGBTIQ individuals. However, as counsel pointed out in his very thoughtful and detailed submissions, the law is always not fully implemented.\n[34] Therefore, although Mexico has taken steps towards equality, there are significant cultural and legal barriers that continue to exist.\n[35] According to the objective documentary evidence, and this is in both counsel\u2019s package as well as the Board\u2019s NDP, specifically in the chapters 2.1 which is the DOS report, and chapter 6 regarding sexual orientation, machismo is still embedded in Mexico culture, which increases homophobia and discrimination against sexual minorities.\n[36] This is certainly more prevalent in smaller towns and larger cities, although the acceptance is certainly not uniform.\n[37] And there is evidence that is provided that indicates that there is violence and discrimination ever present in the Mexican society, as well as among Mexican families, and as the claimant had testified, his family are observant practices \u2026 practitioners of the Catholic faith, consistent with the claimant\u2019s testimony,\n[38] The objective evidence also indicates that most sexual minorities have experienced physical acts of violence or harassment based on their sexual orientation or gender identity. Further, sexual minority students reported discrimination and harassment based on their gender identity. As well, sexual minorities have experienced discrimination as the claimant describes in the workplace.\n[39] Based on this systemic discrimination and the incidents of discrimination and harassment that the claimant has experienced, I do find that the cumulative effect of these acts of discrimination and harassment do rise to the level of persecution.\n[40] Considering the aspect of State protection. As counsel pointed out in his submissions, adequate and effective separate does not exist uniformly throughout Mexico, and it even in jurisdiction where there\u2019s some safe havens for the LGBTQI community, this is not uniformly practiced outside of that particular bubble.\n[41] As well in the issue of internal flight alternative, I find that the \u2026 the panel \u2026 that the claimant would face a serious possibility or certainly more than a mere possibly of persecution should he attempt to locate in Mexico City.\n[42] As well, as the claimant testified, he would be able to find work and a place to live, but this would not protect him from facing again, persecution or potential harm in Mexico City. This in spite of the fact that there are gay friendly areas.\n[43] So, based on the preponderance of evidence, the claimant\u2019s testimony is very consistent with the objective evidence that is provided in the National Documentation Package.\n[44] So, based on the preceding reasons and the totality of the evidence and cumulative findings that I have just indicated, I find that the claimant has satisfied the burden of establishing that he faces a serious possibility of persecution should he return to Mexico, and therefore find that the claimant is a Convention refugee and his claim is accepted.\n[45] So, that effectively concludes the hearing, unless you would like to explain to the claimant what has transpired. I think \u2026 just judging from his reaction I think he understands what\u2019s been said.\n[46] CLAIMANT: Yes. Thank you.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

These are the reasons for the decision in the claim of XXXX XXXX, who claims to be citizen of Uganda and is claiming refugee protection pursuant to s. 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. In rendering my reasons, I have considered and applied the Chairperson\u2019s guidelines number 9, proceedings before the IRB involving sexual orientation and gender identity and expression.\nAllegations\n[2] Your allegations are found in your Basis of Claims forms and narrative in Exhibit 2, as well as in the amendments in Exhibits 7, 9, and 10, and in oral testimony heard today. In summary, you allege persecution in Uganda at the hands of the government and its authorities as well as the anti-LGBTQ society for your sexual orientation as a gay man.\nDecision\n[3] I find that you are a refugee pursuant to s. 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, as there exists a serious possibility of persecution should you return to Uganda on account of your membership in a particular social group, that is, as a person that identifies as a gay man.\nIdentity\n[4] I find that your identity as a national of Uganda is established by the documents provided, relying primarily on the certified copies of your passports in Exhibits 1 and 4.\nCredibility\n[5] I did find you to be a credible witness and therefore believe what you have alleged in support of your claim. You testified in a straightforward manner. You spoke naturally and spontaneously, and there were no relevant inconsistencies in your testimony or contradictions between your testimony and the other evidence before me. In particular, you testified credibly regarding how you came to understand your own sexuality and attraction to the same sex, specifically to your long-term same-sex partner, XXXX (ph), in Uganda. You explained that knowing from a young age that same-sex relationships were generally not accepted at school and in your community, and so you tried to keep your relationship secret or hidden, but it was exposed at school, and after which you were both expelled. Years later, you continued your relationship, and it also became exposed again as an adult in late July 2020 \u2014 sorry, in late July 2019. After this exposure, you allege that you were dismissed from work and you had been physically attacked by a group of strangers who used homophobic slurs. After relocating on two occasions, you also obtained a visa and departed to Canada.\n[6] I note you have also provided evidence to establish the allegations as set out above, and after reviewing the documents, I have no reasons to doubt their authenticity, and I do give weight to the following documents. To establish your sexual orientation and the other allegations, you have provided a statutory declaration and a letter of support from your same-sex partner in Uganda. These attest to the exposure of the relationship and the targeting and violence. You provided a letter from Icebreakers Uganda, which is an LGBTQ organization that you sought support from after your same-sex relationship was exposed. You\u2019ve also provided letters, such as from the African Centre for Refugees, stating your participation in their events and programs, including the LGBTIQ Black Lives Matter protest in July of 2020, and that you have shared your experiences as a sexual minority in their awareness program. I also note they have included a brochure which includes multiple photos of you participating in the LGBTIQ Black Lives Matter protests, and additional photos that you have also provided and testified credibly about. You\u2019ve given a letter from the friend that you stayed with after your attack in October of 2019, as well as letters of support and XXXX XXXX from the Canadian Centre for Victims of Torture, which detail your descriptions of your sexual orientation and your experiences as a result. Based on the totality of the evidence and the credible testimony, I find on a balance of probabilities that you are person that identifies as gay, that you have been in a same-sex relationship in Uganda which was exposed publicly before you came to Canada. I find your subjective fear is established.\nObjective Basis\n[7] Given that there are no serious credibility issues with respect to your allegations, coupled with the documentary evidence set out below, I find you have established a prospective risk and a well-founded fear of persecution in Uganda. The risk is corroborated by Exhibit 3, the National Documentation Package for Uganda, as well as country conditions in Exhibit 6.\n[8] Item 2.1 of the NDP states that consensual same-sex sexual conduct is criminalized, according to colonial-era laws that criminalize \u201cCarnal knowledge of any person against the order of nature,\u201d and that these provide for a penalty of up to life imprisonment. Attempts to commit unnatural offences as laid out in the law are punishable with seven years of imprisonment, and the government has occasionally enforced the law in recent years. As well, although the law does not restrict freedom of expression or peaceful assembly, for those involved with LGBTI groups or speaking out in support of their rights, the government has severely restricted these rights, and the law does not prohibit discrimination against LGBTI persons in areas such as housing, employment, or access to government services. Item 6.1 states that authorities typically consider merely being a homosexual or being in a same-sex relationship as a breach of sodomy laws, and simply violating social norms can also create this presumption of these acts. As well, it indicates that some officials have had a much broader understanding of unnatural acts than has been defined in courts, and this has been used to justify harassment, arrest, and incarceration of sexual minorities, regardless of whether they have engaged in any illegal sexual act or not. 6.2 also details that homophobic views are widespread in society and are openly promoted in government and religion. I therefore find on a balance of probabilities the objective basis for this claim has also been established.\nNature of the Harm\n[9] I have examined your claim under s. 96 of IRPA as I conclude the risk you describe constitutes persecution based on at least one of the grounds in s. 96, specifically your membership in a particular social group as a man who identifies as a gay person. I find you are at risk of harassment, discrimination, arrest, and imprisonment for your sexuality, as well as an inability to live freely as a sexual minority.\nState Protection\n[10] I find it would be objectively unreasonable for you to seek the protection of the state in light of your particular circumstances as the agent of persecution is the state. As mentioned in the objective evidence, same-sex activity is criminalized throughout Uganda, and it is indicated throughout the evidence that authorities do not provide adequate protection or access to justice for victims of crimes who are LGBTQ. Additionally, police themselves are often seen as the principal violator of rights against this community, and therefore, the presumption of state protection is rebutted.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[11] I have also examined whether a viable internal flight alternative for you. Based on the evidence on file, I find that you face a serious possibility of persecution throughout Uganda. Again, the laws condemning same-sex acts and relationships are consistent throughout the country, and there is no part where you would not face persecution or that you would be able to live freely. I therefore find there is no internal flight alternative available to you.\nCONCLUSION\n[12] In light of the preceding, I conclude that you are a refugee pursuant to s. 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, and accordingly, I accept your claim today.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013\n",

You are claiming to be a citizen of Iran and are claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[2] Your claim is accepted. I find that you are a Convention refugee on the grounds of being a member of a particular social group, homosexual men in Iran. Here are my reasons.\n[3] You alleged the following.\n[4] You are a citizen of Iran. You say that since you were young, you have understood that you are a homosexual, attracted to men and not to women. You say that because of this difference and because of the social taboo against your homosexual identity, you feared what would happen to you if you were conscripted into the military. You feared rape and other forms of violence if you fellow conscripts understood that you were homosexual. For this reason, you sought and obtained exemption from military service. You said you feared that the military would share information about your sexual identity with the state and you alleged that the state did indeed become involved in a process in evaluating your sexual orientation. You say that you fear persecution at the hands of the state for homosexuality, which can include imprisonment and execution.\n[5] You alleged that it is not safe for you to return to Iran and that there is no state protection for you or an internal flight alternative for you in Iran.\n[6] Your personal identity as a citizen of Iran has been established by your testimony and the supporting documents filed in the exhibits, namely a certified true copy of your Iranian passport. I find that, on the balance of probabilities, you are who you say you are, and the country of reference is Iran.\n[7] I find that there is a link between what you fear and Convention grounds, membership in a particular social group, namely homosexuals in Iran. And, therefore, I have only assessed the claim under section 96.\n[8] I find you to be a credible witness and I therefore believe what you have alleged in your oral testimony and in your Basis of Claim form. You testified in a straightforward manner, spontaneously and at lengths, answering all questions put to you without hesitation or embellishment.\n[9] You told me you had known from a young age that you were different, but you did not know until you were 17 or 18 that there were other men like you. You told me that you had had one serious intimate relationship, and that in the year you were together with that lover, you were only able to really be together for two (2) months. You convincingly described those months. You described eating in restaurants with him and lowering your voice for certain parts of your conversation. You described walking with him holding hands and seeing the contemptuous way people around you reacted. You also explained that initially, when your psychologist warned you to try to get out of Iran because you are homosexual, you were initially not worried because you thought you could keep it hidden.\n[10] And you explained how being conscripted into the military changed your appreciation of that threat. You explained that the military in Iran is full of machoism and other forms of toxic masculinity, and that was why you took the decision to risk telling the military authorities about your sexual identity.\n[11] I find this to be credible testimony and I find it establishes your identity as a homosexual man who fears exposure and persecution.\n[12] You provided documents to support your claim. The notice from the military that said that you were exempted from service and the application that requested this exemption because of \u201cperversions that are contrary to social and military decencies\u201d. There was a letter from your sister who described what it was like for her to assist you in proving your sexual identity to the authorities. She corroborates your testimony about an important moment in that process. Her letter made it clear to me that she understood and accepted that you are a homosexual.\n[13] You also provided photographs with your lover as well as proof of your activities together. It is clear from those images and that correspondence that you shared that there was a real connection between you two. You showed that you had travelled together to Kish Island, including the air tickets. You also showed evidence of your involvement in LGBTQ rights in Canada and you showed that you were looking for male partners in Canada, using apps like Grindr.\n[14] Based on all of the above, I believe, on balance of probabilities, that you are homosexual. I believe that you are fearful to return to Iran, because you may be imprisoned or killed due to your identity. I therefore find that your subjective fear is established by both your credible testimony and the corroborating documents, and I believed what you have alleged on a balance of probabilities.\n[15] I also find that there is objective evidence for what you fear. The Iranian penal code criminalizes all sexual relations outside of traditional marriage, including heterosexual relations. In the national documentation package for Iran, it is noted that chapter 2 of the penal code explicitly criminalizes same-sex relations. Men engaged in homosexual acts can be executed on the first conviction involving penetration and non-penetrative homosexual acts, such as kissing or touching, are punishable by flogging. Additionally, there is a strong societal taboo against homosexuality and many young gay men face harassment and abuse from family members, religious figures, school leaders, community leaders and authorities. Some have been expelled from university for alleged same-sex relations. It is also known that high-level officials within the regime have continued to make derogatory statements about homosexuality.\n[16] I have considered whether there is a viable internal flight alternative for you, but since the state is the agent of persecution and the state exercise control over all of Iran, I find that there is no viable internal flight alternative. And similarly, I have considered whether the state should be protecting you, but since the state is the agent of the persecution, then there is no way that we can expect that the state will do the job of protecting you.\n[17] Based on the totality of the evidence, I find you to be a Convention refugee because you face a serious possibility of persecution, because you are a member of a particular social group, homosexual men in Iran.\n[18] I accept your claim.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

After considering the evidence and the testimony you provided today, I am ready to deliver my decision, which will follow.\n[2] This is an oral decision in the claim for refugee protection, for persons to s. 96 and s. 97(1) with Immigration and Refugee Protection Act in relation to the claim for the XXXX XXXX XXXX, file number TB9-33147. The Panel notes that the claimant indicates that he is a citizen of Nigeria. The Panel wishes to note that in assessing his claim, the Panel has considered Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9, proceedings before the IRB involving sexual orientation and gender identity and expression and a XXXX XXXX entered into evidence as Exhibit 5. The Panel knows that the claimant has lived his claim pursuant to s. 96 and the basis of his sexual orientation as a bisexual. For this reason, the Panel has been mindful of Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9.\n[3] The details of the claimant\u2019s allegations are filed with the Basis of Claim form narrative in Exhibit 2. To summarize, the claimant alleges persecution from the Nigerian police and the community at large due to his sexual orientation as a bisexual man. In his narrative, the claimant states that he became aware of his sexual orientation at the age of 12, and that in 2016, he entered into same sex relationship with XXXX (ph) while in high school. In XXXX 2019, the claimant arrived to Canada on a visitor visa and asked for refugee protection on November 18, 2019 after learning about the social climate and laws on same-sex relationships in Canada. The claimant alleges that there is no state protection for him or an internal flight alternative anywhere in Nigeria.\n[4] The Panel finds that the claimant is a Convention refugee for the following reasons. The Panel finds that there is a link between what the claimant fears and one of the five convention grounds because of the claimant\u2019s membership in a particular social group as a bisexual man. The Panel finds that, on a balance of probabilities, the claimant\u2019s national and personal identity as a citizen of Nigeria has been established by his testimony and the copy of his valid Nigerian passport, entered into evidence. The certified true copy of the claimant\u2019s passport can be found in Exhibit 1.\n[5] With respect to credibility, the Panel finds that the claimant was a credible witness in relation to the central issues of his claim. The claimant testified in the direct, sincere and emotional manner, and there were no omissions, inconsistencies or contradictions between his statements provided his Basis of Claim form signed in November 18, 2019 and his testimony at the hearing in relation to the central issues of the claim.\n[6] The claimant was able to explain when he became aware of his sexual orientation and the circumstances surrounding him coming to terms with his sexuality. The Panel also finds that the claimant was credible in describing his fear from the Nigerian authorities regarding the prohibition of same-sex relationships in Nigeria and explaining the consequences of someone being arrested for being in a same-sex relationship. The claimant was able to describe why, and how, he believes his return to Nigeria will lead to his potential arrest by the police and to the violence and abuse he suffered both by the police and the community.\n[7] The Panel finds that the claimant also provided detailed testimony about the issues that arose with his father after he has learned about his sexual orientation and the reasons why his father stopped communicating with him. The testimony he provided in relation to all this was very credible and the Panel accepts his, on a balance of probabilities, to be true.\n[8] The claimant also provided detailed testimony about the same-sex relationship he had in Nigeria with XXXX and provided details in this relationship that started about the claimant and XXXX were still in high school, and subsequently, continued their studies at the XXXX XXXX XXXX in Nigeria that both men attended from 2016 to 2019 as part of their preparation for XXXX XXXX. The claimant testified that the relationship with XXXX lasted from 2016 to 2019, and when the relationship ended after the claimant informed his partner about his decision to stay in Canada.\n[9] The claimant also testified about his same-sex relationship in Canada, with XXXX (ph), which was, as the claimant himself explained at the hearing, a combination of a fling and intense friendship that developed over time between him and XXXX, who is homosexual and who is also a refugee claimant from Kenya. As in evidence to the test, the claimant provided a letter from XXXX, where the author of the letter provides information about the way to friendship with the claimant developed over time, and the details of this friendship.\n[10] The Panel finds the letter to be credible, on a balance of probabilities, and assigns it full weight when assessing for the group to the claimant as it relates to his sexual orientation. The letter can be found in Exhibit 5.\n[11] The Panel finds the two claimants was credible in explaining the details pertaining to his same-sex relationships with the named individuals. The Panel finds that the claimant provided reasonable explanation for not having evidence provided by XXXX. He stated that XXXX was disappointed to learn about the claimant\u2019s decision to not to return to Nigeria and that he still felt betrayed by the claimant. The panel accepts the explanation as credible, on a balance of probabilities, and finds that the claimant\u2019s submission to provide a letter from XXXX does not impugn his credibility.\n[12] The Panel also has persisted evidence that establishes that the claimant is a bisexual man. This includes the claimant\u2019s detailed testimony about the way he realized his sexual orientation, and the fear he felt at the time of this realization, as well as his fear to discuss his sexual orientation in Nigeria with anyone. The Panel places a substantial amount of weight in this testimony. As additional evidence, the claimant also provided letters from his coworkers, XXXX and XXXX, all accompanied with copies of identification documents that are equally detailed and personalized as the letter provided by XXXX and that demonstrate knowledge in the claimant\u2019s sexual orientation and details of the reasons he decided to apply for refugee protection in Canada.\n[13] These letters were consistent and spoke as to what the authors of the letter saw. The Panel places a great deal of weight in these letters which can be found in Exhibit 5.\n[14] The claimant also provided photographs of him and XXXX from Nigeria. The Panel notes that the claimant was able to provide detailed information about the place and time the photographs were taken. The Panel finds the photographs to be credible evidence that corroborates the claimant\u2019s allegations about his sexual orientation. In consideration of this matter as a whole, the Panel finds that the claimant has established, on a balance of probabilities, that he is a bisexual man. The Panel is therefore satisfied that the claimant has established his subjective fear.\n[15] The Panel further finds that the claimant has an objective basis for his fear because the documents at conditions for Nigeria as per the evidence in Exhibit 3, the National Documentation Package for Nigeria, herein, national package for NDP. The package provides, in Item 1.4 on page 48, that the general climate for LGBTQ persons has worsened considerably after the introduction of the same-sex marriage prohibition that was signed in January 2014. Human Rights Watch found this act in many ways, officially authorizes abuses against sexual minorities, compounding the already criminalized behaviour of the same-sex relationships. Mob attacks, violence and extortion were extensively reported in the media following the passage of the act, and LGBTQ individuals interviewed by Human Rights Watch stated that, prior to the law, objections were mainly on the basis that homosexual behaviour and same sexual behaviour, in general, was contrary to religious or cultural identities. However, following the introduction of the act, the police and the public have engaged in violations against LGBTQ people including, torture, sexual violence, arbitrary detention, extortion and lack due process. The package also provides, in Item 6.9 in page 9, that the overall sympathy for the deplorable treatment of real, or perceived, LGBTQ persons is abysmally low because speaking out against the harassment and injustice contributes religious and societal obligations and can easily be interpreted as a declaration of gayness. These factors have successfully birthed (ph) cases of extortion, police brutality, unlawful arrest, discrimination in home and workplace for LBTQ individuals in the entire country.\n[16] As well, the package provides, in Item 6.11 on page 19, that sexual minorities are generally not accepted by family members, and that the family acceptance stand for a rare exception to the rule, since it is more common that individuals with same-sex orientation become ostracized while experiencing violence and being forced to change their sexual orientation, should means of correction sections reparative therapy carried out the family members as well as security officers, health care providers, and religious and traditional institutions. Finally, the package provides, in item 6.1 on page 8, that homophobic violence is occurring without fear of consequences. There are many incidences of mob violence against LGBTQ individuals. Law-enforcement agents considered to be (inaudible) as an intervention to ease their work to enforce peace in the community. Therefore, the victims are the ones who get arrested o the basis of their sexual orientation and face more stigma and discrimination, unlawful arrest, detention extortion, and rape.\n[17] The Panel has taken all of this into consideration when assessing the claimant statements and finds that his fear of abuse and torture, as well as his awareness that in case he returns to Nigeria, he\u2019d have to conceal his sexual orientation, are consistent with those in the objective documentary evidence regarding violence towards LGBTQ individuals. Based on documentary evidence, the Panel that finds that the claimant\u2019s subjective fear has objective basis. Therefore, the Panel finds that the claimant has a well-founded fear of persecution in Nigeria due to his sexual orientation.\n[18] Going to the issue of state protection. Except in situations where the state is completely dysfunctional and in total breakdown, states must be presumed capable of protecting their citizens. It is up to the claimants to rebut the presumption with clear and convincing evidence that the state is either unwilling, or unable, to protect them. The same-sex sexual activity is criminalized by the federal laws throughout Nigeria and homophobic violence continues with impunity, the Panel finds that there is clear and convincing evidence that state protection would not be available to the claimant if he were to return to Nigeria. (inaudible), the Panel finds that there is nowhere in Nigeria were the claimant would not face a serious possibility of persecution.\n[19] An internal flight alternative arises when the claimant, who otherwise meets all the elements of the definition of a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection in his or her own area of the country, nevertheless, is not a Convention refugee or person in need of protection because she or he could live safely elsewhere that country. There is a test for a viable internal flight alternative and has two prongs. The Panel must be satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant does not face a serious possibility of persecution, or be subjected personally to a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in other parts of the country, and the conditions in other parts of the country must be such that it would not be unreasonable in all of the circumstances, including those particular to the claimant, for him to seek refugee there. Based on the claimant\u2019s membership in a particular social group as a bisexual man, and due to the fact that the police in Nigeria operates on the federal level, as stated in the NDP in Item 7.4, which provides in page 38 at that, that the Nigerian police force is the principal law enforcement agency in Nigeria, that the Nigerian constitution prohibits states and local governments from forming their own forces, and that the same-sex marriage prohibition act is a federal law, the Panel finds that, on a balance of probabilities, the claimant faces a serious risk of persecution throughout Nigeria. As internal flight alternative test fails on the first prong, the Panel needs not considered the second prong. The Panel finds that there is not viable internal flight alternative for the claimant in Nigeria.\n[20] Based on the totality of the evidence, the Panel finds the claimant to be a Convention refugee. His claim is therefore accepted.\n[21] COUNSEL: Thank you very much, Madam Member.\n[22] CLAIMANT: Thank you so much.\n[23] MEMBER: Thank you, and welcome to Canada.\n[24] CLAIMANT: Thank you.\n[25] MEMBER: Thank you for participating at the hearing today.

        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2021 RLLR 58\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: January 6, 2021\nPanel: Robert K. Riley\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Jonathan E Fedder\nCountry: Rwanda\nRPD Number: TB9-32399\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2022-01594\nATIP Pages: N\/A\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: These reasons will stand as the decision in this case. The reasons given orally today will be rendered into writing, and the claimant and his lawyer will receive the written version in a matter of weeks.\nAllegations\n[2] The claimant alleges that he is a citizen of Rwanda. The claimant says that he is gay. In January 8th, 2019, he was discovered by his father kissing his same-sex partner. His influential businessman father then made allegations to police that the claimant was using drugs and molesting children. The police, apparently on instructions from the claimant\u2019s father, beat the claimant before passing him on to a prison and a rehabilitation centre, where the claimant was beaten some more. The claimant states that he was singled out for beatings precisely because he is gay. The beatings were all intended to persuade the claimant to abandon his sexual identity as a gay man.\n[3] The claimant says he cannot live a normal and peaceful life in Rwanda as a gay man. He says that police in Rwanda are still after him and that gay persons in Rwanda cannot find anyone to go to who would help them defend their rights and their safety in Rwanda. The claimant states that the government of Rwanda will not protect him and that there is no safe place for him anywhere in Rwanda.\nAnalysis: Identity\n[4] The claimant has provided his passport, a certified copy of which appears at Exhibit 1. He has also provided a copy of his national identity card, a copy of which appears at page 2 of Exhibit 4. The Panel is satisfied as to the Rwandan citizenship and the personal identity of the claimant.\nCredibility\n[5] The claimant testified in a straightforward and spontaneous manner with respect to the essential elements of the claim. He overcame, as did the Panel and counsel, difficulties in connecting with the interpreter. There were no contradictions or inconsistencies in the testimony that were of any import, and there was considerable consistency with the claimant\u2019s previous declarations as contained in his Basis of Claim form. The claimant indicated that he spent approximately one month in hospital around May 2019 being treated for injuries that he suffered while in police interrogation, prison, and rehabilitation. The Panel accepts the evidence of the claimant on the core issue that the claimant is considered by the community in Rwanda as a member of the LGBT community who has engaged in a same-sex relationship, and who faces the threat of persecution at the hands of the community in Rwanda due to his sexual orientation. On a balance of probabilities, the Panel finds the evidence of the claimant to be credible and trustworthy.\nDocumentary Evidence\n[6] Claimant provided letters of support from his brother XXXX at pages 6 to 10 of Exhibit 4, which confirm a number of details of the claimant\u2019s story. There are police summonses and a translation thereof found at pages 19 to 22, indicating that the claimant was being pursued by police. Although the specific charges are not outlined in the document, it does on a balance of probabilities tend to support the story that the claimant is telling. And from pages 16 to 18 of Exhibit 4, we have a letter from the claimant\u2019s former common-law partner.\n[7] In the objective evidence, the Panel has looked at the annual report of the US Department of State, which is found at item 2.1 of the national documentation package. The report states that LGBTI persons have reported societal discrimination and abuse, including challenges to officially registering any non-governmental organizations that would be favourable to gay persons. There is mention of a famous gospel singer in Rwanda who faced harsh criticism and isolation, as well as abandonment by friends, family, his employer, and community members in Rwanda, when he came out as gay.\n[8] At item 6.1, there is a report of the situation of gays in Rwanda, and we learn that there are still instances of illegal arrests. We learn elsewhere that being gay or engaging in same-sex behaviour is not against the laws of Rwanda, so these arrests are done notwithstanding the fact that such behaviour is permitted under law. So, these illegal arrests involve people found in bars or streets, detained for a few days, and later released when police realise that there is no case to be prosecuted. A number of law enforcement, notwithstanding the laws of Rwanda, tend to believe that homosexuality falls under the offence of violating good morals.\n[9] At item 6.2 of the NDP, at page 1, we learn that being LGBT in Rwanda is taboo, LGBT persons in Rwanda face societal discrimination, and there is a stigma against sexual minorities in Rwanda. Also, at the same item on page 1, there\u2019s a non-partisan human rights organization by the name of Human Rights First which states that Rwanda\u2019s social environment is \u201crife with homophobia\u201d. At pages 4 and 5 of the same report, we learned that Rwandans cannot be sure of getting employment or finding a residence because of the depth of discrimination against LGBT persons, and then at page 6 of the same report, it is reported that discrimination and stigmatization even occur when LGBT persons attempt to access healthcare services. So, the documentary evidence supports the allegations of the claimant and reinforces \u2014 excuse me \u2014 his credibility on the matter of his fear of persecution for engaging in same-sex behaviour.\nState Protection\n[10] At page 1 of item 6.2 of the NDP, a report from Global Gays states that there is no clear path to protection in Rwanda from the intolerant attitudes of the general public. Although the Rwandan government does not actively pursue members of the LGBT community, given its indifference towards those who are same-sex oriented, it is clear that it would not be reasonable for the claimant to ask the state of Rwanda for protection.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[11] The documentary evidence indicates that the anti-LGBT attitudes prevail throughout the country. The Panel concludes that it would not be reasonable for this claimant to seek an internal flight alternative.\nConclusion\n[12] Having considered all of the evidence, the Panel [inaudible] that the claimant has satisfied his burden of establishing that there is a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground if he were to return to Rwanda. The Panel decides that XXXX XXXX XXXX is a Convention refugee, and the Division accepts the claim.\n[13] And I wish you the best of luck in the future, sir.\n[14] CLAIMANT: Thank you.\n[15] COUNSEL: Thank you very much.\n[16] MEMBER: Good day to everyone.\n[17] CLAIMANT: Thank you so much.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013\n",

Counsel, does your client need word for word translation of the decision?\n[2] COUNSEL: I don\u2019t \u2013 I don\u2019t think so. I think based on his \u2013 his knowledge of the English language it doesn\u2019t need to be word for word. I can certainly go through it with him afterwards as well.\n[3] MEMBER: Okay. So then I\u2019m going to suggest that Mr. Interpreter just take a break and I just read the \u2013 the decision in one fell swoop if that\u2019s okay.\n[4] INTERPRETER: Okay. Okay, so I\u2019m on standby.\n[5] MEMBER: Yes.\n[6] INTERPRETER: This part.\n[7] MEMBER: Is that okay, Counsel?\n[8] COUNSEL: Yes, that\u2019s fine.\n[9] MEMBER: Okay, great. I\u2019m just going to go to the decision now and if there\u2019s any problems hearing me let me know. I\u2019ve had a chance to consider the evidence, I\u2019m prepared to render a decision in this matter orally.\n[10] This decision will be sent to you following the hearing, it may be edited for spelling and grammar. This is a decision for in the claim by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, file number TB9-31222. You are claiming to be a citizen of Pakistan and you\u2019re seeking refugee protection pursuant to Section 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[11] The determination is based upon the totality of the oral and documentary evidence presented I find you to be a Convention refugee under Section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act by reason of your membership in a particular social group as a gay man.\n[12] A summary of the allegations is as follows. You have described you fear persecution in Pakistan because of your sexual preference. You have indicated that if you return to Pakistan you will face persecution and perhaps violence on the grounds of this sexual preference from the government, extremist groups and as well as individuals and society at large.\n[13] You\u2019ve outlined that after discovering your sexual preference in early adolescence you hid it particularly in light of teachings from Islam which \u2013 and other messages from society indicating that homosexuality and LGBT membership was a sin.\n[14] You stated there\u2019s no state protection for you as a member of the LGBT community in Pakistan and nowhere you can go in your home country to be safe.\n[15] On the matter of your identity, your personal identity as a citizen of Pakistan has been established by your credible testimony, the copy of your passport and the other identity documents provided and entered into evidence for this hearing. Upon a balance of probabilities that identity and country of reference Pakistan have been established.\n[16] On the matter of nexus, I find there is a link between your fear of persecution and your sexual preference as a gay man therefore your claim is being assessed under Section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[17] On the matter of credibility, I find you to be a credible witness. You have described persuasively your discovery of your sexual preference, your relationship, your history of same sex relationships and the persecution received as a result including arrest in 2016 after you were discovered having sex with a partner.\n[18] You fled first to Denmark in 2019, shortly thereafter you came to Canada via the United States on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2019. I accept as credible that you are a gay man and that if you return to Pakistan as a member of the LGBT community you will face persecution on the grounds of this sexual preference and you would not be permitted to live openly.\n[19] I find that you\u2019ve been \u2013 you\u2019ve candidly shared your relationship history, your history of facing stigma and arrest because you are gay and the threat you received from a terrorist group as a result. You\u2019ve supported your oral evidence with credible supporting documents including your national identity card, a letter from the 519 group in Toronto, a corroborating affidavit from a friend, a corroborating affidavit from a former partner with whom you were arrested in 2016, a letter from your father supporting your testimony about the details of your arrest by police and the bribe which he paid to get you released.\n[20] Based upon the evidence provided I find on a balance of probabilities you\u2019ve established your subjective fear of persecution on the grounds of your sexual preference. Also I find on a balance of probabilities it is not appropriate in this case to make an adverse inference based upon any failure to claim in Hungry or Denmark.\n[21] Turning to the objective evidence, the objective evidence from the NDP for Pakistan supports your credible testimony. It identifies that in your country, intimate relationships between members of the same sex are actually criminalized in Section 377 of the penal code.\n[22] While the NDP acknowledges that same sex intimate contact is actually common, it never publicly \u2013 it is never publicly acknowledged for fear of reprisal from the state and particularly from members of the community at large.\n[23] The NDP fully confirms your evidence that there\u2019s a risk of violence to you as a member of the LGBT community in Pakistan from multiple sources including the state, although prosecutions under the penal code are actually rare. But also from members of the public who are greatly influenced by the society at large and the, quote, conservative Muslim community.\n[24] The NDP also confirms that persecutory activity of the terrorist group that you had mention, Jamaat-ul-Ahrar which is identified as targeting minority groups and civilians such as yourself. Accordingly I find your subjective evidence concerning your fear of persecution as a gay man is supported by the objective evidence for the \u2013 from the NDP for Pakistan. I therefore conclude your subjective fear of persecution on the grounds of your sexual preference is well founded.\n[25] Looking at the matter of state protection. NDP also \u2013 for Pakistan also confirms that state protection is not really available to members of the LGBT community such as yourself. As noted in the DFAT (ph) report of the NDP, police in Pakistan generally refuse to take complaints or requests for protection from members of the gay community.\n[26] It is also reported that some police actually blackmail complaints who tell them that they are gay. Further, there are no laws in Pakistan which protect the LGBT community from persecution or discrimination despite longstanding calls from the international community to put these in place.\n[27] Given that your oral evidence is supported by the NDP which confirms that there\u2019s no official legal protection, the members of the LGBT community such as yourself and no practical protection either, I find on the balance of probabilities that the presumption of state protection is rebutted in your case.\n[28] On the matter of Internal Flight Alternative, I\u2019ve also considered whether there\u2019s a place you can go in Pakistan and live safely. The conditions of intolerance and official systemic discrimination against members of the gay and LGBT community in Pakistan persist throughout the country.\n[29] As such I conclude on a balance of probabilities there\u2019s nowhere in the country you can go as a gay man and live openly. As such I\u2019m satisfied on a balance of probabilities that you would face persecution based upon your sexual orientation throughout the country and there\u2019s no internal flight alternative for you in Pakistan.\n[30] In conclusion, based upon the totality of evidence before me both oral and documentary I conclude that you face a serious possibility of persecution based upon your sexual preference any place in Pakistan as a gay man and there\u2019s no viable Internal Flight Alternative for you.\n[31] I therefore find you to be a Convention refugee on the grounds of your sexual preference under Section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. I accept your claim.\n[32] Thank you, sir. That decision that I\u2019ve just read will be transcribed and sent to you and \u2013 and so that is basically our hearing. I\u2019d like to give you the opportunity to say something prior to our close. Would you like to say something?\n[33] CLAIMANT: I want to express my gratitude and want to tell him that I cannot return to Pakistan and can start my life anew as a normal person here in Canada. Thank you.\n[34] MEMBER: Thank you for sharing that. Oh, sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to interrupt.\n[35] CLAIMANT: And many, many thanks to him for understanding my situation and giving me a chance to move ahead in my life.\n[36] MEMBER: Okay, thank you. So thank you to you, I really appreciate you sharing your difficult story with me. Thank you to our interpreter and thank you to counsel. Thank you to everyone for staying a little later today and being patient throughout the document hunt that we engaged in a little earlier.\n[37] INTERPRETER: Thank you, sir. Thank you, have a very nice day.\n[38] COUNSEL: Thank you very much, Mr. Member.\n[39] MEMBER: Okay. I\u2019m going to stop the recording now and disconnect. Is there anything else before we leave?\n[40] INTERPRETER: Nothing.\n[41] COUNSEL: No.\n[42] MEMBER: Thank you very much and have a good evening.\n[43] COUNSEL: You as well.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

In deciding this claim, I have taken into consideration all of the evidence, oral testimony, as well as the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9 proceedings before the IRB involving Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression, the SOGIE Guidelines. I\u2019ve also taken into consideration the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 4 Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution. I\u2019ve considered your testimony and the other evidence in the case and I am ready to render my decision orally.\n[1] MEMBER: This is the decision for the following XXXX XXXX XXXX, file number TB9-30161.\n[3] I find that you are a Convention refugee because you face a serious possibility of persecution on the grounds of your membership in a particular social group, namely as a bisexual woman, and also as a survivor of gender-based violence. My reasons are as follows.\n[4] The allegations can be found in your Basis of Claim form at Exhibit 2. You allege you are a citizen of Kenya and that you fear the Government, non-government actors, and your ex-husband due to your sexual orientation. You also allege that there is no state protection for you, nor is there an internal flight alternative.\n[5] Your personal identity as a citizen of Kenya has been established by your testimony and the supporting documents filed in the exhibits, specifically your copy of your Kenyan passport and your National Identity Card. I therefore find on a balance of probabilities that identity and country of reference have been established.\n[6] I find that there is a clear nexus between your fear and the Convention ground of membership in a particular social group, that of a bisexual woman and a woman facing gender-based violence. I find that the test under Section 96, whether there\u2019s a serious possibility of persecution should you return to Kenya, is met.\n[7] In terms of your general credibility, I have found you to be a credible witness and I therefore believe what you have alleged in your oral testimony and in your Basis of Claim form. You testified sincerely and emotionally as to your relationship with your same-sex partner in Canada, and your relief at being able to express your sexuality without fear in Canada.\n[8] Your current same-sex partner also appeared as a witness at today\u2019s hearing. She provided credible and corroborative testimony. You both spoke of gifts and celebrations together and time spent at St. Chad\u2019s Church, at the Black Coalition for AIDS Prevention, as well enjoying meals together. You also provided a significant number of photographs of you and your partner and over 200 pages of text messages between you both over a period of several months. And this is in Exhibit 6.\n[9] I find that your testimony, that of your partner, and this evidence establishes that you are in a same-sex relationship. I therefore find that you have established your identity as bisexual woman.\n[10] You provided the following documents in Exhibit 6 to support your claim which I find relevant and credible. Letters of support from both your same-sex partner and your friend and community member in Canada; an affidavit and letter from your sister in Kenya attesting to your identity as a bisexual woman and the harm you have endured from your ex-husband; an affidavit from your friend in Kenya attesting to your identity as a bisexual woman and your same-sex relationship in Kenya and the threats that you had endured; an affidavit from your neighbour in Kenya attesting to the abuse you suffered at the hands of your ex-husband and an incident requiring him to take you to hospital; a XXXX XXXX from a counsellor you have seen for no less than eight counselling sessions which refers to your low mood, persistent feelings of guilt and shame, and the presence of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX; and a letter from the Refugee Settlement Coordinator at the Black Coalition for AIDS Prevention (Black CAP) in regards to your regular attendance at Foreign Integration Programming for LGBTQ newcomers and his knowledge of your same-sex partner and journey in Canada.\n[11] Your Basis of Claim and your compelling testimony detailed your same-sex relationships in Kenya and the abuse and violence you suffered at the hands of your estranged husband and the community. Your testimony also detailed the discrimination and the threats that followed you after your ex-husband exposed your sexual orientation to the community. You provided spontaneous details about those events and were able to explain any apparent inconsistencies or omissions.\n[12] I therefore find that you were in an abusive marriage and that your husband discovered you were having a same-sex relationship and that you and your partner were attacked and endangered in Kenya. I find your subjective fear is established by your credible testimony and I believe what you allege on a balance of probabilities.\n[13] I also find that there is an objective basis for what you fear in Kenya. The objective evidence is provided in Exhibit 3, the National Documentation Package for Kenya from September 30, 2020. Your counsel has also provided additional country condition documentation in Exhibit 8.\n[14] The Kenyan Penal Code, as amended by Act No. 5 of 2003, criminalizes consensual same-sex sexual activity carrying a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment. This is seen to justify the corollary homophobic police abuse, mob violence, harassment, and intimidation perpetrated on the LGBTQI community in Kenya, and this is Exhibit 3, Item 6.1.\n[15] Though no legislation in Kenya specifically mentions sexual acts between women, LBQ women are frequently arrested, denied access to basic rights and amenities, and excluded from participation as citizens in Kenya. The Sexual Offences Act from 2006 criminalizes indecent acts between adults. The ambiguities of this clause and those in the Penal Code allow for arbitrary decisions and judicial discretion in issuing verdicts according to personal moral views, and this is Exhibit 3, Item 6.6.\n[16] This evidence establishes an objective basis for fear of persecution. Based on this, I find that your fear of persecution in Kenya on the basis of your sexual orientation, namely as a bisexual woman is an objectively well-founded one.\n[17] Given that the agent of persecution is the State and the persecution you fear would be at the hands of the authorities, you have rebutted the presumption of state protection in Kenya. This is corroborated by Item 1.6 which says, \u201cMany LGBT victims of violence believe they have no recourse and that the police are just as likely to persecute them as to protect them.\u201d The report goes on to describe an incident where an LGBT man was stabbed in the chest and reported the incident to police only to be arrested himself and charged with sodomy. I find that there is no state protection available to you.\n[18] Further, since the same laws exist throughout Kenya, there is no safe alternative location in Kenya where one could live openly and freely as a bisexual woman. An internal flight alternative is not viable if it depends on the person concealing their sexual orientation. There is no IFA in Kenya.\n[19] Based on the totality of the evidence, I find you to be a Convention refugee because you face a serious possibility of persecution on the grounds of your membership in a particular social group, that as a bisexual woman. Therefore, I accept your claim.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2021 RLLR 55\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: August 23, 2021\nPanel: Ted Bethune\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Adetayo G Akinyemi\nCountry: Iran\nRPD Number: TB9-08875\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2022-01594\nATIP Pages: N\/A\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: This is the decision for XXXX XXXX XXXX, file number TB9-08875.\n[2] I have considered your testimony and the other evidence in the case and I am ready to render my decision orally. I have also considered and applied the guidelines relating to gender expression and sexual orientation.\n[3] You claim to be a citizen of Iran and are claiming refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. I find that you are a Convention refugee for the following reasons.\n[4] The allegations of your claim in your Basis of Claim form. In short, you allege persecution as a bisexual man. You allege that you realized your sexual orientation throughout high school. And when you were in second year, you felt a strong sexual attraction to another boy in your school, and that you struggled with this due to the attitude of your community towards same-sex attraction. You allege that, in your final year of high school, you became involved in a romantic relationship with that same boy. You allege this relationship continued on \u2014 until 2012, when he dropped out of the university you both attended, and that you had lost contact by November of 2013.\n[5] You allege that you eventually reconnected in March 2018 when he contacted you and asked for a lot of money, which you gave. However, after you realized he had a drug addiction, you declined to give him further loans. You allege that he continued to ask for money and eventually turned hostile. In November 2018, you allege he threatened to expose your sexual orientation to your wife if you did not give him further money. You allege that you then disclosed your prior same-sex relationship to your wife to prevent him from blackmailing you and then continued to refuse to give money to your former partner.\n[6] You allege that, subsequently, you came to Canada in XXXX of 2019, and that while in Canada, you found out that your former same-sex partner had been arrested and had given your name as one of his same-sex partners, leading the police in Iran to begin searching for you. You allege that, in Iran, you would face imprisonment and torture, as well as possible execution by the Iranian government due to your sexual orientation. You allege there is no state protection for you or an internal flight alternative anywhere in Iran.\n[7] Your personal identity as a citizen of Iran has been established by your testimony and the supporting documents filed in Exhibit. Specifically, your valid Iranian passport and Canadian visa. I, therefore, find on a balance of probabilities that your identity and country of reference have been established.\n[8] I find that there is a link between what you fear and one of the five Convention grounds because of your membership in a particular social group as a bisexual man. I find on a balance of probabilities, based on your testimony and the supporting documents filed, that there is a serious possibility of persecution from the Iranian government based on your sexual orientation. Sworn testimony is presumed to be credible unless there is a valid reason to doubt it. I am cognizant of the difficulties faced by individuals in establishing their claims, including cultural factors, testifying to an interpreter, and the milieu of the hearing room.\n[9] Overall, I have found you to be credible. I found your testimony flowed naturally and unprompted and was generally consistent with the evidence in your narrative. You were able to explain in significant detail about the beginning of your relationship with your same-sex partner, including that you had seen him in previous at high school, and on the first day of your last year of high school, you had an interaction with him where you lent him your only pen due to your attraction to him. You then testified as to how your friendship grew and gave examples of the small flirtatious gestures you made to one another as you tested to see if the other person was also interested in a romantic relationship, including how you both interpreted things such as inadvertent touching while walking to be romantic attraction because neither of you would shy away from such contact. You were able to candidly testify in detail about that night of your first romantic encounter, where you had the spent the Iranian New Year at his house, and he suggested you stay over, and when laying in bed together, he touched your hand and began a romantic encounter.\n[10] You testified honestly and in significant detail about your same-sex partner and specific events throughout the relationship, including examples of his interest in volleyball and how that sparked your own interest in volleyball, examples of fights you had with him over his cellphone use during dinner, and the plans you made for your second anniversary to spend it together, since you had not been able to spend your first anniversary together, which had left you heartbroken.\n[11] I found your description of how you lost touch, ending your relationship, to be honest, including your description of your emotions at the time and the efforts that you had made to attempt to regain contact. Also found that your description of your emotions when you reconnected with him to be candid and honest, including your emotional reaction when he asked for money and when he eventually started threatening to reveal your prior relationship in an attempt to extort more money from you.\n[12] I also considered your delay in leaving Iran from when you first realized your sexual orientation in high school until you left in XXXX of 2019. You testified that your same-sex attraction was not discovered by the Iranian authorities until after you had arrived in Canada, and that you had managed to keep your sexual orientation a secret until then. I consider that explanation reasonable, and I draw no negative credibility inference.\n[13] I have also considered your departure from Iran to other countries prior to coming to Canada, namely to Russia in 2007, China in 2018, and Turkey in 2018, and that you did not claim refugee status in any of those countries, but instead returned to Iran. You testified that your same-sex attraction was not discovered by the Iranian authorities until after you had arrived in Canada, and that having managed to keep it a secret, there was no threat to you and that you liked living in Iran. I consider that explanation reasonable, and I draw no negative credibility inference.\n[14] I\u2019ve also considered your delay in claiming refugee protection from when you arrived in Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2019, until you signed your Basis of Claim form on March 29th, 2019. You testified that you did not know your sexual orientation had been discovered by the Iranian authorities until March 10th, 2019, but you had a valid visitor visa for a full month after you arrived in Canada, and I note that your Basis of Claim form was signed less than three weeks after you found out your sexual orientation had been disclosed to the Iranian government. I consider that explanation reasonable, and I draw no negative credibility inference.\n[15] I, therefore, find on a balance of probabilities that you have established your sexual orientation as a bisexual man. I am, therefore, satisfied that there is a serious possibility that you would face persecution at the hands of either the Iranian government or your community should you return to Iran. I find that you have established your subjective fear.\n[16] I further find on a balance of probabilities that you have an objective basis for your fear because of the documented conditions for Iran, as per the evidence in Exhibit 3, the National Documentation Package for Iran.\n[17] Item 2 point reads, \u201cThe law criminalizes consensual same-sex sexual activity, which is punishable by death, flogging, or a lesser punishment. The law does not distinguish between consensual and non-consensual same-sex intercourse, and NGOs reported this lack of clarity led to both the victim and the perpetrator being held criminally liable under the law in cases of assault. The law does not prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. While few details were available for specific cases, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex activists expressed concern that the government executed LGBTI individuals under the pretext of more severe, and possibly specious, criminal charges such as rape. In June 2019, the foreign minister appeared to defend executions of LGBTI persons for their status or conduct.\u201d\n[18] Item 6.6 reads, \u201cA number of interviews with persons accused of homosexual behaviour seem to show that the authorities use harsh measures during arrests and interrogations. Intimidation, blackmailing, incommunicado detention, rape, torture, coercion to sign, false confessions, and extrajudicial punishments such as flogging are widely practiced during detention and interrogation. In most cases, authorities try to press the detainee to make a confession of homosexual conduct and\/or to reveal the identity of other homosexual persons. As various special procedures mandate holders have recognized, the criminalization of private consensual homosexual acts increases stigmatization and make people with diverse sexual orientations and gender identities, including minors, more vulnerable to community violence. Research carried out by the Iranian Lesbian and Transgender Networks shows that LGBT adolescents tend to experience homophobic taunts, insults, and threats on a constant basis, and this is in fact so common that many of them decide to isolate themselves in order to avoid being harassed or assaulted by members of the public.\u201d\n[19] I find on a balance of probabilities that your subjective fear has an objective basis. Therefore, I find you to have a well-founded fear of persecution due to your sexual orientation.\n[20] As same-sex sexual activity is criminalized by the government in Iran, I find that there is clear and convincing evidence that state protection would not be available to you. Likewise, as your persecution is at the hands of the state, and the state applies its persecution throughout the country, I find that there is nowhere in Iran where you would not face a serious possibility of persecution based on your membership in a particular social group as a bisexual man. As the test for an internal flight alternative fails on the first prong, I find that there is no viable internal flight alternative for you.\n[21] Based on the totality of the evidence, I find you to have a serious possibility of persecution in Iran due to your membership in a particular social group as a bisexual man, and therefore, to be a Convention refugee. Your claim is, therefore, accepted.\n[22] CLAIMANT: Thank you very much, sir. Thank you.\n[23] COUNSEL: Thank you.\n[24] INTERPRETER: (Speaking foreign language).\n[25] CLAIMANT: Thank you so much.\n[26] MEMBER: Thank you very much. This hearing is now concluded. I wish you well.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013\n",

Coulthard\nCountry: Ukraine\nRPD Number: TB8-33288\nAssociated RPD Number(s): TB8-33313\nATIP Number: A-2022-01594\nATIP Pages: N\/A\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: For the record, I am starting the decision now. This is the decision of the following claimants. The principal claimant, the first name is XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, the last name XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX file number TB8-33288, and her son, the minor claimant, the first name is XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX the last name is XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX file number TB8-33313. The claimants are claiming to be citizens of Ukraine and are claiming refugee protection pursuant to s. 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. In preparing my decision, I have considered and applied the chairperson\u2019s guidelines 9, proceedings before the Immigration and Refugee Board involving sexual orientation and gender identity and expression. The principal claimant was appointed to be the designated representative for the minor claimant, effective July 19th, 2019. I have considered the whole claimant\u2019s testimony, and the other evidence in the case, and I am ready to render my decision orally.\n[2] I find that the claimants have established a serious possibility of persecution in Ukraine by virtue of their membership in a particular social group, namely, as a lesbian for the principal claimant, and because of his familial relationship with the principal claimant for the minor claimant. The specifics of the claims are set out in the principal claimant\u2019s narrative and their Basis of Claim forms, and the amendments to the Basis of Claim forms, all filed as Exhibits 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3.\n[3] The claimants allege to be citizens of Ukraine. They fear persecution at the hands of the Ukrainian authorities and society at large because of the membership in a particular social group, namely, as a lesbian for the principal claimant, and for the minor claimant, because of his familial relationship with the principal claimant. The claimants allege that there is no state protection for them or an internal flight alternative.\n[4] The claimants\u2019 personal and national identities, as citizens of Ukraine, have been established on the balance of probabilities, by the principal claimant\u2018s testimony, and the supporting documents filed as Exhibit 1, namely, their valid passports, issued by the government of Ukraine. I find that there is a link between what the claimants fear and the grounds under s. 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, namely, membership in a particular social group. Therefore, the claims are assessed under s. 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[5] In terms of the principal claimant\u2019s general credibility, I found her to be a credible witness, and I believe what she has alleged in her oral testimonies and the Basis of Claim forms. The principal claimant\u2019s evidence was detailed and consistent, both internally and with her documentation. Throughout the hearing, the principal claimant was articulate, responsive, and forthright. The principal claimant was able to elaborate on her narrative and gave detailed explanations to the questions. The claims were well supported, and I noted no material inconsistencies or omissions, such that the presumption of truthfulness could be rebutted. The principal claimant has established on a balance of probabilities the following.\n[6] The principal claimant is a lesbian. This claim is supported by the principal claimant\u2019s credible testimony, statements from same-sex partners and friends, a statement from the principal claimant\u2019s sister, an applications to the 519 Community Centre for the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender community, or LGBT, and several photographs of the principal claimant with same-sex partners or former same-sex partners taken over the years at various locations at Canada and Ukraine, and these are all filed as Exhibits 7.1 and 7.2. When she was 22 years old, the principal claimant dated, and later married, a man. She had a child, the minor claimant, with this man. In December 2005, the principal claimant and her spouse divorced. Two years later, the principal claimant\u2019s former spouse passed away. This is supported by the principal claimant\u2019s credible testimony and narrative, and the minor claimant\u2019s birth certificate, the record of marriage certificate, certificate of marriage dissolution, and the principal claimant\u2019s former spouse\u2019s certificate of death filed as Exhibits 1 and 4. Over the years, the principal claimant had several same-sex relationships in Ukraine and in Canada. While in Ukraine, the principal claimant kept her sexual orientation a secret for fear of persecution. The claim is supported by the principal claimant\u2019s credible testimony and statements from same-sex partners and a friend, a statement from the principal claimant\u2019s sister, and several photographs of the principal claimant with same-sex partners or former same-sex partners taken over the years at various locations. These documents are all filed as Exhibits 7.1 and 7.2.\n[7] In 2017 and 2018, the principal claimant spent her summers in Canada, to work on a XXXX. This claim is supported by the principal claimant\u2019s credible testimony and her Canadian work permits filed as Exhibit 7.1. While in Canada, the principal claimants\u2019 parents found out about her sexual orientation and were horrified. As a result, the principal claimant is no longer on speaking terms with her father and has a difficult relationship with her mother. Friends and family were also informed and began threatening and accusing the principal claimant. The principal claimant believes that her life and that of the minor claimant, who is the son of a single lesbian mother, are at risk in Ukraine. This claim is supported by the principal claimant\u2019s credible testimony, and a statement from her sister, filed as Exhibit 7.1. There is no reason to cast any doubt on the veracity of the documentary evidence, and as such, I place great weight on these documents to support the claimant\u2019s allegations and overall claim. I find that the claimant\u2019s subjective fear is established by the principal claimant\u2019s credible testimony and I believe what she has alleged on a balance of probabilities.\n[8] The objective country reports are consistent with the claimant\u2019s evidence about the violence suffered by members of the LGBT community in Ukraine. The national documentation package, or NDP for Ukraine, dated June 30th, 2020, at Exhibit 3, Item 1.6, is an annual review of the human rights situation of lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans and intersex people in Ukraine governing the period of January to December 2019. It was issued by the international lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans and intersex association of Europe, or LGBTI. It notes that notwithstanding its national strategy on human rights and its relevant action plan for 2015 to 2020, and the sections referring to LGBTI rights, the government did not make progress on its implementation. In May, the UN independent expert on protection against violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity carried out a country visit to Ukraine. The independent expert highlighted that legislation is adequate, but implementation is lacking, that LGBTI people are by and large forced to hide their identities as a result of stigma, and that attacks against public events are of serious concern.\n[9] Item 2.1 of Exhibit 3, the Ukraine 2019 human rights report from the United States Department of State, notes that significant human rights issues in 2018 included crimes involving violence or threat of violence targeting lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex person. It further states that civil society groups remained concerned about the lack of accountability for crimes committed by radical groups in cases documented in 2018. During the year, members of such groups committed violent attacks on ethnic minorities, LGBTI persons, feminists, and other individuals they considered to be un-Ukrainian or anti-Ukrainian. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights monitoring mission in Ukraine noted that the failure of police and prosecutors to prevent these acts of violence, properly classify them as hate crimes, and effectively investigate and prosecute them, created an environment of impunity and lack of justice for victims.\n[10] The same report adds that there was societal violence against the LGBTI community, often perpetrated by members of violent radical groups, and authorities often did not adequately investigate these cases, or hold perpetrators to account. The UN High Commission for Human Rights monitoring mission in Ukraine noted that attacks against members of the LGBTI community were rarely classified under criminal provisions pertaining to hate crimes. Crimes of discrimination against LGBTI persons remained under-reported. The NDP documents also notes serious concerns about families of LGBTI individuals, including those raised by LGBTI individuals such as the minor claimant. Exhibit 3 at Item 6.3 recommends the elimination of all provisions in the Ukrainian legislation that lead to discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity. In particular, it notes that prohibiting discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity should protect all families, in particular, same-sex family couples, and children raised by them. Item 6.4, at Exhibit 3, notes that while welcoming increasing efforts in many countries to protect the LGBT, the rights of the LGBTI people, 12 UN entities remain seriously concerned that around the world, millions of LGBTI individuals, or those perceived as LGBTI individuals, and their families, face widespread human rights violations. It is cause for alarm and action.\n[11] The claimants have also filed recent country condition articles to the reports about the persecution of the LGBTI community in Ukraine, and those are all entered as Exhibit 6. As the claimants have established a subjective fear, and an objective basis for that fear, I find that they have established a well-founded fear of persecution.\n[12] When making a refugee claim, a claimant must establish on a balance of probabilities that adequate state protection is not available. There is a presumption that state protection is available, and the onus is on the claimant to provide clear and convincing evidence to rebut such presumption. So, Item 6.3 of Exhibit 3 discusses the lack of the state protection for the LGBTI community in Ukraine. It states as follows: \u201cViolence by right-wing radical groups remains a sore issue for Ukrainian LGBTI organizations and individual activists. The situation in this area has not undergone significant changes with the few previous years. Right-wing radical organizations do not reduce the rate of their homophobic aggression, and law enforcement agencies do not take steps to attractively address this problem. Most high-profile events, such as equality marches, are provided with sufficiently reliable protection from attacks by their aggressive proponents, but in other cases, the police usually act very passively. Hate crimes against LGBTI people are investigated ineffectively, offenders often avoid responsibility, and the motives of intolerance on the grounds of sexual orientation or gender identity are ignored.\u201d I find that state protection would not be reasonably forthcoming for the claimants. In addition, one agent of persecution is the state, as the persecution they could face should they return to Ukraine is at the hands of the authorities. Accordingly, I find that there is no state protection available to the claimants.\n[13] I have also considered whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for the claimant. An agent of persecution is the Ukrainian government. The evidence reviewed above confirms that the oppressive treatment of members of the LGBTI community and the lack of state protection is nationwide. I find that there is a serious possibility of persecution for the claimants throughout Ukraine and therefore find that there is no viable internal flight alternative.\n[14] Mister Interpreter, the following paragraph is the conclusion, or the determination.\n[15] INTERPRETER: Yes, Madam Member.\n[16] MEMBER: Based on the totality of the evidence, I find the claimants to be Convention refugees because they have demonstrated a serious possibility of persecution in Ukraine by virtue of their membership in a particular social group, namely, as a lesbian, for the principal claimant, and for the minor claimant, his familial relationship to the principal claimant. I accept their claims.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013\n",

Seevaratnam\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Amedeo Clivio\nCountry: Mexico\nRPD Number: TC1-04681\nAssociated RPD Number(s): TC1-04721\nATIP Number: A-2022-01594\nATIP Pages: N\/A\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] The claimants, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX(principal claimant) and his partner XXXXX XXXX XXXXX XXXXX (associate claimant), claim to be citizens of Mexico and they are claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).1\n[2] The principal claimant alleges he fears returning to Mexico as a member of a particular social group, a bisexual. The associate claimant alleges he fears returning to Mexico as a member of a particular social group, a gay man. They fear persecution from their homophobic community. The claimants also fear returning to Mexico due to the Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generaci\u00f3n (CJNG) who they believe work in collaboration with the corrupt police and the Mexican government. The claimants are two young men in a same-sex relationship since 2015.2\n[3] The panel has carefully considered the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9 on Proceedings Before the Immigration and Refugee Board Involving Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression, prior to assessing the merits of this claim.3\nALLEGATIONS\n[4] The details of the allegations are outlined in the principal claimant\u2019s (PC) Basis of Claim (BOC) Form4 and the associate claimant\u2019s (AC) Basis of Claim (BOC) Form.5 A synopsis of the allegations is as follows.\n[5] XXXX (PC) testified that his father, in 2007 or 2008, started working as a \u2013 XXXX XXXX XXXX in Mexico City.6 He explained that his father started storing electronics, weapons, and other valuables in their garage.7 The PC stated that his father was a corrupt XXXX XXXX who maintained links to the CJNG cartel.8 He stated that in 2013, members of the cartel, disgruntled with his father, came to their home in search of him. When they were unable to locate him, they kidnapped his older brother XXXX.9 Later, his father secured XXXX release from the cartel, but he arrived home severely bruised.10 XXXX explained that XXXX was clearly beaten and tortured. The claimants fear similar reprisals.\n[6] The PC stated that his father left the XXXX XXXX in 2015, for reasons unknown.11 However, his father continued to work with the cartel XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.12\n[7] XXXX testified that his father dislocated his elbow when he caught him smiling at a young male in public.13 The PC explained that on another occasion, when he was about 15, he and his friend XXXX went to workout at a gym behind their school. As they exited the gym, a police cruiser drove by and noticed them exchanging a kiss. XXXX stated that he and XXXX were immediately taken in the police cruiser, reprimanded for their conduct, and held overnight in detention at the police station. They were warned not to engage in same-sex amorous behaviour.14\n[8] XXXX (AC) explained that his family members are traditional and religious. He explained that the community is homophobic. Both claimants testified that they tried to keep their sexual orientation a secret in Mexico in order to avoid becoming victims of violence perpetrated by members of society.15\n[9] The AC stated that he was attracted to a male classmate who rejected his advances. This led to him being verbally abused, bullied, and ostracized at school among his peers.16 On another occasion, at age 14, the AC was walking hand in hand with his boyfriend. They were threatened by passengers in a vehicle driving by and became the potential victims of a physical assault.17\n[10] Both claimants testified they have suffered numerous acts of discrimination in several aspects of their lives which they believe amount to persecution. They explained that the police in Mexico reflect the homophobic society and protection is unavailable for bisexual or gay men within Mexico. They fear physical and verbal abuse by society. They believe they are at a grave risk of suffering violence if they were to disclose their sexual orientation.\n[11] On December 12, 2018, the claimants were pursued by members of the CJNG cartel.18 The criminal cartel shot twice in their direction, but the claimants were able to escape.19 Fearing for their life, they fled their country of nationality and sought refuge in Canada. 20\nDETERMINATION\n[12] The panel finds the claimants to be Convention refugees. The panel\u2019s reasons are as follows.\nIDENTITY\n[13] In Exhibit 5, the claimants have provided copies of their passports issued by the government of Mexico.21 In addition, the associate claimant has provided a copy of his Mexican electoral voter\u2019 s card.\n[14] The panel finds the claimants to be nationals of Mexico. The panel is satisfied with their identities as members of the LGBTQ community.\nCREDIBILITY\n[15] The panel is guided by the leading jurisprudence on the issue of credibility. Maldonado22 stands for the principle that when a claimant swears to the truth of certain allegations, this creates a presumption that those allegations are true unless there is reason to doubt their truthfulness.\n[16] The panel has carefully assessed the totality of the claimants\u2019 sworn viva voce evidence, their personal and country condition documents corroborating their testimony, specifically the information they have provided in their Basis of Claim (BOC) Forms and narratives,23 the letter detailing the circumstances faced by XXXX (PC) by his stepmother, XXXX24 photos,25 and country conditions regarding LGBTQ people in Mexico and the CJNG cartel.26\n[17] The panel finds the claimants to be credible and trustworthy witnesses. Their oral testimony was candid and straightforward. Accordingly, the claimants have established their subjective fear of persecution based on their sexual orientation and membership in a particular group, family of a corrupt XXXX.\nWELL-FOUNDED FEAR OF PERSECUTION\nSexual Orientation\n[18] The panel has sought guidance from reliable and reputable documentary evidence regarding the current plight of bisexual and gay men in Mexico.\n[19] The US Department of State (DOS) Mexico Country Report on Human Rights 2020 states as follows:\nAccording to the OHCHR, in the first six months of the year, there were 25 hate- crime homicides committed against lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex (LGBTI) persons. Federal law prohibits discrimination against LGBTI individuals. A Mexico City municipal law provides increased penalties for hate crimes based on sexual orientation and gender identity. Civil society groups claimed police routinely subjected LGBTI persons to mistreatment while in custody. Discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity was prevalent, despite a gradual increase in public acceptance of LGBTI individuals, according to public opinion surveys. There were reports the government did not always investigate and punish those complicit in abuses, especially outside Mexico City. On July 24, Mexico City passed a local law to ban LGBTI conversion therapy. A CNDH poll conducted in 2019 found six of every 10 members of the LGBTI community reported experiencing discrimination in the past 12 months, and more than half suffered hate speech and physical aggression. In July the federal government\u2019s National Commission to Prevent Discrimination wrote a letter condemning the Roman Catholic diocese of Mexicali for inciting homophobia by calling for anti-LGTBI protests.27\n[20] LGBT+ people have strong legal protections, but they are not uniformly enforced.28\n[21] A Response to Information Request (RIR) on the situation of sexual and gender minorities finds that according to sources, machismo is still embedded in Mexican culture, which increases homophobia and discrimination against sexual minorities.29\n[22] Sources indicate that most sexual minorities have experienced physical acts of violence or harassment based on their sexual orientation or gender identity.30\n[23] A Response to Information Request (RIR) on the situation of sexual minorities including in Mexico City states as follows: The website of the Attorney General\u2019s Office (Procuraduria General de la Republica, PGR) cites the President of the National Council for the Prevention of Discrimination (Consejo Nacional para Prevenir y Eliminar la Discriminaci\u00f3n, CONAPRED) as stating that in Mexico, [translation] \u201cdiscrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity continues to be a structural phenomenon with extensive social roots\u201d. In correspondence with the Research Directorate, a representative from the Executive Commission of Attention to Victims (Comisi\u00f3n Ejecutiva de Atenci\u00f3n a Victimas \u2013 CEAV), a federal agency that supports those who have been victims of a federal crime or whose human rights have been violated (Mexico n.d.a), stated that crimes against sexual minorities are [translation] \u201cconstant \u2026 and in many cases are motivated by prejudices\u201d. Sources indicate that despite an increase in public tolerance of sexual minorities, discrimination against sexual minorities was prevalent.31\n[24] Agencia EFE cites LGBT organizations as stating that [translation] \u201c\u2018persistent homophobia has been promoted in large part by members of the Catholic Church\u201d.32\n[25] In an article dated May 15, 2020, in Reuters, titled \u201cMexico sees deadliest year for LGBT people in five years,\u201d33 states that in 2019, 117 members of the LGBT community were killed which is a one third increase from 2018 and the highest since 2015.34 The article further states that the victims were found handcuffed, stabbed repeatedly, and in public places.35\n[26] The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR), an autonomous organ of the Organization of American States that promotes and protects human rights in the American hemisphere describes in a November 2015 report on violence against LGBT persons in the Americas, among other states, Mexico.36 For instance, same-sex couples showing public displays of affection are also a frequent target of police abuse and arbitrary detention by state agents \u2013 often with excessive use of force or verbal abuse- because of what is considered \u2018immoral behavior\u2019 in public spaces.37\n[27] Counsel\u2019s documentary evidence package highlights numerous incidents of murder committed upon innocent members of the LGBT community solely motivated by society\u2019s homophobic attitudes.\n[28] Several articles in counsel\u2019s documentary package find as follows:\nOn April 8, 2019, three young gay men were violently beaten for defending themselves against homophobic insults uttered by their aggressors in Guadalajara.38 One of the young men suffered traumatic brain injury.39\nOn February 5, 2019, a primary school teacher, who worked in Puebla, was found stabbed to death in his home for being gay.40 His close friends described him as a committed and sensitive person.41 In addition to teaching, he was a dance coach, a costumer for a youth group who was dedicated to humanitarian efforts and charity causes for children in Puebla.42\nOn July 26, 2018, a gay pageant winner was tortured and assassinated in Veracruz.43 The media report indicates that the gay queen was found half nude with signs of torture wearing a barbed-wire necklace.44\nOn June 19, 2018, three LGBT activists were murdered after being kidnapped from a bar in a popular tourist spot Taxco which is between Mexico City and Chilpancingo.45 Images from the local press suggest that the men were shot in the back of their heads and tortured before they were killed.46\n[29] Sources indicate that most sexual minorities have experienced physical acts of violence or harassment based on their sexual orientation or gender identity.47\n[30] On the issue of education, sources indicate that \u201csexual minority students reported discrimination and harassment based on their gender identity or sexual orientation at school and that the use of homophobic slurs in school is common.\u201d48\n[31] This is similar to the experiences of the AC, XXXX who was verbally abused, bullied, and physically assaulted for being gay. In addition, XXXX experience of being detained by the police overnight for a kissing his friend XXXX is corroborated in the media reports.49\n[32] The National Documentation Package (NDP) for Mexico states that,\nIn 2013, the state of Nuevo Le6n passed the Law to Prevent, Address and Eradicate Discrimination and Harassment and Violence in Schools. However, the representative from Fundaci6n Trans Amor noted that educational institutions have refused to enforce it. In 2019, Desastre, a Mexican news website on LGBTI issues, reported a case of two lesbian students facing harassment and physical aggression at a University in Nuevo Le\u00f3n, wherein the school responded by suspending the two victims. 50 [footnotes omitted]\n[33] The NDP further sates,\nAccording to the national study on LGBTI discrimination in the workplace by CEAV [Comisi6n Ejecutiva de Atenci6n a Victimas], and Fundaci6n Arcoiris [Fundaci6n Arcoiris por el Respeto a la Diversidad Sexual], which was completed by 3,451 respondents across the country, 30 percent of respondents reported that being LGBTI was an obstacle to employment occasionally, 21 percent said frequently, and 10 percent said always, while 30 percent estimated that it was never an obstacle. The report states that some employers ask job candidates questions about sexual orientation, pregnancy, and HIV status.51 [footnotes omitted]\n\u2026\nOther sources indicate that sexual minorities experience discrimination in the workplace \u2026\u2026 \u201cmany\u201d LGBTI people hide their sexual orientation or gender identity at work out of fear that it will have a negative impact on their career.52 [footnotes omitted]\n\u2026\nIn the 2018 national study on discrimination of LGBTI people in the workplace by CEAV and Fundaci\u00f3n Arcoiris, 43 percent of respondents reported being harassed, bullied or discriminated against in the workplace\u2026.53 [footnotes omitted]\n\u2026\nFor respondents who disclosed their gender identity to their boss, 66 percent reported \u201ctotal support\u201d and 25 percent reported \u201crejection.\u201d54 [footnotes omitted]\n[34] Sources indicate \u201cthat sexual minorities reported experiences of discrimination related to their gender identity or sexual orientation when accessing medical services.\u201d55\n[35] Accordingly, the panel finds that the PC is at risk of persecution due to his membership in a particular social group, a bisexual. The AC is at risk of persecution due to his membership in a particular social group, a gay man.\nCartel Jalisco Nueva Generaci\u00f3n (CJNG)\n[36] The US Department of State (DOS) Mexico Country Report on Human Rights 2020 states as follows:\nImpunity and extremely low rates of prosecution remained a problem for all crimes, including human rights abuses. The government\u2019s federal statistics agency estimated 94 percent of crimes were either unreported or not investigated. There were reports of some government agents who were complicit with international organized criminal gangs, and there were low prosecution and conviction rates in these abuses.56\nOrganized criminal elements, including local and transnational gangs, and narcotics traffickers, were significant perpetrators of violent crimes and committed acts of homicide, torture, kidnapping, extortion, human trafficking, bribery, intimidation, and other threats, resulting in high levels of violence, particularly targeting vulnerable groups. The government investigated and prosecuted some of these crimes, but the vast majority remained in impunity. 57\n[37] The current NDP highlights the use of family members by cartels to settle scores or silence individuals. This is relevant to the claimants\u2019 fear because of XXXX father who commenced his links with the CJNG during his career as a XXXX Item 7.13 indicates as follows:\nMeanwhile, the fact that Coronel was now viewed as a traitor by his former associates in the Beltnin Leyva family, led to the murder of his 16-year-old son, Alejandro, in April 2010.58\nThe CJNG is also believed to be responsible for serious atrocities, including the rape and murder of a rival\u2019s alleged 10-year-old daughter in 2013, and the filmed murder of a man and his young son, killed by detonating explosives strapped to their bodies.59\nBuilding further enmity between the CJNG and Sinaloa, Ivan and Jesus Alfredo Guzman, the youngest sons of \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzman were kidnapped when they ventured into CJNG\u2019s Jalisco turf in August 2016.60\n[38] While NDP item 7.12 states:\nIn August 2016, two of the sons of Sinaloa Cartel leader, Joaquin Guzman Loera, alias \u201cEl Chapo,\u201d were briefly kidnapped by the CJNG.61\n[39] The evidence establishes that cartels routinely use family members as a weapon and tool against those they wish to harm and intimidate, as a way to punish what cartels view as noncompliance or defiance.62\n[40] Accordingly, the panel finds that the claimants also face a serious risk of persecution due to their membership in a particular social group, family of corrupt XXXX XXXX. Thus, the claimants have established the objective basis for their well-founded fear of persecution.\nSTATE PROTECTION\n[41] There is a presumption that except in situations where the state is in complete breakdown, the state is capable of protecting its citizens. To rebut the presumption of state protection, a claimant must provide clear and convincing evidence of the state\u2019s inability to protect its citizens.63\n[42] A Response to Information Request indicates that in in 2015, Mexico\u2019s Supreme Court (Suprema Corte de Justicia de la Naci6n, SCJN) \u201cissued a ruling that bans on same-sex marriage were unconstitutional.\u201d64\n[43] According to sources, machismo is still embedded in Mexican culture, which increases homophobia and discrimination against sexual minorities \u2026. Sources state that in smaller towns and rural areas, there is less acceptance than in cities.65\n[44] With regards to societal attitudes in Mexico,\nDiario de Yucatan, a newspaper based in Yucatan, reported in May 2019 that a couple was denied service at a restaurant in Monterrey for being gay; according to the source, the couple entered the restaurant holding hands and were told to leave because it is a \u201cfamily environment.\u201d66\n\u2026\nSources indicate that most sexual minorities have experienced physical acts of violence or harassment based on their sexual orientation or gender identity.67\n[45] The 2021 Freedom in the World report for Mexico states that,\nMexico\u2019s justice system is plagued by delays, unpredictability, and corruption, which often lead to impunity for perpetrators of crimes.68\nWidespread bribery, limited capacity, and weak coordination undermine the lower courts\u2019 and law enforcement\u2019s integrity. According to a December 2020 government report, the vast majority of crimes committed in 2019 went unreported, largely because underpaid police were viewed as either inept or in league with criminals. When investigations were conducted, only a tiny handful of crimes ended in convictions.69\nMexicans are subject to the threat of violence at the hands of multiple actors, including individual criminals, criminal gangs that operate with impunity, and police officers who are often susceptible to bribery. A missing-persons registry\u00ad which continues to grow despite increased government efforts in recent years\u00ad reflects an epidemic of enforced disappearances. Mexicans in police or military custody are at risk of torture by the authorities and must also navigate a prison system that respects neither due process nor physical safety.70\n[46] In the NDP for Mexico,\nSources state that sexual minorities have reported cases of violence or aggression by the police and of being detained for their LGBT status\u2026. According to a report on discrimination of LGBTI people regarding access to justice and security by the CEAV and Fundaci\u00f3n Arcoiris, 31 percent of transgender women respondents and 15 percent of homosexuals said they had been detained because of their LGBTI status.71 [footnotes omitted]\n\u2026\nAccording to sources, the government does not adequately investigate crimes against sexual minorities.72\nThe report on discrimination against LGBTI people regarding access to justice and security notes that \u201cthe high percentage of people who don\u2019t report the aggressions or crimes is alarming,\u201d and indicates that the two main reasons for not reporting are mistrust and alleged inaction of the authorities.73\n[47] The claimants emphasized that despite the ruling by Mexico\u2019s Supreme Court, in 2015, progress has been slow. They testified that the reality the LGBT people face daily are primarily a homophobic society accompanied by a homophobic and corrupt police force.\n[48] The NDP74 and the documents submitted by the claimant75 make clear that there is widespread discrimination against the LGBTI community, and the state (police) is complicit in the hate crimes perpetrated against members of the LGBTQ community. The documentary evidence highlights the lack of the availability of effective protection for members of the LGBT population. It is evident that state protection is not forthcoming for the claimants due to their sexual orientation.\n[49] In these circumstances, it is clear and convincing evidence that the state is unable or unwilling to protect the claimant. Accordingly, the panel finds that the claimants have met their burden of proof, on a balance of probabilities, and that the presumption of state protection has been rebutted.\n[50] Given the corruption among police officers, and the government of Mexico, the PC testified that protection would not be forthcoming. XXXX testified that his father was co- operating with the CJNG corrupt practices. Accordingly, these criminal gangs are able to exert power and control among the complicit security forces. Thus, state protection is an illusion.\n[51] Objective documentary evidence states that, \u201c[s]ources report that the various police forces in Mexico at the municipal and state level lack human and material resources in order to properly investigate crimes committed in their jurisdiction.\u201d76\nAccording to National Survey on Victimization and Perception of Public Security (Encuesta Nacional de Victimizaci6n y Percepci6n sobre Seguridad Publica) the ENVIPE 2019, 93.2 percent of all crimes committed were either not reported or not investigated. The same source lists the following reasons given by respondents for not reporting a crime:\n\n63.2 percent blamed the police, giving the following reasons: reporting a crime was a waste of time, lack of trust in the authorities, difficulties and length of the process, the authorities\u2019 hostile attitude, or the fear of being victims of extorsion.36.2 percent of victims gave other reasons to not report a crime, such as fearing the aggressor, the crime being not important, or lacking proof.Regarding trust in law enforcement institutions, in 2019, 55.2 percent of the respondents thought that the federal police was corrupt, while 60.6 percent had the same perception of the Attorney General\u2019s Office, 64.1 percent of the state police, 65.5 percent of the state Attorney General, 67.9 percent of the municipal police and 68.4 percent of the judges.77 [footnotes omitted]\n\u2026\nThe CJNG has proven itself ready to challenge the government directly. CJNG forces have ambushed police killing more than 15, targeted federal police in ambushes in which five died, and even downed a Mexican military helicopter in a direct confrontation.78\n[52] The US Department of State (DOS) Mexico Country Report on Human Rights 2020 states as follows:\nSignificant human rights issues included: reports of the involvement by police, military, and other government officials and illegal armed groups in unlawful or arbitrary killings and forced disappearance; torture by security forces; harsh and life-threatening prison conditions in some prisons; arbitrary arrest and lengthy pretrial detention; violence against journalists and human rights defenders; serious acts of corruption; impunity for violence against women; violence targeting persons with disabilities and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex persons; and the existence of the worst forms of child labor.79\n[53] The Jalisco Cartel New Generation (Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generaci\u00f3n \u2013 CJNG) is a criminal group that has evolved as a result of killings, captures and rifts in older cartels. It is known for its aggressive use of violence and its public relations campaigns. Despite the capture of certain top leaders, it is now Mexico\u2019s foremost criminal threat and appears set to continue expanding.80\n[54] In April 2015, the CJNG killed 15 Mexican police officers during an ambush in Jalisco state, one of the single deadliest attacks on security forces in recent Mexican history. The group was also blamed for an attack in March 2015 that killed five federal police. Additionally, Mexican officials have previously indicated that the group possesses highly sophisticated armament, including machine guns and grenade launchers were used to conduct the March 2015 attack. In May 2015, the group continued its deadly streak, shooting down a military helicopter on May 1 and launching a wave of violence across Jalisco.81\n[55] According to an Amnesty International report 2020\/2021, titled Mexico State of the World\u2019s Human Rights finds that, \u201c[e]nforced disappearances by state agents and disappearances committed by non-state actors continued to be a concern; those responsible enjoyed almost total impunity.\u201d82\n[56] Mexico. World Report 2021: Events of 2020 indicates:\nThe criminal justice system routinely fails to provide justice to victims of violent crimes and human rights violations. Only 1.3 percent of crimes committed in Mexico are solved, the nongovernmental group Impunity Zero reports. Causes of failure include corruption, inadequate training and resources, and complicity of prosecutors and public defenders with criminals and other abusive officials. A 2018 reform intended to give prosecutors increased independence has not been properly implemented, local human rights and rule-of-law groups report.83\n\u2026\nHowever, prosecutors and police neglect to take even basic investigative steps to identify those responsible for enforced disappearances, often telling families of the missing to investigate on their own. The CNB reported that over 7,000 people disappeared in 2019. That year, the Attorney General\u2019s Office opened only 351 investigations into disappearances and prosecuted only 2.84\n[57] Bertelsmann Stiftung\u2019s Transformation Index (BTI) 2020, indicates that,\nAt the state level, the judiciary is totally bound to the local executives. All the governors that have been accused of fraud and corruption have been able to escape trial. Furthermore, there have been very few cases where corruption by a party, union, Congress leader or functionary is brought to justice, despite rampant corruption. 85\n\u2026\nThe situation has worsened dramatically in those places where the drugs war is intense. The situation has been aggravated by the number of people in those regions that have been disappeared. We do not know if they were abducted by criminal gangs, the army or the police. The most recent estimate is that 37,000 people have been disappeared.\nAs a consequence of impunity and the fact that official forces are in many cases involved in criminal acts, people who are victims of crime rarely report the crime to the police. People are afraid that as the police may be involved, they will be victimized again or because they feel it is useless. 97% of crimes go unsolved and thus unpunished.86\n[58] The report further indicates that, \u201c[h]uman rights advocates have consistently expressed concern about a lack of accountability for rights abuses committed by members of the military, including torture, forced disappearances, and extrajudicial executions.\u201d87\n[59] Counsel\u2019s country condition package highlights a media report which indicates an entire police department in Mexico\u2019s state of Chihuahua was arrested due to corruption.88\n[60] The panel finds that the claimants fear persecution or serious harm at the hands of organized criminal group, CJNG. Therefore, based on the objective and current documentary evidence,89 the claimants cannot avail themselves of the protection of the authorities. The security forces are complicit.\n[61] The National Documentation Package (NDP) for Mexico90 and the documents submitted by the claimant91 make clear that the state is ineffective and in these particular circumstances, there is clear and convincing evidence that the state is unable or unwilling to protect the claimants. Accordingly, the panel finds that the claimants have met the burden of proof, on a balance of probabilities, and the presumption of state protection has been rebutted.\nINTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE (IFA)\n[62] The Federal Court of Appeal established a two-part test for assessing an IFA in Rasaratnam and Thirunavukkarasu: As per Rasaratnam,\n(1) \u201cthe Board must be satisfied on a balance of probabilities that there is no serious possibility of the claimant being persecuted in the part of the country to which it finds an IFA exists\u201d92 and\/or the claimant would not be personally subject to a risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture in the IFA.\n(2) Moreover, the conditions in the part of the country considered to be an IFA must be such that it would not be unreasonable in all the circumstances including those particular to the claim, for him to seek refuge there.93\n[63] The claimants bear the burden of proof to demonstrate that they would be persecuted on a Convention ground, or subject personally, on a balance of probabilities, to a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment94 in all of Mexico.\nSexual Orientation\n[64] The claimants faced verbal abuse throughout their youth at school and within their community due to entrenched homophobic attitudes. The claimants testified that given the homophobic attitude of Mexican society, reinforced by the Catholic church, the police, and the state authorities, they would not be able to live safely and openly as a bisexual and gay couple in Mexico. The claimants testified that they intend to spend their future together and they have taken the preliminary steps towards arranging their marriage in Canada.\n[65] The AC testified that. as a XXXX XXXX he has travelled to a variety of regions within Mexico. He stated that the treatment of gay men and the homophobic attitudes prevailed.\n[66] The objective and reliable documentary evidence from a variety of reputable and current sources indicates that a viable internal flight alternative is unavailable for the claimants, a same\u00ad sex couple.95\n[67] Having carefully considered the totality of the evidence, the panel finds that there is a serious risk of persecution throughout Mexico.\nJalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG)\n[68] Documentary evidence indicates that the cartel has expanded rapidly, and the CJNG now has some sort of presence in every part of Mexico, except Sinaloa and the Golden Triangle of heroin production. 96\n[69] On the issue of the geographic spread of the CJNG in Mexico, the documentary evidence indicates that there is no greater evidence to support the notion of the CJNG as highly resilient and powerful organization than to chronicle its rapid geographic spread throughout Mexico. In a relatively short rise from 2010 to early 2018, the CJNG developed a documented presence in 24 of 32 Mexican states; when including alliances and small cells the count includes all 32 Mexican states.97\n[70] A Response to Information Request states that according to the Assistant Professor, cartels use family networks and private investigators to track people, as well as property records in the US and Mexico and placing GPS trackers on cars.98\n\u2026\nThe Assistant Professor stated that in order to extend their influence beyond their areas of operation, cartels rely on the \u201crepresentation\u201d they have in other areas.99 Reports that the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generaci6n, CJNG), a splinter group of the Sinaloa Cartel, has developed \u201cstrategic alliances\u201d with groups in other regions, including Los Zetas and Gulf Cartel splinter groups along the Gulf Coast.100\n[71] The claimants stated that the police are complicit and would enable the cartel to find them.\n[72] The RIR further finds that the Assistant Professor stated that a large debt or a personal vendetta could motivate a gang to track someone outside their area, and that gangs can use \u201ccorrupt law enforcement agents\u201d to obtain information about people they pursue.101\n[73] Documentary evidence indicates on the CJNG cartel indicates as follows:\nArea of influence: present in 27 Mexican states and \u201casserts control over the ports of Veracruz, Mazanillo, and Lazaro Cardenas.\u201d It has a presence in every part of the country, and is the \u201cdominant criminal actor in Jalisco, Nayarit and Colima, at the port of Lazaro Cardenas in Michoacan, in the eastern state of Veracruz and in the oil-rich central region of Guanajuato, Puebla, Quer\u00e9taro and Hidalgo\u201d\nAlliances: Tijuana Cartel Nueva Generation, a faction of the Juarez Cartel.102\n[74] Accordingly, the objective documentary evidence before the panel indicates that there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout Mexico from the CJNG. As a result, there is no viable IFA where the claimants could reside without a risk to their lives or their safety.\n[75] Having carefully considered the totality of the evidence, the panel finds that there is a serious risk of persecution throughout Mexico. Thus, given the particular circumstances of the claimants, a same-sex couple and having family ties to XXXX father, a former XXXX XXXX having worked in alliance with the CJNG, the claimants are known to the organized criminal cartel and their corrupt counterparts within the police force, thus, an internal flight alternative is unavailable.\nCONCLUSION\n[76] The claimants, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and his partner XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX have established that there is a reasonable chance of persecution, based on their sexual orientation if they were to return to their country of nationality, Mexico, today. They have also established that there is a reasonable chance of persecution due to their membership in a particular social group, family of corrupt XXXX, if they were to return to Mexico today.\n[77] Therefore, the panel finds the claimants to be Convention refugees.\n(signed) S.

Charow\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Udo Mandy Nwobu\nCountry: Nigeria\nRPD Number: TC0-06416\nAssociated RPD Number(s): TC0-06460 \/ TC0-06477 \/ TC0-06478\nTC0-06479\nATIP Number: A-2022-01594\nATIP Pages: N\/A\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] XXXX XXXX (\u201cthe principal claimant\u201d), his wife XXXX XXXX (\u201cthe associated claimant\u201d), and their children, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX (\u201cthe minor claimants\u201d), citizens of Nigeria, claim refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (\u201cthe IRPA\u201d).1\n[2] The claims were heard jointly as required by Rule 55 (1) of the Refugee Protection Division Rules. The principal claimant was appointed as a designated representative for the minor claimants. The minor claimants relied on the testimony of the principal claimant and the associated claimant.\n[3] In making this decision, I have considered the claimants\u2019 testimony, tendered evidence, and counsel\u2019s written submissions.2 I have also considered and applied the Chairperson\u2019s guidelines on both sexual orientation and gender.3\nALLEGATIONS\n[4] The claimants\u2019 allegations can be found in their Basis of Claim forms (\u201cBOCs\u201d)4 and their amended BOC.5 In short, the claimants allege that the principal claimant is a bisexual man who was caught with his same-sex partner. He fled the city. After he left, the principal claimant was sought by the police. The associated claimant and minor claimants fear cleansing rituals. They allege that there is no state protection available to them, nor any viable internal flight alternatives.\nDETERMINATION\n[5] I find the principal claimant to be a Convention refugee. I find that the associated claimant and the minor claimants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection as they have a viable internal flight alternative (\u201cIFA\u201d) in Port Harcourt. My reasons follow.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity and Country of Reference Are Established\n[6] The claimants\u2019 personal identities and country of reference have been established, on a balance of probabilities, by their Nigerian passports.6\nThe Claimants\u2019 Credibility Was Mixed\n[7] I find, overall, the claimants\u2019 credibility was mixed. I noted substantial and significant omissions of key events, all of which tie back to the core of the claim regarding the principal claimant\u2019s sexual orientation. When put to the claimants, these omissions were not adequately explained and each one negatively impacts the claimants\u2019 credibility.\n[8] I further noted one considerable inconsistency, regarding what happened when the principal claimant\u2019s sexual orientation was revealed to his community. The principal claimant\u2019s testimony was inconsistent with the associated claimant\u2019s testimony. This inconsistency was also inadequately explained and again negatively impacts the claimants\u2019 general credibility.\n[9] Lastly, I note that the claimants were in the United States for a lengthy period of time without seeking asylum there. I put this failure to claim asylum to the claimants and was not satisfied that their reply adequately explained the issue. This also negatively impacts their overall credibility.\n[10] I balance this with other detailed, spontaneous, and forthright lines of testimony, including how the principal claimant realized his sexual orientation and about his same-sex partners. The principal claimant\u2019s testimony about how his sexual orientation was revealed was also consistent and rang true. I further note some supporting evidence to establish the principal claimant\u2019s sexual orientation and the subsequent risk to all the claimants, specifically affidavits from the associated claimant\u2019s father, a friend of the principal claimant, their neighbour, and the principal claimant\u2019s sister.7 These affidavits have no clear issues presenting and are consistent with the claimants\u2019 allegations. I further note the presence of two police invitation letters, inviting the principal claimant to the police station to discuss his sexual orientation.8\n[11] In short, although I do find the claimants\u2019 credibility generally tarnished, I still have enough credible evidence before me to find that the principal claimant has established that he is a bisexual man and would be at risk of persecution should he return to Nigeria. I find that the principal claimant has established his subjective fear.\nNexus Is Established for The Principal Claimant\n[12] I find that there is a link between what the principal claimant fears and one of the five Convention grounds due to his membership in a particular social group as a bisexual man. His claim has therefore been assessed under section 96 of the IRPA.\nAn Objective Basis Has Been Established for the Principal Claimant\n[13] I further find that the principal claimant has an objective basis for his fears, as per the documented conditions for Nigeria. I note that Nigerian legislation effectively all forms of activity supporting or promoting lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex rights. According to the law, anyone convicted of entering into a same-sex marriage or civil union may be sentenced to up to 14 years\u2019 imprisonment. The law also criminalizes the public show of same-sex \u201camorous affection.\u201d9 Furthermore, there are many incidences of mob violence against LGTBTQ individuals. Law enforcement agents consider the vigilantes\u2019 attacks as an intervention to ease their work to enforce peace in the community; therefore, the victims are the ones who get arrested on the basis of homosexuality and face more stigma, discrimination, unlawful arrest, and detention, extortion and rape.10\n[14] As both subjective fear and objective basis has been established for the principal claimant, I find that he has a well-founded fear of persecution.\nThere Is No State Protection or Internal Flight Alternative Available for The Principal Claimant\n[15] As per the above analysis, same-sex sexual activity is criminalized throughout Nigeria and homophobic violence continues with impunity. I therefore find that there is clear and convincing evidence that state protection would not be available to the principal claimant.\n[16] Likewise, I find that there is nowhere in Nigeria where the principal claimant would not face a serious possibility of persecution due to his sexual orientation. As the test for an IFA fails on the first prong, I find there is no viable IFA for the principal claimant.\nThe Remaining Claimants Have A Viable IFA In Port Harcourt\n[17] As I have accepted that the principal claimant is a bisexual man, I also accept that there is a corresponding danger for his wife and children (the remaining claimants) as alleged. However, I must determine if there is another place in Nigeria that it is both safe and reasonable for the remaining claimants.\n[18] In short, to determine whether a viable IFA exists, I must consider a two-prong test.11 I must be satisfied that, on a balance of probabilities, there is no serious possibility of the claimants being persecuted in the part of the country in which I find an IFA exists. Furthermore, conditions in that proposed part of the country must be such that it would not be unreasonable, in all circumstances, including those particular to the claimants, for them to seek refuge there.\n[19] As the claimants were originally from Lagos, I proposed IFA locations of Abuja and Port Harcourt to the claimants. I find that, on a balance of probabilities, the remaining claimants do not face a serious possibility of persecution or risk of harm under section 97 of the IRPA in Port Harcourt and it is not unreasonable for the claimants to relocate to Port Harcourt.\nThe Remaining Claimants Would Be Safe in Port Harcourt\n[20] The associated claimant testified that it would not be safe in Port Harcourt because if people by there happen to find out about the principal claimant\u2019s sexual orientation or what had happened to the claimants by chance, they will start \u201cwarring\u201d against the remaining claimants. When asked how people in Port Harcourt would find out about what had happened, the associated claimant replied that her calls would be traceable.\n[21] The onus of disproving a proposed IFA falls to the claimants. In this case, I find that the claimants\u2019 allegations about the risk in Port Harcourt do not disprove the IFA on the first prong of the test.\n[22] The associated claimant testified that the people in Port Harcourt could find out about what had happened to the claimants \u201cby chance\u201d. To be clear, I do not draw a negative credibility inference from this allegation \u2013 I accept that the claimants believe this. However, saying that they may be discovered by chance \u2013 without a further explanation as to how regular people in Port Harcourt (or the principal claimant\u2019s family in Lagos) may discover them \u2013 is entirely speculative. There has been no evidence tendered to establish this and therefore it does not rebut this prong of the test for an IFA.\n[23] I turn to the second argument made, specifically that the claimants could be traced through the associated claimant\u2019s telephone. I find that this also does not rebut this prong of the IFA. This is because there is no evidence to establish that the people the claimants alleged to fear could access any telephone records.\n[24] I have accepted that the claimants fear the Nigeria Police in Lagos and I must consider whether the remaining claimants would face any risk from them in Port Harcourt. However, there is no confirmation that there is any implemented communication system between police forces or other authorities in Nigeria that would be able to track the claimants. Although I note the presence of a national database, there is no indication that it has been fully implemented. The available documentary evidence states that is limited to nominal data, stolen and lost travel documents, and stolen motor vehicles.12 I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the Nigeria Police would not be able to track the remaining claimants should they relocate to Port Harcourt.\nIt Would Be Reasonable for The Remaining Claimants To Relocate Ta Port Harcourt\n[25] The claimants allege that they would not be able to relocate to Port Harcourt because the associated claimant could not get a job there or open another business because she doesn\u2019t know anyone there and it is hard to get jobs. She testified that the children could not go to school there because they don\u2019t know anyone there and can\u2019t live there. She also stated that there would be a language barrier in Port Harcourt.\n[26] In considering this IFA, I am mindful that the Federal Court of Appeal has set a very high threshold for the unreasonableness prong of the IFA test. Indeed, \u201cit requires nothing less than the existence of conditions which would jeopardize the life and safety of a claimant.\u201d13 The Federal Court of Appeal has also been clear that the personal circumstances of a claimant must be central to the reasonableness analysis.14 The question to be answered on the second prong of the test is whether expecting the claimant to relocate to the proposed IFA location would be \u201cunduly harsh.\u201d15\n[27] I further note that I must consider whether the principal claimant would return to Nigeria with the rest of his family, even though his claim is to be accepted. I find that it has not been established that he will \u2013 there has been no corroborating evidence nor testimony tendered to support that speculation. I therefore assess the reasonableness of the proposed IFA for only the remaining claimants, as a female-headed household with four young children (the three minor claimants and one Canadian-born child, who although is not a claimant, must still be considered with regards to their impact on the IFA for the remaining claimants).\n[28] I have also considered the Chairperson\u2019s Guidelines, as cited above, especially as they relate to the claimants\u2019 ability to travel safely to the IFA and to stay there without facing undue hardship.\n[29] For the reasons as outlined below, in all the circumstances, including those particular to the remaining claimants, conditions in Port Harcourt are such that it would not be unreasonable for the claimants to seek refuge there.\n[30] According to the UK Home Office report on internal relocation in Nigeria, generally, a person fearing a non-state actor is likely to be able to relocate to another part of Nigeria depending on the nature of the threat from the non-state agent(s) and the individual circumstances of the person.16 Although there is a fear of the police, I have found that the police could not locate the remaining claimants. I also note that Nigerians have the right to and can generally freely travel around their country.17 Port Harcourt has an airport as well.18\n[31] Although relocation in Port Harcourt could be \u201crelatively difficult\u201d for single women, especially if they have a low level of education or do not benefit from financial support,19 I note that this is not the case for the associated claimant. The associated claimant testified she has a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, which is much higher than the national average for education in Nigeria.20 She has XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and has XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. In Canada, she has upgraded skills and is currently completing a program to XXXX XXXX all transferable skills. I find that these are all factors that will facilitate the remaining claimant\u2019s relocation to Port Harcourt.\n[32] I do note that country document evidence indicates that it is difficult to find work in the formal sector but there are opportunities to work in the informal sector such as trading,21 which would be very similar to the associated claimant\u2019s own work experience.\n[33] I further note that among working Nigerians, 57.37 % of women were working full time and 70% of working women were self-employed,22 even though gender inequality is widespread in Nigeria and women tend to find it harder to obtain paid work. However, there is evidence that there is a \u201cwithering of cultural restrictions on the perception of women in public affairs\u201d and an \u201cincreasing tendency of women to take up economic roles in the family previously reserved for men and to question the myth of the \u2018male-as-breadwinner\u2019 in many middle-class and low\u00ad income families.\u201d23\n[34] Having found it is likely that the associated claimant could obtain suitable employment, I find that it is also likely that the remaining claimants could obtain suitable housing. In terms of housing, I also accept that affordability is not the only issue and that country document evidence \u201cindicates that relocation may present greater challenges for single women who do not have access to a support network.\u201d24 However, despite these challenges, many women do indeed head their own households in Nigeria\u2019s southern states. 14.7% of rural households and 21.8% of urban households are headed by women.25\n[35] Female heads of households may encounter discrimination in seeking accommodation and be stigmatized for living alone, especially if they do not have adequate economic resources or male advocates and this may also make them vulnerable to sexual exploitation, as alleged by the claimants. However, an exception to this discrimination may be the case of accommodation offered by formal real estate firms, in which case what matters is the ability to pay and not social norms, gender, or marital status.26\n[36] In terms of language in Port Harcourt, in Nigeria, Pidgin English is spoken by most of the population and that this ensures that language is not an obstacle. 27 The remaining claimants speak English.28 I also note that most Nigerian towns and all large cities have quite large migrant communities from other parts of the country.29 Furthermore, the evidence indicates that non-indigenes are entitled to access essential public services, including health care, primary and secondary education; however, societal norms discourage them from attempting to do so.30 I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the minor claimants (and the Canadian-born child if need be) could access education, even if it requires the payment of school fees. There is no indication as well that the claimants could not freely practice their religion, as there are large Christian populations throughout Nigeria.31\n[37] The claimants have submitted that Port Harcourt would be an unreasonable IFA as there would be no available treatment for the principal claimant\u2019s mental health conditions. But the principal claimant, as outlined above, has not stated that he would return to Nigeria should the remaining claimants return to Nigeria. No evidence has been tendered regarding any of the remaining claimants\u2019 mental health.\n[38] I accept that relocation to Port Harcourt may be difficult for the remaining claimants. However, difficult circumstances do not make Port Harcourt an unreasonable IFA location in the context of a refugee claim. While the remaining claimants\u2019 circumstances may be difficult, I cannot find that these conditions will necessarily place the claimants in jeopardy, the high bar set by the existing jurisprudence. These factors alone are not capable of sustaining a refugee claim and nor do they suggest that the claimants\u2019 life would be in jeopardy or at risk of persecution.\nCONCLUSION\n[39] For the above reasons, I find that the principal claimant is a Convention refugee under section 96 of the IRPA, as he faces a serious possibility of persecution upon return to Nigeria.\n[40] His claim is therefore accepted.\n[41] As the remaining claimants have an IFA in Port Harcourt that is safe and reasonable in their particular circumstances, I find they do not face a serious possibility of persecution in Nigeria. The finding of an IFA also applies to the IRPA section 97(1) as, on a balance of probabilities, the remaining claimants do not face a danger of torture, or risk to life, or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. Consequently, the remaining claimants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection.\n[42] Their claims are accordingly denied.\n(signed) S.

Razak\nCountry: India\nRPD Number: TC0-05774\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2022-01594\nATIP Pages: N\/A\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: This is the decision of the Refugee Protection Division in the claim of XXXX XXXX TC0-05774. Mr. XXXX you claim to be a citizen of India and is claiming refugee protection pursuant to Section 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. I have considered your testimony and the other evidence in the case and I am ready to render my decision orally.\n[2] I find that you are a Convention refugee as you have satisfied the burden of establishing a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground in India based on your membership in a particular social group based on your sexual orientation.\n[3] In coming to this determination I have considered the Chairpersons Guidelines, guideline 9 proceedings before the IRB involving sexual orientation and gender identity and expression.\n[4] I find that there is a nexus between the harm that you fear in India and the Convention ground of a particular social group. Therefore your case will be assessed pursuant to Section 96.\n[5] Your allegations are set out in your Basis of Claim form, which can be found at Exhibit 2. In summary, you allege fear of persecution at the hands of the Indian authorities, your family members and particularly your father and the society at large based on your sexual orientation.\n[6] I am satisfied that your personal and national identity as a citizen of India has been established on a balance of probabilities by way of your testimony and a true copy of your Indian passport found at Exhibit 1. When a claimant affirms to tell the truth this creates a presumption of truthfulness unless there is evidence to contrary. You testified in a straightforward, spontaneous and unhesitating manner and your answers to my questions that I proposed about the central aspects of your claim were detail and unrehearsed. There were no material inconsistencies in your testimony or contradictions between your testimony and the other evidence that was before me today.\n[7] Your testimony was consistent and in content and was chronological. In particular, your testimony about your identity as a gay man was detailed, natural and clear based on your own personal experiences growing up in India in a household of the Orthodox Roman Catholic faith. You testified growing up in India as an only child you tended to stay to yourself because you were shy. Your testimony was that your father did not like the way that you behaved and would scold you because of it. You were able to testify about how unhappy this made you feel growing up. Your testimony was that you had a close relationship with your mother however when asked why you did not provide a support letter from her, you indicated that individuals in the community and your family already thought that your father left her because of you and because of that you did not want to add any more stress and troubles to her life. Given your profile I take no issues with your response.\n[8] Your testimony was that growing up you did not know what your sexuality was, however, you were able to express to me when you first started having feelings for the same sex. Your testimony was that it was during your teen years and you were even able to point out a couple of actors from your country who you had a boyhood crush on. You were able to express what the social and religious views were in India regarding same-sex attraction and you testified that you did not accept these views but you kept your feelings to yourself out of fear of not knowing what might happen to you, especially since you already had a strained relationship with your father. You testified that after high school your mother suggested that you attend school abroad as it would make your life easier and you could live freely. As such you made your way to Canada on a student visa.\n[9] You\u2019ve also provided spontaneous and straightforward testimony about your activities in Canada as far as your schooling and the renewal of your student visa. Your testimony was that you met your current partner (inaudible) in 2017 when you shared a house with him and five other individuals. Your testimony was that the two of you shared a room and you did have a crush on him but you dared not to tell him because you did not know if he was gay. Your testimony was that because you were roommates you developed a close friendship and you shared the same birthdays. You indicated that in 2019 on your birthdays you shared with him the troubles that you were having back home and that you were gay. He in tum confided in you and told you that he was gay as well and had made a refugee claim.\n[10] You testified at that point the two of you started to date. Your testimony was that (inaudible) was your first boyfriend and your first gay experience. You were able to tell me the things that the two of you did together such as walks, going to the movies and what Netflix shows that you both liked to watch, as well as you expressed elements of his personality that drew you to him. What I found compelling was your testimony about when you two are together you are happy and relieved and that now you have someone that you can talk to openly and who is there for you.\n[11] In support of your claim, (inaudible) came to testify at your hearing today and his testimony was in line with what you have alleged. You also (inaudible) of photographs which you were able to also talk about and they also collaborate what you have alleged, which can be found at Exhibit 4.\n[12] I find that you have established on a balance of probabilities that your sexuality was first brought to your attention as a teenager back in India, number one. Number two, that you never acted on such feelings in India because you were afraid. Number three, while in Canada you started a relationship with (inaudible). And number four, that you do identify as a gay man. I\u2019ve also found on a balance of probabilities that you have established a subjective fear in India due to your sexual orientation.\n[13] The objective evidence is consistent with your accounts of fearing persecution in India. In the Supreme Court case of NAVTEJ, Sang Johar versus Union of India Supreme Court case, it determined that Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code which prohibits consensual same-sex relations was unconstitutional and a violation of international human rights obligations which were binding on India. The question addressed in this report a concern that the degree to which these principals have been implemented in society. They concluded that members of the LGBTQ community face discrimination which impedes civil, cultural, economic, political and social rights. In addition they are at a risk of violence. They encounter difficulties from both state actors and members of civil society in assessing such public services as water, sanitation, and transportation.\n[14] It is well documented in the National Documentation Package and from the country conditions and several other news articles that your counsel provided, several articles which can be found at Exhibit 5 regarding members of the LGBTQ community that they face discrimination and human rights violation in all aspects of employment including impediments with respect to education, training which is mocked by violence, bullying or harassment. It also notes that they may experience discrimination in seeking employment or lack of job security if they are employed. Harassment and arbitrary discriminatory dismissal have been identified as problems.\n[15] Members of the LGBTQ community also face discrimination and verbal or physical assaults when trying to access public spaces by the police or other authorities as well as by members of the public. There are reports of police making selective use of various laws such as begging, public nuisance, sex work or to target and harass them. They can experience problems assessing private property which is open to the public, including shopping mails, restaurants, businesses and hotels. Discrimination can take form of evasive surveillance, charging higher prices, refusal to serve and denial of access.\n[16] Item 6.1 of the NDP indicates that there has been a surge of LGBTQ events and activities since September of 2018 legislation of the same-sex relationships. However a BBC report indicates that this does not mean that the public attitude has changed. Although gay pubs exist, patrons are at risk of being attacked in nearby streets after they leave.\n[17] Despite decriminalization, sexual minorities continue to experience violence, harassment and widespread social discrimination. One source indicates that members of the LGBT community are at risk for blackmail, rape and sexual violence. Although discrimination based on sexual orientation is prohibited in India, this does not apply to about 90 percent of the employment which is not part of the formal sector. Sexual minorities have a long way to go before their rights are fully respected. Indian laws do not protect against conversion therapy, hate crimes, incitement or discrimination in employment in the non-formal sector.\n[18] Reports state that the police use violence, abuse, harassment and threats to arrest and intimidate sexual minorities although police now receive awareness training about LGBT issues after the decriminalization, this document does not include sources which indicate how effective this has been or what changes have taken place with respect to police practices.\n[19] I find that the country conditions and the documentation regarding the situation in India regarding sexual minorities coupled with your credible declarations has led me to find that you have established a serious possibility of persecution in India based on your sexual orientation if you are to return to India. Accordingly I find that your fear has an objective basis and is well-founded.\n[20] The widespread nature and frequency of the attacks on sexual minorities described in the country conditions clearly and convincingly demonstrates that Indian authorities are either complacent or unable to prevent such events. As such there is a presumption of state protection unless the state is in a condition of complete breakdown. This presumption has been rebutted with clear and convincing evidence. Based on your personal circumstances and the fact that the state is the agent of persecution and the objective country documentation, I find that you have rebutted the presumption of state protection and that state protection would not be reasonably forthcoming or available to you in your particular circumstances.\n[21] I\u2019ve also had an opportunity to consider whether there is an Internal Flight Alternative exists for you. The evidence suggests that there is serious possibility of persecution throughout the entire country based on your sexual orientation given the widespread attacks on the LGBT community. As the state is the agent of persecution and the area remains widespread to social discrimination against LGBTQ persons, I find that no IFA is available for you.\n[22] Having considered the totality of the evidence, I find that there is a serious possibility that you would face persecution in India based on your sexual orientation. Accordingly I find that you are a Convention refugee pursuant to Section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection and therefore I accept your claim.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2021 RLLR 50\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: February 3, 2021\nPanel: Matthew Weston\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): N\/A\nCountry: Kenya\nRPD Number: TC0-05375\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2022-01594\nATIP Pages: N\/A\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: Okay, so this is the decision in the refugee claim made by XXXX XXXX and the file number is TC0-05375. So, sir, you claim to be a citizen of Kenya and you are claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1), the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[2] In rendering my decision, I have considered the Chairperson\u2019s guideline 9 on claims involving sexual orientation, gender identity and expression and for the reasons I follow, I find that you are a convention refugee. Your allegations can be found in your basis of claim form, found in Exhibit 2, but to summarise, you alleged persecution at the hands of state and non-state actors due to your sexual orientation, namely as a gay man.\n[3] With respect to your identity, I find that you have established your persona! and national identities on a balance of probabilities and you have done this through your Kenyan passport, a certified true copy of which can be found in Exhibit 1. You also provided me with numerous identity documents both from Canada and from Kenya, but I also relied on your national identity card, which can be found in Exhibit 5 at annex 2.\n[4] In terms of your credibility, there are certain aspects of your claim that I found that you have not established on a balance of probabilities. You alleged that you are wanted by the police in Kenya right at this time for having same sex relationship, so you testified that you had a one night stand with a man in Kenya and he sought medical attention and the doctor determined that he had engaged in same sex sexual conduct and the doctor was legally obligated to inform the police. Beyond this, you could not tell me how you were discovered by the police or how you became wanted by the police, you provided a charge sheet, two charge sheets actually, both are found in Exhibit 5 at annex 1. So, the charge sheet lists that you are charged with a natural offenses contrary to section 162 of the penal code. You also provided the same charge sheet for the man that you alleged that you had same sex relationship with. You testified that it was your mother who has given these documents and she is one who sent them to you, you were unable to tell me how your mother obtained the charge sheet for the other man and I don \u2018t find it reasonable that your mother would have been given the charge sheet for your co-accused.\n[5] I also had issues with the appearance of the charge sheets, as I questioned you on, there was a line going through that cuts off some of the writing, or goes through some of the writing. The stamp in the bottom right of both charge sheets appears to be printed on the page and then on top of that it signed in pen, so based on these concerns, I find that these documents are not credible or trustworthy and I give them no weight in establishing that you are wanted by the authorities in Kenya.\n[6] You also provided the original version of an arrest warrant that is found in the same Exhibit in annex as the previous documents, it is Exhibit 5, annex 1. On the arrest warrant, I noted that the writing gets cut off from the side of the page, you testified that it was likely cut off because when making a copy. However, the arrest warrant that was provided to me was the original and it was written in pen, so I did not find it reasonable that the arrest warrants writing would be cut off on the side given the fact that it is original.\n[7] The arrest warrants also list you and the man that you alleged that you had same sex relationship with and I don\u2019t find it reasonable that two people who are unrelated would be listed on the same arrest warrant. So, again based on these concerns I find that this is not a credible or trustworthy document and I give it no weight.\n[8] Lastly, you provided a post rape care form from the ministry of health, you couldn\u2019t tell me why this was given to your mother or why it was provided, and I indicated to you that the form appears to have been altered in many places and that there are clearly two different forms of ink used, and that the writing in certain areas has been scratched out or whited out throughout the form. For instance the box that indicates the sex of the victim appears to have initially been checked off as female, but has been scratched out and the male box. The box that indicates the victim was a male was then checked off. The form also indicates that the victim who is a male, suffered vaginal injuries, again this is indicated by the check box on the side as well at the bottom there was a diagram for the medical professional to detail the injuries, and again the diagram and the details indicates that there were injuries to the female genitalia. You were unable to provide any sufficient reason as to why this would be the case and so I find that this is not a credible or trustworthy document and give this document no weight as well. As such I find that you have not established that you are wanted by the authorities in Kenya at this time on balance of probabilities.\n[9] Despite this, I do find that you have established your sexual orientation on a balance of probabilities. You provided credible testimony that was detailed and spontaneous, you gave credible testimony about when you first noticed that you were attracted to men, and you even detailed your first same sex sexual relationship with another male, you mentioned that this was in high school when you were about the age of 14, you were able to give me spontaneous and very detailed testimony about what attracted you to him, what qualities of his you were attracted to, you also gave very detailed testimony about the struggles that you had regarding accepting and identifying your sexual orientation. I found this to be the most credible of your testimony.\n[10] You testified that you often thought about this and you struggled with this for a very long time and you testified that it was a very long process for you to accept that you are a gay. You testified that you are your family\u2019s only son and that this made even harder for you to accept yourself as being gay. You testified that you tried hard to supress these feeling, but you were eventually able to accept who you are. You testified that you opened up to your mother and she to your surprise even she accepted you and continues to love you and care for you as just as much as before.\n[11] You testified that this was a great comfort to you and aided you in continuing to accept yourself. Again I find your testimony in this regard to be very credible.\n[12] You also provided detailed testimony about some of your other same sex relationships that you had in the past. You provided detailed testimony and supporting documentation to establish one relationship in particular that you had from 2015 until 2018, to corroborate this you provided text messages and photographs, these can be found in Exhibit 5 at annex 4 and 7 respectively.\n[13] You also provided text messages from a friend and another former partner which can be found in Exhibit 5 at annex 5 and 6 as well. Overall, I find that your testimony in this regard was consistent with the documentation that you provided and I find that you have established that you were involved in same sex relationships in the past on the balance of probabilities.\n[14] You also provided detailed testimony about the struggle that LGBT people face in Kenya as the government does not accept you or grant you the rights guaranteed to all citizens in the constitution. You testified that it is difficulty to live openly and freely in Kenya and you testified that you do fear being arrested by the authorities. Despite my finding that you are not wanted by the police currently, I do find that the objective documentary evidence makes it clear that LGBT people do risk imprisonment if their sexual orientation is discovered.\n[15] You also testified credibly about the overall attitude of the Kenyan society towards LGBT people. As a result I find that you have established on a balance of probabilities that you are a gay man and that you faced a serious possibility of persecution and that you have a subjective fear of persecution based on those grounds.\n[16] I further find that there is a link between what you fear and one of the 5 convention grounds, specifically due to your membership in a particular social group, namely as a gay man. Therefore, I have assessed your claim under section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. I also find that you have an objective basis for your fear because of the documented conditions for Kenya as per the evidence in the national documentation package which is found in Exhibit 3. Item 6.1 of the NDP states that having sexual relations with people of the same sex is considered a crime and is punishable by up to 14 years in prison.\n[17] Item 2.1 states that the constitution does not explicitly protect LGBTI persons from discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. The penal code criminalises carnal knowledge against the order of nature, which was interpreted to prohibit consensual same sex sexual activity and specifies a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment if convicted. The same report goes on to indicate that police have and do continue to detain people under these laws. This excerpt in particular is in line with your testimony about Kenya\u2019s constitution and also you did testify that police continued to detain people under these laws and again this corroborates that.\n[18] Continuing on item 6.2, states that the suicidal attitudes towards same sexual relationships are generally intolerant and LGBT people face gross human rights violations in Kenya. In item 6.6 states that the president has come out recently and said that he will not accept practices that are in conflict with Kenyan culture, he says that Kenya\u2019s culture believes that homosexuality is not a human right and he considers gay rights a non-issue for the government to consider.\n[19] Therefore, I find that your subjective fear has an objective basis and that you have a well-founded fear persecution due to your sexual orientation. I also found that you have rebutted the presumption of state protection. You fear the state as an agent of persecution because engaging in same sex sexual conduct in Kenya is considered a crime and is punishable with jail time.\n[20] In Kenya, the police are also known to not provide protection to LGBT people in fact they are known to be just as likely to persecute LGBTI persons as they are to protect them. Item 6.1 of NDP details an incident where a gay man was stabbed and he reported this to the police only to be arrested himself and charged sodomy. So again, with this in mind I find that adequate state protection would not be available to you in Kenya.\n[21] With respect to an internal flight alternative given the conditions that are documented in the country, I further find that there would be a serious possibility of persecution for you anywhere in Kenya, as there are laws criminalising same sex sexual conduct throughout the country. This would prevent you from living freely and openly in Kenya and therefore, I find that there is no viable internal flight alternative for you.\n[22] In conclusion based on the totality of the evidence, I find that you are a convention refugee and I therefore accept your claim.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014-REASONS CONCLUDED\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2021 RLLR 49\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: April 12, 2021\nPanel: Tamara Thomas\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Aleksandr Radin\nCountry: Turkey\nRPD Number: TB9-33040\nAssociated RPD Number(s):\nATIP Number: A-2022-01594\nATIP Pages: N\/A\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] The Claimant, XXXX XXXX XXXX (\u201cClaimant\u201d), is a citizen of Turkey claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (\u201cIRPA\u201d).\nDETERMINATION\n[2] Having considered the totality of the evidence, I find the Claimant to be a Convention refugee under section 96 of the IRPA as he would face a serious possibility of persecution on the basis of his membership in a particular social group, specifically, due to his sexual orientation as a gay man, should he return to Turkey.\nALLEGATION\n[3] The allegations of this claim are found in the Claimant\u2019s Basis of Claim (\u201cBOC\u201d) form and subsequent amendment. In essence, the Claimant is a 28-year-old man who alleges harm from Turkish society, Turkish authorities, and his family, in particular his father and his uncles, due to his sexual orientation. The Claimant identifies as gay. He also alleges a fear of harm arising from his father\u2019s perceived and actual political opinion as a Hizmet supporter (referred to as the Fethullah Terrorist Organization, or \u201cFETO\u201d, by the Turkish state). The Claimant\u2019s father is a member of the military and has already been investigated, tried and released due to his perceived membership with FETO. The Claimant alleges his house was raided in October 2019, while he was still in Turkey, and the gendarmerie detained both himself and his father. The Claimant alleges his family learned of his sexual orientation during this raid. The Claimant also alleges fear of harm due to identifying as agnostic, as well as his conscientious objection to military service. He alleges that state protection is not available to him and that he would not be able to live safely anywhere in Turkey.\nANALYSIS\n[4] In making this assessment, I have considered all the evidence, including the oral testimony and documentary evidence entered as exhibits. I have also considered the Chairperson \u2018s Guideline 9: Proceedings Before the IRB Involving Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression.i\nIDENTITY\n[5] I am satisfied of the Claimant\u2019s personal and national identity as a citizen of Turkey, which has been established on a balance of probabilities by his genuine Turkish passport, a copy of which is in evidence.ii The original was seized upon the Claimant making his refugee claim in Canada.\nNEXUS\n[6] I find the Claimant has established, on a balance of probabilities, a link between what he fears and a Convention ground; specifically, on the basis of his membership in a particular social group, due to his sexual orientation. This claim will therefore be assessed under s. 96 of the IRPA.\nCREDIBILITY\n[7] When a claimant swears that certain facts are true, this creates a presumption that they are true unless there is valid reason to doubt their veracity.iii The determination as to whether a claimant\u2019s evidence is credible is made on a balance of probabilities.\n[8] Overall, I find the Claimant to have been a credible witness. While there were some internal inconsistences and inconsistences between the documents and the Claimant\u2019 s testimony, discussed below, which I find are sufficient to rebut the presumption of truthfulness, I find that in considering his testimony overall in addition with the documentary evidence before me, the Claimant\u2019s credibility as regards his sexual orientation has been made out on a balance of probabilities. The Claimant\u2019s testimony was generally consistent with his narrative and with the documentary evidence on country conditions in Turkey. He testified generally about his experiences in Turkey, the ways in which he would try to keep his sexual orientation hidden from others and his family, provided the names of some his LGBTQ-identified friends in Turkey and, importantly, testified in detail about his previous partners. On balance, I find in this case that the level of detail the Claimant was able to provide about his previous partners was substantial and it significantly assisted in establishing his credibility as relates to his own sexual orientation.\n[9] The Claimant also provided some documentary evidence to support his claim, found at Exhibits 6 through 8, including letters of support from previous partners and LGBTQ-identified friends in Turkey. These letters are accompanied by identity documents for the writers.iv There were some concerns about some of the ID documents provided for these individualsv. These concerns were put to the Claimant at the hearing. I find ultimately however that these concerns are not sufficient on their own, without more, to call into question the reliability or genuine nature of the letters and I assign them full weight.\n[10] There was a significant concern arising from a discrepancy between the Claimant\u2019s forms, narrative, and testimony regarding when he moved from Bursa to Afyon. Specifically, the Claimant\u2019 s visa application to Canada and his Schedule A form suggest he did not move to Afyon until XXXX 2019.vi This discrepancy is significant as the Claimant alleges to have met his partner, XXXX, in Afyon in mid-September 2018 and that XXXX returned to Istanbul in XXXX 2019, while the Claimant remained in Afyon.vii The letter of support from XXXX also indicates that they couple met in the fall of 2018 and corroborates that XXXX moved to Istanbul in XXXX 2019.viii\n[11] When this discrepancy was put to him, the Claimant appeared confused. The Claimant\u2019s Counsel revisited the issue in his questions, at which point the Claimant accepted that he must have relocated to Afyon by XXXX 2018. He testified that the company he worked for was physically located in Bursa, but given his line of work, he did not need to go into the office and could work remotely. He testified that when he first started working for the company, he initially travelled to Bursa approximately four days a week. The commute time would be just over 3 hours each way, but he needed the job. He started working remotely approximately a month after working there. He accepted the proposition that the dates listed in the \u201caddress history\u201d of his Schedule A form was likely a mistake and that the reason Bursa was listed under the \u201cpersonal history\u201d section of that form was because his company was physically located there.\n[12] The Claimant\u2019s testimony has not addressed my concerns. I find the Claimant\u2019s testimony that his forms indicate he was in Bursa until 2019 because this is where is company was physically located is not borne out by evidence before me. Specifically, I find it concerning that all the Claimant\u2019s forms requesting a history of where he was located, including those completed before the Claimant came to Canada, would provide the same timeline. I find this suggests that this was not simply a mistake. Further, the \u201cpersonal history\u201d section of his Schedule A form also indicates that he was in Bursa, unemployed, prior to starting his job in 2018, and after ending his employment in XXXX 2019. It would not make sense for the Claimant to indicate he was in Bursa prior and subsequent to being employed by this company if the only reason he wrote Bursa in the \u201cpersonal history\u201d section of the forms was because the company was located there. I find the balance of the evidence before me establishes that it is more likely than not that the Claimant did not move to Afyon with his family in XXXX 2018 as alleged in his narrative. This discrepancy results in a negative inference regarding the Claimant\u2019s overall credibility.\n[13] I note, however, that the Claimant was able to provide detailed testimony about XXXX. and their time together, as well as his other same-sex partners in Turkey. As noted above, letters of support have been provided by several of these individuals. Given this, I am prepared to give the Claimant the benefit of the doubt despite my lingering concerns arising form the discrepancy detailed above. I therefore find the Claimant has established, on a balance of probabilities, it is more likely than not that he was in a romantic relationship with XXXX while in Turkey. I also find that, when weighed as a whole, there is sufficient credible evidence before me to establish, on a balance of probabilities, that the Claimant has also been involved in other same-sex relationships in Turkey. This, along with his testimony regarding his own personal experiences, is sufficient to establish, on a balance of probabilities, his sexual orientation.\n[14] I find that, having established his sexual orientation, the Claimant has also established his subjective fear on a balance of probabilities.\nObjective Basis\n[15] I find that this claim is objectively well-founded, as illustrated in the country conditions documents provided by the Claimantix and the information contained in the National Documentation Package (\u201cNDP\u201d) for Turkey.x\n[16] The US Department of State\u2019s 2019 Country Report for Turkey includes violence against lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTQI+) persons on its list of significant human rights issues for the country.xi Although same-sex sexual activity is legally permitted in Turkey, LGBTQI+ people continue to experience widespread discrimination, intimidation, police harassment, and violent crimes, including murder. Harassment and abuse against the LGBTQI+ community are reportedly common, with an increase in homophobic and transphobic assaults during the state of emergency.xii These assaults have continued despite the end of the state of emergency.xiii LGBTQI+ persons are still victims of honor killings by family members and there remains considerable social pressure for lesbian and gay individuals to enter heterosexual marriages and produce children.xiv\n[17] The government at both at local and state-wide levels continue to espouse and support anti\u00ad LGBTQI+ sentiment with its actions and statements. Pro-government media and high-level officials, including the president, have been noted to frequently make derogatory comments and statements about homosexuality. Recently, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the head of the Religious Affairs Directorate said in a Ramadan sermon that Islam condemned homosexuality because it brought disease and blamed it for the spread of HIV. These statements were subsequently supported publicly by the President and other cabinet ministers.xv LGBTQI+ organizations have reported a sharp increase in campaigns of intimidation and harassment targeting individuals or planned events. Bans on LGBTQI+ events in recent years have continued, with attendees forcefully and violently dispersed by the police through the use of batons, tear gas, water cannons, and rubber bullets and detained by police for several hours. Police harassment of LGBTI+ persons remain common, and LGBTQI+ individuals have been taken into custody in Turkey due to social media posts and comments on social media sites such as Facebook.xvi\n[18] Hate speech against LGBTQI+ persons is not effectively persecuted and is often found to fall within the boundaries of freedom of speech. Sexual orientation and gender identity are still not protected grounds in hate crime law. The lack of explicit legal protection for LGBTQI+ individuals has amounted to a tacit legal endorsement of acts of violence and discrimination. There is widespread discrimination against LGBTQI+ people in education, employment, health, housing, and access to services. References in the law relating to \u201coffenses against public morality,\u201d \u201cprotection of the family,\u201d and \u201cunnatural sexual behavior,\u201d have been used as a basis for abuse by police and for discrimination by employers. LGBTQI+ people continue to be treated negatively in the workplace on a regular basis and often have to conceal their sexual and gender identity at work or risk facing repercussions.xvii\n[19] This objective country condition evidence is consistent with and supports the Claimant\u2019s allegations of persecution and harm were he to live openly as a gay man. I find that, when considered as a whole, the documentary evidence establishes that it is more likely than not that LGBTQ+ persons are persecuted and unable to live openly without fear of being harmed in Turkey and that the level of discrimination in Turkey amounts to persecution given its pervasive and widespread nature, including the inability of LGBTQI+ individuals to live openly in Turkey while simultaneously accessing services that are essential for their livelihood, such as work, housing, or health services.\n[20] I therefore find the Claimant has established a well-founded fear of persecution on the basis of his sexual orientation.\n[21] The Claimant has also raised allegations of harm based on his political opinion due to his perceived membership with the Hizmet movement, as well as on the basis of his conscientious objection to military service and agnosticism. However, given I have found the Claimant has established his claim on the basis of his sexual orientation, I will not engage in an assessment of the other alleged grounds put forward.\nState protection would not be available\n[22] Given the foregoing, I find there is sufficiently clear and convincing evidence to find the presumption of state protection to be rebutted. In practice, law enforcement officials and the judiciary take a lenient attitude towards crimes committed against LGBTQI+ individuals. A May 2020 Kaos GL report indicates that there was an \u201cincrease\u201d in rights violations against LGBTI+ individuals \u201cthat originated directly from authorities and law enforcement\u201d in 2019. Judges have routinely applied the defense of \u201cunjustifiable provocation\u201d under the penal code to reduce sentences of those who have killed LGBTQI+ persons, and courts of appeal have upheld the verdicts based, in part, on the \u201c\u2018immoral nature\u2019 of the victim.\u201d Numerous cases of crimes against people of a different sexual orientation or gender identity remain unpunished. The ECRI Report on Turkey indicates that the police tend to trivialise hate crime targeted at LGBTQI+ persons and are reluctant to open investigations into such cases. Very few LGBTQI+ victims report hate crimes to the authorities, and many have suffered violence and sexual abuse from the police.xviii I therefore find that state protection would not be reasonably available to the Claimant in Turkey.\nThere is no viable internal flight alternative (\u201cIFA\u201d)\n[23] For the same reasons, considering the objective evidence and that the agent of persecution is the state, I find the Claimant would face a serious possibility of persecution throughout the country. The objective evidence indicates that the level of persecution, lack of state protection and inability to live life openly as a gay man would remain the same across the country. I find the Claimant would face a serious possibility of persecution across the country and that there is therefore no viable internal flight alternative available him in Turkey.\nDECISION\n[24] Given the above, I find that the Claimant has established, on a balance of probabilities, that he would face a serious possibility of persecution on the basis of his sexual orientation if he were to return to Turkey.\n[25] I therefore find the Claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to s. 96 of the IRPA and accept his claim.\n(signed) Tamara L.

        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2021 RLLR 48\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: August 12, 2021\nPanel: Evan Stringer\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Elanor Rose Andrew\nCountry: Chile\nRPD Number: TB9-01668\nAssociated RPD Number(s):\nATIP Number: A-2022-01594\nATIP Pages: N\/A\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] This is the decision in the claim for refugee protection of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (the claimant). The claimant alleges to be a citizen of Chile and seeks Canada\u2019s protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).\n[2] In assessing this claim, I have considered the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline No. 9 regarding claims based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression, and Guideline No. 4 regarding women facing gender-based violence.\nDETERMINATION\n[3] For the reasons that follow, I find that the claimant would face a serious possibility of persecution in Chile due to her membership in a particular social group as a lesbian woman. I therefore find that she is a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 and accept her claim.\nALLEGATIONS\n[4] The claimant\u2019s allegations are set out in her Basis of Claim form and attached narrative, as well as the amendments to her BOC narrative (BOC).1 The claimant alleges that she is a lesbian woman. She fears that if she returns to Chile, she will have to hide her sexual orientation, and that, if she does not, she will face physical attacks by skinheads and other strangers, harassment including verbal abuse and threats from strangers, and physical attacks and death at the hands of her cousin. She also fears being deprived of the ability to earn a living in Chile should an employer discover her sexual orientation.\nIDENTITY\n[5] The claimant\u2019s identity was established by her Chilean passport, a certified true copy of which was provided by the Minister. I am satisfied that the claimant has established, on a balance of probabilities, her identity as XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, a Chilean national.\nNEXUS\n[6] There is a clear nexus between the harm the claimant fears and a Convention ground, namely her membership in a particular social group as a lesbian woman. Accordingly, this claim has been assessed under section 96.\nCREDIBILITY\n[7] Overall, I found the claimant to be a very credible witness with respect to the core elements of her claim \u2013 namely, her identity as a lesbian woman, her past experiences of being threatened, verbally abused, harassed, and chased by skinheads in Chile on account of her sexual orientation, her experience of being fired from her XXXX XXXX XXXX and the threats of violence from her cousin, XXXX I did not note any inconsistencies, contradictions, or omissions going to the core of the claim.\n[8] The claimant provided credible testimony about her profile as a lesbian woman. She easily and spontaneously described her early experiences of becoming aware of her sexual orientation and provided detailed testimony in response to all of my questions about her past same-sex relationships, including with her former spouse. In support of her identity as a lesbian woman, the claimant also provided numerous supporting documents, including her marriage and divorce certificates pertaining to her marriage to DR, many photos of the claimant and DR, letters from LGBTQ community organizations speaking to their knowledge of her involvement with the LGBTQ communities in Montreal and in Toronto, and letters from friends and former colleagues in both Canada and Chile speaking to the claimant\u2019s sexual orientation. I found these documents to be reliable and give them full weight in further supporting the claimant\u2019s identity as a lesbian woman.\n[9] The claimant provided detailed testimony about her experiences as a lesbian woman in Santiago, Chile. She stated that, based on her own experiences, she fears that she will suffer violence and harassment if she is open about her sexual orientation in Chile.\n[10] When I asked the claimant about day-to-day examples of having to hide her sexual orientation, she stated that, for example, in Chile she could not hold her same-sex partner\u2019 s hand in public like heterosexual couples can, and that she had to adjust her style of dress, hair, and makeup in an effort to avoid being identified as a lesbian and subjected to violence and harassment in public in Santiago, where she resided. The claimant described a few occasions where her and her partner did hold hands in public and testified that on every such occasion, they would have homophobic comments shouted at them, as a result of which they stopped holding hands. Based on these experiences, she stopped holding her partner\u2019s hand in public. She also described how after getting a short hair cut in 2017, she was yelled at with homophobic slurs. In an effort to compensate and avoid further danger, the claimant described how she began wearing more feminine makeup and clothes, instead of her usual more \u201ctomboy\u201d style to try to avoid being perceived as a lesbian.\n[11] The claimant testified that there is a \u201cgay village\u201d in Santiago where she used to go out with friends some evenings. She explained that, unlike the gay village in Toronto, there are no Pride flags outside of LGBT establishments as this would make them a greater target for attacks. She further explained that while she felt it was important to visit this neighbourhood in order to experience a sense of community, she did not feel safe when she visited it. She testified that every time she went out in the gay village she was afraid of being chased and attacked by skinheads. She described one occasion around 2015 when, after leaving a gay bar in this neighbourhood, a group of men waiting outside began to yell homophobic slurs at the claimant and her friends and chased them down the street. She was able to get away, but two of her friends were punched in the face. When asked if she considered reporting that incident to the police, the claimant stated that she and her friends didn\u2019t even consider it because they don\u2019t trust the police and didn\u2019t believe they would do anything.\n[12] The claimant also provided consistent and detailed testimony about her experience being fired from the XXXX XXXX XXXX in Santiago in 2015. She explained that one of the mothers of the children had learned that the claimant was a lesbian and told her employer that she would be withdrawing her child if the claimant were allowed to continue working there. The very next day, the claimant was fired without any reason being offered. One of the claimant\u2019s co-workers with whom she maintained a friendship, told her that it was understood among the employees that she had been fired in order to appease the parent who had complained about her sexual orientation. I found the claimant\u2019s testimony in this regard to be credible and sincere.\n[13] She also explained how she had gone to the local police station in her neighbourhood in Santiago to file a complaint based on prohibited discrimination. She explained that while she did have concerns about the police, her livelihood was on the line, and she did not know what else to do, so she decided to try approaching the police for help. She testified that the police ridiculed her, stating that a lesbian was not fit to be around young children, and that her employer had good reason to fire her. They did not take any report or refer her to any other agency or otherwise direct her to any assistance.\n[14] The claimant also provided detailed and consistent testimony about her fear of harm from her cousin, XXXX. She explained that since her family found out about her sexual orientation, her cousin, XXXX has subjected her to verbal abuse and threats. Things came to a head in January 2018 when she was already outside of Chile when the claimant\u2019s cousin directed a tirade of homophobic insults and threats at her and her partner, threatening to seriously harm them if they returned to Chile. More recently, in February 2020, the claimant was informed by her mother that she had run in to XXXX who made further homophobic threats against the claimant and renewed his threat to kill her if she returned to Chile.\n[15] The claimant described her fear of her cousin, explaining his history of being arrested and released from prison for having beaten ex-girlfriends on multiple occasions, as well as her belief that he is associated with neo-Nazis, based on him having bragged to her in the past about he and his friends beating up gay men in Santiago\u2019s gay village. When asked whether she could obtain protection from the police from her cousin, she stated that she did not believe they would help her, and, based on her past experiences with the police, and those of other LGBTQ individuals, she fears they might be a further danger to her if she approached them for help.\n[16] In support of the harm the claimant fears from her cousin, she provided copies of the Facebook messages from her cousin in January 2018, detailing the threats against her and her former partner as alleged. She also provided a signed letter from her mother, accompanied by her photo identification card, describing the threats XXXX made against the claimant to her in February 2020, and her fear that he will follow through on those threats if the claimant returns to Chile. I found these documents to be reliable and give them full weight in supporting the claimant\u2019s fear of harm at the hands of her cousin XXXX.\n[17] The claimant provided letters from former school mates, co-workers, and members of the LGBTQ community in Canada and Chile speaking to their knowledge of harassment and bullying she experienced in school on account of her sexual orientation, their knowledge of her having been fired because of her sexual orientation, and their own experiences of enduring homophobic violence in Chile in recent years for which the police did not provide them assistance. I found these documents to be reliable and give them full weight in supporting the claimant\u2019 s past experiences in Chile and her fear of persecution.\n[18] Based on the claimant\u2019s credible testimony, and the reliable supporting evidence she provided, I find that she has established, on a balance of probabilities, her identity as a lesbian woman, her experiences of violence, threats, and harassment related to her sexual orientation from skinheads, strangers, and her cousin, XXXX as well as her loss of employment in 2015 and subsequent experience with the Chilean police. I further find that the claimant has established a subjective fear of persecution in Chile for reason of her identity as a lesbian woman.\nOBJECTIVE BASIS\n[19] The ongoing death threats against the claimant by her cousin XXXX support the objective basis of her fear of physical and verbal attacks in Chile. The claimant\u2019s fear of being physically attacked and harassed in Chile because of her sexual orientation as a lesbian woman, both by her cousin, as well as by skinheads and other strangers, is supported by the documentary evidence before me in the National Documentation Package (NDP) for Chile2 and in counsel\u2019s country conditions package.3\n[20] The U.S. Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for Chile states in its executive summary that \u201cSignificant human rights issues included reports of arbitrary or unlawful killings; torture by law enforcement officers; violence against lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex persons; and violence against indigenous persons.\u201d4 [emphasis added]. The report states that violence against LGBT individuals continues and details two notable cases where gay men were abused by the police. The report also indicates that law enforcement authorities appear reluctant to use the full recourse of Chile\u2019s anti-discrimination laws.\n[21] Other sources in the NDP indicate that despite the existence of progressive laws and attempts to stem discrimination, hate crimes continue and homophobic murders are still being recorded.5 Movilh, a Chilean LGBTQ rights organization, reports that in recent years, attacks against LGBTQ people have climbed to record numbers. In their 2021 report, they highlight 1,266 abuse cases against the LGBTI community reported in 2020.6 Their 2020 report indicates that over seventy-five percent of eight-hundred and fifty lesbian women surveyed had suffered harassment on the street because of their sexual orientation.7\n[22] The claimant\u2019s own experiences of being yelled at on the street by individuals who suspected she was a lesbian, are suggestive of an undercurrent of a homophobic society. While the documentary evidence indicates that same-sex relationships were decriminalized in 1998 and a civil union comparable to marriage was legalized in 2015, the claimant\u2019s own experiences and those evidenced in the documentary evidence indicate that Chilean society has not yet progressed to a point where sexual minorities can live openly and free of potential persecution and violence.\n[23] Another study indicates that since the high-profile homophobic murder of Daniel Zamudio in Santiago in 2012, which prompted new hate crime legislation and anti\u00ad discrimination measures, only twenty-three percent of five-hundred anti-SOGIE discrimination lawsuits filed as of 2020 went to trial, and of those, a majority have been decided against the victim.8 Despite the introduction of new legislative tools to fight homophobic crimes in Chile, reports of hate crimes against LGBTQI people have increased since the measures were introduced. Complainants have registered thirty-four new potential hate crimes, but the anti\u00ad discrimination law has proven ineffective to deliver justice: it has only been applied on four occasions and there haven\u2019t been reparations of any sort.9\n[24] Counsel\u2019s country conditions package includes numerous examples in the last few years of murders and violent attacks against lesbian women in Chile in various parts of Santiago, as well as in other cities and rural areas throughout the country. A 2019 article from Le Monde Diplomatique indicates that \u201csmall groups with fascist leanings regularly \u2013 and violently \u2013 attack feminists, lesbians, and transgender people\u201d.10 Another 2019 article describes a young lesbian couple who were violently attacked while walking home at night holding hands in Santiago\u2019s \u201cgay village\u201d of Bellavista.11 Other reports from 2019 describe attacks against LGBTQ individuals in Santiago and in other cities, wherein the victims were branded with swastikas.12\n[25] The claimant\u2019s fear of being deprived of her ability to earn a living in Chile is supported by her past experience of having been fired from her XXXX XXXX because of her sexual orientation in 2015. While this discriminatory treatment does not in and of itself amount to persecution, I have considered it as an additional factor in considering whether the harm feared, considered in its totality, amounts to persecution. The claimant\u2019s fear of being further subjected to employment discrimination in Chile is further supported by the documentary evidence.\n[26] Counsel\u2019s country conditions package includes two high-profile cases of lesbians losing their employment in the field of education due to their sexual orientation: one a high school teacher13, and one a university faculty head.14 In the case of the school teacher, her case was rejected by the San Miguel Court of Appeals as well as by the Supreme Court of Justice. It was not until the matter was brought before the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) that it was determined that her dismissal was discriminatory.\n[27] Taking into account the ongoing death threats from her cousin, her past experiences of being shouted at, chased, and threatened with violence, and losing her XXXX, as well as the documentary evidence indicating that, despite seemingly progressive laws, violence and discrimination against lesbians in Chile remains a serious concern, I find that the claimant\u2019s fear of persecution in Chile is objectively well-founded.\n[28] I find that the harms the claimant fears should she live openly in Chile as a lesbian woman \u2013 violence and harassment from skinheads and other strangers, violence including murder from her cousin XXXX and dismissal from her job \u2013 considered together \u2013 amount to persecutory treatment. Accordingly, I find that the claimant would face a serious possibility of persecution in Chile as a lesbian woman.\nSTATE PROTECTION\n[29] For the reasons that follow, I find that the claimant has rebutted the presumption of state protection with clear and convincing evidence. In coming to his finding, I have considered Guideline 9, which states that where individuals with diverse SOGIE do not disclose their SOGIE or report incidents of violence out of fear of further reprisal from the state or non-state actors, it may be unreasonable for them to approach the state for protection. It also states that in countries where decriminalization of same-sex relation has recently occurred, decision-makers must carefully assess whether state protection is adequate at the operational level.\n[30] The claimant testified that on the one occasion where she sought assistance from the police in Santiago in 2015, she was mocked and insulted because of her sexual orientation. The claimant further testified that with respect to the threats made against her by her cousin, not only does she not believe that the police will not help her, she also fears based on her own experiences and those of others that she may face further abuse from the police. She is therefore reluctant to confirm her belief that the police will not protect her.\n[31] As cited above, the U.S. Department of State includes recent examples of police abuses against LGBTQ individuals. Further examples of police abuse of members of the LGBTQ community are highlighted in counsel\u2019s country conditions package. For example, a 2019 article in the Advocate15 describes cases of gay men arrested after being caught up as bystanders to a protest action, and being subjected to homophobic slurs, stripped naked and sexually assaulted, beaten, and hit on the head until they referred to themselves by a homophobic slur. In both cases, when the officers learned that the individuals were gay, the homophobic slurs and violence began. The article also reports on the case of a prison officer who was denounced for physically abusing five LGBTQ individuals at a Santiago penitentiary because of their sexual orientation. These types of incidents, considered alongside the claimant\u2019s own experience of being mocked by the Chilean police, are indicative of a homophobic attitude that appears to be well-entrenched in the Chilean police force.\n[32] A 2019 BBC article16 about a string of violent attacks and murders of lesbian women in Valparaiso, as well as attacks against lesbians in Santiago, describes the pervasive distrust of the police by lesbian women in Chile. The report notes that after the BBC produced a report about one homophobic attack, the police arrested two men in relation to the case, which was viewed as a shock to members of the community. The BBC reports that, \u201cLesbian activists tell the BBC that the arrest was unexpected, even though there was CCTV footage and the attackers were known to the victim. Generally, they say, lesbophobic violence goes unpunished.\u201d\n[33] The BBC reports that lesbian activists set up a WhatsApp number called the Linea Violeta (the Violet Line) in 2019, which received more than one hundred reports of violence or intimidation in a month, but none were reported to police because the callers saw no point \u2013 they were convinced no action would be taken.\n[34] The 2019 Advocate article17 provides a recent example, reporting that in June 2019 a gay couple who had been physically assaulted by a co-worker reported the attack to the police, who refused to help, with one officer stating, \u201cImagine what disease you\u2019re carrying\u201d upon noticing that one of the men was bleeding.\n[35] The documentary evidence cited throughout these reasons indicates that there is a culture of homophobia within the Chilean police forces, including instances of violence against LGBTQ individuals, that they are reluctant to enforce existing anti-discrimination laws, and that members of the LGBTQ community rarely report attacks against them to the police for fear of further abuses and out of a belief that the police will not help them. Based on the documentary evidence before me, as well as the claimant\u2019s own credible experiences, I find that the claimant has rebutted the presumption of state protection and that adequate state protection would not be available to her as a lesbian woman in Chile.\nINTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE\n[36] Based on the country evidence highlighted throughout these reasons, the type of harm the claimant fears as a lesbian woman, and the lack of adequate state protection in Chile for LGBTQ individuals, exists throughout the country, and is in fact notably worse in some areas outside of Santiago, the claimant\u2019s home city. Accordingly, I find that the claimant would face a serious possibility of persecution throughout Chile, and that there is no viable internal flight alternative available to her in Chile.\n[37] Because the claimant would face a serious possibility of persecution throughout Chile under the first prong of the IFA test, it is not necessary to proceed with an analysis under the second prong.\nCONCLUSION\n[38] Having carefully considered all of the evidence before me, I find that the claimant would face a serious possibility of persecution in Chile due to her profile as a lesbian woman. Accordingly, I find that she is a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA and accept her claim.\n(signed) Evan Stringer\nAugust 12, 2021\n1 Exhibits 2, 4, 7.\n2 Exhibit 3.\n3 Exhibit 9.\n4 Item 2.1, NDP for Chile.\n5 Item 6.1, NDP for Chile.\n6 Exhibit 9, p. 74.\n7 Exhibit 9, p. 76.\n8 Exhibit 9, p. 71.\n9 Ibid.\n10 Exhibit 9, p. 27.\n11 Exhibit 9, p. 40.\n12 Exhibit 9, pp. 36, 50, 63.\n13 Exhibit 9, p. 48.\n14 Exhibit 9, p. 46.\n15 Exhibit 9, pp. 78-87.\n16 Exhibit 9, p. 1-20.\n17 Supra Note 15.\n",

        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2021 RLLR 47\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: January 12, 2021\nPanel: Joseph Berkovits\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Ugochukwu Udogu\nCountry: Nigeria\nRPD Number: TB8-31369\nAssociated RPD Number(s):\nATIP Number: A-2022-01594\nATIP Pages: N\/A\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] Mr. XXXX XXXX, a 44-year-old citizen of Nigeria, has claimed refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, (the IRPA).\n[2] The panel has considered the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9: \u201cProceedings before the IRB involving Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression.\u201d1\n[3] Pursuant to paragraph 17(c) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act and according to Section 29 of the Refugee Protection Division Rules, the Minister informed the Refugee Protection Division that he wished to intervene in this claim by making observations and submitting evidence. The Minister\u2019s submissions formed Exhibit 42. The Minister\u2019 s representative intervened in writing only.\nDECISION\n[4] For the reasons given below, the panel finds that the claimant is a Convention refugee.\nALLEGATIONS\n[5] The claimant\u2019s allegations are, in summary, that due to his bisexual sexual orientation, as well as his political opinion, he faces violence, arrest and imprisonment in Nigeria.\n[6] The claimant, who has been an active member of an opposition party, alleges that after a same-sex relationship with a prominent member of another party- the governing party\u00ad ended, his former partner organized reprisals against him, which resulted in the claimant being shot at and injured by people sent over by the governing party, threatening phone calls, and ultimately, a police investigation on the grounds of the claimant\u2019s bisexuality.\n[7] On XXXX XXXX, 2018, the claimant was able to fly from Nigeria to Canada on an assumed identity, and on November 24, 20218 he claimed asylum.\n[8] The claimant alleges that should he return to Nigeria, he faces criminal charges for being bisexual, and that he also faces extra-judicial violence at the hands of political adversaries.\nNEXUS\n[9] Given the claimant\u2019s allegations, his claim will be assessed pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA, with the nexus being a person of a particular social group, as a bisexual man. While the claimant\u2019s allegations about his political opinion also forma nexus to section 96 of the IRPA, because of the strong connection between his allegations about his sexual orientation and his political opinion, his claim will primarily assessed on the grounds of membership in a particular social group.\nIDENTITY\n[10] While the claimant flew into Canada under an assumed identity, the claimant\u2019s personal identity as a citizen of Nigeria has been established by a certified copy of his true passport. Also, biometric information shared between Canada and the United States reveals that his identity is as claimed in his application.3\n[11] The panel therefore finds that the claimant has established his identity, on a balance of probabilities.\nCREDIBILITY\nIntroduction:\n[12] When a claimant swears that certain facts are true, this creates a presumption that they are true, unless there is valid reason to doubt their truthfulness. Hence, as a corollary, there is no general legal requirement for a claimant to corroborate sworn testimony that is uncontradicted and otherwise credible.\n[13] In terms of the claimant\u2019s general credibility, and in light of the evidence below, the panel has found him to be a credible witness and the panel therefore accepts what he has alleged in his oral testimony and in his basis of claim form.\nThe Minister\u2019s Intervention:\n[14] It was the position of the Minister that \u201cthe claimant has not been consistent in his answers to a point where it is difficult to discern the truth of his statements.\u201d4 The panel put these concerns to the claimant, and will consider each one separately below;\n[15] Firstly, the Minister submitted that, \u201cThe claimant did not declare that he was denied a US visa in his Schedule A, even though he clearly admitted that fact in his last US NIV application.\u201d According to the claimant, he did verbally inform the officer at the airport in Toronto that he had applied for a US visa after the officer asked if he if had or had not. He further testified that he was under the impression that the officer wrote his answer down and that he had no intent to be misleading. It was the submission of the claimant\u2019s counsel that the failure to complete Schedule A correctly constituted an error or a miscommunication rather than an intentional effort to mislead Immigration. Ultimately, the panel agrees and does not find that the failure to properly fill in Schedule A, undermines the claimant\u2019s credibility in an substantial way, especially in light of the claimant\u2019s testimony, which the panel accepts as credible, that he thought that his verbal answer to the officer at the airport was written down and kept on record. As such, the panel does not find that this concern, in and of itself, is sufficient to undermine the claimant\u2019s credibility.\n[16] Secondly, the Minister submitted that, \u201cThe claimant declared that he travelled alone and also inferred that he travelled with someone. The Minister does not believe that both statements can be true.\u201d The claimant confirmed at the hearing that he travelled alone from Abuja, stating that he last saw the agent assisting him when he got onto the plan in Abuja. However, in the narrative attached to his Basis of Claim, the claimant does state that \u201cwe transited in Cairo International Airport in Egypt. We spent some hours in Cairo Airport before we now took off from Cairo Airport on that same day of XXXX XXXX 2018. Then we arrived in Toronto Canada International Airport on the XXXX XXXX 2018 and filed for asylum.\u201d5 At the hearing, the claimant testified that by using \u201cwe\u201d in the previous sentences, he merely meant to refer to the other passengers on the airplane, meaning that he was not the only person on the airplane. The panel accepts this explanation as reasonable, as the usage of \u201cwe\u201d does not have to interpreted literally and can reasonably be employed in a more colloquial fashion. As such, and in light of the claimant\u2019s explanation, the word \u201cwe\u201d does not need to be interpreted with such precision in this context, especially in light of the fact that while the claimant speaks English, it is not his first language. Overall, the panel does not find that anything substantial turns on this issue in terms of the claimant\u2019s overall credibility.\n[17] Thirdly, the Minister submitted that \u201cThe claimant swore by declaration that he came to Canada on XXXX XXXX 2018 while officer notes clearly show that he arrived and was examined on XXXX XXXX 2018.\u201d After hearing the claimant\u2019s testimony at the hearing, as well as referring to the documentary evidence in Exhibit 16 , the panel is not persuaded that this issue is substantially affects the claimant\u2019s credibility. The claimant\u2019s explanation for the discrepancy was clear and reasonable. According to the claimant, he arrived at the Toronto airport on XXXX XXXX , 2018, and made his claim for asylum at that point. However, he returned for a second interview at the Immigration Officer on December 3, 2018. These interview notes are included in Exhibit 1 and are dated December 3, 2018.7 The claimant subsequently filed his Basis of Claim Form on December 17, 2018, and then was given up to two weeks to file his narrative, which he did by December 28, 2018. At the time that the claimant filed his narrative, he included the declaration referenced by the Minister, on December 17, 2018. At this point, however, according to the claimant\u2019s counsel, a template was used that referenced to the date that the claimant attended his second interview, which was December 3, 2018, rather than his date of entry and initial entry to Canada, which was XXXX XXXX, 2018. The claimant\u2019s counsel submitted that this was essentially a clerical error due to the multiple dates involved and did not represent an attempt to mislead the Minister. The panel does not find that the claimant\u2019s credibility can be undermined in any substantial way by an incorrect date being given in a statutory declaration that the panel is persuaded was done inadvertently, and that, in and of itself, does not in the panel\u2019s view, speak to the merits of the claim in any meaningful way.\n[18] Fourthly, the Minister submitted that \u201cThe claimant submitted a BOC narrative which cited sexual orientation as the basis of his claim as well as political opinion. This differs from what he told the examining officer upon arrival to Canada.\u201d At the hearing, the claimant testified that as a person coming from a country where bisexuality is criminalized, he initially felt frightened to disclose his bisexuality, for fear that he would be turned back to his home country immediately. Even though the claimant is not unsophisticated, and is a XXXX in Nigeria, he testified that he came from a closed and homophobic society where one\u2019s bisexuality is kept secret. He testified that he felt fear at the prospect of talking to a government official about his sexuality, and the fact that she was wearing a uniform made him feel particularly scared. However, it should be noted that by the second interview with the Immigration Office, on December 3, 2018, which was well before the claimant submitted his narrative in December 28, 2018, the attending officer\u2019s notes do reflect the claimant\u2019s answer that he is bisexual.8\n[19] The panel accepts the claimant\u2019s explanation for his initial reluctance to disclose his bisexuality to the Immigration Officer as reasonable, particularly given his objective country conditions, where bisexuality is criminalized, and as will be discussed in a separate section below. The panel also notes section 7.4 of the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9: \u201cProceedings Before the IRB Involving Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression,\u201d wherein it is stated that: \u201cDecision-makers should examine whether there are cultural, psychological or other barriers that may reasonably explain [an] inconsistency. For instance, it may be difficult for an individual who has concealed their SOGIE to disclose and discuss it with government authorities at a port of entry, which may give rise to an inconsistency between information from the port-of-entry interview and testimony at a hearing.\u201d9 In this instance, the claimant did, however, disclose his sexual orientation fairly soon after his initial port of entry interview, by December 3, 2018, and well before he filed his Basis of Claim Narrative on December 28, 2018. Overall, the panel finds that claimant\u2019s credibility is not undermined in any substantial way by this issue raised by the Minister.\n[20] Fifthly, the Minister submits that it is difficult to know what is the truth, and what is part of an evolving narrative.\u201d The panel understands this submission to be connected to the previous submission which the panel has already addressed in the previous paragraph, but also to engender a more general concern with the claimant\u2019s credibility. As will be seen in the analysis below, during the course of a lengthy hearing, the panel found the claimant\u2019s testimony about the core of his claim, in particular as it related to his sexual orientation, to be consistent both during the course of the hearing, and to be consistent with his Basis of Claim, as well as well supported by corroborating documents. While, as will be discussed below, his allegations on the basis of his political opinion were less central to his section 96 claim, there was no reason for the panel to find that the claimant was being untruthful about them. Overall, and for the reasons below, however, the panel found the claimant to be truthful and credible.\nThe Claimant\u2019s Sexual Orientation:\n[21] According to the claimant, he first realized that he had feelings for other males when he was in secondary school and felt a \u2018chemistry\u201d with a classmate named XXXX and this evolved into a physical relationship. After graduation, the two were unable to keep in touch. The claimant detailed other relationships with men that followed, as well as his unhappy marriage with his wife.\n[22] In 2016, during the course of his work as a political organizer for the leading opposition party in Nigeria, the PDP, the claimant met an eventual partner, XXXX, a prominent and powerful organizer for the governing party, while the two campaigning for their respective candidate. The claimant testified that he \u201ccould not resist a handsome man,\u201d and at the claimant\u2019s initiative, the two started dating clandestinely. However, according to the claimant, XXXX started demanding that the claimant switch political parties and began exhibiting controlling behaviour overall, something that the claimant found frightening. The claimant stated that he commenced seeing another man XXXXS who became the claimant\u2019s partner to this day, although the claimant\u2019s partner is still in Nigeria. To help corroborate his testimony about their relationship, the claimant submitted photos and print-outs of numerous text messages exchanges between himself and XXXX.10\n[23] Soon after the claimant commenced this new relationship, however, XXXX found out, and in October, 2017, sent \u201cthugs\u201d over to a private party he was having with his new partner, and this resulted in the claimant being shot in the leg. Being afraid to go to the hospital for fear of a police report, which he testified would result in the authorities finding out about the bisexual relationships he was having, he went to stay with a traditional medical practitioner who would not report the bullet wound to the police. The claimant submitted into evidence two photographs of the bullet wound to his leg.11 However, the claimant\u2019s wife found him some three or four days later, still being treated by the practitioner. According to the claimant, his wife, instead of being sympathetic to him, became very angry, confronted him about his bisexuality, reported him to their pastor, and demanded that the claimant call him. The claimant testified that he was too afraid and ashamed to call his pastor. Nevertheless, the claimant\u2019s pastor ultimately called the claimant and informed him that his wife was leaving him.\n[24] Only a few months later, by January, 2018, the claimant received a phone call from a police inspector from his home city of Benin City, notifying him of a complaint that had been made against him on the grounds of his sexual orientation, and ordering him to turn himself in. In the meantime, the claimant started receiving threatening phone calls from either XXXX or his friends. According to the claimant, the fact that XXXX was also bisexual did not make him any less of a danger to him, because XXXX was so well connected politically, that he was able to insulate himself from homophobia more than the claimant could, who was no as powerful and well-connected.\n[25] As a result of these threats from both the police as well as from his former partner, XXXX the claimant decided to leave Nigeria, using the services of an agent who was able to obtain travelling documents and a passport of a man with the same last name as the claimant. The claimant testified that he keeps in touch with his cousin in Nigeria, who informed him that the police are still looking for him. The claimant\u2019s fear of the police was understandable. As will be discussed further below, the passing of the Same Sex Marriage Prohibition Act in 2014 has, according to an objective observer, resulted in \u201cincreased harassment and threats against\u201d LGBTQ people. \u201cAccording to [Human Rights Watch], the law had become a tool used by police and members of the public to legitimize human rights violations against LGBTI persons such as torture, sexual violence, arbitrary detention, extortion, and violations of due process rights.\u201d12\n[26] Since coming to Canada, the claimant has been able to participate in LGBTQ positive events, such as social activities sponsored by the 519 Community Centre, which he attended prior to the pandemic. The claimant provided corroboration of his participation in LGBTQ activities by means of a letter from the LGBTQ Refugee Programme at the 519 Centre, as well as his attendance records at a Newcomer Training Programme at the 519 Centre, as well as his membership card in their \u201cAmong Friends Program.\u201d13\nThe Claimant\u2019s Political Opinion\n[27] While the claimant also submitted that he was being persecuted as a result of his political opinion, the panel finds that his political opinions were less central to his section 96 claim than his membership in a particular social group. Nevertheless, the claimant gave credible evidence about his political activities. The claimant met his previous partner through his political activities, and the claimant demonstrated credible knowledge about this aspect of his life. The claimant established that he belonged to an opposition party, submitted into evidence his party membership card14, gave credible evidence that demonstrated that he was well-versed in his country\u2019s political situation and in his country\u2019s political issues, and described how his former partner\u2019s political party was adversarial to his own.\n[28] However, the claimant\u2019s evidence about his political activity, in the panel\u2019s view, was more in support of allegations about his persecution on the grounds of his bisexuality rather than helping to establish that his political opinion, in their own right, were grounds for his persecution. The claimant\u2019s political opinions are relevant inasmuch as they help explain how and why his previous partner, who is powerful and well-connected, exposed him to danger and persecution, but the claimant\u2019s political opinions and their connection to a nexus ground are otherwise not sufficiently delineated to stand on their own as a grounds for persecution. Ultimately, the panel finds that the reason for the dispute between the claimant and his former partner is just as much grounded in his sexual identity as in his political opinion, and further analysis of his political opinion is not necessary.\n[29] To be clear, however, the panel does not find that that the claimant\u2019s evidence about his political activity undermined his credibility overall, just that his evidence on these grounds was not as central to his claim to protection as his sexual orientation.\nConclusion:\n[30] The panel therefore finds that the claimant\u2019s allegations about his membership in a particular social group have been, on a balance of probabilities, credibly established. His testimony about his relationships with men rang true, and his most recent relationship was corroborated by multiple text messages, as already referenced above.\n[31] The panel therefore finds that on a balance of probabilities that the claimant\u2019s subjective fear of persecution is both credible and that it poses an ongoing threat.\nOBJECTIVE EVIDENCE:\n[32] The claimant\u2019s experience of persecution at the hands of his community and the state is not unique to him but is shared by the LGBTQ community in Nigeria at large. As Amnesty International has observed, \u201cHuman rights abuses continue to be committed against people suspected of engaging in same-sex relations or for having a non-conventional gender identity.\u201d15 As such, the objective country evidence supports the claimant\u2019s allegations that LGBTQ people are at a serious risk of persecution by the state, which criminalizes same sex relationships.\n[33] Because same sex acts are criminalized in Nigeria, pursuant to the Nigerian Federal Criminal Code, anyone having physical relations with a member of the same sex is considered to be acting \u201cagainst the order of nature,\u201d and to be committing an \u201cunnatural offence,\u201d and is subject to a 14-year prison term. The Same Sex Marriage (Prohibition) Act also criminalizes same sex marriages and civil unions, as well as gay clubs, gay organizations, meeting of gay people, and the support of LGBT organizations. For example, anyone who supports or participates in pro-LGBT organizations is liable to a 10- year prison term.16\n[34] Furthermore, while the Constitution of Nigeria \u201coffers general legislative guarantees to the rights to life, privacy, association, assembly, dignity, and freedom of expression\u2026. there is no legislation explicitly protecting sexual minorities from targeted violence or discrimination.\u201d17 The situation of LGTBQ people is made even more difficult by their treatment by the police, who arrest LGBTQ on the basis of \u201cphysical appearances, or on other pretexts,\u201d blackmail and extort them, and mistreat them in custody.18\n[35] As the claimant himself has experienced by the attitude towards him and his family by his community, acceptance of LGBTQ people in Nigerian society is very low. According to a survey conducted as recently as in 2015, 87 percent of Nigerians \u201csaid that they would not be willing to accept a family member who is homosexual\u2026. And 81 percent did not believe that homosexuals should have the same rights as other Nigerians.\u201d19\n[36] As one objective study has concluded, \u201cThe roles of discriminatory laws are evident in the forms of violence perpetrated by both state and non-state actors. Impunity is one of the driving forces of the continued violation of [LGBTQ] people in Nigeria. [LGBTQ] people find it extremely difficult to approach relevant government agencies for redress, for fear of stigma, more violence and discrimination\u2026. Actions by non-state actors are further validated by the behaviour of state actors who also extort [LGBTQ] people by evoking fear of legal reprisal\u2026. This is not surprising given the fact that these government institutions are often the perpetrators of harm themselves or act in collusion with non-state actors.\u201d20\n[37] Overall, the panel finds that there is a well-documented basis for the claimant\u2019s objective fear of persecution on the grounds of being a bisexual man.\nSTATE PROTECTION\n[38] The principal claimant\u2019s fear that, as a bisexual man, is without adequate state protection from homophobia is corroborated by the objective evidence. Not only does the objective evidence demonstrate that LGBTQ people are without adequate state protection, it also demonstrates that in many instances the state is itself a persecutor of LGBTQ people. As one objective report has observed, \u201cThe initiative for Equal Rights (TIER) noted in its annual report that \u2018in 2017, there were several instances of mass arrests based on perceived sexual orientation\u2026 a number of cases of arbitrary arrests and unlawful detention were perpetrated by the police.\u201d21\n[39] Also, \u201cSources explained that sexual minorities tend not to file reports with authorities out of fear of reprisals from authorities\u2026 [S]exual minorities who report abuse or discrimination are \u2018ridiculed\u2019 by authorities\u2026. The Amnesty International representative indicated that the judicial system is not effective in investigating crimes committed against sexual minorities and \u2018[i]n most cases, crimes committed against sexual minorities are not even investigated, [and] vigilante group attacks are not often reported due to fear of repercussions and further stigmatization by law enforcement officers.\u201d22 Furthermore, it has been noted by objective observers that \u201cthere is no government-supported helpline for sexual minorities who face violence.\u201d23\n[40] Given the objective evidence of country conditions discussed above, as a bisexual man, the panel finds that adequate state protection would not be available to him.\nINTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE\n[41] As the panel finds that an agent of persecution is the state by virtue of sexual minorities being criminalized, the panel finds that there is no place in Nigerian where the claimant could reside safely. The panel also notes that the claimant is politically active and likely well known within political circles, which increases the likelihood of him being discovered in an any internal flight alternative location, making it more dangerous for him to live anywhere in Nigeria. Therefore, there is no viable internal flight alternative for the claimant in his particular circumstances.\nCONCLUSION\n[42] The panel is persuaded that should the claimant return to Nigeria, he would face a serious possibility of persecution at the hands of the Nigerian community as well as agents of the state, namely the police. Based on the totality of the evidence, the panel finds that the claimant faces a serious possibility of persecution in Nigeria pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA.\n[43] The claim for protection is therefore accepted.\n(signed) Joseph Berkovits\n12 January 2021\n1 Guidelines issued by the Chairperson pursuant to subsection 65(3) of the Immigration Act, IRB, Ottawa, November, 13, 1996\n2 Exhibit 4, Minister\u2019s Written Intervention\n3 Exhibit 1, Package of information from the referring CBSA\/IRCC.\n4 Exhibit 4, Minister\u2019s Written Intervention, p. 5\n5 Exhibit 2, Basis of Claim Form, Narrative, paragraph 23\n6 Exhibit 1, Package of information from the referring CBSA\/IRCC.\n7 Exhibit 1, \u201cRIPC= Examining Officer Notes,\u201d pp. 1-5\n8 Ibid.\n9 Guidelines issued by the Chairperson pursuant to subsection 65(3) of the Immigration Act, IRB, Ottawa, November, 13, 1996, paragraph 7.4, np\n10 Exhibit 5, Claimant Disclosure, p. 17, (photo of current partner), pp. 18-48, (Print-out of text messages between the claimant and his current partner).

In reaching this decision, I have followed Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9, Proceedings Before the IRB Involving Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression, and Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 4, Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution.\n[2] I\u2019ve considered your testimony and the other evidence in the case, and I\u2019m ready to render my decision orally.\n[3] I would like to add that when written decisions are issued, they may be edited for spelling, syntax and grammar. Additional country documentation may also be added.\n[4] You are claiming to be a citizen of Uganda and are claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nDETERMINATION\n[5] I find that you are a Convention refugee because you face a serious possibility of persecution for the following reasons.\nALLEGATIONS\n[6] You allege the following.\n[7] You are a citizen of Uganda. You were raised as a Christian and became a XXXX XXXX XXXX. You supported LGBT XXXX at two XXXX where you worked in Uganda. As a consequence, you were accused of being a lesbian and you were abducted, severely assaulted and gang raped by three men on the orders of the father of two of your XXXX, who was a Major in the Ugandan army.\n[8] You left your spouse and children behind and hid until you fled to Canada. You allege that as a suspected lesbian and as a supporter of LGBT rights, if you return to Uganda you will face persecution from the state, including members of the armed forces, and from members of the community.\n[9] You allege that there is no state protection for you, nor any internal flight alternative.\nIDENTITY\n[10] Your personal identity as a citizen of Uganda has been established by your testimony and the supporting documents filed in the exhibits. These include a certified copy of a Ugandan passport with Canadian TRV and a copy of your Ugandan birth certificate.\n[11] I therefore find, on a balance of probabilities, that identity and country of nationality have been established.\nNEXUS TO SECTIONS 96 OR 97\n[12] I find that there is a link between what you fear and one of the five Convention grounds, specifically, your membership of a particular social group as an imputed sexual minority and as a defender of LGBT rights. Therefore, this claim has been assessed under section 96.\nCREDIBILITY\n[13] In terms of your general credibility, I have found you to be a credible witness and I therefore accept on a balance of probabilities what you have alleged in your oral testimony and in your Basis of Claim form. In support of your claim, you provided documents confirming that you were a XXXX at the XXXX you described, that there was a controversy surrounding allegations of homosexuality at one of the XXXX that reached the media, and that you were the victim of a sexual assault in 2018.\n[14] You also provided statutory declarations and letters of support from numerous friends and former colleagues familiar with your circumstances and the accusations against you because of your imputed sexual orientation as a lesbian and your support for LGBT students. These include a letter from MJ, an administrator at XXXX XXXX XXXX, who witnessed your arrest by Major B., statutory declarations from the dental surgeon, Dr. A.S., who treated some of your injuries in 2018, and from Dr. M.H.K., who treated your internal and bodily injuries.\n[15] Your testimony was straightforward, unrehearsed, responsive to questioning and was in keeping with your Basis of Claim form and there were no significant inconsistencies or omissions.\n[16] Your description of your experiences defending the rights of LGBT XXXXat two XXXX in Uganda was detailed, convincing and unrehearsed, as was your testimony about the brutal assault perpetrated against you by Major B and his men. You also described in detail the pain of having to leave your husband and children behind in Uganda to seek safety in Canada.\n[17] I therefore believe what you have alleged in support of your claim and I find the following to be credible.\n[18] That on a balance of probabilities, you are a XXXX from Uganda who defended the rights of LGBT XXXX and that many people believe that you are a lesbian, although you are not. You were brutally assaulted by members of the military as a consequence of your imputed sexual orientation and your defence of LGBT students.\n[19] You have credibly established your subjective fear of persecution, including violence, from members of the community and imprisonment from the state.\nPERSECUTION RISK\n[20] The objective documentation supports your allegations that individuals in your circumstance face persecution. Ugandan law criminalizes sexual acts between mutually consenting people of the same sex, NDP item 6.1 at page 22. Senior government Ministers have engaged in openly-hostile rhetoric against the practice of and legalization of same-sex behaviour, NDP item 6.2, page 1.\n[21] Ugandan police are often seen as the principal violators of the rights of LGBT citizens, item 6.2 at page 21. Homophobic views are widespread in society. LGBT persons are not only not accepted, they\u2019re often believed to be or accused of being an intrusion of western values into Ugandan society, NDP item 6.4 at paragraph 2.4.14.\n[22] Your counsel also provided additional evidence in Exhibit 5 confirming that the persecution of LGBT citizens in Uganda has continued and, in some cases, intensified during the COVID pandemic. Therefore, I find that you have a well-founded fear of persecution.\nSTATE PROTECTION\n[23] I find that adequate state protection would not be available to you were you to seek it in Uganda. The objective documentary evidence indicates that homosexuality is criminalized throughout Uganda and authorities often do not provide adequate protection or access to justice to victims of crime with diverse (inaudible) or imputed minority sexual orientation and the police themselves are often seen as the principal violators of the rights of LGBT citizens.\n[24] Furthermore, in your case, an agent of the state from the armed forces has been the principal agent of persecution. In light of the above objective country documentation and the evidence presented, I find that the claimant has rebutted the presumption of state protection clearly and convincingly.\n[25] Based on your personal circumstances as well as the objective country documentation, I find that adequate state protection would not be available to you in Uganda.\n[26] On internal flight alternative, I have also considered whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for you. The country documentation indicates that the situation for individuals in circumstances such as yours is the same throughout the country and that you would face a serious possibility of persecution or risk to life anywhere in Uganda.\n[27] Furthermore, I observe that members of the armed forces have subjected you to persecution and, as such, I find there is no viable internal flight alternative for you in Uganda.\n[28] In conclusion, based on the totality of the evidence, I find the claimant to be a Convention refugee, as she faces a serious possibility of persecution because of her imputed sexual orientation as a lesbian and her active support for LGBT rights. Your claim is therefore accepted.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

You will receive a transcript of this decision. It might be edited to correct grammar or add references to personal and country conditions documents. This is the decision in file TB9-26476. The claim of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, a citizen of Nigeria who is claiming refugee protection pursuant to Section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[2] XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, you\u2019ve claimed that you fear returning to Nigeria because you are bisexual. Your allegations and the hearing was conducted in accordance with Chairpersons Guideline 9 regarding proceedings before the IRB involving sexual orientation and gender identity and expression. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, I find that you are a Convention refugee and your claim is accepted.\n[3] The allegations in your Basis of Claim form are briefly summarized as follows. You are a bisexual man who has been in Canada since XXXX XXXX XXXX 2013. You began studying at the University of XXXX with a sponsorship of a Nigerian MP. When that sponsorship ended you continued to work during the summers in various places, Calgary, Edmonton and Vancouver for example, and you paid your fees and studied as much as you could. You now live in Toronto.\n[4] During the time that you\u2019ve been in Canada and particularly during your summer jobs at XXXX and XXXX in Vancouver, these locations being away from a predominantly Nigerian community, you felt free to meet and having sexual encounters with men and a few with women. You have realised and come to accept your identity and have come out as a bisexual man. Initially you were careful not to let people in the Nigerian community know your identity, nevertheless several of your friends and other friends in Canada are now aware of your identity. There are multiple affidavits and supporting letters from friends supporting your claim. Your Basis of Claim also documents your continued attempts to renew your student visa and other options for staying in Canada.\n[5] With respect to your identity which is always the first issue, I am satisfied that your identity as a citizen of Nigeria is established through your testimony and a copy of your passport and other documentation on file.\n[6] With respect to your testimony the panel is mindful of the principal that when a claimant swears to the truth of certain allegations this creates a presumption that those allegations are true unless there is reason to doubt their truthfulness. I am aware of the many difficulties faced by refugee claimants in establishing their claim, including the stress of the hearing and all the questions that are asked, as well as other cultural factors.\n[7] I find that generally XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, you testified in a straightforward and compelling manner. Your testimony was clear and consistent with your allegations. It was internally consistent and consistent with the documentary evidence on file. You described coming to the realization that you were attracted to men. You described your first relationships. You readily answered questions regarding your social life and activities in the LGBTQ community including get togethers at your apartment in Toronto that were known as safe spaces for queers. Your testimony was compelling as I mentioned before.\n[8] I note that the case is well documented with corroborative evidence, relevant recent social media posts including one that predates the refugee claim are in evidence as well as several affidavits supporting your allegations of being bisexual. You reasonably described the time and explained the time it took for you to realize and be comfortable in your sexual identity as well as the time it took to realize that you could make a refugee claim. In this regard you explained that no one in the Nigerian community talks about their immigration status and you explained that you didn\u2019t realize that the refugee process would be a private process and this also led to a delay in making a refugee claim. I find on a balance of probabilities that you are bisexual and that the objective evidence supports your allegation that you can\u2019t return to Nigeria and live safely as an openly bisexual man.\n[9] With respect to the objective evidence, the Nigerian government outlawed same sex relationships in 2014. Same sex relations for men are criminalized throughout Nigeria and the recent report for the initiative for equal rights in the National Documentation Package as well as the UK Country Policy and Information note on sexual orientation and gender identity and expression, and the Response to Information Request on anti\u00adLGBTQ vigilante groups clearly indicate that there is a climate of impunity for perpetrators of violence against the LGBTQ community members and that there would be no protection from the state.\n[10] To summarize I find that there is clear and convincing evidence that you would be at risk and that the state would be unwilling to protect you. For the same reasons you have no viable Internal Flight Alternative in Nigeria. You should not be expected to conceal your bisexual identity to live in Nigeria.\n[11] Just to conclude XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, is a person in need of protection pursuant to Section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act and the claim is accepted.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n",

        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2021 RLLR 44\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: January 8, 2021\nPanel: Oluwabukola Adeoye\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Ian Wong\nCountry: Turkey\nRPD Number: TB9-23616\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2022-00978\nATIP Pages: 000124-000127\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: I have had the opportunity to consider your oral testimony and also review your documentary evidence and I am prepared to render my decision orally.\nIntroduction\n[2] The claimant, XXXX XXXX, is claiming refugee protection pursuant to s. 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act and claims to be a citizen of Turkey.\nDetermination\n[3] I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee for the following reasons. I find that the claimant has established a serious possibility of persecution on the grounds of political opinion, as per s. 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nAllegations\n[4] The claimant\u2019s allegations are contained in her Basis of Claim form and I will not repeat them here, but in summary, the claimant alleges the following. The claimant alleges the fear of persecution in Turkey because of her Kurdish ethnicity and political opinion, specifically, she alleges that she is a member of the HDP and that she was arrested, detained, physically and verbally assaulted by the Turkish authorities because of her participation at anti-government rallies and demonstrations.\nAnalysis\nPersonal Identity\n[5] Your identity as a national of Turkey is established by your testimony and a certified copy of your Turkish passport attached to Exhibit 1.\nPolitical Identity\n[6] In terms of the claimant\u2019s political identity, I find on a balance of probabilities that the claimant has established her anti-government profile as a member and a supporter of the HDP. These were based on her oral testimony and several probative documentary evidence, which includes photographs of the claimant at HDP rallies in Turkey.\nCredibility\n[7] Even though, the Panel had concerns about the letter issued by the HDP, overall, the Panel found the claimant to be credible witness on the balance of probabilities on what is called to her claim that is her political opinion.\n[8] The Panel, therefore, believes what she has alleged in support of her claim. The claimant testified in a straightforward manner, and there were no relevant inconsistencies in her testimonies or contradictions between her testimonies and other evidence before me that were not satisfactorily explained. Also, the Panel notes that the claimant was forthcoming in when she was asked questions and she did not know the answer, she clearly stated so and did not embellish her answers or tried to make up testimony on the spot.\n[9] The Panel also finds that the claim was documented with documents found primarily in Exhibit 5, 6, 7, and 8, which includes a letter from the Toronto Kurdish Community and Information Centre, a letter of support from the claimant\u2019s father, photographs of the claimant at rallies in Turkey and Canada, and a government issued print out of the claimant\u2019s entry and exit from Turkey, in and out of Turkey. The Panel gives significant weight to these documents as it corroborates the claimant\u2019s oral testimony in regard to her political profile and the persecution she suffered as a result of a political opinion.\n[10] So, therefore, I accept your allegations due to your anti-government activities and affiliations with the HDP. You were targeted by the Turkish authorities. I, therefore, find that on a balance of probabilities that the claimant is credible, accept her allegations as credible, and that she has established her subjective fear.\nWell-Founded Fear\n[11] As it relates to the well-founded fear of the claimant\u2019s fear of persecution, I find that the claimant\u2019s subjective fear has an objective basis based on the objective documentary evidence before me.\n[12] The National Documentation Package indicates that those persons who are or are perceived to be members of political opposition groups are subjected to a variety of human rights violations in Turkey. Under the guise of the emergency decrees and anti-terrorism laws, the Turkish government disproportionately subjects Kurdish, Alevi-Kurdish, and those critical of the government to these human rights violations.\n[13] While Turkey is no longer in a state of emergency, the emergency decrees granting abusive powers remain enforced. Despite, the public declaration of a repeal of the state of emergency there is no change in the treatment of Kurdish persons or persons who are opposite to be critical of the government, just like the claimant.\n[14] According to the United States Department of State Country Reports and Human Rights Practices of Turkey, there are approximately, 4,000 criminal persecutions for insulting Turkish leaders, politicians, or Turkishness. This number represents a significant increase in persecution compared to the pre-coup period.\n[15] The documentary evidence also states that the problems reported included alleged tortured and abuse of detainees at times leading to their death, police violence against peaceful citizens, abuse of inmates in prisons, harsh and sometimes life-threatening prison conditions, detentions without warrant, and incommunicado detention. The documentary evidence also confirms that the authorities beat and threaten the opposition activists to force them to confess to false charges as in the case of the claimant.\n[16] In regard to the HDP party, the documentary evidence confirms that the HDP recognizes and fights for the right of Kurdish people to [inaudible] determination and seek peaceful democratic solution to the Kurdish question based on equal rights and voluntary togetherness.\n[17] It also confirms that the HDP has been the target of a number of attacks in the months that preceded and followed the 2015 elections in June 2015 and November 2015. The party reported that between July and October 2015 an important number of its members were taken into custody and that some HDP members were charged with the deformation of public authorities including insulting the president and most of them were detained and also charged with terrorism charges.\n[18] The test in assessing your risk of harm is forward looking. You testified credibility about your fears regarding returning to Turkey and the treatment you would receive. Your testimony was consistent with the country conditions in Turkey just like I have read, and thus, I find that there is an objective basis to support your fear and I therefore, find that your fear is well-founded.\nState protection\n[19] With respect to state protection, given that your fear of persecution is at the hands of the Turkish government, it will appear to be unreasonable for you, the claimant, to approach the state for protection. Based on objective documentary evidence, I find that there is no adequate state protection and therefore, the presumption of state protection has been rebutted.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[20] Given the information that the authorities in Turkey operate similarly throughout the country, I find that the claimant faces a serios possibility of persecution throughout Turkey and therefore, I find that there is no viable Internal Flight Alternative for the claimant anywhere in Turkey.\nConclusion\n[21] Based on the foregoing analysis, I have determined that the claimant has established that there is a serious possibility of persecution on the convention ground of her political opinion and I therefore find that that claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to s. 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act and I therefore accept her claim.\n[22] So, this will conclude the hearing. I want to thank, Madam Interpreter. And thank you, Counsel.\n[23] And congratulations to the claimant.\n[24] COUNSEL: Thank you very much, ma\u2019am.\n[25] MEMBER: In the absence of any question, concerns, I am going to formally end the hearing.\n\u2014\u2014\u2013REASONS CONCLUDED\u2014\u2014\u2013\n",

The claimant entered Canada on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018, having travelled directly from Burma. He made a refugee claim on arrival. At that time, the claimant was accompanied by his mother, who also made a claim. Their claims were later separated, at the request of the claimant, due to the sensitivity of his claim. The claimant is a 20-year-old transgender man who submits that he is at risk of persecution by the government and civil society because of his religion and sexual identity as transgender man.\n[2] For the following reasons, I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee based on both his religion and sexual identity. In coming to my decision, I have considered the Chairperson\u2019s SOGIE guidelines.1\n[3] I accept that the claimant is a citizen of Burma, based on his passport, and I accept that he is a Muslim, based on his testimony and national identity card.\n[4] The allegations are set out in the narrative portion of the claimant\u2019s Basis of Claim. There is no need for me to go into great detail into those allegations except to say that the claimant is a Sunni Muslim who is also identified by some factions as Rohingya due to a familial relationship with a member of the Rohingya community. As a member of the Muslim community, he has been discriminated against throughout his life. This discrimination included the inability to pursue his chosen profession because of an unofficial policy of not allowing Muslims to enter the higher professions such as medicine, which he wished to do. The claimant also testified as to the fear that he experienced as a member of the Muslim community and that violence towards Muslims is not unusual.\n[5] The claimant also testified as to his sexual identity as a transgender male and is fearful of the treatment he would experience in his home country should he return there. The claimant testified as a young person exploring his gender identity, he was attracted to females, and later came to realize that he identified as male. His sexual identity manifested itself in his home country as sexual orientation towards females, that was not accepted by his family or society at large. The claimant\u2019s testimony was consistent in all material aspects, with his Basis of Claim and narrative, and I find the claimant to be a credible witness.\n[6] Based on the claimant\u2019s testimony and the documents submitted, I find that the claimant has a subjective fear of persecution should he return to Burma. In doing so, I have also considered the cumulative impact of being a young, transgender, Muslim man, whose sexual identity also makes him vulnerable, not only in society at large, but also within his own Muslim community.\n[7] My definition of a Convention refugee is someone who has a well-founded fear of persecution. Fear is, by its very nature, subjective, while the well-founded nature of that fear is an objective matter. Both subjective and objective components are required to meet the definition. The definition of Convention refugee is also forward-looking, and I must consider what risk the claimant would face today if he were to return to Burma. I must also find that there is credible, trustworthy and reliable evidence that establishes, on a balance of probabilities, that there is more than a mere possibility that the claimant would be persecuted if he were to return.\n[8] S. 34 of Myanmar\u2019s constitution entitles all Myanmar citizens to freedom of conscience and the right to freely to profess and practice religion, subject to public order, morality or health. S. 361 of the constitution recognizes the special position of Buddhism as the faith professed by majority of citizens. This applies only to Theravada Buddhism. That is Item 1.9, s. 3.47 of the country documentation.\n[9] There are four laws known as the Protection of Race and Religion laws which concern interfaith marriage, religious conversion, monogamy, and population control. These were originally proposed by the Committee for the Protection of Nationality and Religion, an organization led by nationalist Buddhist monks, and were passed by the government in 2015. The UN\u2019s special rapporteur for human rights in Myanmar has criticized the laws for undermining the rights of women, children, and religious minorities, particularly Muslims. These laws remain in force.\n[10] At 12.1,2 the Department of State Report, of page 3, indicates that since 1999 \u2014 and they used the word \u201cBurma\u201d, so I am using them interchangeably throughout the country documents \u2014 \u201cBurma has been designated a country of particular concern under the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 for having engaged in or tolerating particularly severe violations of religious freedom.\u201d I also note that Myanmar is not party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. At 1.5,3 the country information indicates that there are several distinct Muslim communities living throughout Myanmar with different cultural and ethnic backgrounds. At the time of the 2014 census, Muslims made up approximately four percent of the population, and the majority lived in northern Rakhine State. Muslims are underrepresented in the public sector, there are no Muslim members of parliament, and consistent with the claimant\u2019s testimony, Muslims have been excluded from a range of government jobs, including teaching and health professionals. Businesses owned by Muslims are reported, in order to procure contracts, to have to have a Buddhist interlocuter.\n[11] Furthermore, Muslims experience a range of limitations on their ability to practice their faith freely. In recent years, authorities have blocked the rebuilding of mosques and madrassas that have been either damaged, destroyed or sealed. Muslims have also been denied access to basic rights and services. The Burma Human Rights Network documented multiple incidents of Muslims of all ethnicities being refused national registration cards. Reasons varied, ranging from the Muslim applicant being unable to provide extensive, and often difficult to obtain, documents to prove family lineage before 1824, and the refusal of immigration authorities to register a Muslim person as Bamar, the majority ethnicity.\n[12] Anti-Muslim sentiment is prevalent throughout the country and is circulated through social media, some state institutions and mainstream news websites. In the same Item, at 3.72, \u201cMuslims in Yangon have described increasing restrictions on their ability to practice their faith in recent years. Public events marking Islamic days were cancelled by authorities in Yangon in 2017 due to pressure from Buddhist nationalist groups. In April 2017, authorities closed two madrassas that educated several hundred primary school students in Thaketa Township, Yangon. The reduced tolerance for Islamic faith activities has been, at least in part, propagated by a rise in anti-Muslim sentiment at both an official and societal level and its most extreme form has resulted in violent incidents against the Muslim community.\u201d4\n[13] Muslims are also not permitted to enter some villages designated by communities as \u2018Muslim-free zones\u2019. The Burma Human Rights Network documented at least 21 Buddhist villages across Myanmar from 2012-2017, whereby villagers, with support from local authorities, erected signposts warning Muslims against entering the villages. DFAT at 1.45 assesses the Muslims outside of Rakhine State to face \u201cmoderate levels of official and societal discrimination.\u201d\n[14] The country documentation, again the Department of State report on religious freedoms at 12.1, indicates that \u201cReligious leaders and civil society activists reported that some government and military officials continued to deploy anti-Rohingya and anti-Muslim rumours and hate speech in official events.\u201d6 While local and international experts said deeply awoken prejudices led to abuses and discrimination against religious minorities, some civil society groups have worked to improve inter-religious tolerance.\n[15] Nonetheless, hate speech against Muslims continued to be widespread on social media. Recently, Facebook removed 89 Facebook accounts, as well as 5 Instagram accounts, for engaging in and coordinated authentic behaviour. An investigation found that some of this activity was linked to individuals associated with the military. According to media reports, the military conducted a coordinated effort to spread anti-Muslim and anti-Rohingya sentiment through dummy Facebook accounts and other social media.\n[16] Local and international experts said [inaudible] awoken prejudices led to instances of abuse and discrimination against members of religious minorities by societal actors. [inaudible] prominent military, civil and religious leaders continued to promote the idea that Burmese Buddhists culture was under assault by Islam and Muslims and would come through the mountains of Western Burma, northern Rakhine State where the Rohingya live.\n[17] While the country has taken some steps to rein in ultra-nationalist Buddhist monks, those steps fall short and the military, who largely control the government, continues to propagate anti-Muslim rhetoric. Country documentation also demonstrates that for minority communities, including Muslims, they do not trust the government to assist them.\n[18] Furthermore, same-sex conduct is illegal in Myanmar and subject to up to 10 years imprisonment. LGBTQ, and in particular transgender people, are said to have been targeted by the police and subject to abuse at the hands of the authorities. Although there has been some ability to organize same-sex activities, such as a pride parade in 2019, these continue to be met with opposition from the government. That is at 6.1.7 There is a high level of societal discrimination in Myanmar, including amongst families, who often insist on forced heterosexual marriage. DFAT at 1.5 assesses a \u201cModerate risk of official and societal discrimination against members of the LGBTQ community.\u201d\n[19] In addition, while I cannot find any direct information regarding the availability of treatment for transgendered (sic, derogatory) people in Myanmar, the claimant\u2019s testimony, which I accept, suggests that treatment is unregulated and dangerous and can only be accessed by those with the ability to pay for it. In my view, this is consistent with the country information indicating that same-sex conduct is illegal and societal condemnation of sexual orientation, and by extension, sexual identity \u2014 and condemnation of anything other than mainstream.\n[20] The claimant has indicated that he would not subject himself to such treatment given the safety concerns. In my view, even were he to do so, I find a lack of professional, family, and social supports were he to return to his home country, make the transition particularly arduous. Furthermore, given entrenched societal views, it would be unreasonable to believe that the claimant could lead a life free from discrimination. He would not have access to identification that properly acknowledges his sexual identity, and this would likely impact his ability to work and to access appropriate healthcare. Furthermore, he would not be free to openly express his gender.\n[21] In my view, the nature of the discrimination cumulatively amounts to persecution. For these reasons, I find that the claimant has a well-founded fear of persecution should he return to Burma.\n[22] Since the agent of persecution regarding anti-Muslim rhetoric is, at least in part, from the military, who continue to have 25 percent of parliamentary seats, control various government portfolios, including the Ministry of Interior Defence and Border, and a veto power \u2014 that is found at Item 1.9, page 58 \u2014 and from the state in regard to sexual orientation and identity, I find there is no state protection available to the claimant, and he would face the same risk of persecution anywhere in the country. Myanmar has a centralized government and, as I indicated, the same conditions exist throughout the country. For these reasons, I find there is no viable internal flight alternative available to the claimant.\n[23] Therefore, after the above reasons, I find on a balance of probabilities, that there is than a mere possibility that the claimant would be persecuted were he to return to Myanmar, or Burma, and his claim is accepted.\n[24] Thank you.\n1 Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9: Proceedings Before the IRE Involving Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression, Guidelines issued by the Chairperson pursuant to paragraph 159(1)(h) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, Effective date: May 1, 2017.\n2 Exhibit 3, National Documentation Package (NDP) for Myanmar (Burma), version 30 October 2020, item 12.1.\n3 Ibid., item 1.5.\n4 Ibid.\n5 Ibid.\n6 Ibid., item 1 2. 1.\n7 Ibid., item 6.1.\n8 Ibid., item 1.9.\n",

So, these are the reasons for the decision in the claim of XXXX XXXX who claims to be a citizen of India and is claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[2] In rendering my reasons, I have considered the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9, Proceedings Before the IRB Involving Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression.\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] You alleged the following. You left India in XXXX 2017 as you were forced to hide your sexuality as a homosexual. You feared societal violence and your family\u2019 s reproval. You came to Canada on a student visa and claimed asylum in XXXX 2019 on the basis of your sexual orientation.\n[4] In a recent amendment to your narrative, you claimed that you discovered your gender identity while you were in Canada. You alleged that you are a transgender person. That you had been hiding your true self. If you were to return to India, you fear to be killed or tortured because of your sexual orientation and gender identity.\nDECISION\n[5] I find that you are a refugee pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA as there exists a serious possibility of persecution should you return to India on account of your gender identity. My reasons are as follows.\nIdentity\n[6] I find that your identity as a national of India is established by the passport provided.\nCredibility and Subjective Fear\n[7] I note that once in Canada, you delayed for two (2) years before claiming refugee protection. However, you indicated that you came to Canada on a student visa and that you completed your studies. It was upon finishing your studies when you were faced with the obligation to return to India and to your family that you sought information about the possibility to stay in Canada.\n[8] This explanation seems reasonable in your alleged circumstances. And therefore, does not raise significant concerns with respect to subjective fear or credibility.\nCredibility Other Elements\n[9] I find you to be a credible witness and therefore, generally believe what you alleged in support of your claim. You testified in a straightforward manner. And there were no relevant inconsistencies in your testimony or contradictions between your testimony and the other evidence before me that were not reasonably explained.\n[10] You testified about your realization of being a transgender instead of a homosexual in 2019 when you consulted the 519 organization. You testified about the medical treatments you are considering concerning your gender identity. You also testified about your relationship with your family and how they learned of your sexual orientation while you lived in India.\n[11] In particular, the following evidence establishes your allegations as set out above. You provided letters from friends in Canada who attest that you are a transgender. You also provided a copy of a membership card of the 519 Community Center for LGBTQ. And pictures of yourself with a boyfriend between 2019 and 2021.\n[12] After reviewing the documents, I have no reason to doubt their authenticity. When a claimant swears to the truth of certain allegations, this creates a presumption that those allegations are true. Unless there are reasons to doubt their truthfulness. This is the principle established in Maldonado.\n[13] Although you had a relationship with a boyfriend for a while in Canada and had not alleged it, you explained that you thought that it would be enough to provide pictures as exhibits. I find this explanation reasonable in your circumstances and it does not raise sufficient concerns concerning your credibility.\nObjective Basis\n[14] The National Documentation on file indicates the following about persecution faced by transgender persons in India. According to Amnesty International at Tab 2.2, many repressive amendments were made into laws such as the Transgender Persons Act. In December 2019 during the winter session of the Parliament, the Transgender Persons Protection of Rights Act was passed.\n[15] The Act undermines the rights of transgender and intersex persons and violates India\u2019s international human rights obligations. And the 2014 ruling of the Supreme Court in the case of N-A-L-S-A v. Union of India. Amongst other flaws, the Act lays out vague bureaucratic procedures to be followed for legal gender recognition of the transgender persons.\n[16] Human Rights Watch agrees with the statements. Human Rights Watch states at Tab 6.1 of the National Documentation Package that the decriminalization of same-sex conduct will not immediately result in full equality for LGBT people in India. Transgender people in particular including hijra communities face discrimination in employment and housing. Human Rights Watch also notes that transgender people face discrimination in health care.\n[17] The United States of America Department of State report on Human Rights for 2020 at Tab 2.1 contains the following quote, \u201cLGBTI groups reported they faced widespread societal discrimination and violence, particularly in rural areas\u201d.\n[18] Activists reported that transgender persons continued to face difficulty obtaining medical treatment. Some police committed crimes against LGBTI persons and used the threat of arrest to coerce victims not to report the incidents.\n[19] Given that there are no serious credibility issues with respect to your allegations, coupled with the documentary evidence set out before, I find that you have established a perspective risk of being subjected to hostility and outbursts of violence because of your gender identity. As well as cumulative discrimination in work and public services that become tantamount to persecution.\nNature of the Harm\n[20] I have examined your claim under section 96 of the IRPA as I conclude that the risk you described constitutes persecution based on at least one (1) of the grounds prescribed in section 96. Specifically, that gender identity has been recognized as a social group of protected Nexus in the Convention.\nState Protection\n[21] I find that it would be objectively unreasonable for you to seek the protection of the state in light of your particular circumstances. Objective information on file at Tab 6.1 indicates that the attitudes and behaviour of the police is one of the biggest barriers to queer persons. Access to the justice system in India. Several people spoke to the ICJ about violence, abuse, and harassment they suffered at the hands of the police. Furthermore, in several cases, the police have refused to file complaints submitted by queer persons, owing to bias or stereotypes.\n[22] You also testified of an event in 2016 when there was an attempt to kidnap you and the police did not file your first information report.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[23] I have examined whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for you. Based on the evidence on file, I find that you face a serious possibility of persecution throughout India as LGBTI groups reportedly face widespread societal discrimination and violence throughout India.\n[24] I have considered whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for you. I find that there are no other parts of the country where you would not face a serious possibility of persecution.\nCONCLUSION\n[25] In light of the preceding, I conclude that you are a refugee pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA. Accordingly, I accept your claim.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

The Board has heard the evidence with regards the claim filed by XXXX XXXX and is ready to render its decision from the bench. The claimant alleges she is a citizen of Rwanda and is seeking refugee protection under s. 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. For the purpose of the present asylum determination analysis, the Board took into account the Chairperson\u2019s guideline 9, entitled proceedings before the IRB involving sexual orientation, gender identity and expression. At the hearing, the claimant expressed a preference for the use of the pronoun \u201cshe\u201d, which is what the Board will use in rendering its decision.\n[2] The claimant alleges that she would face persecution if she were to return to Rwanda based on her sexual orientation. More specifically, she alleges that she always felt like a girl in the body of a boy, starting as a young teenager. In XXXX 2018, she met a guy on return to a trip to Uganda, with whom she had had an intimate relationship. On XXXX XXXX XXXX 2019, a family servant caught the two of them in the claimant\u2019s bedroom, and they were subsequently beaten by the claimant\u2019s family. However, they denied that they were in an intimate relationship. For this, the claimant was punished by her family. They took away her phone, limited her outings, but relaxed some of those restrictions when she obtained a visa to study in the United States as they considered that perhaps she would change if she went to study there. So, the claimant\u2019s aunt sent her to study in the US in XXXX of 2019, after several months there, around the month of XXXX, the claimant got a call from her mom, where she was told that they had found nude pictures of the claimant and her former boyfriend in her old laptop, and that the family had called the police, that they had beaten her former boyfriend, and that basically they were so disappointed in her and were rejecting her completely. The claimant was cut off financially after this phone call and has not had any contact with her mother, father, or most of her siblings or her aunt. And the claimant tried to obtain a scholarship to continue her studies in the US, but no scholarship was forthcoming, therefore she decided to come to Canada on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2020, and her asylum claim was deterred three days later to the Refugee Protection Division.\n[3] The Board finds, in this case, the claimant has established that she faces a serious possibility of persecution, on the basis of her membership in a particular social group, for being gay, and also for identifying with the gender is not their biological sex at birth.\n[4] The claimant\u2019s identity has been established on a balance of probabilities, by a copy of her passport, which was filed with the Board.\n[5] With regards to credibility, the claimant was a credible witness, she provided details about growing up and feeling like a girl, being interested in hair and make up and being attracted to boys, contrary to the other boys that were around her. She testified about her relationship with her first boyfriend, XXXX, and how her family reacted when a servant found out that they were a couple. She also described the feelings of shame that she experienced when she realized she was different, since in her community it is considered to be an affront against Rwandan culture to be gay, and that she would potentially be spoiling, her words, people around her, this was the perception in her community. The claimant also described to the Board how her participation in the LGBTQ community centre in Montreal has helped her be more accepting of her own identity, and be more open about it, despite those feelings of shame in that cultural upbringing.\n[6] The claimant also provided several documents to support her claim. C-1 is a letter from the LGBTQ+ centre, where they also refer to the claimant as \u201cshe\u201d and describe her participation and the activities at the centre. C-2 is a letter from her former partner that she had in Montreal, and C-3 is a copy of an email from her sister who lives in Uganda, who, while expressing a disapproval for her sexual orientation, discussed her attempts to trace XXXX and see what had happened with him.\n[7] The claimant\u2019s failure to seek asylum in the United States when she studied there from XXXX 2019 to the end of 2019, is not \u2014 is justified by the claimant\u2019s explanation. She said that once her family cut her off finically, her legal status in the US was tied to her status as a student, and she has tried to look into applying for asylum in the US, but when she discovered that there were no or fewer resources such as shelters for people who are awaiting the outcome of their asylum claim, she decided to come to Canada, as she felt that there were more resources available. And thus, no negative inference is drawn by the Board with regards to the claimant\u2019s overall credibility due to this failure to seek asylum in the US, and the Board also notes that as soon as she came to Canada, she did apply for refugee protection.\n[8] There is also an objective basis for the future risk that the claimant faces if she were to return to Rwanda. The document evidence that is found in the national documentation package does support the claimant\u2019s allegations and the fact that she would face a serious possibility of persecution upon return to Rwanda. Now, it must be said that the evidence can be contradictory with regards to the treatment of members of the LGBTQ community in Rwanda, and like many neighbouring countries, same-sex relations are not prohibited by law in Rwanda. However, there was an attempt to legislate in that manner in 2009, and homosexuality remains highly stigmatized within society. Tab 6.2 states that members of the LGBT community can suffer violence, discrimination, and harassment in general because of the cultural and religious beliefs which are highly intolerant of homosexuality. Homosexuality is viewed as disease coming from the west, and as an immoral thing. And it is very rare in Rwanda to encounter people who are openly gay and who are able to live their identity freely, because being openly gay will normally cause total isolation and cause gay people to be rejected by their family and their friends, and the claimant\u2019s testimony is in line with that reality, where she was rejected by her family upon them learning of her sexual orientation.\n[9] Furthermore, tab 6.1 states that gay people in Rwanda will suffer discrimination in trying to get a job, in trying to get access to housing, because they can be evicted by landlords, or families will kick gay people out of the households where they have always lived. And so, the fact that gay people in Rwanda will face human rights violations with regards to their basic, fundamental rights, such as housing, lodging, on a systemic basis and a systematic basis for the Board amounts to persecution. So, in light of the way members of the LGBTQ community are treated in Rwanda as stated in this documentary evidence, and in light of the claimant\u2019s past experience within her family where she was beaten for being in a relationship with another young man, she has established on a balance of probabilities that she faces a future risk of illegal detention, suffering violence, or persecution, if she were to be open about her sexual orientation in Rwanda.\n[10] With regards to state protection, the Board finds that there is clear and convincing that the state is unable or unwilling to provide the claimant with adequate protection. 6.2 of the national documentation package states that it is possible to ask for state protection, but whether that protection will be forthcoming will depend on the individual who receives the complaint, and their own personal beliefs. Tab 6.1 has stated that while there are some ethical police officers who will help people from LGBTQ community, they can also be arrested on behalf of lies that the arrestees were stealing, or were causing insecurity, or that the LGBT community is the root cause of several social ills. So, in large numbers, police officers do not want to hear about the existence about the LGBTQ community, and that is true also within the judicial system. Furthermore, tab 6.1 states that the police can arrest and illegally detain gay people for indefinite time based on morality laws, and there are very few cases brought before the courts for cases of violence against people from the LGBT community. So, in light of this evidence, there is not adequate protection that can be provided to the claimant, were she to return to Rwanda, and she has rebutted the presumption of state protection.\n[11] Finally, the Board analyzed whether the claimant could possibly relocate safely within her country of origin. However, the sentiment with regards to homosexuality is the same, all throughout the country, and as the Board has found that there is no adequate state protection available to members of the LGBTQ community if one is attacked or suffers discrimination or persecution due to their sexual orientation, the Board finds that the claimant would thus face a serious possibility of persecution anywhere in the country, and there is thus no viable internal flight alternative available to the claimant.\n[12] In conclusion, the Board has analyzed evidence as a whole, and finds that the claimant has discharged her burden of establishing a serious possibility of persecution based on one of the grounds set out in s. 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, and the claim is therefore accepted. This is the end of my decision.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014-REASONS CONCLUDED\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

Because of his sexual orientation and gender identity, as well as his advocacy for the LGBTI community, he was targeted by the Gulf Clan, the country\u2019s largest criminal organization, as well as by unknown members of the community.\n[4] In 2017, he was sexually assaulted by a group of men because he was public about his sexual orientation on Facebook.\n[5] Then in 2019, while working for the LGBTI Social Alliance of Antioquia, in Medellin, he was targeted by the Gulf Clan because he counseled transexuals and other members of the community not to give in to threats of extortion by the Gulf Clan and to report these threats to the police.\n[6] On XXXX XXXX XXXX 2019, after a tour of the city centre to commemorate the 50 years of the XXXX XXXX XXXX \u2013 the riots outside a gay bar in New York City that marked the beginning of the gay rights movement in 1969 \u2013 an armed man accosted him on his way home and threatened to kill him if he did not stop his work with the LGBTI Social Alliance. The aggressor also told him if he wished to continue working as a prostitute in the neighbourhood \u2013 which he did occasionally \u2013 he would have to pay a portion of this earnings to the Gulf Clan.\n[7] On XXXX XXXX XXXX 2019, after representing the LGBTI group on a float in the gay pride parade in Medellin, the claimant was threatened again by an armed man who said he knew where he worked and where he spent his free time, as well as where he lived, with his mother and his dog. The claimant also received threatening messages on Facebook and Grindr, a dating app.\n[8] Two weeks later, on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2019, the claimant flew to the United States. The next day he crossed the border into Canada and claimed asylum.\nDecision\n[9] The Tribunal finds that the claimant is a refugee, pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA, as there exists a serious possibility of persecution, should he return to Colombia, on account of his membership in a particular social group, specifically gay and transgender people in Colombia. The reasons are as follows.\nIdentity\n[10] The Tribunal finds that the identity of the claimant as a national of Colombia is established by the documents provided, notably his passport.\nCredibility\n[11] Based on the documents in the file, the Tribunal has noted no serious credibility issues. In particular, the evidence establishes the allegations as set out above.\n[12] Medical reports dated XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX 2017, corroborate the allegation that the claimant was drugged and assaulted on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2017 (Exhibit C-1 and C- 3).\n[13] Photographs of the claimant at training and public events corroborate the allegations that he volunteered with the LGBTI Social Alliance of Antioquia and took part in events to mark the 50th anniversary of the XXXX XXXX XXXX riots. Other photos of the claimant at a Drag Queen contest and at the Gay pride parade in 2019 also corroborate the allegation that he is queer himself and was an advocate for the community (Exhibits C-10 to C-13).\n[14] Facebook posts denouncing violence against the LGBTI community after the murder of a transgender woman corroborate the allegation that the claimant spoke out publicly on behalf of the LGBTI community (Exhibit C-6). Threats receives online after those posts, as well as threats on a dating app, corroborate the allegation that the claimant was targeted because of his public advocacy for the LGBTI community (Exhibit C-15).\n[15] This is also confirmed by the submission of a survey given to participants at the 2019 pride parade in Medellin, by the social alliance (Exhibit C-14). This exhibit includes a photograph of the claimant marching at the front of the parade, which appeared in a Colombian newspaper.\n[16] A police complaint dated XXXX XXXX XXXX 2019, corroborates the allegation that the claimant sought police protection following the threats he received after the gay pride parade on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2019, and threats he received online, as an advocate with the LGBTI Social Alliance. It also confirms that the local police response was that it was not in their jurisdiction to act on this complaint (Exhibit C-16).\n[17] A second complaint, filed with police XXXX XXXX XXXX 2019, also details the incidents in question, and the claimant\u2019s fears and reasons to suspect that the Gulf Clan is behind the threats in person and on social media. The police response is to advise the claimant to hire a private investigator to find out exactly who made the threats (Exhibit C-16).\n[18] A letter of support by the Montreal LGBTQ+ Community Centre affirms that the claimant has been an active member of the centre since XXXX 2020, and took part in activities and discussions with the centre even before becoming a member (Exhibit C-18).\n[19] After reviewing the documents, The Tribunal has no reason to doubt their authenticity.\nObjective basis\n[20] Given that there are no serious credibility issues with respect to allegations of the claimant, and in light of the documentary evidence set out below, the Tribunal finds that the claimant has established a prospective risk of being assaulted or killed by the Gulf Clan, or other armed groups because of his sexual orientation, and because of his work as a social leader and advocate for the LGBTI community.\n[21] This risk is corroborated by the following documents in the National Documentation Package for Colombia, August 31, 2021 version, at tabs 2.1, 2.17, 2.18, 2.19, 6.3, 6.5, 7.13, 7.21, and 7.28.\n[22] Colombia decriminalized same-sex sexual relations in 1981 and has laws and recent court decisions prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity.\n[23] However, sources have indicated that a \u201csignificant proportion\u201d of the Colombian population still has prejudices against LGBTI people and there were reports of sexual assaults against members of the community.\n[24] According to a report by Colombia Diversa in 2018, 110 persons belonging to sexual and gender minorities were murdered in 2017, while in 2018, 109 individuals were killed. At least 33 percent of these murders and around 34 percent of threats were motivated by the victim\u2019s sexual orientation or gender identity.\n[25] Antioquia, where the claimant lived, was the department with the highest number of incidents of violence against sexual and gender minorities in 2018, and the highest number of assassinations that year (23 victims).\n[26] Armed groups, like the Gulf Clan, were behind many of the homicides and threats toward LGBTI persons. According to the Colombia Diversa report from May 2020, this kind of violence is used as a \u201cwar strategy\u201d and to exercise social control in an area. Between 2014 and 2019, armed groups had issued 75 threats against people belonging to sexual and gender minorities.\n[27] The Gulf Clan, responsible for the threats made against the claimant, is said to be the largest and most powerful of the paramilitary groups in Colombia. It is also described as a major drug trafficking group and the largest criminal organization in Colombia.\n[28] At the same time, LGBTI people were also at risk of violence by the police. Between 2014 and 2019, there were 431 incidents of police violence against sexual and gender minorities, including 87 in 2018.\n[29] While a majority of the members of the community said they did not experience discrimination in their workplaces, this was not true for transgender persons, 40 per cent of which were unemployed because of discrimination in hiring practices.\n[30] The claimant would not have been affected by this while he was in Colombia. However, given his stated desire to transition to a different gender, he would face this risk of discrimination as well if he were to return to Colombia and express his gender identity.\n[31] There is also a wealth of objective evidence pertaining to the risks of persecution in Colombia facing social leaders and human rights defenders.\n[32] According to the U.S. State Department\u2019s Human Rights Report for 2020, several illegal armed groups perpetrated human rights abuses and violent crimes, including murders, kidnapping, torture and threats against journalists, women, human rights defenders and social leaders.\n[33] In the first six months of 2020 alone, there were 13 kidnappings of human rights and social leaders.\n[34] Citing statistics from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, the same report stated that between January 2016 and August 2020 more than 400 human rights defenders were killed.\n[35] According to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, since 2017, when Colombia recorded its lowest overall homicide rate in the last 30 years, there has been a significant and alarming increase in the number of murders of human rights defenders and social leaders in the country- including a 13% increase in the number of human rights defenders killed from 2018 to 2019.\n[36] LGBTI human rights defenders, like the claimant, are in a particularly dangerous situation, the Commission noted, as they are targeted both because of their efforts to defend people who are victims of discrimination and because of their own sexual orientation or gender identity.\n[37] With respect to who is responsible for the killings, according to the Office of the Attorney General of Colombia, in a 2018 report, the main perpetrators are, by order of responsibility, individuals, local criminal organizations, the Gulf Clan, and Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) dissidents and the National Liberation Army.\n[38] Civil society organizations point out the difficulty of identifying those allegedly responsible for these crimes. However, many concur in identifying illegal armed groups, first and foremost the Gulf Clan, as the main source of violence.\n[39] In this context, and having examined this claim under section 96 of the IRPA, the Tribunal concludes that the risk the claimant faces constitutes persecution based on at least one of the grounds prescribed in the Refugee Convention, specifically his membership in a particular social group \u2013 members of the LGBTI community in Colombia \u2013 and his political opinion, as a human rights defender working with that community.\nState Protection\n[40] The Tribunal finds that there is clear and convincing evidence that the state is unable or unwilling to provide the claimant with adequate protection, either as a member of the LGBTI community, or as a social leader and human rights defender.\n[41] According to several sources, LGBT persons\u2019 rights were included in the 2016 peace agreement with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and they are recognized as a specific category of victims of the armed conflict in the agreement.\n[42] Furthermore, according to information provided by the State, in 2020, 3,686 human rights defenders and social leaders did receive protection through the National Protection Unit (UNP), equivalent to roughly half of the total number of people protected by the UNP.\n[43] On the other hand, civil society organizations note that there has hardly been any development of protection measures for LGBTI members by the State since 2016, despite the promises of the accord. And they characterized the protection measures for human rights defenders as \u201csoft\u201d, even in areas with serious security situations, and therefore ineffectual.\n[44] Furthermore, as mentioned above, the police themselves are the instigators of violence against the LGBTI community \u2013 for example they were responsible for 87 cases of violence against members of the LGBTI community in 2018. As such there is a reluctance by members of that community to seek police protection for fear that they may be re-victimized.\n[45] The claimant states and has provided documentary evidence that he sought police protection from the Gulf Clan on two occasions. The first time, in XXXX 2019, he was told by police that it was not in their jurisdiction to investigate the threats he received at the Gay Pride march. The second time, in XXXX 2019, he was told that a police investigation could only begin once the claimant identified a specific person responsible for the threats within the Gulf Clan. The police suggested he hire a private investigator.\n[46] Given the objective evidence and the personal experience of the claimant, the Tribunal finds he can not rely on police protection from the threats he received or could face, should he return to Colombia.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[47] The Tribunal has also examined whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for the claimant.\n[48] According to several sources, the Gulf Clan, who the claimant believes was responsible for the threats levelled against him, has control over the entire territory of Colombia and most of its ports. In 2017, the Colombian government estimated that it had some 2,000 members, who were particularly concentrated in Colombia\u2019s northern region, especially in the Pacific departments of Antioquia, Choco and Cordoba.\n[49] While the National Documentation Package for Colombia does not provide specific information on the Gulf Clan\u2019s ability to track individuals to other parts of the country, it does reveal that the Gulf Clan, on top of being the largest and most widespread of the illegal armed groups, also has allies both within and outside of Colombia.\n[50] The documentary evidence also shows that members of the LGBTI community, human rights defenders and social leaders are particularly vulnerable to threats and illegal groups, not to mention violence and discrimination, in rural areas and smaller cities.\n[51] Based on the evidence on file, the Tribunal finds that the claimant faces a serious possibility of persecution throughout Colombia.\nCONCLUSION\n[52] The Tribunal concludes that the claimant is a Convention refugee, pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA, and accepts his claim.\n(signed) Catherine Solyom\nNovember 3, 2021\n",

Fraser\nCountry: El Salvador\nRPD Number: MB7-23221\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2022-00978\nATIP Pages: 000034-000040\nREASONS FOR DECISION\nINTRODUCTION\n[1] The claimant, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (also known as XXXX), is a citizen of El Salvador. She1 claims refugee protection in Canada pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).2\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] The claimant fears to be killed by the members of gangs if she returns to El Salvador.\n[3] On XXXX XXXX XXXX 2017, the claimant was kidnaped by members of the Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13). While abducted, she was mistreated and tortured by members of the MS-13. They threatened to kill her unless her mother paid a ransom.\n[4] The claimant alleges she was kidnaped because she is a transsexual person and because the gang members knew her mother works for the supreme court of justice.\n[5] On XXXX XXXX XXXX 2017, the claimant left El Salvador and she entered Canada with a visitor\u2019s visa.\n[6] She claimed refugee status around November 21, 2017.\n[7] Being a transgender, transsexual person, the claimant fears to be persecuted due to her gender identity should she return to El Salvador.\nDETERMINATION\n[8] The tribunal finds that the claimant is a Convention refugee for the following reasons.\nANALYSIS\n[9] In assessing this claim, the tribunal considered the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9: Proceedings before the IRB Involving Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression.3\nIdentity\n[10] The tribunal is satisfied with the identity of the claimant, which was established by a copy of her passport on file.4\n[11] The tribunal notes that claimant chose to identify herself as a man when filling her Basis of Claim Form (BOC)5. The tribunal suspects that this was to keep in conformity with her passport. Nevertheless, the claimant provided documents from medical professionals regarding her medical transition from male to female. The tribunal is satisfied that the claimant is indeed transgender, transsexual.\nCredibility\n[12] The tribunal considers the claimant\u2019s allegations in her BOC to be credible. The tribunal considered all the documentary evidence on file and found no significant contradictions or inconsistencies that would undermine the claimant\u2019s credibility.\n[13] As to the claimant\u2019s gender identity, the claimant provided numerous documents to corroborate her claim. These include documents from medical professionals indicating that she is transgender.6\n[14] In support of her claim, the claimant provided a letter from her psychiatrist indicating that she initiated hormonal therapy.7 The psychiatrist confirms that, after evaluating the claimant, he determined that she was a person with a transsexual gender identity.8\n[15] The claimant also submitted a letter from her XXXX that indicates that during 20 sessions of XXXX with the claimant, which began on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018, she has observed XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX associated with XXXX XXXX and the traumatic events experienced by the claimant in her country of origin.9\n[16] The claimant submitted a letter from her family physician who confirms that he has assisted her to medically transition from male to female.10\n[17] Additionally, the claimant provided a police report that confirms that she was kidnapped by gang members on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2017.11\n[18] The claimant provided a photo of herself to corroborate her transition from male to female.12\n[19] All this is consistent with the claimant\u2019s allegations as stated in her BOC. In light of the documentary evidence submitted, there is no doubt that the claimant is a transsexual person.\n[20] Therefore, the tribunal finds the main allegations at the heart of this claim to be credible.\n[21] Moreover, the objective documentation supports the claimant\u2019s allegations that individuals in her circumstances face persecution due to their gender identity.\n[22] The claimant also submitted different news articles regarding the situation of sexual minorities and violence against LGBT persons in El Salvador.13\n[23] According to the most recent US Department of State Country Reports14, there is widespread discrimination and violence against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender persons, even though the law prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.\n[24] According to Amnesty International, LGBTI persons in the Northern Triangle of Central America \u201care frequently the target of different forms of violence due to their real or perceived sexual orientation and\/or gender identity, such as, for example, intimidation, threats, physical aggression, sexual violence and even murder\u201d.15\n[25] Another report by Amnesty International indicates that trans women, who are particularly stigmatized because of patriarchal social norms, are especially subjected to violence and extortion by gangs and often face greater obstacles to accessing justice due to discrimination.16 Furthermore, since the eruption of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, the situation has definitely deteriorated and the measures taken by the government have put many trans women in an extremely vulnerable position.17\n[26] After considering the documentary evidence submitted, the tribunal concludes the claimant has established a reasonable fear of persecution if she returns to El Salvador.\nState Protection\n[27] The tribunal finds that adequate state protection would not be available to the claimant in El Salvador.\n[28] The objective documentary evidence indicates that the authorities also engage in violence and discrimination against LGBTI people18:\nNGOs reported that public officials, including police, engaged in violence and discrimination against sexual minorities. Persons from the LGBTI community stated that the PNC and the Attorney General\u2019s Office harassed transgender and gay individuals when they reported cases of violence against LGBTI persons, including by conducting unnecessary and invasive strip searches.\n[29] Furthermore, impunity persisted despite government steps to dismiss and prosecute abusers in the security forces, executive branch, and justice system.19\n[30] In fact, many LGBTI people prefer not to report to the authorities the attacks they suffer and the few people who dare go to the authorities to report a crime \u201care frequently re-victimized or treated with disdain, indifference and discrimination due to their gender identity and\/or expression, and so they rarely follow their case up and even, sometimes, withdraw it\u201d.20\n[31] The tribunal notes that the claimant did seek protection from the authorities in XXXX 2017, after she was kidnaped, but there was no further action from the authorities.\n[32] Based on the claimant\u2019s personal circumstances, specifically a transgender person, as well as the objective country documentation, the tribunal finds that the claimant has rebutted the presumption of state protection.\nInternal Flight Alternative (IFA)\n[33] The tribunal also considered whether the claimant could reasonably and safely relocate to another city in El Salvador. The tribunal is of the opinion that the claimant does not have a viable IFA in El Salvador.\n[34] It appears from the objective documentary evidence mentioned above that the situation of sexual minorities in El Salvador is the same throughout the country.\n[35] Given the claimant\u2019s profile, a transsexual person who has transitioned from male to female, and also considering that gangs are present all over the country, the tribunal concludes that the claimant faces a reasonable possibility of persecution throughout El Salvador.\n[36] Therefore, there is no viable IFA in the claimant\u2019s particular circumstances.\nCONCLUSION\n[37] For these reasons, the tribunal finds that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (also known as XXXX) is a \u201cConvention refugee\u201d pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA.\n[38] Therefore, the tribunal accepts her claim.\n(signed) Heidy Melissa Arango\n19 February 2021\n1 The claimant is identified as male in her passport but self-identifies as female according to her allegations.

Del Negro\nCountry: India\nRPD Number: TC1-12301\nAssociated RPD Number(s): TC1-12302\nATIP Number: A-2022-00978\nATIP Pages: 000018-000026\nREASONS FOR DECISION\nINTRODUCTION\n[1] This is the decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) in the claim of XXXX XXXX XXXX (principal claimant) and XXXX XXXX XXXXX (minor claimant), citizens of India, who are claiming refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (the \u201cAct\u201d)1.\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] The specifics of these claims are stated in the narratives of the claimants\u2019 Basis of Claim (BOC) form.2 In summary, the claimants allege that they cannot return to India because they fear being persecuted by the police based on their membership of a particular social group namely: family ties with XXXX XXXX \u2013 an XXXX involved in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.\n[3] The principal claimant is XXXX XXXX XXXX. The police were allegedly seeking to arrest XXXX who hid in the claimants\u2019 house before he left India on XXXX 2019. The suspicion that the claimants hid XXXX in their house resulted in police harassment against the claimants.\n[4] On one of the raids by the police on XXXX 2019, the principal claimant was beaten, arrested, and sexually assaulted by the police after they discovered that she was in communication with XXXX. Subsequently, the principal claimant left India for Canada on XXXX 2019. After the principal claimant\u2019s departure, the police raided the claimants house and harassed the minor claimant. The minor claimant was brought to Canada by his father on XXXX 2019, and together the principal and minor claimant made a refugee claim on October 17, 2019.\n[5] In rendering the decision and reasons, the panel considered and applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guidelines on Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution3 to ensure that appropriate accommodations were made in questioning the principal claimant, in the overall hearing process, and in substantively assessing the claims.\nDETERMINATION\n[6] After considering the claimants\u2019 testimony and the documentary evidence, the panel finds that the claimants are \u201cConvention refugees\u201d based on their membership of a particular social group: family ties with XXXX XXXX \u2013 an XXXX involved in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[7] The panel finds that the claimants\u2019 identities as nationals of India are established on a balance of probabilities by the copies of their Indian passports4.\nCredibility\n[8] Testimony provided under oath is presumed to be truthful unless there is a valid reason for doubting its truthfulness.5\n[9] In assessing the credibility of the evidence presented by the claimants, the panel accepts the allegations in the claim on a balance of probabilities. The claimants\u2019 testimony was consistent, spontaneous, and was generally supported by personal documentary evidence. As such, the panel finds that the claimants have established the following facts on a balance of probability.\n\nThat XXXX is involved in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX based on the principle claimant\u2019s testimony that he XXXX XXXX in the community.That XXXX\u2019s political stand forms the basis of police assault and harassment against the claimants.That the police arrested and sexually assaulted the principal claimant on XXXX 2019, and as a result she sought medical attention at XXXX XXXX under the care of Dr. XXXX.That the principal claimant and her husband are separated due to the ongoing issues with the police in India and the principal claimant\u2019s testimony that their last communication was about two years ago.That the police harassment has not only made the principal claimant fearful but also affected the mental state of the minor claimant.[10] The panel further notes that the claimant\u2019s allegations are supported by personal documentary evidence which establish that the claimants face persecution because of their membership of a particular social group: family.\n[11] The panel finds no reason to doubt the authenticity of the documentary evidence that the claimants disclosed. The panel finds that the evidence supports and corroborates the claimants\u2019 allegations and accords them full weight in establishing the basis of persecution, attacks and sexual assault against the claimants, and the forward-facing risk the claimants face should they return to India. Specifically, the panel referred to the following documents:\n\nAn affidavit dated 29-11-2021, by XXXX XXXX, the village sarpanch corroborating the basis of persecution, subsequent attacks and forward\u00ad facing risk the claimants face should they return to India;6An affidavit dated 01-12-2021, from the principal claimant\u2019s parents, XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX corroborating the basis of harassment by the police, subsequent assaults, and the condition of affairs between the principal claimant and her husband7;A copy of the doctor\u2019s note from XXXX XXXX XXXX dated 30-11- 2021, by Dr. XXXX regarding the minor claimant\u2019s diagnosis of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and the medication currently being administered8; and a copy of the note from the minor claimant\u2019s school counsellor, XXXX about the minor claimant\u2019s traumatic experience for the school year 2020-20219 corroborates the principal claimant\u2019s testimony about the impact of the police harassment in India on the minor claimant.Well-Founded Fear of Persecution\n[12] Item 12.4 of the NDP10 reports that Sikhs account for approximately 2% of the population in India. The report further states that communities that \u201cadvocate for and support a separate Sikh state or Khalistan\u201d or challenge the power of the state government in religious matters, activists against Sikhs who are suspected of being \u201cmilitant sympathizers\u201d are \u201csubject to monitoring and in some cases, detention and torture\u201d. Objective country evidence further reveals that the status of women in India is not equal to that of men, and that gender-based violence is prevalent across India. 11\n[13] Item 1.5 of the NDP12 further reports that the ease with which an individual can relocate internally depends to a large degree on their individual circumstances, including whether they have family or community connections in the intended area of relocation, and their financial situation. According to the report, internal relocation is generally easier for men and family groups as local sources advised relocation would generally be possible for a single woman without children, who was able to access accommodation and support networks, or who was educated, skilled or wealthy enough to support herself.\n[14] The panel finds that the principal claimant testimony about the difficulty she will experience in renting as a single woman, her language and work skills, her responsibility to her son, and her age effectively described the difficulties experienced by persons perceived to supporters of Khalistan. The principal claimant\u2019s testimony also confirms the experience of women in India based on their gender and has convincingly described her fears for future persecution because she is a woman.\n[15] The principal claimant\u2019s subjective fear for her safety in India because she is a woman is supported by objective country evidence, which shows that similarly situated women in India are likely to be faced with serious threats such as rape, domestic violence, dowry related deaths and honour killings.13\n[16] The panel finds that the claimants have demonstrated, on a balance of probabilities, that they have a subjective fear of persecution in India that is objectively well founded.\nState Protection\n[17] The panel finds that the claimants have rebutted the presumption of state protection with clear and convincing evidence that such protection is not available to them. This includes the principal claimant\u2019s testimony that the state is the agent of persecution, and her sexual assault experience at the hands of the police. The panel finds that the principal claimant\u2019s reluctance to seek police protection was reasonable in her circumstances.\n[18] The panel therefore finds that, based on a balance of probabilities, state protection is not available to the claimants.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[19] IFA analysis is a two-prong approach.14 In considering the identified IFAs, the panel is mindful that the Federal Court of Appeal has set a high threshold for the second prong of the IFA test in that \u201cit requires nothing less than the existence of conditions which would jeopardize the life and safety of a claimant\u201d.15 The jurisprudence is clear that the personal circumstances of the claimant must be central to the reasonableness analysis.16 The central question in the second prong of the test is whether expecting the claimants to relocate to the proposed IFA locations would be \u201cunduly harsh\u201d.17\n[20] The claimants bear the burden of proof. In this case, the panel has proposed IFAs in Mumbai or Rajasthan, India.\n[21] When asked if there was any reason, apart from the alleged agents of persecution, that she could not travel to and live in Mumbai or Rajasthan, the principal claimant testified that without a man in her life, she could not move to or live in the proposed IFAs. She testified that as a single woman, no one would rent her a place to live, because single women do not live on their own.\n[22] The principal claimant also testified that although she works in a XXXX in Canada, she has never worked in India, and would not be able to get a job without connections or the support of a man. She further testified that because of her separation from her husband, she has no one in India who would support or help her. The minor claimant who would have been able to support the principal claimant has also been diagnosed of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX which makes it difficult for him to focus on school.\n[23] The principal claimant testified that because they would not be able to find or afford housing in either of the IFAs, she would be forced to live on the street, which could subject her to sexual abuse at the hands of men.\n[24] Objective country evidence shows that single women in India need to depend on the goodwill of others to provide for them.18 This same evidence indicates that landlords do not want to rent to a single woman, as they are expected to live with a male relative. Other country evidence shows that domestic violence, which includes control, isolation, threats, and coercion, greatly increases the chances of an Indian woman becoming homeless, and that violence against homeless women in India is rampant.19\n[25] Based upon the claimants\u2019 testimony and the objective country documentation, the panel finds that it is not reasonable for the claimants to seek refuge in Mumbai or Rajasthan. The principal claimant has no work experience in India. She is a victim of sexual assault by the police who are the people meant to protect her, her education level is low, she does not speak Hindi which is spoken at the IFA locations, and she has no employable skills to support herself in the IFA locations. She is currently separated from her husband and would have no family or friend support in any of the proposed IFAs to assist her with employment or housing. In addition, the principal claimant is responsible for the minor claimant who is undergoing XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.\n[26] In considering all of the circumstances that are particular to the claimants, the panel finds that they would not be able to successfully establish herself in India. The panel is also mindful of the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9, Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution, and the fact that expecting the claimants to relocate to an IFA, given their particular circumstance, would subject them to a risk of homelessness, and related sexual violence and other forms of violence addressed in the referred guideline. This would make the claimants\u2019 relocation to one of the proposed IFAs unduly harsh.\n[27] Because the panel has found that relocating to one of the proposed IFAs would be unduly harsh for the claimants, there is no need to analyze the first prong of the IFA test. The panel finds that, based on a balance of probabilities, the claimants do not have a viable IFA in India.\nCONCLUSION\n[28] Having considered all the evidence, including the claimants\u2019 testimony, the panel finds that the claimants face a serious possibility of persecution in India as members of a particular social group, fearing persecution due to their membership in a family.\n[29] Therefore, the panel finds that the claimants are \u201cConvention refugees\u201d pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA.\n[30] The panel accepts their refugee claim.\n(signed) Ayo Adetuberu\nDecember 15, 2021\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27, section 96 and 97(1) [IRPA].\n2 Exhibit 2, Basis of Claim Form (BOC)\n3 Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (IRB) Chairperson Guideline 8: Procedures With Respect to Vulnerable Persons Appearing Before the IRB.

Qi\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Lindsey K Weppler\nCountry: China\nRPD Number: TB9-29019\nAssociated RPD Number(s):\nATIP Number: A-2022-00978\nATIP Pages: 000012-000017\nREASONS FOR DECISION\nINTRODUCTION\n[1] These are the reasons for the decision in the claim of XXXX XXXX. You claim to be a citizen of China and are claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.1\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] The detail of your claim is fully set out in your Basis of Claim form2 and is supplemented by your testimony at the hearing. In summary, you fear persecution in China at the hands of the Chinese government due to your membership in a particular social group; specifically, as a Falun Gong practitioner.\n[3] You allege that you were introduced to Falun Gong by your boyfriend in March 2019, while studying in Canada. You allege that at the time, you felt depressed, stressed from your studies and had difficulty eating and sleeping. You further allege that since practicing Falun Gong, you have felt positive changes both physically and mentally, as such, you have continued to be involved with Falun Gong practice and activities.\n[4] You allege that if you return to China, you would be persecuted due to your identity as a Falun Gong practitioner. You also allege that there is no state protection or an Internal Flight Alternative for you in China.\nDETERMINATION\n[5] I find, on a balance of probabilities, that you have credibly established a nexus between what you fear and a Convention ground. Accordingly, I find that you are a Convention refugee, pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA, as there exists a serious possibility of persecution, should you return to China. My reasons are as follows.\nIdentity\n[6] Your identity as a citizen of China is established, on a balance of probabilities, by your Chinese passport, the original which was seized by the Minister.3\nANALYSIS\n[7] In assessing your credibility, I am cognizant of the difficulties faced by claimants in establishing their claim, such as cultural factors, level of education and sophistication, anxiety inherent in responding to oral questions through an interpreter and the added stress in testifying via videoconference.\n[8] I find you to be a credible witness in general and therefore believe what you alleged in support of your claim.\n[9] Although you provided testimony regarding your relationship with your boyfriend, I did not find it necessary to explore it further given that a sur place basis to the claim have been established. Accordingly, I will not address this matter any further or make any findings on the credibility of your relationship with your boyfriend, Mr. XXXXX.\nThe Claimant\u2019s Identity as a Falun Gong Practitioner\n[10] You testified in a straightforward manner, and there were no material inconsistencies in your testimony or contradictions between your testimony and the other evidence before me which have not been satisfactorily explained.\n[11] I accept, based on your credible testimony, that you were introduced to Falun Gong by your boyfriend in March 2019 in Canada and shortly thereafter began to practice on a regular basis.\n[12] With respect to your Falun Gong knowledge, I find your knowledge is commensurate to the length and frequency of your Falun Gong practice. Through your testimony, you have demonstrated adequate knowledge and understanding of Falun Gong and Master Li\u2019s teachings. Although your explanation of attachments was not perfect, it reflected your own understanding of the Zhuan Falun and Master Li\u2019s teachings. You were able to correctly identify and explain the purpose of the exercises when asked. You also correctly explained the law wheel and Karma. You explained why one should cultivate the mind in order to reach a higher level, and thus focus should be placed on cultivating the mind as it is more important than the body. You were also able to correctly explain the purpose and importance of sending righteous thoughts.\n[13] Most compelling was your testimony about loss and gain. You testified that you have always felt this loss growing up without a father and that made you felt different than other children. Prior to practicing Falun Gong, you were always fixated on why you did not have a father and why other children would have things that you did not have, and that you were unhappy because of this. You explained that these were attachments, and that through your practice and reading the book Zhuan Falun, you are able to let go of these feelings and that you have learned to care more about how your family members feel rather than your own feelings.\n[14] You testified about your participation in Falun Gong group practices and truth clarifying activities in Canada. You have also provided photos4 and support letters from your boyfriend as well as another friend.5 You further testified that Falun Gong has become a part of your life and that you wish to continue your practice freely in Canada. You indicated that Falun Gong has become an important part of your life and that you would not be willing to give up your practice even if you have to return to China.\nDelay in Claiming Refugee Protection\n[15] You were asked about the delay in making your refugee claim. You explained that at the beginning when you were first introduced to Falun Gong, you decided to try it out for the purpose of strengthening your health. Although you have heard that Falun Gong is illegal in China, you did not practice in a committed manner. However, you made the claim for refugee protection when you realized that Falun Gong had integrated and became a part of your life and you were unable to separate yourself from the practice. Given that this time period also coincided with the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, which disrupted routine services at government offices, I find your explanation to be reasonable under these circumstances, and therefore finds that this delay does not raise significant concerns regarding subjective fear or your credibility. Accordingly, I did not draw any negative inferences in these regards.\n[16] I find your testimony to be spontaneous and genuine. You did not embellish your claim even when you had the opportunity to do so when I asked you about your photo being taken while participating in truth clarifying activities in front of XXXX XXXX. For these reasons, I find that you have established your identity as a Falun Gong practitioner, as well as your subjective fear, and I believe that your commitment and your spiritual practice is genuine.\nObjective Basis\n[17] The objective evidence supports your claim. The National Documentary Package for China confirms that the Chinese government has banned the practice of Falun Gong since 1999, labeling it an \u201cevil cult\u201d under China\u2019s Criminal Law and that there is an established 610 Office, an extrajudicial security apparatus wholly designed to eradicate Falun Gong. State authorities systematically target FLG practitioners, forcing them into prisons or labour and education camps where they are subject to harassment, torture, and forced conversion and\/or sentenced to long prison terms.6\n[18] Documentary Evidence further indicates that new regulations on religious affairs took effect in February 2018 strengthening controls on places of worship, travel for religious purposes and children\u2019s religious education. This report indicates that the campaign against Falun Gong continued in 2018 and practitioners face long prison terms and arbitrary detention.7\nState Protection\n[19] With regard to state protection, given that the state is the agent of persecution, I find that it would be objectively unreasonable for you to seek the protection from the state in your circumstances.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[20] I have considered whether an internal flight alternative exists for you. Given that the state is an agent of persecution with control over the entire country, I find that there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout China and therefore a viable Internal Flight Alternative does not exist for you.\nCONCLUSION\n[21] For the foregoing reasons, I conclude that you are a Convention refugee and I therefore accept your claim.\n(signed) Selena Qi\nMarch 15, 2021\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27\n2Exhibit 2 \u2013 Basis of Claim and Narrative.\n3 Exhibit 1 \u2013 Minister\u2019s Package.\n4 Exhibit 8, Disclosure, Claimant Documents, pages 11-13.\n5 Exhibit 9, Disclosure, Claimant Documents, pages 2-7.\n6 Exhibit 3 \u2013 National Documentation Package for China March 2020 version, Items 12.2, 12.22, 12.23.\n7 Exhibit 3 \u2013 National Documentation Package for China March 2020 version, Item 2.7.\n",

Eberhard\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Charlotte Suzanne Cass\nCountry: Jordan\nRPD Number: TB8-32072\nAssociated RPD Number(s):\nATIP Number: A-2022-00978\nATIP Pages: 000001-000011\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] This claim has been decided without a hearing, according to the Immigration and Refugee Board\u2019s Chairperson\u2019s Instructions Governing the Streaming of Less Complex Claims at the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) and paragraph 170(f) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act [IRPA or the Act].1\n[2] The claimant, XXXX XXXX , whose name at birth was XXXX XXXX2 claims to be a citizen of Jordan and is claiming refugee protection pursuant to Sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nDETERMINATION\n[3] I find that you are a Convention refugee because you have established that you face a serious possibility of persecution in Jordan, as a member of a particular social group, namely trans woman.\n[4] In deciding your claim, I have considered and applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guidelines on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Expression [the \u201cSOGIE Guidelines\u201d], which were released on May 1, 2017 as well as the Guidelines on women fearing gender-related persecution.3\nALLEGATIONS\n[5] The details of your claim are set out at length in your Basis of Claim (BOC) form dated November 23, 2018 and amended on December 22, 2020 and 18 January 2021, respectively.4\n[6] In short, throughout your life you have experienced difference painfully, and almost entirely without support from your family or home community. Others who have failed to see and appreciate you have made fun of and endangered you, so that you have had to live in fear and under constant threat of humiliation, discrimination, and violence.\n[7] Specifically, in addition to your family\u2019s unwillingness to accept you, your religious, social and military communities in Jordan reinforced the \u201cwrongness\u201d of who you were, including by teaching intolerance, threatening you, sexually assaulting you and, in your family\u2019s case, trying to marry you off to a woman at a time when you identified as a gay man. You finally left the workforce in Jordan because you could no longer bear the mistreatment, discrimination and harassment you experienced based on others\u2019 perceptions of who you were and their related conclusions about your worth.\n[8] You survived discrimination, erasure and violence in part because of successful romantic partnerships you formed with three men who could see, appreciate and value you. While the relationships were secret, they were yours until your partners were sent back to Iraq. In one case, you believe your homophobic parents are the persons who reported your then partner to Jordanian authorities, causing him to be deported.\n[9] At the time of these relationships, you identified as a gay man and others perceived you this way, because of the way you \u201clook, speak, walk and even carry your bag,\u201d to use your own words.5 Nowhere was safe for you; not state offices, not the streets, not police, not conservative religious communities, where the common belief is that all gay persons deserve to \u201cburn in hell,\u201d again to use your own description This belief has real consequences in Jordan, including risk to your very life in the event your sexuality (or the truth of your intimate relationships) was discovered, confirmed and became publicly known.\n[10] Since 2016, you have enjoyed the security of a trusting, loving relationship with your partner.6 Yet, it too had to remain secret in Jordan, so that you could both remain relatively safe, and to prevent your partner\u2019s deportation from Jordan to his country of nationality, Iraq, a real possibility as your past experiences taught you.\n[11] Following painful rebukes from several family members who saw the two of your together in public and judged your relationship, the situation grew more dangerous for your both when your partner\u2019s sister\u2019s husband came uninvited to your apartment in XXXX 2018. Finding you and your partner together there, he assaulted you and threatened your safety. He also took your cell phones, which contained compromising information and images about your lives and relationship, and he threatened to use this information to have you detained and your partner deported.\n[12] After this incident, your partner immediately registered with UNHCR7 in Jordan, citing these threats. And you responded by also trying to protect your safety, including by taking steps to leave Jordan. You fled the country without delay, traveling to Canada in XXXX 2018. However, you returned to Jordan two weeks later at your partner\u2019s request, to help him because he was suffering in hiding. Specifically, at the time he was living alone in a boiler room, where he was hungry and terrified of discovery and deportation to Iraq.\n[13] When you returned to Jordan to help your partner, you told no one except your niece\u2019s husband, who you had come to trust. While you were in the country, your partner would come to see you at night only when he felt it was relatively safe to do so. You returned to Canada from Jordan in XXXX 2018 and sought refugee protection without delay.\n[14] In the intervening months, which became two years, you have found support in the LGBTQI community here, and you have come to identify yourself as a trans woman, something that was \u201cimpossible\u201d before, including because of your own assimilation of some of the cultural limitations of Jordanian society. Until he safely arrived in Canada in XXXX 2020, as a resettled UNHCR refugee, you continued throughout this time to fear for your partner\u2019s safety. You have remained joyfully together since your reunion now a year ago.\n[15] During this time, you have also taken steps to gather medical and psychological support from professionals who can and have begun to help you become increasingly more physiologically aligned with your true self, including by using hormones that promote \u201cfeminine\u201d features. And, you have sought and received psychological treatment and care to tend your past and ongoing suffering, including as caused by the delay in having your claim decided.\n[16] Since you have been here in Canada together with your partner, your dream of living in \u201csafety and dignity\u2026able to express yourself\u2019 without fear of harm, united in love and peace has moved closer to reality. Together, again to use your own words, you now \u201cfeel human for the first time in (y)our lives [and] it feels safe and normal to live here as a couple\u2026[in a] beautiful life.\u201d\n[17] Your claim against Jordan is based on the fear of persecution you will face if you return, including by the state and others who have already threatened and harmed you. And, with the possibility of return to Jordan, you have continued to fear losing the \u201cbeautiful life\u201d you have begun to build here in Canada together with your beloved partner.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[18] You have established your identity as a national of Jordan on a balance of probabilities by your disclosure of relevant documents including a copy of your passport.8\n[19] I note you\u2019ve also provided several additional identity documents including your original driver\u2019s license and national identity card from Jordan. Copies of these and other identity documents, including your birth certificate from Jordan are in evidence.9\n[20] For record keeping purposes, your name as given at birth, which also presently appears on your identity documents, is included on this decision as an AKA or an \u201calso known as.\u201d In amending the IRB\u2019s institutional record of your name, I am applying Operational Bulletin Number 7 and reading it together with the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Expression (the \u201cSOGIE Guidelines\u201d).10\n[21] In particular, I rely on Section 4 of the Guidelines which directs the use of appropriate language in hearings and decisions and states:\nAll persons in proceedings before the IRB have a responsibility to be respectful toward other participants. Part of this responsibility includes the use of appropriate language by all participants. Appropriate language is defined as language that reflects that person\u2019s self\u00ad identification and avoids negative connotations. Individuals should be addressed and referred to by their chosen name, terminology and pronouns. [emphasis added]\nCredibility\n[22] I find you to be a very credible witness and I believe what you\u2019ve alleged in support of your claim.\n[23] Your account of why you fear persecution in Jordan is set out in an open, direct, straightforward and clear manner, and there are no relevant inconsistencies between your BOC account, including amendments, and the other evidence before me.\n[24] In particular, I accept as fully reasonable and satisfactory your explanation for why you returned to Jordan after only two weeks in Canada after you first fled in XXXX 2018. You explained that you returned to assist your beloved partner who was suffering and living in immense fear, including of deportation to Iraq, having been threatened, assaulted and having had his phone with compromising information stolen. In your particular circumstances, this makes sense and is otherwise consistent with your account. In making this finding, I have considered that when you returned to Jordan, or reavailed, you remained in virtual hiding and your presence in Jordan was known only to your niece\u2019s husband.\n[25] While you did not testify at a hearing, your \u201cvoice\u201d was clear in your Basis of Claim form and the other many personal documents you presented to corroborate your claim. In particular, I note the shift in your self-identification as between your initial BOC and your later BOC Amendments from gay man to trans woman.11 Given the cultural context in Jordan, and your own personal experiences, it is entirely reasonable that you only appreciated the option of exploring your gender identity after you began to reside in Canada and grew more comfortable with the relative safety here, especially noting the supportive LGBTQI community of which you have become a part.12\n[26] Over the course of more than two years, you provided substantial personal documentation to corroborate all aspects of your claim, in fact, there are twelve exhibits before me, most of which are your personal documents.13 In sum, the documents corroborate your account of your life in Jordan, including your education and employment there, most notably your early studies at an Islamic religious school.14\n[27] I have also carefully reviewed the many medical reports in evidence, including those that demonstrate your continuing efforts to harmonize your inner self with your physiological body.15 There are several documents that indicate your efforts to see an endocrinologist, and later ones that show you had such appointments.16 Other letters by professionals including psychiatrists and psychologists also contain information that is consistent with what you have set out about your ongoing efforts, and indeed the struggles you have faced, to live authentically.\n[28] Notably, some of these reports were submitted in support of an application to have you designated as a Vulnerable Person, including because of the impact on your well-being of the realities you have faced before you arrived into Canada and the delay here in having your claim decided. As the member who ultimately assessed and decided your claim, I want to acknowledge this delay and express my deep regret for it, especially because of its impact on you.\n[29] The many support letters in evidence are also of particular note not only because they contain details about your life and risks you face in Jordan, but also because they are personal letters written by persons with direct personal knowledge of you, including past partners and your niece\u2019s husband, who is a trusted family member and friend.17\n[30] Your lawyer in Jordan has also submitted a letter on your behalf, which is consistent with your account of his advice to you, which essentially was to leave Jordan for your safety.18 Specifically, his letter clearly corroborates your account of having been assaulted and threatened together with your partner in Jordan, which was the precipitating cause of your flight in XXXX 2018. It also provides insight into your inability, in your circumstances, to access state authorities and your ongoing risk of detention and prison by Jordanian authorities, including because of your family members\u2019 continuing \u201cpursuit\u201d of you both.\n[31] For all of these reasons, I accept the evidence that you\u2019ve presented both documentary and testamentary, and I find it to be credible.\nNexus, subjective fear\n[32] A person who seeks protection as a Convention refugee has to establish both that she is afraid of persecution in her home country based on a nexus ground, and that there is an objective basis for that fear, including as reflected in the country condition evidence.\n[33] In your case, the primary Convention ground is particular social group of which you are a member as a Jordanian trans woman. I also note that at the time you fled Jordan and initially made your claim in Canada, you self-identified as, and were perceived by others to be, a gay man. This is another basis for your membership in a particular social group, also because of the treatment in Jordan members of the LGBTQI community.\n[34] I find that your decisions and actions in leaving Jordan and claiming refugee protection in Canada as soon as possible are consistent with having a subjective fear of persecution. I note you left Jordan nearly immediately after you were assaulted and threatened when your relationship with your partner was discovered and confirmed by family members. Again, I have considered the context and circumstances that caused you to flee, those that caused you to return to Jordan in virtual hiding, and the situation that culminated in your final return to Canada, within months, to claim for refugee protection without further delay.\nObjective basis\n[35] The country condition documents in the National Documentation Package (NDP) for Jordan dated 18 December 2020,19 as well as the documents disclosed by counsel20 are also consistent with your allegations that there is a serious possibility you will face persecution as a trans woman (including one who formerly identified and was perceived in Jordan as a gay man) if you return.21\n[36] In particular, NDP item 6.1 by Outright Action International entitled \u201cJordan. Activism and Resilience: LGBTQ Progress in The Middle East and North Africa: Case Studies From Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco and Tunisia,\u201d reports that Jordanian authorities use morality and public decency laws to target LGBTQ persons. Trans women face specific risks under Penal Code Article 30722 which can impose a prison sentence of up to six months on \u201cany man disguised as a woman who enters into a place reserved or restricted for the use of women.\u201d23\n[37] Generally, Jordanian law does not explicitly recognize or protect transgender people and violence and discrimination against LBBT people is pervasive in both public and private spheres, including employment.24 This is consistent with your explanation for why you could no longer bear the discrimination you faced in the course of your employment in Jordan.\n[38] Moreover, as counsel\u2019s country condition packages indicate, the Jordanian Parliament in 2018 passed a law criminalizing gender-affirming surgeries (\u201csex reassignment\u201d) for trans persons. Article 22 of the Medical Liability law targets medical service providers, stating that anyone who performs a gender affirming surgery \u201cshall be imprisoned for a period of not less than three years and not more than ten years with temporary penal labour.\u201d25\n[39] Moreover, the very fact that there is little information in the NDP (one report) about the situation for sexual minorities is also consistent with the kind of repression that is at the core of your own personal experience of living in Jordan.26\n[40] Based on the totality of evidence before me, both personal and objective, I find your fear of persecution in Jordan is well-founded and you face a serious possibility of persecution in Jordan if you return because of your membership in a particular social group as a trans woman. In making these findings, I have also considered your past self-identification and perception by others in Jordan as a gay man.\nState protection\n[41] There is a presumption that states can protect their own citizens except when they are completely broken down, which is not the case in Jordan. To rebut this presumption of state protection, a claimant has to provide \u201cclear and convincing\u201d evidence of the state\u2019s inability or unwillingness to protect its citizens.\n[42] Again, with respect to the country condition documents in evidence, I find that you are precariously situated as a trans woman in Jordan. You are not free or permitted to be who you are, to express yourself as you choose, to dress as you prefer, to call yourself by your chosen name or to love who you love. And, you face risks at every level, from your family, to your community (religious and otherwise) to your state. In practice, these intersecting pieces of your life mean you face the realities of discrimination, mistreatment, exclusion and even violence, whether in employment, healthcare, walking down a street or greeting a family member.\n[43] I find state authorities will not adequately protect you in Jordan. Indeed, they may be the, or among the, agents responsible for persecuting you for being who you are, including through the misuse of morality laws, and the penal code.\n[44] For all of these reasons, following the Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s decision of Ward,27 having regard to your own personal experience and the experiences of others similarly situated to you, I find you have presented sufficient clear and convincing evidence to rebut the presumption that adequate state protection is available to you in Jordan, on a balance of probabilities.\nInternal flight alternative\n[45] I have also considered whether an internal flight alternative exists for you in Jordan. Generally speaking, internal relocation is not an option if a person has to conceal their sexual orientation or gender identity in a proposed new location.28 This principle is expressed in the SOGIE Guidelines. Anywhere you go in Jordan, you would face the same situation as you have described in your account, fearing the state, your community, particularly conservative religious men, and your family members. I therefore find you face a serious possibility of persecution throughout Jordan, and there is no internal flight alternative available to you.\nCONCLUSION\n[46] For all of these reasons, I find you have established you face a serious possibility of persecution in Jordan on a Convention ground. I therefore find that you are a Convention refugee and I accept your claim.\n[47] I wish you all the best, especially as you settle into a newfound sense of security and joy in your life here.\n(signed) J.

        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2021 RLLR 35\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: March 16, 2021\nPanel: Jessica Norman\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): El-Farouk Khaki\nCountry: Ukraine\nRPD Number: TB9-07374\nAssociated RPD Number(s):\nATIP Number: A-2022-00665\nATIP Pages: 000173-000180\nREASONS FOR DECISION\nINTRODUCTION\n[1] These are the reasons for the decision in the claim of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, legally known as XXXX XXXX, who alleges that they are a citizen of Ukraine, and are claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (the \u201cIRPA\u201c).\n[2] This claim has been decided without a hearing, according to the Immigration and Refugee Board\u2019s Chairperson\u2019s Instructions Governing the Streaming of Less Complex Claims at the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) and paragraph 170(f) of the IRPA.\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] The details of the claimant\u2019 s allegations are fully set out in their Basis of Claim form and narrative, dated XXXX XXXX XXXX 2019.1 To summarize, the claimant alleges that they fear persecution at the hands of the Ukrainian police and Ukrainian society, including far-right nationalist groups, due to their sexual orientation and gender identity as a bisexual, non-binary, transgender person.\nDETERMINATION\n[4] For the following reasons, the panel determines that the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA, because they face a serious possibility of persecution in Ukraine.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[5] The panel finds that the claimant\u2019s identity as a Ukrainian citizen is established, on a balance of probabilities, by a certified copy of their genuine Ukrainian passport.2\nNexus\n[6] The panel finds that there is a link between the claimant\u2019s fear and the Convention refugee definition \u2013 namely, membership in a particular social group as a queer, non-binary, transgender person. Accordingly, the panel has assessed their claim pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA.\nCredibility\n[7] The claimant\u2019s narrative includes a detailed description of growing up in a repressive and abusive environment, where they were abused by their parents, bullied, and physically and sexually assaulted, including by their classmates, for not conforming to gender norms. The claimant also gives a detailed description of how they came to understand their own sexual orientation and gender identity after coming to Canada. The claimant\u2019s BOC form and narrative are internally consistent, and entirely consistent with the other forms they completed upon initiating their refugee claim.\n[8] The claimant submitted relevant and probative documentary evidence corroborating their allegations.3 That evidence includes a copy of their birth certificate; copies of detailed social media posts expressing their sexual orientation and gender identity; detailed letters of support, including from the claimant\u2019s partners and other friends described in their narrative; documents showing that the claimant attended the 519 \u201cAmong Friends\u201d program well before initiating a refugee claim; photos of the claimant with partners and friends, including at Pride events; and a letter from the claimant\u2019s XXXX corroborating their XXXX health issues.\n[9] The claimant\u2019s documentary evidence is consistent, in content and chronology, with their basis of claim form and narrative and with the other evidence in their claim.\n[10] The panel believes what the claimant has alleged and finds that they have established on a balance of probabilities that they are a queer, non-binary, transgender person.\nSubjective Fear\n[11] The panel notes that the claimant arrived in Canada in 2013 but did not file a refugee claim until XXXX 2019, at which point they had been out of status since XXXX 2017.4 The panel considered whether this gives rise to a negative inference as to their subjective fear of returning to Ukraine.\n[12] The claimant explained that prior to leaving Ukraine to attend university in Toronto in 2013, they were unaware of their sexual orientation and gender identity. It was only after becoming part of a community of transgender, non-binary and other queer persons that they began to explore this aspect of their identity. They began to identify as, and publicly came out as, a non-binary transgender person in XXXX 2016, at which point they changed their chosen name from XXXX to XXXX XXXX XXXX. The claimant has not returned to Ukraine since that time.\n[13] The claimant also explained that although they learned of the existence of the refugee claim system in XXXX 2017 after visiting the 519, their poor XXXX health and homelessness made it difficult to make decisions and seek information about anything outside day-to-day survival.\n[14] The claimant explained that in XXXX 2018, they were finally able to access healthcare for the first time since the expiry of their previous health insurance, and that after receiving XXXX health treatment they began working with a lawyer to prepare a refugee claim in XXXX 2018. However, after an exploitative employment situation, followed by the loss of their job, their XXXX health again worsened, and they were unable to continue. The claimant alleged that it was only after their partner reached out to their current counsel in XXXX 2018, and learned of the existence of legal aid, that the claimant felt able to continue working on their claim.\n[15] The claimant submitted evidence corroborating that they had begun working with a lawyer in XXXX 2018,5 as well as evidence corroborating their XXXX health challenges.6\n[16] The panel finds that the claimant has provided a reasonable explanation of how their poverty, homelessness and XXXX health issues led to their delay in filing a refugee claim. Accordingly, the panel does not draw a negative credibility inference, and finds that the claimant has established that they fear returning to Ukraine.\nObjective basis\n[17] The panel finds that the claimant\u2019s fear of persecution in Ukraine as a queer, non-binary, transgender person is objectively well founded, and that going forward the claimant faces a serious possibility of persecution. In reaching this conclusion, the panel considered the documents in the National Documentation Package (NDP) for Ukraine dated June 30, 2020,7 as well as the country condition evidence submitted by counsel.8\n[18] Despite the fact that consensual same sex activity was decriminalised in Ukraine in 1991, the objective evidence suggests that \u201cLGBTI people are by and large forced to hide their identities as a result of stigma\u201d.9\n[19] Transgender persons additionally face unique challenges. They reported \u201cdifficulties obtaining official documents reflecting their gender identity, which resulted in discrimination in health care, education, and other areas.\u201d10\n[20] There have been some minor improvements in state policy towards transgender persons. For instance, transgender individuals are no longer required to \u201cundergo sex reassignment surgery to change their names and genders officially\u201d. However, they are still required to receive \u201ccounseling and hormone therapy\u201d to do so. Moreover, regulations \u201cstill prevent reassignment for married individuals and those with minor children.\u201d Furthermore, \u201ctranssexuality\u201d is still classified as a psychiatric disorder, and those individuals who do wish to have reassignment surgery \u201cmust spend 30 days in a psychiatric hospital amongst the mentally ill before this is considered\u201d.11 A person with a diagnosis of \u201ctranssexualism\u201d is \u201clegally prohibited to be a guardian of a child.\u201d12 Until very recently, forced sterilization was required as a part of the legal procedure for gender recognition.13\n[21] Societal violence against LGBTI persons in Ukraine continues to be prevalent and was \u201coften perpetrated by members of violent radical groups.\u201d14 Authorities reportedly \u201coften did not adequately investigate these cases or hold perpetrators to account.\u201d15 Attacks against members of the LGBTI community \u201cwere rarely classified under criminal provisions pertaining to hate crimes, which carried heavier penalties.\u201d16 Moreover, such crimes and discrimination are considered underreported.17\n[22] Far-right nationalists and other radical groups \u201cconsistently tried to disrupt LGBTI events with violence or threats of violence.\u201d18 For instance, at a \u201cTrans March\u201d held on Transgender Day of Remembrance in Kyiv, the eighty people marching were attacked by extremists from the \u201cTradition and Order\u201d far-right group. While six attackers were detained by the police, they were only charged with \u201cpetty hooliganism\u201d.19 Similarly, police intervened and detained members of the radical groups who attacked participants at the European Lesbian Conference in Kyiv with tear gas. However, the \u201cattackers were subsequently released, and no charges were filed.\u201d20\n[23] In summary, the panel finds that the objective evidence strongly corroborates that the claimant faces a serious possibility of persecution in Ukraine on the basis of their sexual orientation and gender identity.\nState Protection\n[24] There is a presumption that States are capable of protecting their own citizens. However, a claimant can rebut the presumption of State protection, and demonstrate that such protection would not be provided, with clear and convincing evidence of the unwillingness or inability of the State to protect them.21\n[25] The objective evidence described above details the inadequate response by police to violence and other abusive behaviour against the LGBTI community. A 2020 report from the \u201cLGBT Human Rights Nash Mir Center\u201d summed up the situation as such: \u201cHate crimes against LGBT people are investigated ineffectively, offenders often avoid responsibility, and the motives of intolerance on grounds of sexual orientation or gender identity are ignored.\u201d22\n[26] In addition to the incidents and patterns already described, there are also reports of police violence against members of the LGBTI community, and instances of the police luring members of the community through online ads and then extorting them for money.23 Moreover, police reportedly \u201cused laws on human trafficking or prostitution as a pretext to target LGBTI persons\u201d, including in a raid on a gay nightclub in Dnipro in April 2018.\n[27] With respect to police protection for Pride and other marches, a report by Freedom House states that \u201cwhen police do provide protection, they often only protect the assembly itself, allowing participants to be attacked before and after the event.\u201d24\n[28] Having considered all the evidence, the panel finds that the presumption of State protection has been rebutted.\nInternal flight alternative\n[29] The panel considered whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for the claimant. Given the objective evidence already cited above, which confirms that the State and its agents are often among the agents of persecution, whether directly or indirectly, the panel finds that the claimant does not have an internal flight alternative. There is nowhere in Ukraine that they could safely live openly as a queer, non-binary, transgender person.\nCONCLUSION\n[30] Having considered all the evidence, the panel finds that the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA, as they face a serious possibility of persecution in Ukraine on the basis of their sexual orientation and their gender identity and expression. Their claim is therefore accepted.\n(signed) Jessica Norman\n16 March 2021\n1 Exhibit 2.\n2 Exhibit 1.\n3 Exhibit 4.\n4 Exhibit 2.\n5 Exhibit 4.\n6 Ibid.\n7 Exhibit 3, National Documentation Package for Ukraine (June 30, 2020) [Ukraine NDP].\n8 Exhibit 5.\n9 Exhibit 3, Ukraine NDP, Item 2.9, \u201cHate crimes and incidents in Ukraine.\u201d LGBT Human Rights Nash Mir Center.

Given the circumstances that you have faced, and that you are afraid of facing if you remain in Bahrain. You cannot live as a person who you are not. It is reasonable and fair and right, that you want to live as you are. And this is a place where you can do that. So it\u2019s a privilege to be able to give you this decision today.\n[2] Clearly, the state is among those that you are afraid of, so you can\u2019t go to them for protection. Even if it\u2019s a little bit mixed about where they stand, and they sometimes have not been as awful as they might have been. They do arrest people. And they do punish people under morality laws. And it\u2019s the way that you have chosen to hide and how you have managed your life looking over your shoulder and worrying all the time is nota fair way to live your life. It\u2019s not reasonable, it\u2019s not okay.\n[3] So, there isn\u2019t anywhere else in the country that you could go where you wouldn\u2019t face the same problems and risks. So, for all of those reasons, I will grant you protection in a slightly longer and more formal decision in just a minute. Do you have any question so far? No. Counsel, that\u2019s about the gist of it.\n[4] COUNSEL: Thank you.\n[5] MEMBER: What I will say is, given the amount of documentation and the length of time that your claim covers, which is basically your whole life, you\u2019re XXXX. I could say a lot more, we could have been here for longer. It\u2019s not necessary, as I said before, for me to keep you. It\u2019s not necessary for me to put every piece into the decision. You know your story, and the people in your life who matter to you know your story. But I wanted to reflect some of it there.\n[6] So the things that I haven\u2019t put in, forgive me. The things that I have, I chose because they were some of the things that stood out tome, just in case you\u2019re wondering, okay? Okay.\n[7] Let me see what the time is 03:14, okay.\n[8] So I\u2019ve considered your testimony and the other evidence before me and I\u2019m ready to render my decision orally. You will receive an unedited transcript of this decision in the mail in the near future. Your Counsel will also get a copy. So if you have any questions for her, you can ask her.\n[9] The Claimant, XXXX XXXX, otherwise known as (XXXX) (ph), which we\u2019re putting in parentheses, claims to be a citizen of Bahrain and is claiming refugee protection pursuant to Sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[10] For the record, this claim was made in the name of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX which is the name that the Claimant was given at birth, and which appears on the Claimant\u2019s passport. The Claimant has long lived as a male and has completed and signed the Immigration Refugees and Citizenship Canada\u2019s request for a form \u2014 request form for a change of sex designation, what the form is called, to formerly request a change to his name on the record of this proceeding. The request form was signed on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2019 shortly after the Claimant arrived into Canada on claim protection.\n[11] For record keeping purposes only, the name the Claimant was assigned or given at birth, which also appears as I mentioned on his passport will be included on the decision as an AKA or an also known as. In making this change to the IRB\u2019s record I consulted with and I\u2019m applying both the Operational Bulletin Number 7, together with the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Expression or the SOGIE Guidelines.\n[12] In particular, I noted Section 4 of the SOGIE Guidelines on the use of appropriate language which states the following, \u201cAll persons in proceedings before the IRB have a responsibility to be respectful toward other participants. Part of this responsibility includes the use of appropriate language by all participants. Appropriate language is defined as language that reflects that person\u2019s self-identification, and avoids negative connotations. And this is the key part individuals should be addressed and referred to by their chosen name, terminology and pronouns\u201d. I find that you are a convention refugee because you have established that you face a serious possibility of persecution in Bahrain, as a member of a particular social group, namely trans man.\n[13] In deciding your claim, again, I\u2019ve considered and applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Expression, which was released on May 1, 2017.\n[14] The details of your claim are set out at length in your Basis of Claim Form dated March 29, 2019.\n[15] In short, you were born in Bahrain in 1993, to a family of five sisters and parents. As you grew older, you realized that you were different from your sisters and your other cousins in terms of your preferences, including for play, and dress. As you matured, you came to understand that your identity as \u2014 you came to understand your identity male rather than female, as your physical body suggested. You sought ways to express your genuine identity in dress and name and in your relationships over time.\n[16] You forged your own way, trying to walk a tightrope of conformity to please your family and meet social expectations while still being able to recognize yourself. You found support along the way from romantic partners, friends, and in time medical and legal professionals and others who helped you as you sought ways to be more authentic, including in time by physically changing your body first hormonal and later surgically.\n[17] Your decision to leave Bahrain for Canada was not spontaneous, but rather well informed, considered legally advised and still heartbreaking because it meant having to leave your family and your community at home.\n[18] You\u2019ve still not been able to tell your parents that you\u2019re not coming home, and your earlier attempts to be truthful with them about who you are, and your struggle with gender dysphoria were overwhelmingly painful for all of you.\n[19] You left Bahrain as soon as you were able after you received your Canadian (audio cut). You\u2019ve established your identity as a national of Bahrain.\n[20] COUNSEL: Sorry, I think we just lost you for a moment there. After heartbreaking, overwhelmingly heartbreaking for all of you, I think we lost you right after there.\n[21] MEMBER: Okay, I\u2019ll start after that. Okay so I\u2019ll go back your decision to flee Bahrain for Canada was not spontaneous, but rather well informed considered legally advised and still heartbreaking because it meant leaving your family and community at home. You still have not been able to tell your parents that you are not coming home. And your earlier attempts to be truthful with them about who you are, and your struggle with gender dysphoria were overwhelmingly painful for all of you.\n[22] You left Bahrain as soon as you were able, after receiving your Canadian visa, and you sought protection without delay after your arrival.\n[23] You\u2019ve established your identity as a national of Bahrain on a balance of probabilities by your testimony in the copy of your passport, which is in Exhibit 1, another copy is also in Exhibit 4. I note you\u2019ve also provided several additional identity documents in Exhibit 4. These include your national identity card and driving licence from Bahrain.\n[24] I find you to be a very credible witness and I believe what you\u2019ve alleged in support of your claim. You testified in an open, direct, straightforward and very natural manner about all of the central aspects of your account, and there were no relevant inconsistencies in your testimony or contradictions between it and the other evidence before me.\n[25] You provided substantial personal documentation to corroborate all aspects of your claim in Exhibit 4 and 6, which includes the documents I\u2019ve just received today. You provided documents that were consistent in content and chronology with your testimony about your personal identity, including your transition to a trans man.\n[26] In particular, you provided a carefully documented photo essay of your life over 15 years from 2005 to 2019. You\u2019ve entitled your photo essay \u201cBorn Different\u201d, and the photos you have selected to share clearly illustrate your lifelong efforts to freely express your true male identity. They also reflect your ongoing and persistent efforts to balance this desire with the need to protect your safety in Bahrain, within your immediate family, community and in your country.\n[27] As you describe in your account, your awareness of the risks you faced in Bahrain only increased over time, and you hadn\u2019t even always appreciated precisely how precariously you were living. For example, your double life included dressing in male clothing, as your life expanded to use your words appreciating the risk, but not deescalating danger, given that it can be seen as illegal to cross-dress in Bahrain, or to elect to call yourself a male name. You didn\u2019t know this when you first chose to use the name Soud. I\u2019ve considered and accepted the medical evidence before me of your decisions to change your physical body over time to comport with your self-identification as male.\n[28] This has been a lengthy and undoubtedly difficult process at times, including rejection by doctors who wouldn\u2019t undertake the risk of performing your top surgery, boards of directors and others who regulated your personal choices, and who could place you at grave risk if your intentions and information were revealed.\n[29] Other documents and evidence corroborate your account of the efforts you undertook before surgery to shift your external appearance into alignment with your internal one, including by wearing shirt binders for many years and undergoing hormone therapy, which was largely unavailable to you in Bahrain until much later and then not particularly hopefully. Medical reports also document your efforts to seek legal and safer ways to transition including through chromosomal and hormonal analysis and abdominal ultrasounds.\n[30] Ultimately, these efforts were unsuccessful, as were your later efforts to seek professional legal assistance in claiming your own identity in Bahrain.\n[31] Over and again, you heard from psychiatrists and the legal expert that you have talked about that you would have to leave Bahrain in order to live freely and safely as yourself at the high cost of leaving behind your family and other people that you love.\n[32] The letters also in Exhibit 4 reflect the many persons you\u2019ve known in a wide variety of capacities as close family, friends, former employers, volunteer coordinator. All of these letters indicate that you\u2019re a well respected, capable and cared about human being, though not all of them reflect knowledge of your male identity.\n[33] While this synopsis doesn\u2019t reflect the full breadth of the personal evidence that you\u2019ve disclosed, I have considered it all carefully. And I find that the documents that you\u2019ve mentioned together with your testimony are consistent with what you\u2019ve set out in your Basis of Claim Form account about why you fear returning to Bahrain.\n[34] In short, I accept the evidence that you\u2019ve presented both documentary and testamentary. And I find it to be (unintelligible 02:03:48).\n[35] So a person who seeks protection as a convention refugee has to establish both that he\u2019s afraid of persecution at home, and that there\u2019s an objective basis for that fear.\n[36] In your case, the primary convention ground is as I said earlier, a particular social group of which you are a member as a trans man who\u2019s subject to persecution in Bahrain. I find that your decision to leave as soon as possible after receiving your Canadian visa is consistent with having a subjective fear of persecution for the reasons that you have set out in great detail.\n[37] I accept your explanation for the delay in time as between when you got your visa and when you finally left the country. And mainly that you needed to cover your departure for the sake of your parents, who needed a good reason and you were waiting for leave from work to be able to go.\n[38] In making this finding, I\u2019ve also considered your words on the final slide of your photo essay, namely, \u201cI had to choose between the people I love and seeking protection in Canada. I chose to leave the country after consultations and confirmation that I have no future in Bahrain. I\u2019ve been living as a man ever since\u201d.\n[39] The country condition documents in the National Documentation Package for Bahrain dated 31, March 2020, which are in Exhibit 3, as well as those exhibited by \u2014 submitted by Counsel in Exhibit 5 are also consistent with your allegations that there\u2019s a serious possibility you\u2019ll face persecution as a trans man if you returned to Bahrain, particular I\u2019ve looked at items 6.1, 2.1 and 2.6.\n[40] In short, well, there\u2019s some mixed evidence, according to the United States Department of State report, the 1976 penal code. In other words, the law in Bahrain does not criminalize same sex, sexual conduct between consenting adults of at least 21 years. But it does not extend anti-discrimination protections to lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender intersex individuals on the basis of their sexual orientation or gender identity.\n[41] According to human rights watch, the government prosecuted acts, such as organizing a, \u201cgay party, or cross dressing\u201d under Penal Code provisions against \u201cindecency and immorality\u201d. Discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity occurred in Bahrain, including in the areas of employment and obtaining legal identity documents. In some cases, courts have permitted transgender individuals to update identity documents if they had undergone sex reassignment surgery, but as Counsel has suggested by drawing my attention to a case where somebody was granted permission to have this surgery and later ran into troubles nonetheless, things in Bahrain are not clear-cut, and the risks are too high.\n[42] Freedom House states that \u201csame sex activity is not illegal, yet individuals have reportedly been punished for it\u201d. And some organizations explain that it should be noted that there is morality or public decency laws in place in Bahrain that can be interpreted to include LGB and trans persons. Article 324 of the 1976 Penal Code states, that every person who entices a male or female to commit acts of immorality or prostitution, or assist in the acts of any matter whatsoever shall be liable for a prison sentence. This is very general and the fact that such a general morality law exist on the books and can be used puts you at risk.\n[43] Moreover, other documents say that law enforcement agencies in the courts have broad discretionary power to use fines or jail time for any activities that they deem to be in violation of traditional morality.\n[44] Another article by Middle Eastern news site Al Bawaba states that \u201cgender non conforming individuals encounter harassment by police and Bahraini citizens alike\u201d. Country Reports 2014 further states that in July of 2014, a foreign man was sentenced to a month in jail, followed by deportation for \u201cwearing women\u2019s makeup and accessories\u201d. The source adds that the man was arrested because police thought he was walking in a feminine way. This kind of arbitrary, discretionary power is not what you would choose to be subjected to, and certainly would constitute persecution if you are constantly fearing it.\n[45] Moreover, sources indicate that there are no legal measures to prevent discrimination against sexual minorities in Bahrain. According to Human Rights Watch, and there are no organizations in Bahrain, to which sexual minorities may turn for recourse of protection.\n[46] As we discussed, during your hearing, the very fact that there\u2019s almost no information in the NDP about the situation for sexual minorities suggests the kind of repression and discretionary over use of morality laws that is consistent with your account of your own personal experience living there.\n[47] Account of the objective evidence that I\u2019ve just described and noting that Counsel has provided me with well over 100 pages of documentary evidence, which is consistent with what I just set out with more emphasis on cross-dressing and some other aspects of your claim. I find that your fear of persecution in Bahrain is well-founded.\n[48] So given the evidence before me both personal and objective, I find there\u2019s a serious possibility that you\u2019ll face persecution in Bahrain if you return because of your membership in a particular social group as a trans man.\n[49] There\u2019s a presumption that states can protect their own citizens except when they\u2019re in a state of complete breakdown. To rebut this presumption of state protection, a claimant has to provide what we call clear and convincing evidence of the state\u2019s inability or unwillingness.\n[50] Again, with respect to the country condition documents that I have described, I find that you are precariously situated as a trans man in Bahrain, you\u2019re not permitted to be who you are, to dress as you choose, to call yourself by your chosen name. And you face risks at every level, from your family level, to your community level, to your state level, with all of the intersecting pieces of that whether it\u2019s employment or healthcare or access to a wide variety of what is the normal going about of life business.\n[51] Police will not protect you in Bahrain. Indeed, they may be the agents responsible for persecuting you by punishing your dress and your self expression.\n[52] So for all of these reasons, following the Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s decision and award, I find you presented clear and convincing evidence that rebuts the presumption that adequate state protection is available to you on a balance of probabilities having regard to your own persona) experience and the experiences of others similarly situated to you.\n[53] I\u2019ve also considered whether an internal flight alternative exist for you. Generally speaking, internal relocation is not an option if a person has to conceal their sexual orientation or gender identity in the proposed new location. Anywhere you go in Bahrain, you would face the same situation. I therefore find you face a serious possibility of persecution throughout Bahrain, and therefore there is no internal flight alternative available to you.\n[54] So for all of these reasons, I find you established you face a serious possibility of persecution in Bahrain on a convention ground. I therefore find that you are convention refugee and I accept your claim.\n[55] COUNSEL: Thank you, Madam Member.\n[56] MEMBER: You\u2019re most welcome.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014-REASONS CONCLUDED\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

Kim\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Farzan Fallahpour\nCountry: Iran\nRPD Number: TB9-16035\nAssociated RPD Number(s):\nATIP Number: A-2022-00665\nATIP Pages: 000163-000165\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: This is a decision for the claimant XXXX XXXX, file number TB9-16035. I\u2019ve considered your testimony and other evidence in the case, and I\u2019m ready to render my decision orally. For making this decision and in formulating questions for the hearing, I considered Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9, proceedings before the IRB involving sexual orientation, and gender identity and expression. You are claiming to be a citizen of Iran and are claiming Refugee Protection pursuant to s. 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. I find that you are a Convention refugee for the following reasons.\n[2] You allege the following. That you are a citizen of Iran, and that if you were to return, you will face persecution because of your membership in a particular social group as a gay man. You allege that there is not state protection for you or an internal flight alternative.\n[3] Your personal identity as a citizen of Iran has been established by your oral testimony and a copy of your passport, which can be found at Exhibit 1. I find on a balance of possibilities that identity and the country of reference, which is Iran, have been established.\n[4] In terms of your general credibility, I found you be credible witness and I therefore believe what you have alleged in your oral testimony and in your Basis of Claim forms. You provided an extensive amendment to the original Basis of Claim form, which originally alleged that you were gay and also a transgender woman. You\u2019d retracted that portion of the original Basis of Claim form that stated that you are transgender woman, and alleged improper conduct by your former counsel and the interpreter for the counsel. Your testimony was straightforward and was keeping with amended Basis of Claim form. There were no significant inconsistency or omission that went to the heart of the claim, which is that you are a gay man (sic).\n[5] Your oral testimony today included details regarding your realization about your sexual orientation, and learning about the term, and what being a gay person means to you. You discussed your serious relationship you had with a person of the same gender in Canada, and regarding the short-term relationship you\u2019ve had since then. You discussed your serious relationship, how the two you met, how the relationship developed, what you two did as a couple, and how you to broke up, as he had to return to Iran to family issues. You discussed a fear you had of what would happen to him, as he was returning to Iran after being in relationship with another man, and that you never contacted him since you two parted ways.\n[6] You also discussed your father\u2019s negative reaction when he found out about your relationship with your boyfriend and how he cut you off. You also discussed activities you have done in Canada, such as going to clubs and attending pride parade. Your best friend also testified today, in regard to your sexual orientation and knowing about your serious relationship. Although there were some minor inconsistencies with his testimony and your testimony, I do not draw negative credibility inferences on them.\n[7] You provided your own affidavit, in regard to the reason for significant amendment on your Basis of Claim form and XXXX Assessment Report, which can be found at Exhibit 5. You also provided communication to your previous counsel, and the response from the previous counsel. I do not put a lot of weight on this issue with previous counsel, as I find it to be not determinative, as I found you to be credible in your allegation that you are a gay man. Your testimony and the supporting documentation all established, on a balance of probabilities, you are a gay man.\n[8] The country condition documents in the National Documentation Package for Iran, which can be found at Exhibit 3, are consistent with your allegation that there is a serious possibility that you will face persecution as a gay man in Iran. Item 2.1, the US Department of State Report for Iran, points to the crimes involving violence or threats of violence targeting members of the LGBTQ+ communities, criminalization of consensual same-sex conduct as few of significant human rights issues present in Iran (sic). Item 6.2, report by International Lesbian Gay Bisexual Trans and Intersex Association, states the implementation of discriminatory laws against same-sex relations, and states that healthcare professionals have been reported to regularly tell gay and lesbian patients that their same-sex attraction and gender non-conformity are a sign of gender identity disorder that must be treated.\n[9] Item 6.6, report by UK Home Office on sexual orientation and gender identity or expression also points to the Islamic Penal Code that criminalizes same-sex sexual relations, and states that the security forces rely upon discriminatory laws to harass, arrest, and detain those they suspect of being lesbian, gay, and bisexual. Having considered this objective evidence, together with your consistent and credible testimony, I find on a balance of probabilities that you have well-founded fear of persecution in Iran.\n[10] I find on a balance of probabilities that adequate state protection would not be available to you if you were to seek it in Iran, as the agent of persecution is the state authorities. It would be unreasonable to expect you to seek state protection in this case. As already stated, that you report by UK Home Office, Item 6.6, states that security forces use laws to harass and abuse those are part of LGBTQ+ communities in Iran. Therefore, I find on a balance of probabilities that you have rebutted the presumption state protection because adequate state production will not be available to you, as the state will be unwilling to protect you in Iran.\n[11] As you have rebutted the presumption of state protection, and since the country documentation indicates about the situation for individuals in circumstances such as yours is the same throughout the country, I find on the balance of probabilities that you do not have a viable internal flight alternative.\n[12] In conclusion, after assessing ail of the evidence, I find that you have established that there is a serious possibility of persecution on the Convention ground, because of your membership in a particular social group as a gay man. I therefore find that you are Convention refugee, and I accept your claim.\n[13] All right. Thank you, that concludes this hearing.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014-REASONS CONCLUDED\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

The claimants are XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and his mother, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. They seek refugee protection against Venezuela pursuant to s. 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[2] For the following reasons, the Panel finds that the claimants are Convention refugees and this claim is accepted.\n[3] CO-CLAIMANT: Thank you.\n[4] CLAIMANT: Thank you, sir. Thank you very much.\n[5] MEMBER: Mister Interpreter, you can pause at this point, and I will let you know when you can resume.\n[6] For ease of reference, these reasons will make reference to the claimants by their first names.\n[7] This claim was based on the following allegations. XXXX has a history of political involvement in Venezuela, he has participated in numerous protests and often engaged with and clashed with Venezuelan police during these protests. He has travelled to Panama and Argentina in 2014 and again in 2017, to avoid the heated situation in Venezuela and also for educational purposes and other personal reasons related to his sexual orientation.\n[8] XXXX and his mother fled Venezuela for the final time on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2019. Shortly after he left, he learned that he received notifications that he was under investigation. XXXX had no political involvement in Venezuela since 2014, she fears returning to Venezuela because she was targeted for extortion by a taxi driver after a traffic accident.\n[9] Since the first hearing, XXXX has amended her claim to include an allegation that she is also targeted because of her son\u2019s political activity. Since the prior hearing, she has learned that an investigation has been opened against her as well.\n[10] The identities of the claimants were established on the basis of their Venezuelan passports, the originals of which were seized by the Minister.\n[11] The Panel\u2019s primary concern in this claim with respect to the credibility of XXXX extortion by a taxi driver. Given that XXXX had no political involvement herself since 2014, XXXX appeared to have no nexus to any Convention ground. That was simply not plausible given the limited political involvement she had even to that point, which was limited only to attending demonstrations. There was no realistic or plausible evidence that she was targeted by Venezuelan authorities for this involvement.\n[12] The Panel was also concerned about her narrative of extortion by a taxi driver that \u2014 last contact that XXXX had with the taxi driver was in XXXX 2018 and XXXX did not leave Venezuela until XXXX 2019. Clearly there was no threat to XXXX from the taxi driver and accordingly she would not fit the definition of a person in need of protection, let alone a Convention refugee.\n[13] However, the Panel has since received credible evidence that XXXX has been identified as a person of interest on the Tasc\u00f3n List. This is a list containing the names of persons known to be opponents of Hugo Chavez and his successor, Nicolas Madura, and who have voted against him. XXXX gave credible evidence as to how she found out about this list and the fact that she was on the list. Essentially, she found out about that through her legal counsel, who is now representing her at this hearing.\n[14] Counsel has previously represented clients who have had access to that list and an affidavit was provided by Counsel\u2019s assistance.\n[15] XXXX has also provided disclosure of the notice of investigation she received dated XXXX XXXX XXXX 2020. The Panel had no reason to question the authenticity of this document or of the authenticity of the evidence surrounding the Tasc\u00f3n List, especially coming from Counsel, who is an officer of the court.\n[16] Accordingly, despite concerns with other elements of XXXX claim, the Panel is prepared to give her the benefit of the doubt based on the strength of the Tasc\u00f3n List evidence, the notice of investigation, and also based on the strength of her son\u2019s profile and evidence.\n[17] Given the strength of the XXXX claim and evidence, it is not implausible that Venezuelan authorities have also targeted XXXX as a means of getting to XXXX.\n[18] In respect to XXXX claim, the Panel had no significant concerns. XXXX spoke about his political involvement and background. He spoke about his attendance at protests and his clashes with police and about his reluctance to seek their help when he was robbed.\n[19] The Panel had no reason to question any of XXXX testimony. He was straightforward and direct, he elaborated his allegations spontaneously and with a level of detail that one would expect of a person who had actually lived through the experiences that he described. There were no inconsistencies and there did not appear to be any attempt to embellish his evidence. Where the Panel did have concerns, they either had reasonable explanation or otherwise they were minor in nature and did not affect the outcome of this claim.\n[20] The Panel found XXXX testimony was compelling. XXXX evidence was supported by the notices that he was under investigation, several letters of support, and extensive copies of his Facebook postings, which provided excellent detail about his political involvement. The Panel found this documentation was compelling and there was no reason to question any of its authenticity.\n[21] Can everyone still hear me?\n[22] CLAIMANT: Yes.\n[23] MEMBER: Okay.\n[24] CLAIMANT: Yes.\n[25] MEMBER: Where the Panel did have concerns, again, they were either reasonably explained or minor in nature and did not undermine the evidence in support of this claim.\n[26] The National Documentation Package for Venezuela supports these allegations. The Panel has access to credible and reliable sources, such as the United States Department of State report and the CIA Factbook. These documents make clear that the government of Venezuela is conducting a brutal campaign of oppression against political dissent of any kind. Over 2,000,000 Venezuelans have fled the country as refugees, and a large majority of these refugees have come from the upper and the middle classes. These claimants clearly fit that profile.\n[27] Sorry, Counsel, we lost you for a moment.\n[28] COUNSEL: Yeah, my apologies. Internet \u2014 I have mentioned this to the screen, I am hot spotting [inaudible] so we are fine, thank you.\n[29] MEMBER: Did you miss anything that I should go over?\n[30] COUNSEL: No, I am good. Thank you.\n[31] MEMBER: These claimants certainly fit that profile given their employment and education history, given the political and economic profile of the claimants. The Panel finds that they are indeed at significantly high risk if they were to return to Venezuela.\n[32] [inaudible] the state is the agent of persecution, the claimants have rebutted the presumption that state protection would be adequate and forthcoming to them. Likewise, there is no location in Venezuela they could go where they would not face a serious possibility of persecution. They have no viable internal flight alternative.\n[33] The claimants are presumed to be truthful unless there is a reason to believe that they have not been credible. I did have some concern, especially with XXXX claim. The adverse evidence in this case is not sufficed to undermine the credibility of the claim as a whole.\n[34] Okay, Mister Interpreter, you can start again.\n[35] INTERPRETER: Yes.\n[36] MEMBER: For all of these reasons, the Panel finds that this claim is credible. The claimants\u2019 fear is well-founded. The claimants face a serious possibility of persecution in Venezuela on account of their political opinion. The claimants are Convention refugees, and this claim is accepted.\n[37] Thank you both very much for being here and for speaking with me, and I have no doubt that the past year has been very stressful for you, waiting to get back to this hearing.\n[38] So, I thank you very much for your patience and for coming back to speak with me again.\n[39] And Counsel, for your assistance, thank you very much as well.\n[40] COUNSEL: Thank you.\n[41] MEMBER: Mister Interpreter, thank you as well.\n[42] INTERPRETER: You are welcome.\n[43] CLAIMANT: We are very grateful to you and really appreciate your contribution that you have made to our security and our protection. Thank you.\n[44] MEMBER: Thank you very much.\n[45] INTERPRETER: Thank you.\n[46] MEMBER: Everyone have a wonderful day.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014-REASONS CONCLUDED\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

Loebach\nCountry: Colombia\nRPD Number: TB9-22083\nAssociated RPD Number(s):\nATIP Number: A-2022-00665\nATIP Pages: 000155-000157\nDECISION\nMEMBER:\n[1] I\u2019ve reviewed the documents in this claim and asked the claimant some questions. I\u2019m prepared to give my decision now.\n[2] The claimant, XXXX XXXX XXXX is making a claim against Colombia, seeking refugee protection pursuant to section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[3] I find you are a convention refugee for the following reasons.\n[4] The allegations are set out in the claimant\u2019s basis of claim form. They\u2019re quite detailed and consistent throughout the narrative. They do not raise any credibility concerns that need to be addressed on what I considered to be the key issue here.\n[5] The allegations, as I see it, are on two parts. The first part is regarding gender identity. The second is regarding possible criminal targeting.\n[6] Based on the documents I\u2019ve been supplied in, in support of the claim, I accept as credible the allegations regarding gender identity. This is, this is the (indiscernible) of the claim, this is sufficient for me to make a positive decision on.\n[7] So, I\u2019ve not addressed the possible criminal targeting by paramilitaries because it is not necessary, and I, I make no finding on that aspect of the claim. As I said, it\u2019s not necessary for me to, to.\n[8] The claimant\u2019 s described his understanding of his, of his gender identity experiences. He lived as a result of that identity, and these are consistent with \u2014 as I said, internally consistent and consistent with country condition documents on Colombia. I have no reason to, to \u2014 I have no credibility concerns about, about those allegations.\n[9] The claimant submitted a passport. The passport is in the \u2014 includes the claimant\u2019s (indiscernible) a former middle name. But I, I acknowledge that it is a passport issued to the claimant, and therefore it is sufficient to establish his identity and his, his Colombian nationality.\n[10] With regard to level of risk, this is covered in part by the claimant\u2019s own evidence and by the, the country documents. I\u2019m just going to refer briefly to a couple of documents that were submitted by counsel.\n[11] The first was an article contained in the 2019 package. It has one statement in particular that, that I find summarizes what, what I understand to be the situation in Colombia for the claimant and others generally situated. And it\u2019s page 54, 55 of the country \u2014 first country condition document that speaks about the paradox between laws and practice.\n[12] The, the quote is that there is a strong \u2014 I\u2019m going to be paraphrasing a little bit \u2014 there\u2019s a strong legal framework, but in practice, practice it is rarely enforced. And that is my understanding from reviewing the country documents generally on, on this, this issue.\n[13] Other documents were included with the next country condition \u2014 the next package, which included country condition documents. These were all consistent and they point to, I think, persuasive evidence that you would be facing more than a mere possibility\u2013 a reasonable chance \u2014 there\u2019s difference ways it\u2019s phrased in the, in the, the, the jurisprudence. You would face a reasonable chance of persecution due to your gender identity.\n[14] Since gender identity is concluded in the Canadian law as coming within the parameters of the convention refugee decision \u2014 the \u2014 convention refugee definition as being a member of a particular social group.\n[15] The country documents also point to two other issues I have to address. And the first is state protection. Again, both your evidence, your statements and your narrative speak of your experiences trying to access state protection in Colombia, and the documents are consistent with that.\n[16] And, and, and I point out that your experience is part of a, a broader, a broader issue in the country. What you experienced is consistent with what happens in Colombia far too regularly, such that I would have to say that for you, there is not on, on a balance of probabilities state protection in Colombia at this time.\n[17] The laws that have been passed may eventually result in practices which could in the future mean that you would have state protection in Colombia, but I\u2019m assessing the claim as things are now. So, as things are now, I do not find that you would have, have state protection in Colombia; would be afforded state protection in Colombia.\n[18] With regard to internal flight alternative, the problem for \u2014 that goes to, to a lack of state protection is cultural attitudes. And I, I do not see any evidence before me that there are places in Colombia you would live where the cultural attitudes would be different from what you\u2019ve experienced or what the documents speak of. So, therefore I do not find that there is a reasonable internal flight alternative available to you in Colombia.\n[19] So, based on the reasons just given and on review of the evidence, I find you\u2019re a convention refugee and I accept your claim.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

For making this decision and in formulating questions for the hearing, I considered Chairperson\u2019s guideline 9 with regards to proceedings before the IRB involving claims of sexual orientation and gender identity and expression.\n[4] I find that are a Convention refugee for the following reasons;\n[5] You allege the following;\n[6] That you are citizen of Brazil, and that if you were to return, you will \u2013 you will face persecution because you are a member of a particular social group, as a transgender person.\n[7] You allege that there is no state protection for you or an internal flight alternative.\n[8] Your personal identity as citizen of Brazil has been established by your oral testimony, a copy of your passport, and your birth certificate, which can be found at Exhibit 1.\n[9] I find that on a balance of probabilities that identity and the country of reference have been established.\n[10] I find that there is a link between what you fear and one of the five Convention ground, which is your membership in a particular social group as a transgender person. Therefore, I assessed your claim under section 96.\n[11] In terms of your general credibility, I found you to be a credible witness and I therefore believe what you have alleged in your oral testimony and in your Basis of Claim Form. Your testimony was straightforward and was in keeping with your Basis of Claim Form. There were no significant inconsistencies or omissions that went to the heart of the claim. I therefore find the following to be credible;\n[12] That you are a transgender person who faces persecution in Brazil because of your gender identity.\n[13] Your oral testimony today included details regarding your process in coming to a realization about your gender identity as well as a medical process, and the process of the name change. You\u2019ve described the hormonal therapy you had been receiving in Brazil and in Canada. You testified regarding the different NGOs you\u2019ve worked with since you came to Canada, (inaudible) served the members of the LGBTQ+ communities. You\u2019ve also testified about why you had to go back to Brazil in 2017 as you had to go through (inaudible) legal procedure of having your name changed. And I did not draw negative credibility inference on your (inaudible) based on your explanation.\n[14] You\u2019ve also testified regarding the difficulties and hardship you face in Brazil because of your gender identity.\n[15] You\u2019ve also provided documents in support of your claim, which can be found at Exhibit 4. These include a letter and a medical document from CAMH certification of the completion of high school, (inaudible) certification and photographs of you throughout your transitioning period. There are also documents from hospital in Brazil regarding your transition as well as a XXXX report.\n[16] There are also documents regarding your legal process to change your name and gender in Brazil. You\u2019ve also submitted letters from different NGOs in Canada, including 519, Friends of Ruby, and the Cyborg Circus Projects.\n[17] Your testimony and the supporting documentation all establish, on a balance of probabilities that you are a transgender person.\n[18] The country condition documents in the National Documentation Package for Brazil, which can be found at Exhibit 3, and the documents that counsel submitted on your behalf, which can be found at Exhibit 5, are consistent with your allegation that there is a serious possibility that you will face persecution as a transgender person in Brazil.\n[19] US Department of State\u2019s Report, found at Exhibit 3, Item 2.1, notes that that violence against LGBTQI2S individuals as a serious concern, and that the Federal Public Ministry, who\u2019s responsible for registering reports of crimes committed on the basis of gender or sexual orientation has been slow to respond. As of May15th there were over hundred killings of LGBTQI2S individuals in the year and that transgender individuals are particularly at risk of harm, according to the reports.\n[20] 2019 report by International Lesbian, Gay, bisexual, Trans, and Intersex Association, Item 6.4 states that quote, homophobia, sexism and racism operate as a means to produce lethal violence and systemic violations of the human rights of LGBTI persons in Brazil, end quotes. Page 106. It further notes President Bolsonaro stands against LGBTQ+ community through his appointment of pastor known for her support of so-called conversion therapy as the head of public policies for human rights for men and family.\n[21] The report by Human Rights Watch, Item 2.3 also addresses the homophobic statements and restriction of the rights of LGBTQ+ people facing the (inaudible) President Bolsonaro.\n[22] Country condition documents submitted by counsel, Exhibit 5, also describes the level of risk and discrimination that transgender individuals face in Brazil.\n[23] Having considered this objective evidence together with your consistent and credible testimony, I find on a balance of probabilities that you have a well-founded fear of persecution in Brazil.\n[24] I find that adequate state protection would not be available to you if you were to seek it in Brazil as the state is the agent of persecution in this case. Therefore, I find on a balance of probabilities, that you have rebutted the presumption of state protection because state protection will not be available to you as the state will be unwilling to protect you in Brazil.\n[25] As you have rebutted the presumption of state protection, and since the country documentation indicates that situation for individuals in circumstances such as yours is the same throughout the country, I find on a balance of probabilities that you do not have a viable internal flight alternative.\n[26] In conclusion, after assessing all of the evidence, I find that you have established that there is a serious possibility of persecution on the Convention ground because of your membership in a particular social group as a transgender person I therefore find that you are Convention refugee and I accept your claim.\n[27] Okay, thank you, that concludes the hearing.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

Smith\nCountry: Mexico\nRPD Number: TB9-32419\nAssociated RPD Number(s):\nATIP Number: A-2022-00665\nATIP Pages: 000141-000150\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (the claimant), a citizen of Mexico, seeks refugee protection, under sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).1\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] The claimant\u2019s allegations are set out fully in her Basis of Claim (BOC) forms.2 The claimant fears persecution from her family and society generally because of her gender identity. She fears that, if forced to return to the transphobic environment in Mexico, she will be subjected to persecution based on her gender identity from members of Mexican society, including certain members of her family, prospective employers and the authorities. The claimant alleges that she has been verbally, emotionally, psychologically and physically abused by members of her family and others, during her adolescence and adulthood, in Mexico. The claimant also alleges that she suffered discrimination and violence due to her gender identity.\nDETERMINATION\n[3] The panel finds that the claimant would face a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground upon return to Mexico. She is a Convention refugee and the claim is accepted.\nISSUES\nNexus\n[4] The claimant alleges that the persecution she faces is due to her membership in a particular social group in Mexico, namely trans women. The panel accepts that gender identity is a particular social group and has, therefore, assessed this claim against section 96 of the IRPA.\nIdentity\n[5] The claimant\u2019s identity as a citizen of Mexico is established, on a balance of probabilities, as per her passport.3\nCredible Subjective Fear\n[6] In considering credibility, the panel is aware of the difficulties that may be faced by the claimant, a 45 year old trans woman, in establishing a claim, namely, the setting of the hearing room and the stress inherent in responding to questions. The panel has also considered the contents of the medical report.4\n[7] Most importantly, the panel has considered and applied Guideline 9: Proceedings Before the IRB Involving Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression (SOGIE Guidelines)5 and in this regard it has carefully examined the claimant\u2019s oral testimony in line with the factors to be considered when applying this Guideline.\n[8] The claimant was not reluctant to discuss her gender identity. She was born a male but she has openly identified as a trans female for many years, since at least when she was a teenager. She testified about her fears, including having to hide her gender identity, based on her past experiences in Mexico, if she must return to Mexico. The claimant testified that when she lived in Mexico, including in Mexico City, she had to bide her identity as a trans woman. Members of her family and other members of the community have made transphobic comments about her gender identity.\n[9] The claimant had great difficulty testifying about being abducted and sent to a \u201cconversion therapy\u201d clinic by her family to change her gender identity. In this regard, the panel was cognizant of the claimant\u2019s XXXX health issues, adding to the marginalization factor. The claimant was deemed to be a vulnerable person based on medical evidence and the panel made accommodations. Guideline 8 \u2013 Concerning Procedures with Respect to Vulnerable Persons Appearing Before the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada6 was considered and applied. She testified about her fears about being misgendered. violence and being killed because of her gender identity. She fears for her safety living as a trans woman anywhere in Mexico.\n[10] The claimant\u2019s history of social isolation, mistreatment and lack of social support and mental disabilities were considered in terms of the way she testified. The report by the XXXX resident submitted was considered; in particular the diagnosis of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (in remission) and XXXX XXXX XXXX (in remission); and the significant impact of the claimant\u2019s experience of emotional and physical violence as a result of her gender identity.7 The report states, \u201cOn assessment, she reports a significant trauma history, involving a forced institutionalization while living in Acapulco, Mexico several years ago, which has resulted in symptoms of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, including reexperiencing, XXXX XXXX XXXX and negative XXXX in XXXX XXXX and XXXX.\n[11] Given that the claimant was straightforward and gave many details in other areas of her testimony, the panel accepts that she experienced a traumatic experience, involving some kind of conversion therapy that had a link to her gender identity. For example, she testified about them cutting her hair.\n[12] The claimant gave evidence as to why she had re-availed herself of Mexico after years in the U.S., why she did not make an asylum claim in the U.S. and why she took so long to make a refugee claim in Canada. The panel accepts this as not being determinative of the claim,8 given her residual profile, a trans woman, for which there is a serious possibility of forward-looking persecution in Mexico, based on the National Documentation Package for Mexico9 and the claimant\u2019s documentary disclosure.10\n[13] Although credibility, persecution versus discrimination and whether she has a subjective fear of return to Mexico (delay and re-availment) were identified at the hearing along with other issues, in keeping with the SOGIE Guidelines, the panel does not find that these issues detract from the claimant\u2019s credibility. In totality, the panel was satisfied that the claimant\u2019s testimony was credible and that she has identified as a female for years. The panel accepts that the claimant is a transgender woman and that she has a subjective fear of persecution in Mexico.\n[14] Moreover, the claimant\u2019s testimony was corroborated by copious amounts of corroborative documentary evidence,11 including medical reports from XXXX 2020, letter of support from the Hola Group dated XXXX XXXX XXXX 2020, letter of support from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Neighbourhood Centre, letter of support from XXXX XXXX XXXX, The 519 (dated XXXX XXXX XXXX 2020), letter of support from XXXX XXXX, The 519 (dated XXXX XXXX XXXX 2021), several other support letters from her friends, emails related to her asylum application in the U.S., an email from the claimant to Adam House requesting assistance in refugee and legal aid process dated XXXX XXXX XXXX 2019, other emails relating to making her claim in Canada, photographs, and media articles confirming the situation for LGBTQ communities in Mexico and in illegal rehab centres in Mexico. Thus, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant has subjective fear.\nObjective Basis\n[15] Transgender women in Mexico still face pervasive persecution based on their identity gender identity and expression. Documentation notes the following:\nIndeed, violence against LGBT people has actually increased, with transgender women bearing the brunt of this escalation. Changes in the laws have made the LGBT communities more visible to the public and more vulnerable to homophobic and transphobic violence. Increased visibility has actually increased public misperceptions and false stereotypes about the gay and transgender communities. This has produced fears about these communities, such as that being gay or transgender is \u201ccontagious\u201d or that all transgender individuals are HIV positive. These fears have in turn led to hate crimes and murders of LGBT people, particularly women.\n[\u2026]\nTransgender women continue to face beatings, rape, police harassment, torture and murder in Mexico.12\n[16] It is reasonable to conclude from a review of the country conditions that while there has been some improvement in terms of attitudes towards LGBTQ issues, many challenges remain, particularly for persons with the claimant\u2019s profile.\n[17] While unprecedented political and legal gains have been made in Mexico, the religious, cultural and social environment in most of Mexico remains repressive, and often dangerous.13 Machista ideals of manly appearance and behavior contribute to extreme prejudices against sexual minorities, and violence against them.\n[18] Moreover, as the claimant testified, she is fearful of the police. This is also supported in the documentary evidence. In this regard, the panel has considered the personal circumstances of this claimant which includes her age and health status, along with her history which is well\u00ad documented. The panel further accepts that in the claimant\u2019s circumstances, it may be unreasonable for her to approach the state for protection, keeping in mind that the state protection must be adequate at the operational level.\n[19] Furthermore, issues such as employment, secure housing, access to medical treatment as well as treatment related to the transition process must be considered, along with mental health issues and equal access to social services:\nVulnerable communities, including transgender women, are often victims of drug cartel and gang violence. Transgender women fall victim to cartel kidnappings, extortions, and human trafficking. One transgender woman described how cartel members forced her into sex work in Merida. Another transgender woman was targeted for rape and robbery while traveling by bus. In another case, a transgender woman named Joahana in Cancun was tortured to death by drug traffickers who carved a letter \u201cZ\u201d for the Zeta cartel into her body. If a cartel targets a transgender woman, it is nearly impossible to escape the cartel\u2019s power. An immigration attorney in the U.S. described in an interview how his transgender female client unknowingly dated a cartel member. After doing so, she could not escape persecution from the cartel.14\n[20] A recent Response to Information Request further notes from various sources that despite the president creating the National Guard, which began its activities to fight organized crime on June 30, 2019, \u201cat the expense of the local police forces that are experiencing precarious conditions\u201d, \u201cthe organization has failed to address criminality in a measurable way\u201d and \u201cviolence has not decreased in the three states with the greatest National Guard contingent.\u201d15\n[21] The documentation indicates that antidiscrimination laws do not prohibit discrimination on the basis of gender identity. The lack of protection leaves transgender women especially vulnerable to employment discrimination.16 Transgender women in Mexico often lack access to gender health care and are generally denied the ability to change their name and\/or gender on identity documents to match their gender presentation. It is indicated:\nIt should be noted that transgender people cannot simply \u201chide\u201d who they are and thereby escape persecution by living in accordance with their birth-assigned gender role. Gender dysphoria is a serious condition. recognized by every major medical association, the only trea1rnen1 for which is to live in accordance with the gender with which they identify, rather than the gender assigned at birth. Attempting to suppress one\u2019s gender identity can have dire health consequences. Moreover, a person\u2019s gender identity is a fundamental component of identity. which cannot be required io be changed or hidden as a condition of protection under asylum. laws.\nAs noted, only Mexico City permits transgender people to legally change their name and gender to correspond to their gender identity. Even where such mechanisms are technically available, however, legal name changes are not accessible in practice for many transgender women. This is in part due to \u201clengthy delays and high costs-at least six months and approximately 70,000 pesos\u2026 are required, and completion sometimes depend[s] on the \u2018good will\u2019 of some civil servants.\u201d\u2026\n[\u2026]\nTransgender women lack adequate health care in Mexico. Many transgender women resist seeking medical help because they must disclose their transgender status and subsequently face hostility and threats of violence from medical providers. Medical care providers often do not want to provide medical attention to transgender patients. Providers have mocked and humiliated transgender patients using offensive language, threats, aggression, and hostility. Consequently, transgender women do not routinely access preventive or emergency care.\nIn particular, medical care to support gender transition-such as hormones or surgeries\u00ad is almost entirely unavailable to most transgender women in Mexico. While medical authorities uniformly recognize the medical necessity of transition related treatment, such care is not covered under Mexico\u2019s national health plan and licensed providers (for those who can afford to pay out of pocket) are scarce.211 Even where it is available, such care can be prohibitively expensive for transgender women already suffering the effects of economic marginalization discussed earlier.212 Without access to gender-affirming medical care, many transgender women permanently damage their skin and muscles by injecting dangerous black-market feminizing liquid silicone or other fillers.17\n[22] Further documentation notes:\nThe May 2016 report of the Cornell Law School LGBT Clinic and the Transgender Law Center also specifies that there are \u201cno federal laws that explicitly protect transgender individuals from discrimination on the basis of their gender identity (i.e., their transgender status) as opposed to sexual orientation\u201d\u2026\n[\u2026]\nIn a short overview of, among others, hate crime legislation in different countries, the same report indicates, however, that in Mexico there is no such legislation. The report, in contradiction to the above cited explanation, states that the federal law neither criminalises hate speech nor hate crimes. The report in this context mentions article 149 Ter of the Federal Criminal Code of Mexico which refers to discrimination\u2026\n[\u2026]\nIn its query response about the situation and treatment of sexual minorities, particularly in Mexico City, Cancun, Guadalajara, and Acapulco of August 2015, the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (IRB) writes:\nA report on crimes against transgendered women sent to the Research Directorate by a representative at the Support Centre for Transgender Identities\u2026, an NGO that advocates for the rights of transgendered women in Mexico \u2026, indicates that transgendered women are discriminated against by the police and judicial authorities \u2026 The representative from Colectivo Le\u00f3n Gay, A.C. indicated that LGBT persons are [translation] \u2018frequently\u2019 harassed and arbitrarily detained due to their physical appearance, the way they dress, or for expressing affection in public\u2026 The representative also indicated that they are barred from assembling in public because they are seen as \u2018engaging in prostitution or giving a \u2018bad example\u2019 or \u2018bad image\u2019 to society \u2026 18 [footnotes omitted]\n[23] Thus, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that there is an objective basis for the claimant\u2019s subjective fear.\nNo State Protection\n[24] In light of the above documentary evidence regarding similarly situated persons in Mexico who did not receive adequate state protection, there is sufficient evidence before the panel to conclude that, despite efforts made by the state, at this time, the state is not able to offer adequate protection19 to trans women, like the claimant.\n[25] Therefore, the panel finds that there exists clear, convincing and cogent proof that state protection is not available to trans women, like the claimant, in Mexico. The panel, therefore, finds that the claimant has rebutted the presumption of state protection and has established that her fear is objectively well-founded since the harm she fears cumulatively amounts to persecution.\nInternal Flight Alternative (IFA)\n[26] With respect to an IFA, it is clear from the documentary evidence that societal prejudices against transgender persons are found all over Mexico, including Mexico City. Documentation reports as follows:\nPolice harassment against the LGBT community remains high in Mexico City as well. Despite the reputation of the Zona Rosa district of Mexico City as an LGBT neighborhood, extortion and harassment particularly of transgender women continues there. As described above, Mexico City also has the highest rate of transphobic murders in the country. Moving to Mexico City will therefore not protect transgender women from persecution: they will remain vulnerable no matter where they reside in Mexico.20 [footnotes omitted]\n[27] There is blatant disregard for the safety and wellbeing of trans women, like the claimant. Homicides and assaults against these groups continue under a backdrop of religious and cultural tolerance and moral condemnation. Having to hide her gender identity amounts to a serious interference with a basic human right, constituting persecution.21 Based on the evidence adduced, the panel finds that there is no viable IFA for trans women in Mexico City or throughout Mexico.\n[28] Based on the totality of the evidence adduced, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that there is a serious possibility, based on her evidence, that she would be persecuted due to her gender identity as a trans woman should she return to Mexico.\nCONCLUSION\n[29] Accordingly, the panel accepts the claimant as a Convention refugee.

These are the reasons for the decision in the claim of XXXX XXXX XXXX who claims to be a citizen of Barbados and is claiming refugee protection pursuant to s. 97 and s. 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. In rendering my reasons, I have considered the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9: Proceedings Before the IRB Involving Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression.\n[2] Your allegations are fully set out in your Basis of Claim. In summary, you fear persecution at the hands of society as a transgender woman. I find that you are a refugee pursuant to s. 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act as there exists a serious possibility of persecution should you return to Barbados due to your membership in a particular social group, namely transgender women. I find that your identity as a national of Barbados is established by submission of your passport.\n[3] I find you to be a credible witness and therefore believe what you alleged in support of your claim. You testified in a straightforward manner and there were no relevant inconsistencies in your testimony or contradictions between your testimony and the other evidence before me. In particular, the following evidence establishes your allegations as set out above: psychological, medical and social work reports substantiating that you identify as a transgender woman and are undergoing hormone therapy, multiple letters of support from friends in Canada and the Caribbean substantiating your sexual identity and the issues you have faces as a result, photos of you and social media screenshots related to your social interactions. After reviewing the documents, I have no reason to doubt their authenticity.\n[4] Given that there are no serious credibility issues, with respect to your allegations, coupled with the documentary evidence set out below, I find that you have established a perspective risk of harm in Barbados. The risk is corroborated by the following documents: at Tabs 6.1 to 6. 3 the evidence indicates the discrimination against LGBT individuals was one of the most serious human rights problems in Barbados, with LGBT persons facing discrimination in employment, housing, and access to education and healthcare.\n[5] At Tabs 6.4, the documents indicate that homosexual acts are illegal in Barbados with a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. Although the laws are generally not enforced, the discriminatory legislation negatively impacts the LGBT population, giving social and legal sanction for discrimination, violence, stigma and prejudice against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals.\n[6] Your evidence indicates that your style of dress and demeanour were inconsistent with societal expectations. At Tabs 6.1, the documents indicate that those who do not fit the gender norm are tremendously at risk in Barbados and have been subjected to physical and sexual violence. 6.4 further indicates that trans women are particularly vulnerable to attacks by their partners as well as strangers and for transgender people, social rejection intensifies as they attempt to express their gender identity. Stigma and discrimination is often manifested in the form of property damage, ostracism and verbal abuse from strangers and family alike, unjustified denial of employment, denial of housing, rejection and abandonment by family, friends and society at large. The objective evidence is consistent with your allegations and I find that the harassment, discrimination and violence you have and would face in Barbados amounts to persecution. Further, the evidence supports a conclusion that you cannot live openly and freely as a transgender woman in Barbados.\n[7] I have examined your claim under s. 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act as I conclude that the risk you describe constitutes persecution based on at least one of the grounds prescribed in s. 96, specifically your membership in a particular social group. I find that there is clear and convincing evidence before me that this state is unwilling to provide you with adequate protection, the objective evidence indicates that there are no legal protections for those who face discrimination as a result of their sexual orientation, and the police in Barbados have been denounced as discriminatory in their treatment of victims who are LGBT.\n[8] I have also examined whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for you based on the evidence on file. I find that you would face a serious possibility of persecution throughout Barbados. The country is small, and the documentary evidence indicates that authorities operate similar throughout the country and societal attitudes are also similar throughout the country. In light of the preceding, I conclude that you are a refugee pursuant to s. 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act and accordingly, I accept your claim.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014-REASONS CONCLUDED\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

Mary Akhbari\nCountry: Barbados\nRPD Number: TC0-11108\nAssociated RPD Number(s):\nATIP Number: A-2022-00665\nATIP Pages: 000131-000137\nREASONS FOR DECISION\nINTRODUCTION\n[1] These are the reasons for the decision in the claim of XXXX XXXX XXXX, aka XXXX XXXX XXXX, who claims to be a citizen of Barbados, and is claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[2] This claim has been decided without a hearing, according to the Immigration and Refugee Board\u2019s Chairperson\u2019s Instructions Governing the Streaming of Less Complex Claims at the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) and paragraph 170(f) of the Act.\n[3] The panel has considered and applied the Immigration and Refugee Board\u2019s Chairperson\u2019s Guidelines 9: Proceedings Before the IRB Involving Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression.\nALLEGATIONS\n[4] The claimant\u2019s allegations are found in her Basis of Claim form and narrative1 and amendments.2\n[5] In summary, the claimant alleges she faces persecution in Barbados at the hands of the homophobic and anti-LGBTQ community for identity as a transgender woman and sexual orientation as lesbian.\nDecision\n[6] The panel finds that the claimant is a refugee, pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA, as there exists a serious possibility of persecution, should she return to Barbados, on account of her membership in a particular social group, specifically as a person that identifies as transgender and lesbian. The reasons are as follows.\nIdentity\n[7] The panel finds that the identity of the claimant as a national of Barbados is established by the documents provided, primarily the certified copy of the passport.3\n[8] The panel notes the claimant has indicated a preference for she\/her pronouns and the name of XXXX XXXX XXXX. As the claimant\u2019s identification documents still reflect the legal name of XXXX XXXX XXXX, that name has also been included in this decision, however her preferred name and pronouns will be used henceforth.\nCredibility\n[9] Based on the documents in the file, the panel has noted no serious credibility issues. After reviewing the documents provided, the panel has no reason to doubt their authenticity.\n[10] To establish the claimant\u2019s identity as a transgender female, she has provided excerpts from her blog indicating her transgender identity and some of her experiences in Barbados as a result;4 excerpts from her Facebook page showing her name as \u201cXXXX XXXX\u201d and referring to herself as trans;5 an email confirming the claimant\u2019s acceptance in XXXX XXXX XXXX;6 a published article interviewing the claimant and her art;7 medical documents confirming hormone treatments the claimant is prescribed;8 letters of support from friends and family referring to the claimant in her preferred name and pronouns, and corroborating their knowledge of allegations;9 and a letter of support from the organization XXXX XXXX, which confirms her status as a client of the organization and her gender identity.10\n[11] To establish her sexual orientation, the claimant as provided a letter of support from her current partner, as well as photographs of the claimant and her current partner together;11 social media posts, photographs, and a conversation on a dating application showing the claimant\u2019s relationship with a previous partner.12\n[12] The panel therefore finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant identifies as a person that is transgender and a lesbian.\n[13] The panel finds the claimant\u2019s subjective fear has been established.\nObjective basis\n[14] Given that there are no serious credibility issues with respect to allegations of the claimant, coupled with the documentary evidence set out below, the panel finds that the claimant has established a prospective risk and well-founded fear of persecution in Barbados.\n[15] This risk is corroborated by the National Documentation Package (NDP) for Barbados -April 23, 2021 version.13\n[16] The objective evidence reports that the criminalization of consensual same-sex activity is a significant human rights issue facing Barbados. The penalty for this, although rarely enforced, includes life imprisonment.14 The presence of this law encourages anti-LGBTQ sentiments amongst the general population.15\n[17] Where the overall homophobic and anti-LGBTQ community is concerned, recent surveys have shown that approximately half of all Barbadians supported the enforcement of current laws banning same-sex activity.16\n[18] It is reported that LGBTI persons face ongoing discrimination in employment, housing, access to education and healthcare.17 The stigma and discrimination is commonly manifested in the form of property damage, ostracism, and verbal abuse from strangers, friends, family, and society at large.18 Activists have indicated that police disapproval and societal discrimination has made LGBTI persons more vulnerable to threats, crime, and destruction of property.19\n[19] Societal discrimination in Barbados is further exacerbated by public figures and church leaders condemning sexual minorities and labelling the \u201cgay agenda\u201d a threat to human existence.20 Popular media outlets have trivialized physical and sexual violence against the LGBTQ community and emphasize the lack of value placed on LGBTQ lives in Barbados.\n[20] It is additionally reported that LGBTI persons in Barbados face immense pressure to simply conform to traditional gender norms in order to appease society. Those that do not conform face a risk of physical and sexual violence, with transgender women being among the most at risk.21\n[21] The panel therefore finds the objective basis for this claim has been established.\nNature of the harm\n[22] The panel has examined this claim under section 96 of the IRPA, as it concludes that the risk the claimant faces constitutes persecution based on at least one of the grounds prescribed in the Refugee Convention, specifically her membership in a particular social group, as a transgender woman and lesbian.\n[23] The panel finds the claimant faces risk in the form of harassment, discrimination, threat of physical and psychological harm, and an inability to live openly as either a transgender female or lesbian.\nState Protection\n[24] The panel finds that there is clear and convincing evidence that the state is unable or unwilling to provide the claimant with adequate protection.\n[25] As outlined above, the laws banning consensual same-sex acts in Barbados carry heavy sentences, and there are limited legal protections for those facing discrimination as a result of sexual orientation or gender identity. The potential for arrest and prosecution under these laws is reported to be among the most serious issues facing the LGBTI community in Barbados.22\n[26] It is further reported in objective country documentation that police can be \u201cvery dismissive\u201d of LGBTQ persons and of transwomen.23 Additionally, most members of the LGBTQ community do not report matters to police out of fear of further negative repercussions and ridicule. Reports state that police in Barbados have been denounced as discriminatory in their treatment of LGBT victims, and that individuals attempting to make reports have faced condemnation by police officers. Justice is very rarely served for LGBT cases and many charges are dropped after years of waiting, incomplete investigations and police complacency.24 Alternate sources also confirm police disapproval of the LGBTQ community contributes to the vulnerability of its members.25\n[27] The panel therefore finds the presumption of state protection in this case has been rebutted.\nInternal flight alternative\n[28] The panel has examined whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for the claimant. Based on the evidence on file, the panel finds that the claimant faces a serious possibility of persecution throughout Barbados. As the legal framework and anti-LGBTQ atmosphere is consistent throughout Barbados, there is no part of the country where the claimant would be able to live freely as a sexual minority and with her transgender identity.\nConclusion\n[29] In light of the preceding, the panel concludes that the claimant is a Convention refugee, pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA and accepts this claim.\n(signed) Miranda Robinson\nJune 10, 2021\n1 Exhibit 2, Basis of Claim (BOC) form, 08 April 2020\n2 Exhibit 6, BOC Amendment, 27 April 2021\n3 Exhibit 1, Claim Referral Package from IRCC\/CBSA\n4 Exhibit 5, Personal Disclosure, 27 April 2021\n5 Ibid., Exhibit 5\n6 Ibid., Exhibit 5\n7 Ibid., Exhibit 5\n8 Ibid., Exhibit 5\n9 Ibid., Exhibit 5\n10 Exhibit 7, Personal Disclosure, 03 May 2021\n11 Ibid., Exhibit 5\n12 Ibid., Exhibit 5\n13 Exhibit 3, National Documentation Package (NDP) for Barbados, 23 April 2021\n14 Exhibit 3, National Documentation Package (NDP) for Barbados, 23 April 2021, item 2.1\n15 Exhibit 3, National Documentation Package (NDP) for Barbados, 23 April 2021, item 6.1\n16 Ibid., Exhibit 3, item 6.1\n17 Ibid., Exhibit 3, item 2.1\n18 Ibid., Exhibit 3, item 6.1\n19 Ibid., Exhibit 3, item 2.1\n20 Exhibit 3, National Documentation Package (NDP) for Barbados, 23 April 2021, item 6.2\n21 Ibid., Exhibit 3, item 6.2\n22 Ibid..

It is 2:34, and we are back on the record.\n[2] CLAIMANT: Thank you, [inaudible].\n[3] MEMBER: Sir, I am now going to read my decision and the reasons for my decision. Are you ready?\n[4] CLAIMANT: Yes.\n[5] MEMBER: Okay.\n[6] CLAIMANT: Thank you.\n[7] MEMBER: These are the reasons for the decision under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act concerning XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.\n[8] XXXX XXXX XXXX, the claimant, seeks protection pursuant to s. 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. The claimant is a citizen of Jamaica.\n[9] The allegations of his claim can be found in his Basis of Claim form and in his testimony. The claimant alleges a fear of persecution on the basis of membership in a particular social group. In particular, the claimant alleges a fear of persecution on the basis of his gender identity. The claimant alleges that as a transgender man, should he return to Jamaica, he would be subject to discrimination, harassment, and an increased risk of violence at the hands of society in general.\n[10] At the outset of the hearing, I identified credibility as a primary matter for the hearing to focus on. In particular, an assessment of credibility was required to determine whether the claimant is, as he alleges, a transgender man, and whether he fears persecution as a result.\n[11] With respect to identity, on the file at Exhibit 1 are certified copies of the claimant\u2019s passports from Jamaica. Other identification documents can be found at Exhibit 1 and 4. Through these documents, and his testimony, the claimant has established his personal identity, and his citizenship of Jamaica.\n[12] With respect to credibility, the claimant testified at the hearing. The claimant testified under oath as presumed to be telling the truth, unless there are valid reasons to disbelieve the testimony. In this case, I find no valid reason to reject the claimant\u2019s testimony with regard to his gender identity and his fear of persecution in Jamaica. The claimant was straightforward and spontaneous in his testimony. His testimony contained no material inconsistencies or contradictions. The testimony was consistent with the narrative found in his Basis of Claim form and was supported by a considerable number of documents submitted at Exhibit 4. These documents included medical reports, letters of support from people who knew the claimant in Jamaica, press articles confirming that the claimant has been active in the LGBTQ community in Jamaica, and photographs of the claimant at LGBTQ events.\n[13] Overall, the claimant provided credible and trustworthy testimony. The claimant testified that he was assigned a gender of female at birth. He discovered his gender identity when he was very young. He faced harassment and abuse at school and at home because he was perceived as having masculine mannerisms and he was attracted to women. The claimant testified that he did have a number of relationships with women at high school and during university. On a number of occasions, he had been threatened with violence or sexual assault to cure him. At one point in university, he narrowly escaped assault from a group of teenage boys who had been following him and his date. The claimant testified that he was also subject to discrimination and harassment at his workplace.\n[14] The claimant testified that he began hormone replacement therapy as part of his transition in 2015. He informed his workplace, a technical company named XXXX (ph). Although his supervisor undertook to attempt to aid in the transition in the workplace, the claimant testified that he continued to face harassment and abuse from colleagues. The claimant included other instances of threats or harassment short of actual assault in his Basis of Claim narrative. He testified that he did not go to the police because the police were homophobic, and often allied with people who might attack him.\n[15] The claimant testified that after he left XXXX, he discovered that somebody from that company had outed him as transgender without his consent or knowledge. In the claimant\u2019s Basis of Claim narrative, he describes how this made it difficult for him to secure work.\n[16] The claimant testified that he felt he had to leave Jamaica by 2020. He testified that his XXXX health was suffering because of the stress of having to conceal his identity, as well as the fear of violence. The claimant testified that he was aware of other transgender people who had been assaulted.\n[17] In light of my findings with respect to the credibility of the claimant and the extensive supporting evidence, I find, on a balance of probabilities, the claimant is, as alleged, a transgender man. I further find that he has a fear of persecution on the basis of his gender identity in Jamaica.\n[18] Having found the claimant to have a subjective fear of persecution, I turn to the question of whether this fear has an objective basis. Country condition reports in the Immigration and Refugee Board\u2019s National Documentation Package for Jamaica, dated 16th of April, 2021, support the claimant\u2019s allegation that he is at heightened risk of violence, harassment, and discrimination in Jamaica because of his gender identity. Homophobia remains prevalent throughout Jamaican society, and transgender persons in particular are at high risk of harassment and violence.\n[19] I conclude that the claimant does have an objective basis for his fear of persecution. As such, the claimant has a well-founded fear of persecution.\n[20] The claimant testifies that he does not believe that the police would be able to help him escape a heightened risk of violence. Item 6.2, 6.5, and 6.7 of the National Documentation Package for Jamaica supports this allegation. Jamaica remains a deeply homophobic society, and transgender individuals face a higher risk of discrimination in the workplace, the provision of services, as well as harassment and an increased likelihood of ill-treatment and violence. While steps have been taken by the Jamaican government to address these issues in the hopes that the LGBTQ community will feel safer reporting violence or abuse to the police, in practice, these steps have not been successful. The police continue to often turn a blind eye towards persecution and may even be complicit to such persecution.\n[21] I conclude that there is compelling evidence that the state is unable or unwilling to protect the claimant against persecution. With respect to an internal flight alternative, given the pervasiveness of homophobia and anti-trans sentiments throughout Jamaica, I find there would be no reasonable internal flight alternative to the claimant in Jamaica.\n[22] My conclusion is this. Based on the evidence before me, and the testimony of the claimant, I conclude that the claimant has established a serious possibility of persecution on the Convention ground of membership in a particular social group if he were to return to Jamaica. The claimant is therefore a Convention refugee pursuant to s. 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. His claim for protection is accepted.\n[23] That concludes my reasons. Sir, do you have any questions?\n[24] CLAIMANT: No, sir. Just a point \u2014 I think, in delivering your decision, you said that I started hormone replacement therapy in XXXX XXXX 2015. I actually started in XXXX XXXX 2016.\n[25] MEMBER: Thank you. My apologies. I think I got that from the Basis of Claim form, so \u2014 all right. I appreciate you correcting me. Other than that, do you have any questions?\n[26] CLAIMANT: No, sir, just \u2014 thank you.\n[27] MEMBER: I would like to thank you for answering all my questions. I do appreciate that they were personal questions, and they may have brought back some difficult memories, so I would like to thank you for being honest and open with me today. I would like to thank your counsel, who provided an excellent evidentiary record that made it very easy for me to come to a positive decision.\n[28] COUNSEL: Thank you.\n[29] MEMBER: And, if there is nothing else, sir, I wish you all the success possible in your new home.\n[30] CLAIMANT: Thank you, sir.\n[31] COUNSEL: Thank you. Have a good week.\n[32] MEMBER: The hearing is concluded. Have a good day, everybody.\n[33] CLAIMANT: You too.\n[34] COUNSEL: [inaudible].\n\u2014\u2014\u2014-REASONS CONCLUDED\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2021 RLLR 25\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: July 8, 2021\nPanel: Deborah Coyne\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): (no information)\nCountry: Saudi Arabia\nRPD Number: TC0-12715\nAssociated RPD Number(s):\nATIP Number: A-2022-00665\nATIP Pages: 000123-000126\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: These are the reasons for decision in the claim of XXXX XXXX XXXX who claims to be a citizen of Saudi Arabia and is claiming refugee protection pursuant to Sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. In deciding this claim, the Panel applied the Chairpersons\u2019 Guideline 9, the proceedings before the IRB involving sexual orientation and gender identity and expression.\nAllegations\n[2] The allegations are set out in the Basis of Claim form. The claimant alleges a serious possibility of persecution in Saudi Arabia because of her sexual orientation and gender identity. The claimant was born as a male but self-identifies as a female and completed the gender transition in Malaysia. She alleges that she faces serious persecution and life-threatening harm if she has to return to Saudi Arabia.\nDecision\n[3] The Panel finds that the claimant faces a serious possibility of persecution should she return to Saudi Arabia because of her membership in a particular social group, specifically based on her sexual orientation and gender identity as a transgender woman. She is, therefore, a refugee pursuant to Section 96 of the IRPA.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[4] The Panel finds that the identity of the claimant as a national of Saudi Arabia is established by the claimant\u2019s Saudi Arabian passport in Exhibit 1.\nCredibility\n[5] Based on the testimony and the documents in the file, including the detailed Basis of Claim, the Panel has noted no serious credibility issues. On a balance of probabilities, the Panel finds the following to be true: that the claimant was born as a male in Saudi Arabia in 1996. Since a very young age, the claimant was aware that she was not like other boys and that she preferred the female identity. She was abused and threatened mentally and physically by her father throughout her childhood, especially when her father took custody of him and his sister, away from their mother after their parents\u2019 divorce. She suffered physical and mental bullying at school.\n[6] In 2019, the claimant was able to travel to Malaysia for studies and the claimant started the HRT process to transition his gender to female. Exhibit 5 includes documents from the claimant\u2019 s XXXX in Malaysia that explains the claimant\u2019 s treatment and progress.\n[7] The claimant\u2019 s family found out when the claimant returned to Saudi Arabia to attend his sister\u2019 s wedding. The claimant\u2019s father and other relatives threatened his life and the claimant\u2019s mother insisted that the claimant leave Saudi Arabia immediately as the pandemic was starting to shut down flights out of Saudi Arabia. The claimant was able to get a TRV to come to Canada and arrived in XXXX 2020.\n[8] The claimant submitted her claim for refugee protection and cannot return to Saudi Arabia where she fears persecution and death because of her gender identity and sexual orientation as a transgender woman.\n[9] The Panel finds that the claimant\u2019s narrative and evidence was internally consistent and plausible. There were no contradictions or omissions that go to the core of the claim. The allegations were supported by personal documents in Exhibit 5 that the Panel finds credible, and that establishes the claimant\u2019s identity as a transgender woman. These include letters from the doctor in Malaysia who provided the HRT treatment and related medical documents, as well as some photos.\n[10] The Panel accepts the evidence as establishing on a balance of probabilities the claimant\u2019 s subjective fear of persecution because of her gender identity and sexual orientation if she returns to Saudi Arabia.\n[11] The objective evidence in the National Documentation Package for Saudi Arabia in Exhibit 3 indicates that LGBTQ rights are not recognized and confirms that both male and female, same sex sexual activities are illegal. Saudi citizens must comply with uncodified criminal code based on Sharia Law and within this framework, sex outside of marriage is illegal, same sex marriage is not permitted and same sex intimacy is criminalized.\n[12] In Saudi Arabia, homosexuality and being transgender is widely regarded as immoral and indecent. The law imposes severe punishments for acts of homosexuality and cross dressing such as torture, prison up to a lifetime and capital punishment. Members of the LGBTQ community are ostracised and, in some cases, exposed by their own family members.\n[13] The situation faced by transgender persons in Saudi Arabia is corroborated by news reports and reports submitted by the claimant and also in Items 2.1, 2.4, 2.9, 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3 of the NDP. The Panel finds that the claimant\u2019s subjective fear of persecution and death as a transgender woman in Saudi Arabia is well founded.\nState Protection\n[14] Since being a transgender woman is criminalized in Saudi Arabia, the Panel finds that it is clearly unreasonable for the claimant to ask for the protection from the Saudi authorities. The Panel finds the claimant has rebutted the presumption of state protection with clear and convincing evidence.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[15] The Panel has considered whether a viable Internal Flight Alternative exists for the claimant. The Panel finds that the claimant faces a serious possibility of persecution throughout Saudi Arabia because of her sexual orientation and gender identity, and, therefore, the Panel finds the claimant does not have a viable Internal Flight Alternative within Saudi Arabia.\nCONCLUSION\n[16] The Panel finds that the claimant faces a serious possibility of persecution should she return to Saudi Arabia because of her membership in a particular social group, specifically based on her sexual orientation and gender identity as a transgender woman. She is, therefore, a refugee pursuant to Section 96 of the IRPA and the claim is accepted.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

The same parties are present. Sir, I\u2019m ready to give you my decision today. The decision I give you now will be provided to you in written form in the coming weeks, and may be revised for grammar and syntax, and references to the case law and documentary evidence may also be added. Do you understand that?\nCOUNSEL: So, XXXX XXXX (ph), you can say yes if you understand, and no if you don\u2019t.\nCLAIMANT: Yes. Yes. Yes.\n[1] MEMBER: Okay. These are the reasons of the Refugee Protection Division in file TC1-04808. XXXX is a citizen of the State of Kuwait by birth, seeks refugee protection pursuant to s. 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. He alleges more particularly a nexus to the Convention based on his membership in a particular social group, namely his sexual orientation and gender identity. Accordingly, as discussed with Counsel at the beginning of the hearing, I was guided by the Chairperson\u2019s guideline number 9 dealing with such claims.\n[2] The claimant\u2019s personal identity and nationality are established by the documentary evidence, including the certified copy of his Kuwaiti passport disclosed by the Division from the department at Exhibit 4. I\u2019m satisfied on the balance of probabilities as to the claimant\u2019s personal identity and that he\u2019s a citizen of Kuwait and of no other country. The claimant did not allege that he faced a danger of torture in Kuwait. The documentary evidence does not persuade me otherwise, and therefore, I find that he does not face a danger of torture in Kuwait.\n[3] The issue before me was whether I believed the claimant. I found him to be a straightforward and trustworthy witness. He had some awareness of his sexual orientation and gender identity somewhat earlier in his life, when he was still amongst his family in Kuwait, and coming to Canada as a visa student allowed him to explore that more fully. According to the evidence and his testimony, he briefly underwent hormone replacement therapy to transition to the female gender, but has since abandoned that path and currently defines his sexual identity as non-binary \u2014 or I guess that\u2019s the gender \u2014 I get the terms mixed. From what I know, it totally is not unusual to commence that therapy and to abort it before much progress has been made. That doesn\u2019t concern me. I do find the \u2014 the report of the psychiatrist very helpful and informative. The claimant\u2019s own testimony \u2014 it is somewhat unclear as to where I think he is. But I think that\u2019s also not unusual, given that he\u2019s only had the freedom to explore his orientation and identity in the last couple of years. It may well be that he \u2014 that when all the dust settles, some years from now, he ends up to be a heterosexual or cisgender male, but that\u2019s not what is before me today, and I\u2019m satisfied that if the claimant were required to return to Kuwait, that according to the documentary evidence contained both in part 6 of the Board\u2019s index and disclosed in Exhibit 5 from Counsel, that there\u2019s a serious possibility that the claimant would face persecution in Kuwait because of his sexual orientation and gender identity. I therefore determine that the claimant is a Convention refugee and I accept the present claim.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2021 RLLR 23\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: December 31, 2021\nPanel: Devin MacDonald\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Penny Yektaeian\nCountry: India\nRPD Number: TC1-09714\nAssociated RPD Number(s):\nATIP Number: A-2022-00665\nATIP Pages: 000112-000119\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] The claimant XXXX XXXX (Legal name XXXX XXXX XXXX) is a woman from India who is claiming refugee protection in Canada pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Act.\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] The claimant\u2019 s allegations are detailed in her basis of claim narrative. In short, the claimant fears persecution in India from her family, and society due to her gender identity expression as a trans woman.\n[3] The claimant\u2019s narrative describes her self-discovery process as a trans woman in India and her experience living with gender dysphoria. The claimant also outlines many instances of transphobia, homophobia, and gendered violence that she alleges to have personally experienced in India.\n[4] The claimant alleges that she entered Canada on XXXX XXXX 2018, and began to receive hormone therapy in XXXX 2018. She alleges that she did not take steps towards making an asylum claim in Canada until April 2020 because she did not have the necessary support system in place until that time and wanted to avoid remembering traumatic events from her past.\nDETERMINATION\n[5] Paragraph 170(f) of the IRPA1 provides that the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) may allow a claim for refugee protection without a hearing, unless the minister has notified the RPD of the minister\u2019 s intention to intervene within the time limit set out in the Refugee Protection Division Rules.2 Further, subsection 162(2) of IRPA3 directs each division to deal with all proceedings before it as informally and quickly as the circumstances and the considerations of fairness and natural justice permit. The Immigration and Refugee Board has issued Chairperson\u2019s Instructions Governing the Streaming of Less Complex Claims at the Refugee Protection Division (RPD).4 The claimant\u2019s claim was identified as one to which this process could apply. Her Certificate of Readiness was received on December 17, 2021. Having carefully considered the evidence in this case, the panel finds that it meets the criteria to be decided without a hearing.\n[6] The panel finds that the claimant is a Convention refugee according to s. 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[7] The claimant\u2019s identity as a citizen of India is established by a certified true copy of her passport issued by Indian authorities.5\nNexus\n[8] The panel finds that the claim is based on the claimant\u2019s membership in a particular social group, as the claim is based on her gender identity. As such, the claim has nexus with the Convention and is assessed according to s. 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nCredibility\n[9] The claimant submitted reliable documents that credibly establish that she is a trans woman.\n[10] The claimant provided a medical report, hormone prescription records, and bloodwork from her family physician.\n[11] The medical report, dated XXXX XXXX, 2021, indicates that the doctor has provided care for the claimant since XXXX XXXX, 2018. The doctor confirms the claimant\u2019s identity as a trans woman, states that they established the diagnosis of Gender Dysphoria for the claimant over the course of two assessments in XXXX 2018 and indicates that the claimant will require lifelong hormone therapy as treatment.6\n[12] The prescription records included in the medical report are a printout from a :flowsheet. The indicate that the family physician has prescribed hormone medications to the claimant regularly with the earliest prescription dated XXXX XXXX 2018.7\n[13] The blood test results included in the medical report indicate that the claimant\u2019s level of estradiol has increased, and level of testosterone as dropped between the first test dated XXXX XXXX, 2018, and subsequent tests.8\n[14] The claimant provided three internet posts from an internet forum made in 2016, which is years prior to the claimant entering Canada. In the posts, the claimant expresses her identity as a trans woman and her experience with gender dysphoria.9 The posts are anonymous; however, the details of the posts are consistent with the claimant\u2019s basis of claim narrative and in conjunction with the official medical documentation, with the panel has no reason to doubt that the claimant authored the posts. The panel finds the documents reliable and probative for the purpose of establishing the claimant\u2019s identity and gender expression.\n[15] The panel finds that the documents cited above reliably establish on a balance of probabilities that the claimant is a transwoman, that she has a diagnosis of gender dysphoria, and that she receives ongoing treatment for her gender dysphoria in the form of hormone therapy.\n[16] The claimant provided a recording of a conversation between her and her mother in Gujrati10 and a transcript of the conversation accompanied by a translator\u2019s declaration indicating that the audio tape was translated from Gujrati to English.11 The conversation concerns a specific instance of violence inflicted by the claimant\u2019s parents onto the claimant. The documentation from mental health professionals indicates that the claimant has reported a long history of abuse.12\n[17] The letter from XXXX XXXX Registered Psychotherapist, indicates that at the time of letter-writing they have had eighty-seven one-hour psychotherapy sessions with the claimant and indicates that the claimant has been diagnosed with complex trauma, which is diagnosed in individuals who have repeatedly experienced traumatic events such as violence, abuse, or neglect over a sustained period of time. The author states the claimant dissociates when reminded of past abuse which results in a struggle to think or communicate clearly.\n[18] The letter is consistent with the claimant\u2019s narrative in that her diagnosis of complex trauma is consistent with the experiences outlined in her narrative and in that the symptoms of complex trauma that the psychotherapist has noted in the claimant explain why the claimant delayed in making her claim in Canada until April 2020.\n[19] Based on the sworn statements in the claimant\u2019s BOC narrative and the corroborating documentation, including, the claimant\u2019s mother\u2019s verbal confirmation of physical abuse, the panel finds that the claimant faced mistreatment including physical violence in India due to her trans identity.\n[20] The panel finds that the above facts establish a subjective fear of persecution for the claimant should she return to India.\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution\n[21] The National Documentation Package [\u201cNDP\u201d] indicates that the transgender community is continually harassed, stigmatize, and abused by the police, judges, their family, and society. Human rights watch indicates that transgender people face discrimination in employment and housing.13\n[22] Sources indicate that transgender individuals have difficulty accessing health care and face stigma and discrimination when attempting to access the care they require.14\n[23] An article, provided by the claimant from Scientific American states that transgender people are refused health care at public hospitals.15 Another article from Al Jazeera documents specific incidents of mistreatment that trans individuals have experienced in attempting to access health care in India. It mentions an individual who died while doctors could not decide whether to admit the patient into a male or female ward and mentions an individual who was not given treatment, or the anti-HIV medicine recommended to rape victims. The article states that trans patients often face derogatory remarks from hospital staff and face delay in treatment.16\n[24] NDP item 2.15 indicates that transgender persons face difficulties in finding rental housing and are often forced to live in remote slum areas, where access to water and sanitation facilities is poor. 17\n[25] NDP item 6.6 states that trans individuals are vulnerable to physical and sexual violence in their homes. When young trans persons begin to express their gender identity they are often subjected to emotional, verbal, physical and even sexual abuse. The documents also discuss mistreatment perpetrated by private actors against transgendered individuals in public spaces, ranging from widespread verbal harassment, denial of services, and including physical and sexual violence perpetuated by mobs against transgender women.18\n[26] The panel finds that the objective evidence establishes, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimants fear of persecution in India due to her identity as a transwoman is well-founded.\nState Protection\n[27] Trans individuals in India are legally recognized by the Indian state as belonging to a third gender. Despite legal recognition, transgender protection laws in India are criticized for denying the right to self-identify and requiring a certificate of identity from authorities and by not offering adequate legal protection against sexual violence.19\n[28] Although the law bans discrimination, it does not define discrimination or provide for an enforcement mechanism to enforce the right to non-discrimination or provide any remedy when discrimination occurs.20\n[29] NDP item 6.3 states that the systemic discrimination and violence faced by queer persons in India, and the challenges they face in accessing justice and seeking remedies for human rights violations, remain at odds with the constitutional provisions concerning right to equality, non-discrimination, freedom of expression and dignity which has been recognized as the source of transgender persons\u2019 right to self-recognition of their gender identity by the Indian Supreme Court.21\n[30] Item 6.3 indicates that trans individuals face a risk from state authorities including police. Item 6.3 indicates that many transgender persons rely on sex work as a means of livelihood and that there is also a perception that transgender persons are involved in sex work, even when they may not be. The police often use provisions designed to regulate sex work against transgender persons to arrest and detain them. Likewise, the documents indicates that trans persons are targeted by anti-beggary laws and nuisance laws by police who are supposed to be serving as agents of state protection.22\n[31] Although the NDP indicates that there are trans-specific group that focus on advocacy and support for the trans community, the evidence does not indicate that these groups function as agents of state protection transgender individuals.\n[32] The panel finds that operationally adequate state protection would not be forthcoming to the claimant in India should she return.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[33] The panel finds that the claimant is unable to relocate to another part of India as there would be nowhere in India where the claimant would be able to openly express her gender identity without facing persecution. The country evidence reveals a strong societal bias against trans woman throughout India.\nCONCLUSION\n[34] Having considered the totality of the evidence in this claim, the panel finds that the claimant\u2019s subjective fear is objectively well-founded, and that the claimant has a serious possibility of persecution upon return to India due to her membership in a particular social group. There is no viable internal flight alternative or adequate state protection for the claimant in India.\n[35] The panel finds that the claimant is a Convention refugee and accepts the claim under s. 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection act.\n(signed) Devin MacDonald\nDecember 31, 2021\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27, as amended, section 170(t).\n2 Refugee Protection Division Rules (SOR\/2012-256).\n3 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27, as amended, section 162(2).\n4 Instructions Governing the Streaming of Less Complex Claims at the Refugee Protection Division, effective January 29, 2019.\n5 Exhibit 1: Claim referral information from CBSA\/IRCC\n6 Exhibit 5: Applicant\u2019s document package, Persona] documents, Medical report and file issued by Dr. page 7-23\n7 Ibid\n8 Ibid\n9 Exhibit 5: Applicant\u2019s document package, Persona] documents, P.

In summary, you allege to be an Indian trans woman in the process of transitioning. Your sexual orientation is pansexual. You have experienced abuse multiple times, and you fear returning to India on the basis of your gender identity and sexual orientation, and you claim refugee protection under s. 96 and s. 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. I considered and applied the Chairperson\u2019s guideline 9, regarding claims on sexual orientation and gender identity and expression.\nDetermination\n[3] I find that you are a Convention refugee according to s. 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nIdentity\n[4] Your identity as a citizen of India was established by a certified true copy of your passport, a copy of your Indian union driving licence, a copy of your birth certificate, a copy of your national identity card, set out in Exhibit 5.\nNexus\n[5] I find that this claim is based on your membership in a particular social group, as the claim is based on your gender identity and sexual orientation. Thus, you will be assessed according to s. 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nCredibility\n[6] Credibility is always an issue in a refugee protection hearing. You testified in a straightforward manner with no hesitation, and quite often with great emotion. You provided realistically detailed testimony of your experience as a sexual minority in India. You described the intolerance and harassment that you faced from family, the society, and even the police. You explained that your gender identity and sexual orientation alienated you from your family, and the last communication you had with them regarding your engagement with XXXX (ph) was very stressful for you. Your allegations are supported by the documentary evidence that we have. Therefore, I accept your allegations that you are who you say you are, a pansexual trans woman from India who has a forward-looking risk of facing persecution in India. You are afraid to return to India and live your life openly as a pansexual trans woman. In support of your claim, you provided multiple documents corroborating your allegations, including an updated Basis of Claim form, translated Facebook messages from XXXX (ph), your father, Facebook messages from [inaudible] XXXX (ph), your sister, a letter from XXXX (ph), your counselor, copies of medical files, including emergency department triage records, mental health assessments, mental health services reports, and a letter of recommendation for cross-gender hormone replacement therapy from XXXX XXXX (ph), a support letter from XXXX XXXX (ph), your fianc\u00e9, with accompanying ID dated , XXXX XXXX 2021, support letter from XXXX XXXX (ph), your friend, with a accompanying ID dated XXXX XXXX, 2021, support lette from XXXX XXXX XXXX (ph), dated XXXX XXXX 2021, a copy of lease with you listed as a tenant and XXXX XXXX as a tenant too, which \u2014 with two children, photos of you, XXXX, XXXX (ph), and XXXX (ph).\nArticles on the Country Conditions\n[7] I find the documents provided to be highly probative because I have no reason to doubt the authenticity. They contain all marks of genuine documents, and I hereby assign them full weight in corroborating your allegations of persecution. I find that you have established on a balance of probabilities that you are a pansexual trans woman from India. You testified in detail about your personal evolution as to your self\u00ad definition and self-awareness as to your sexuality and gender. Your Basis of Claim narrative states your experiences in India, past relationship with XXXX (ph), and current relationship with your fianc\u00e9 XXXX XXXX, and much more. You spontaneously state the things that you like about XXXX XXXX , and about your relationship with the children. XXXX XXXX provided a detailed support letter. You found out your sexual orientation when you were in grade 6 or 7, and at that time, you knew that you liked boys and thought that you were gay. You have now discovered that you are pansexual, and that gender does not matter for you, but connection does, in a relationship. You became aware of this because your fianc\u00e9, XXXX XXXX is a trans man, and you realized that the connection is all the matters. You discovered your gender identity as an adult in Canada, though you had worn female clothing and makeup as a child, and you got harassed and reprimanded strongly for doing that. In addition, you provided corroborating documents about the allegations on the state of your mental health. Cumulatively, I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that you have established subjective fear, and the objective basis and evidence support the same, and you have a well-founded fear of persecution in India on the basis of your sexual orientation as a pansexual and trans woman.\nObjective Basis\n[8] Although the law in India made it legal for sexual minorities in India in late 2018, the general public have not accepted such relationships. LGBTQ2+ groups reported that they faced widespread societal discrimination and violence, particularly in rural areas. Some police committed crimes against LGBT persons and used the threat of violence to coerce victims not to report the incidents. Research has revealed that LGBTQ persons typically face sexual orientation and\/or gender identity-based discrimination that affects their ability to fully enjoy civil, cultural, economic, political, and social rights. For example, housing. Its members often face extensive rights violations within the domain of housing [inaudible]. This includes discrimination in the rental market, denial of housing, segregation into poorly resourced neighbourhoods, violence and harassment from landlords, neighbours, families, and police.\n[9] Sexual minorities experience discrimination and human rights abuses at all stages of the employment process. This includes unequal access to educational opportunities, discrimination during the recruitment process, discrimination and gendered working conditions, and a Jack of job security. I had to look holistically at the experience that a trans woman who is pansexual would face in India in terms of the overall climate, both from the state and from the people, as well as the active persecution that one might face in India. I\u2019ve also considered your personal circumstances in this case. Your clear desire to live openly, both in terms of your sexual orientation as well as your gender identity. I also considered the past abuse on your mental state. So, for these reasons, I find that you have sufficiently established from the evidence that there remains a conservative culture which in and of itself might not be enough. But the totality of the factors point in the direction that there is sufficient subjective fear and objective basis to have your claim rise to the level of persecution to satisfy the terms that I have to apply today.\nState Protection\n[10] Refugee status is only available to those who can establish that state protection is unavailable to them in their country of nationality. States are generally presumed to be capable of protecting their citizens. However, this presumption may be rebutted by clear and convincing evidence that state protection would not be forthcoming to the claimant. I am satisfied that the presumption of state protection has been rebutted in your case. In reviewing the country conditions on state protection in India and its treatment to the sexual minorities, the NDP item 6.1 outlines that the attitudes and behaviour of the police is one of the biggest barriers to sexual minorities \u2014 to sexual minorities\u2019 access to the justice system in India. Furthermore, in several cases, the police have refused to file complaints submitted by sexual minorities, owing to bias or stereotypes. You testified that you sought state protection when your father locked you up in a room for about a week after beating, abusing, and causing you injuries that have caused scars on your face. You could not access medical assistance because you were locked up. You escaped by breaking the window. However, when you reported to the two police officers, they made snide comments like \u2018oh, he is one of those,\u2019 and they collected your father\u2019s phone number. You had thought that the officers collected your father\u2019s phone number to take action against the inhumane treatment meted to you by your father, but they only took the number to call your father to take you back home. You got no help from the police, as they refused to file a complaint, and they released you to your father, who abused you.\n[11] Objective evidence does indicate the laws might be in place and mechanism of protection for sexual minorities may be in place. However, I find that at this time, they are not operationally adequate. The attitude of the police remains one of the biggest barriers for access to justice for sexual minorities. Given the mistreatment of sexual minorities by Indian authorities, and the evidence painting to the limited police effectiveness regarding LGBTQ crimes, I find on a balance of probabilities that adequate state protection would not be reasonably forthcoming to you in India.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[12] I have also considered whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for you. In other words, whether there is any location in India where you could live safely. Based on the country condition evidence, I find that the persecution of LGBTQ+ persons persists throughout India. I therefore find on a balance of probabilities that there is no viable internal flight alternatives for you in India.\nCONCLUSION\n[13] So, for all the above reasons, having considered everything, including the SOGIE guidelines, I find that you have a well-founded fear of persecution under s. 96, and thus, I find you to be a Convention refugee under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, and I therefore accept your claim.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014-REASONS CONCLUDED\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2021 RLLR 21\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: July 8, 2021\nPanel: Megan Kammerer\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Ramneek Sidhu\nCountry: Hungary\nRPD Number: VB9-07875\nAssociated RPD Number(s):\nATIP Number: A-2022-00665\nATIP Pages: 000101-000107\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: This is the decision of the Refugee Protection Division in the claim of XXXX XXXX who also goes by the chosen name of XXXX XXXX as a citizen of Hungary who is claiming refugee protection pursuant to Section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[2] In assessing these claims, I have considered and applied the Guidelines on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression called the SOGIE Guidelines, to ensure that appropriate accommodations were made in questioning the claimant and the overall hearing process and in substantively assessing the claim.\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] The claimant alleges that she is transgender and that as a transgender person she is subject to persecution in Hungary.\nDETERMINATION\n[4] I find that the claimant has a well-founded fear of persecution and is, therefore, a Convention refugee under Section 96 of the Act.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[5] I find that the claimant\u2019s identity as a national of Hungary has been established on a balance of probabilities by her testimony and a copy of her passport.\nCredibility\n[6] When a claimant swears to the truth of her allegations, this creates a presumption that those allegations are true unless there is a reason to doubt their truthfulness. In this case I have found no reason to doubt the claimant\u2019s truthfulness, she testified in a straightforward and convincing manner and answered all of the questions posed to her. She was able to speak in detail about what it is like to live as a transgendered person in Hungary. The discrimination and threats that she faced in Hungary and the risks that she would face if she were to return to Hungary, particularly as she has started the process of transitioning and is currently on hormone replacement therapy.\n[7] In addition, the claimant has provided several documents which corroborate her claim. These included a number of medical and XXXX reports authored by professionals in Canada and in Hungary, which confirm that the claimant has identified as transgender since her childhood. And that the claimant is currently being treated with hormone therapy.\n[8] A statement of support from a friend that the claimant met online in the XXXX 2018. This friend states that she is aware of the claimant\u2019s quote \u201cdysphoria and her attempt to establish her trans identity back in her country\u201d from their first email exchange. The friend states that the claimant disclosed that quote, \u201cAlmost every attempt to present female in her old place of living was met with threats to her life and health often with XXXX malice in the form of verbal attacks.\u201d\n[9] The friend indicates that she helped the claimant to obtain information on the asylum process in Canada. A series of emails exchanged between the claimant and her friend which corroborate her allegations and contain a series of references to the claimant transitioning, identifying as female, and the discrimination and harassment she has experienced in Hungary. A series of photographs which captured the claimant\u2019s physical transition. And the claimant also made a witness available to attest her gender identity but given the wealth of detailed evidence available, I did not feel it was necessary to call this witness.\n[10] I find the claimant to be credible and I believe what she has alleged in support of her claim.\nNexus\n[11] The claimant alleges that she is at risk due to her identity as a transgender individual. I find that the persecution the claimant fears has a Nexus to the Convention ground of a particular social group, namely transgendered individuals. I have thus assessed this claim under Section 96 of the Act.\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution\n[12] The claimant testified that she is afraid to return to Hungary as a visibly transgender person. She indicated that if she were to return to Hungary, she would face discrimination in nearly every facet of her life.\n[13] Ranging from the ability to seek employment, to the ability to seek medical treatment, to the ability to walk safely down the street. She spoke about being verbally assaulted on the street for her appearance and about death threats her trans friends have received.\n[14] The claimant testified that while Hungary has never been particularly accommodating for members of the LGBTI community, but that the atmosphere has deteriorated significantly in recent years to the point where she feels she can no longer live safely in Hungary.\n[15] She indicated in the past few years the government has passed laws which are designed to target LGBTI people and transgender people in particular. And that her country now does not recognize her existence.\n[16] The claimant also testified about how difficult it was to make the decision to leave her home in Hungary but how she felt she had no other options given the XXXX impact of hiding her true self and the increasingly discriminatory legislation being passed by the government.\n[17] The claimant testified about how difficult it was XXXX and emotionally to live in Hungary where transgender issues are quote \u201crepressed\u201d and where she legally does not have the option of transitioning.\n[18] She testified about the process of attempting to legally transition in Hungary before legislation was passed in 2020 now making this illegal, and the impact that this process had on her mental state.\n[19] The objective country condition evidence corroborates the claimant\u2019s evidence. The International Lesbian Gay Bisexual Trans and Intersex Association of Europe which is cited at Item 6.1 of the National Documentation Package has stated that Hungary has adopted a quote \u201cincreasingly hostile atmosphere\u201d towards sexually minorities. Likewise a recent report authored by the Hatter Society, the Hungarian LGBT Alliance and the Transvanilla Transgender Association concludes that quote, \u201cdiscrimination, harassment, and various forms of violence are part of the everyday experience for a large proportion of LGBTI persons in Hungary. These views are often shared, in some cases even encouraged, by leading politicians.\u201d\n[20] A recent report on hate speech also cited at Item 6.1 of the National Documentation Package links the Hungarian government\u2019s policies with the rise in discrimination and intolerance perpetrated against LGBTI persons.\n[21] The objective evidence demonstrates that the government has become increasingly homophobic, has targeted LGBTI people with homophobic and discriminatory comments, and has taken a series of escalating measures designed to severely curtail the rights of transgendered people.\n[22] In May 2019 for example, as is set out at Item 6.1 of the National Documentation Package, the speaker of the Hungarian parliament stated that there is no moral difference between the adoption of children by same-sex couples and pedophilia.\n[23] That same year, an article submitted by the claimant at Exhibit 6 shows that one (1) of the State-run public service channels dedicated a show to conversion therapy spreading the view that homosexuality is a disease and that it is only the gay lobby trying to convince young people that this was not a sickness and incurable.\n[24] As is detailed at Item 2.1 of the National Documentation Package, on December 15th 2020 parliament adopted a government submitted amendment introducing additional gender specific language into the constitution declaring that \u201cthe basis for family relations is heterosexual marriage\u201d and \u201cthe mother is a woman, the father is a man\u201d. It also declared that the country \u201cprotects children\u2019s rights to an identity based on their gender at birth\u201d and that children must be guaranteed, \u201cupbringing based on values stemming from Hungary\u2019s constitutional identity and Christian culture\u201d.\n[25] Parliament also adopted government submitted legal provisions on adoption allowing only married couples consisting of a woman and a man to adopt children unless the Minister for Family Affairs grants special permission.\n[26] On May 19th 2020, Hungary\u2019 s parliament adopted a Bill that included provisions replacing the term gender with gender at birth in the civil registry. And prohibited gender change on all official documents such as identification cards, passports, and driving licenses.\n[27] LGBTI Organizations expressed public concern that as a result transgender persons could face harsh workplace and health care discrimination or could be accused of fraud when presenting personal identity documents.\n[28] A representative of Amnesty International cited at Item 6.4 of the National Documentation Package has stated that the legislation \u201cpushes Hungary back towards the dark ages and tramples the rights of transgender and intersex people\u201d and will \u201d deepen an already intolerant and hostile environment faced by the LGBTI community\u201d.\n[29] At Item 6.3 of the National Documentation Package, Amnesty International further states that the uncertainty and daily struggles these changes bring in accessing basic services, institutions and opportunities can lead to self-harm, suicide, and other mental health challenges for people who are unable to have their gender identity recognized.\n[30] This affects, in particular, those individuals whose appearance, gender expression or gender identity do not match their sex on official documents, since their right to privacy could be violated whenever they are required to prove their identity.\n[31] Amnesty International has also pointed out that these provisions not only severely violate the right to privacy but also expose transgendered and intersex people to additional legal, social, and institutional hurdles in violation of their economic, social and cultural rights.\n[32] Moreover, according to Amnesty International, these changes are likely to expose transgender and intersex people to discrimination in all spheres of life.\n[33] In October 2020, the Prime Minister of Hungary stated that a book that depicted fairy tales with minority Romani LGBTI and characters with disabilities was a quote, \u201cact of provocation\u201d.\n[34] The leader of the party tore up a copy of the book in public and a conservative campaign group collected signatures calling for a boycott. And then most recently as is set out in the evidence provided by the claimant in Exhibit 6, in XXXX 2021, Hungarian law-makers approved legislation that prohibits sharing with minors any content that portrayed homosexuality or sex reassignment on the grounds that this will help them fight pedophilia.\n[35] Amnesty International has condemned this legislation on the ground that it will further stigmatize LGBTI people and expose them to greater discrimination in what is already a hostile environment.\n[36] At Item 2.1 of the National Documentation Package, the United States Department of the State identifies threats of violence by extremists targeting lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex persons as one (1) of the most significant human rights issues in Hungary.\n[37] Sources at Item 6.3 of the National Documentation Package also indicate that in Hungary transgender and intersex people are often subject to discrimination with respect to employment, education, accessing goods and services, and housing.\n[38] Moreover, they often experience violations of their right to health, both in obtaining treatment related to their gender identity and in obtaining general medical care.\n[39] In addition to the legal obstacles, the often outdated approach of certain medical staff can lead to transgender and intersex people avoiding a visit to the doctor altogether.\n[40] In light of the evidence outlined above, I must determine whether the claimant faces a serious possibility of mistreatment that would amount to persecution if she returned to Hungary. There is a distinction between discrimination and persecution. Only those individuals who face a serious possibility of persecution are entitled to protection under the Act. Although persecution is not defined in the Act, the relevant case law has identified general hallmarks for criteria of persecution.\n[41] In determining the meaning of persecution, I note that the Act must be construed and applied in a manner that complies with international human rights instruments to which Canada is a signatory. In order to be considered persecution, the mistreatment suffered by a claimant must be serious. In order to determine whether a particular mistreatment would qualify as serious, one must examine what interest of the claimant might be harmed and to what extent the subsistence enjoyment, expression or exercise of that interest might be compromised.\n[42] The court has equated a serious compromise of the claimant\u2019 s interest with a \u201csustained or systemic violation of basic human rights\u201d.\n[43] The second criterion of persecution is that the inflicting of harm occurs with repetition or persistence in a systematic way. Each act of mistreatment or discrimination on its own may not reach the level of persecution and I must consider the cumulative impact on the claimant. In this case, the evidence outlined above demonstrates that the government in Hungary continues to target LGBTI persons, including transgender persons by making homophobic and discriminatory comments as well as bypassing a series of increasingly homophobic and regressive laws, designed to promote a hostile atmosphere towards LGBTI persons and to curtail their rights.\n[44] This is compounded by persecutory social practices that mean that transgender persons are often notable to access basic services such as education, health care, and housing.\n[45] And that they are not able to exercise basic rights, including those outlined in international human rights instruments such as the right to security of the person and the right to privacy.\n[46] As such, considering all of the evidence before me, I find that the level of discrimination and mistreatment faced by transgender persons in Hungary amounts to persecution and that the claimant would face such a persecution if she returned to Hungary. I thus find that the claimant would face a serious possibility of persecution in Hungary.\nState Protection\n[47] The next element in my analysis is whether there is adequate state protection for the claimant in Hungary. While there is a presumption of state protection, this presumption can be rebutted with clear and convincing evidence that protection would not be forthcoming to the claimant.\n[48] I note that the State is one (1) of the agents of persecution in this case and in concert with the legislation described above, has taken steps to erode mechanisms through which members of the LGBTI community can seek recourse for discrimination and hate crimes.\n[49] Sources indicate at Item 2.1 of the National Documentation Package for example that in December 2020 parliament voted to abolish the equal treatment authority which is viewed by LGBTI groups as the one (1) of the few remaining public bodies that deliver decisions against discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.\n[50] Moreover, although law prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation as well as certain forms of hate speech and prescribes increased punishment per violence against members of the LGBTI community.\n[51] NGOs representing the LGBTI community reported at Item 2.1 of the National Documentation Package that police officers continued to resist classifying incidents as hate speech and were unfamiliar with police hate crime protocols.\n[52] Sources cited at Item 6.1 of the National Documentation Package described a 2008 case where Molotov cocktail attacks against LGBTI venues were initially investigated by the police as hooliganism rather than hate crimes.\n[53] Likewise, sources cited at Item 6.1 of the National Documentation Package indicate that the government does not have a coordinated strategy or action plan to counter discrimination against sexual minorities. I thus find that the presumption of state protection has been rebutted.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[54] With respect to an internal flight alternative, I do not find that the claimant can live safely in any part of Hungary. The government has stripped members of LGBTI community of their rights throughout the country. I find that discrimination and persecution against transgender people is prevalent throughout Hungary. I find that the claimant faces a serious possibility of persecution throughout the country. In my view there is no viable internal flight alternative available to the claimant.\nCONCLUSION\n[55] For these reasons I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee and I accept her claim.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2021 RLLR 20\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: April 8, 2021\nPanel: Kari Schroeder\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Albert Chiu\nCountry: Japan\nRPD Number: VB9-09766\nAssociated RPD Number(s):\nATIP Number: A-2022-00665\nATIP Pages: 000086-000089\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: This is the decision of the Refugee Protection Division in the claim of XXXX XXXX as a citizen of Japan who is claiming refugee protection pursuant to Section 96 and Subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[2] In rendering a decision today, I have applied the Chairperson\u2019 s Guideline on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression. The following is a brief synopsis of the claimant\u2019s allegations.\n[3] The claimant is a transgender woman, she was diagnosed with gender identity disorder in 2009 in Japan and underwent two (2) years of psychotherapy. She had gender reassignment surgery in Thailand in 2011. The claimant has also been diagnosed with High-Functioning Autism spectrum and disorder. The claimant came to Canada in 2016 as a temporary worker. She claimed refugee protection in 2019. The claimant fears returning to Japan to face discrimination and harassment as a transgender woman.\n[4] I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to Section 96 of the Act for the reasons that follow.\n[5] The claimant\u2019s identity today has been established through a certified copy of her passport on file before me.\n[6] In terms of credibility, I\u2019ll note that there is a presumption of truth applied to all refugee claimants unless there is a reason to doubt their allegations, and today I had no concerns arising from the claimant\u2019s testimony. She testified in a direct and straightforward manner with no attempt at embellishing the evidence, there were no material discrepancies between her testimony and her Basis of Claim form. I note that the claimant has been diagnosed with autism and so she did sometimes take some time to respond to my questions, but I found this did not impact her credibility. The claimant testified that she began hormone replacement therapy in 2009 but that she had to purchase the hormones from Thailand as it was difficult to find in Japan. Similarly the claimant underwent surgery in Thailand after visiting different doctors in Japan. She testified that there were few doctors who would be able to perform the surgery for her. After she transitioned and retuned to Japan, she testified to always feeling that something was wrong, and that people treated her differently. Ultimately she did not feel safe and made the decision to leave Japan. She also faced discrimination in employment because she was transgender. I have documentary evidence before me, including medical reports confirming the gender reassignment surgery in 2011 and a copy of the two (2) birth certificates showing the change in gender. Based on the evidence before me I accept the claimant\u2019s allegations as credible.\n[7] I find that there is a Nexus to the Convention ground in this case, namely membership in a particular social group that the claimant is a transgender woman.\n[8] I have considered whether there is an issue with subjective fear given that the claimant did not claim refugee protection right away after entering Canada. She testified that she came as a worker and her intent was to leave Japan which she did after researching many different options for many different countries. She was able to obtain an open work permit in Canada and for a time felt that she would be able to remain. However, after experiencing some difficulties with employment, including sexual harassment by her employer she realized that she may have to return to Japan, and it was at that point she visited a non-profit organization and learned about making a refugee claim. And so I find that the claimant was making attempts to remain in Canada and that her failure to claim when she arrived in Canada does not detract from her subjective fear.\n[9] I have reviewed the objective evidence before me, and I also find that it also corroborates the claimant\u2019s allegations. While it is possible in Japan to change one\u2019s gender legally, the requirements are complex, discriminatory and restrictive. The law requires transgender persons to be without reproductive capacity, effectively requiring surgical sterilization for most persons in order to have their gender identity legally recognized. They also must meet additional conditions, including undergoing a psychiatric evaluation and receiving a diagnosis of gender identity disorder. Which I\u2019ll note that the World Health Organization has formally removed from the mental disorder section of the international classification of diseases. The person has to be unmarried and over the age of 20 and cannot have any children younger than the age of 20. On January 23rd the Supreme Court ruled on a suit that was filed in 2016, that ail of the above requirements were constitutional.\n[10] According to the US Department of State report, there is no law prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity, there are no penalties associated with such discrimination either. In February the Tokyo District County dismissed a damage suit against one (1) university which was filed by the parents of a student who fell from the school building in 2015 after his classmates without his consent disclosed that he was gay, and the court declared that the university bore no responsibility for the death. The report also notes that the Ministry of Justice received 33 inquiries about potential human rights violations based on sexual orientation and gender identity in 2018. And LGBT advocacy organizations reported several instances of discrimination, outing, bullying, harassment, and violence. The stigma surrounding LGBT persons remained an impediment to self-reporting of discrimination or abuse.\n[11] I have several other country condition documents which have been submitted by counsel which confirm the claimant\u2019s allegations and I\u2019ll read some excerpts of these documents into the record. One document confirms that Japan does not prohibit discrimination explicitly based on sexual orientation or gender identity neither in employment or in other fields. Additionally, Japan does not explicitly protect LGBT individuals against violence, while hate crime and hate speech at least based on sexual orientation is criminalized in a majority of other democratic countries. Japan does not legally recognize same-sex partnerships meaning that same-sex couples are deprived of many of the pecuniary rights to which married couples are entitled. Same-sex partners are not given equal access to joint adoption and medically assisted insemination.\n[12] One document confirms that legal LGBT inclusivity in Japan has improved over the past (2) decades but at a modest pace. Since 1882 the Penal Code does not penalize consensual same-sex sexual acts and has mentioned since 2004, transgender individuals are allowed to change their gender marker in the civil registry. However, as an edit above legal gender recognition is conditioned on several discriminatory conditions such as sterilization. In recent years regional human rights courts and other rights bodies have found that these legal requirements of Japan violate international human rights law. In 2013 the United Nations Special Rapporteur noted that transgender people being required to undergo unwanted sterilization surgeries as a prerequisite to enjoying legal recognition of their preferred gender was a human rights violation and called on governments to prohibit the practice.\n[13] And so based on the review of the evidence I find that the instances of discrimination, harassment, and violence experienced by many LGBT people in Japan rise to the level of persecution. I find that the conditions imposed on transgender persons in Japan are persecutory. The claimant testified that if she returned to Japan she would feel compelled to hide her identity as she did before which in and of itself is inherently persecutory. And so based on the evidence before me I find that the claimant would face more than a mere possibility of persecution in Japan. I find that the level of discrimination she would face in employment, accessing healthcare and other services as well as the threat of harassment and violence is sufficiently serious to be persecution.\n[14] I have considered whether there is state protection available to the claimant and I find that there is not. States are presumed to be capable of protecting their citizens and this is particularly the case in a democratic country such as Japan where human rights are generally respected. The evidence shows there has been some progress made with respect to LGBT rights generally, including one (1) example in an Amnesty International report of a gay couple who had been approved as foster parents in Osaka. However, a review of the overall evidence shows that there is still little to no legal protections particularly for transgender persons in Japan. As I mentioned same-sex marriage is still illegal, there are no laws protecting LGBT persons from discrimination and so employers and healthcare providers are free to discriminate against people with diverse sexual orientation and gender identity with little recrimination. There are no laws protecting against hate speech and hate crime which is a market difference from other similarly democratic countries. And finally the conditions upon which a person is able to legally change their gender are State sanctioned and have been upheld by the Supreme Court. I therefore find that state protection would not be forthcoming to the claimant in this case.\n[15] And finally as the conditions facing LGBT people in Japan are the same throughout the country, I find that there is no internal flight alternative available to the claimant in this case.\n[16] In conclusion, I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to Section 96 of the Act and the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada therefore accepts her claim.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

I just\u2026 I need to read my decision, which sometimes takes a few minutes because I have to go through all the legal tests and the evidence and so if you just bear with me for a few minutes, and then afterwards, if you have any questions, you are more than welcome to ask them, but you have experienced Counsel representing you, so I am sure that they will be more than capable of answering all of your questions. All right.\nINTRODUCTION:\n[2] These are the reasons for the decision in the claims of XXXX XXXX, who is the principal claimant, who claims to be a citizen of Lebanon and XXXX XXXX, who is the associate claimant and who claims to be a citizen of Tunisia, they are seeking protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nALLEGATIONS:\n[3] In their Basis of Claim forms and during their testimony at the hearing, the claimants alleged that they fear being harmed by members of society and the state in their respective countries of reference as a result of their membership in the SOGI community.\nDETERMINATION:\n[4] I find that the claimants have established that they face a serious possibility of persecution in their respective countries of reference on the basis of a convention ground, which is membership in a particular social group, specifically that being members of the SOGI community and I therefore find that they are convention refugees.\nDECISION:\n[5] In coming to my decision, I have considered and applied Chairperson\u2019s guideline 4 \u2013 women refugee claimants fearing gender-related persecution and guideline number 9 \u2013 proceedings before the IRB involving sexual orientation and gender identity and expression.\nANALYSIS:\n[6] IDENTITY: I find that the claimants\u2019 identities have been established by the documents on file, namely certified copies of their passports. I will note that some of the principal claimant\u2019 s identification documents list his name as XXXX XXXX. That is the name the principal claimant was born with. However, the principal claimant has undergone an official legal name change. There is a certificate of legal name change from the Province of British Columbia on file that indicates that the principal claimant\u2019 s legal name has been changed from XXXX XXXXtoXXXX XXXX XXXX.\n[7] 1E AND COUNTRIES OF REFERENCE: The principal claimant is a national of Lebanon and no other country. The principal claimant has a passport from Lebanon, even though he was born and raised in Kuwait. He testified that he has Lebanese nationality because both of his parents are Lebanese nationals.\n[8] According to NDP on Kuwait, the principal claimant would not be entitled to nationality in Kuwait by birth because his father is not Kuwaiti. Nationality could be conferred through naturalisation; however, it is not automatic. It requires a fulfillment of a series of criteria. This alone, however, does not lead to the granting of nationality. Once the criteria are fulfilled, then the granting of nationality remains discretionary on the part of the authorities in Kuwait. When I consider the Williams test in conjunction with the evidence before me, I find that the principal claimant is not\u2026 is not currently a national of Kuwait and does not have a right to citizenship in Kuwait.\n[9] The associate claimant is a national of Tunisia and no other country. She was born and raised in Tunisia and moved to Kuwait in 2005 and lived there until coming to Canada in 2019. As a result, she has no birthright to nationality in Kuwait and has not lived long enough in Kuwait to be able to apply for nationality according to the NDP, which requires a residency requirement of 20 years. Furthermore, as previously mentioned, the granting of nationality is discretionary on the authorities and therefore, even if she met the resident residency requirement, acquiring nationality would not be within her control.\n[10] The principal claimant lived in Kuwait his whole life and the associate claimant lived in Kuwait since 2005. They testified that they had temporary status linked to their employment in Kuwait that needed to be renewed yearly. They also did not have the same rights as those who are nationals of Kuwait. The NDP on Kuwait indicates that there is no permanent residency status in Kuwait, only temporary status. Given the foregoing, when I consider the Zeng test, I find that the claimants do not have status in Kuwait sufficiently similar to that or substantially similar to that of a national of Kuwait. I therefore do not have to consider whether the claimants are excluded from refugee protection pursuant to Article 1E of the convention. As a result of the foregoing, I will assess the claimant\u2019 s claims against Lebanon in the case of the principal claimant and Tunisia in the case of the associate claimant.\n[11] CREDIBILITY: I find that the claimants are credible. When a claimant swears a truth of certain allegations, this creates a presumption that those allegations are true, unless there would be a reason to doubt the truthfulness. This is Maldonado in 1980 Federal Court of Appeal. The presumption of truthfulness has not been rebutted in this case. The claimants testified in a straightforward manner. There were no material inconsistencies in their testimony or contradictions between their testimony and the other evidence before me. I find that the claimant\u2019 s allegations are heavily corroborated by the personal documents on file, including witness letters and the objective country evidence.\n[12] SUBJECTIVE FEAR: I find that the claimants have established that they have a subjective fear of returning to their respective countries of reference. The claimants arrived in Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2020, and their BOCs were signed on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2020. I find that there has been no delay in their claims when they arrived in Canada. I note that, according to the principal claimant\u2019s passport, he had multiple tourist visas to Europe and the UK and travelled to Europe between 2014 and 2018 and he did not claim asylum during those trips. I asked the principal claimant whether he had considered applying for asylum during those trips abroad and he explained that at that time, he was always with his family and that he was not free to claim asylum. I accept that this is a reasonable explanation, in spite of the fact that the claimant did not seek asylum in Europe and consequently find that because this explanation \u2026 I consequently find that this reasonably explains why the claimant did not claim asylum on those trips abroad and as a result, his failure to claim asylum does not undermine his subjective fear.\n[13] I also note that the principal claimant\u2019s claim is in part as a result of years of mistreatment by society, including his family and as a result of his gender identity. It was in 2019, that his family were pressuring him to marry a man of their choice and assaulted the principal claimant as a result of his refusal. It is accumulation of a life lived and this added pressure that let the claimant to flee to Canada and when I consider ail of the evidence, I find that the claimant has established that he faces a subjective fear of returning to Lebanon.\n[14] The associate claimant similarly travelled outside of Tunisia, including a trip to France in 2019. Again, I find that the associate claimant\u2019s claim is as a result of a cumulative experience and not necessarily an acute event. When I consider the whole of the evidence, the circumstances of the associate claimant, the fact that she has not returned to Tunisia and claimed asylum within days of entering Canada, I find that her failure to claim asylum in France in 2019 does not undermine her subjective fear. I find, as a result, she has established that she faces a subjective fear or has a subjective fear of returning to Tunisia. The facts established on the balance of probabilities, given that I find that the claimants are credible, I find that they have established the principal claimant is a transgendered man. The associate claimant identifies herself as a straight girl or straight woman, who is a relationship with the transgendered man. The claimants met in Kuwait in 2017 and soon began a romantic relationship. They have been in a committed relationship ever since and they plan to marry.\n[15] They both identify as members of the LGBTQ community and have been active members of that community with different groups while in Canada.\n[16] NEXUS: I find that the claimants have established a nexus with their fear of harm on a convention ground of membership in a particular social group, members of the SOGI community. I will therefore assess their claims pursuant to section 96 of IRPA.\n[17] SECTION 96 ANALYSIS: Pursuant to section 96 of IRPA, a convention refugee is a person who is outside of their country of nationality, has a well-founded fear of being persecuted on the basis of one of the five convention grounds and where they cannot avail themselves of the protection of their country. For the following reasons, I find that the claimant\u2019s meet these criteria and are therefore convention refugees.\n[18] WELL-FOUNDED FEAR OF PERSECUTION: Objective evidence, in considering the objective evidence in relation to the claimant\u2019s profiles, I find that the claimants face a serious possibility of harm if they return to their respective countries of reference. I will assess the country conditions separately, given that each claimant is claiming against a separate country.\n[19] I will begin with the principal claimant\u2019s claim in relation to Lebanon. The NDP indicates unequivocally that there is intolerance in Lebanon for diverse sexual orientations or gender expressions and people within the SOGI community face criminalisation and discrimination. According to NDP 6.2, Lebanon still holds Article 534 of the Penal Code in practise, which condemns unnatural intercourse by up to one year of imprisonment. The use of this Article creates a basis for prosecuting non-normative sexual orientations and gender identities. Members of the SOGI community face arrest. The most common patterns for arrest are based on an individual, who visually does not conform to gender norms. Criminalising homosexuality limits the right to protection for members of the SOGI community. Individuals with non-normative SOGIs can rarely seek legal protection as their identities might be revealed, which will automatically lead to investigation.\n[20] The most common pattern that individuals have to deal with is blackmail by individuals who declare to use the information to SOGI status against them. According to NDP 6.4, sexual minorities in Lebanon are less persecuted in Lebanon than elsewhere in the Middle East; however, they remain ostracised by society except in perhaps affluent areas of the capital of Beirut. However, even in Beirut, members of the gay community must operate in secrecy. The NDP indicates that homosexuality is still strongly condemned in Beirut. The founder of an LGBT NGO and activist stated that, despite the gay nightlife in Beirut, gays frequently suffer from physical and psychological abuse in private. This activist indicated that LGBT people are sometimes forced to stay at home, forced into marriage, or beaten by members of the family. According to NDP 6.3, who\u2026 that related experience of a transgendered woman, that woman indicated that she faced systemic discrimination in education, employment, housing, and the provision of healthcare in Lebanon. The NDP also indicates that transgendered women in particular also are at greater risk of arbitrary arrest, arrests and questioning at checkpoints and are\u2026 which are often accompanied by physical violence by law enforcement officials.\n[21] Transgendered women also face routine violence and the threat of violence by members of the public and are denied police protection, which compromises their ability to live in safety and positions them in a perpetual state of precarity and this discrimination against transgendered women emanates from severe social stigma and isolation. It is exacerbated by the lack of resources that are tailored for trans\u00ad people and by their difficulty in obtaining identification documents that reflect their gender identity and expression, I appreciate that the claimant before me is a trans-male. However, I find that this NDP that does speak specifically about transgendered women, talks about \u2026 provides evidence with respect to the experience of individuals from the trans-community. When I consider the principal claimant\u2019s personal circumstances in conjunction with his objective\u2026 with the\u2026 in conjunction with the objective evidence. I find that there is a serious possibility that you will face systemic discrimination and possibly criminal sanctions as a result of his gender identity, if he were to return to Lebanon.\n[22] I will now turn to Tunisia in relation to the forward-facing risk faced by the associate claimant. The experience of the members of the SOGI community appears to be largely the same in Tunisia relative to that of members of the SOGI community in Lebanon. According to NDP 6.1, homosexuality is taboo. It\u2019s a taboo subject to Tunisia and as a result, people who are gay or lesbian in Tunisia keep quiet about their sexual orientation. Homosexuality is considered a disease of the West by conservative Muslims and Tunisian society associates homosexuality with pedophilia. Despite being discrete, gay people are assaulted in society and arrests since the revolution in 2011 had been on the rise.\n[23] Treatment in society includes a constant risk of arrest and blackmail, social outcast, and Joss family ties and job prospects. Many LGBTI people experience rejection, discrimination, harassment and violence by their families and communities at every stage of their life. In mid-April of 2016, a Tunisian actor stated in the television interview that homosexuality is disease. LGBTI people live with constant fear of being arrested and prosecuted. In terms of treatment by authorities, the Minister of Human Rights and Transitional Justice in 2012 characterised homosexuality as a perversion that requires medical treatment. Expression \u2026 expressing one\u2019s sexuality is not a human right and that freedom of expression has limits. The Tunisian government rejected the recommendation by the UN Human Rights Council to decriminalise same-sex acts. The recommendation was viewed as incompatible with the laws and realities of Tunisian society. Consensual same-sex relations are criminalised under Article 230 of the Penal Code, which provides up to three years of imprisonment and a fine for sodomy and lesbianism.\n[24] According to Article 226 of the Penal Code, which criminalises indecency and acts deemed to be offensive to the public morals. That particular Article is used against transgender and gender non\u00ad conforming people providing up to six months imprisonment. The true scale of the application of Article 230 is not known. LGBTI organisations say that scores of mainly gay men are arrested every year. People are arrested because of their behaviour, their appearance and expression and when their appearance and expression seem to fit certain stereotypes of LGBTI people and \u201crarely because they are caught in the act.\u201d To obtain proof of same-sex sexual activity, gay men are routinely subjected to anal examinations by forensic doctors after being arrested and upon a judge\u2019s order. The impact of the laws that criminalise homosexuality creates a permissive atmosphere for hate crimes against people suspected of engaging in same-sex relationships or not conforming to gender norms, There is a little accountability and the police will often not investigate homophobic and transphobic crimes and will instead threaten survivors with prosecution for their perceived sexual orientation and gender identity. Many LGBTI people do not dare to report to authorities of violations and abuses they are subjected to. The authorities\u2019 unwillingness to change these laws reflects a state-entrenched discrimination against LGBTI people.\n[25] When I consider the objective evidence in relation to the associate claimant, the associate claimant identifies as a straight girl or a straight woman. However, she is in a relationship with a transgendered male. She is also\u2026 she herself also identifies as a member of the LGBT community. I find that, according to Tunisian society, she would not be viewed as being in a normative heterosexual relationship. I find that she would also\u2026 I find that it would also be imputed that she is either not a heterosexual woman or at the very least not conforming with respect to norms relating to sexual orientation in Tunisia. In her BOC and in her testimony, she also alleges that she fears being harmed and killed by her family because she has dishonoured them. She said her brother has already threatened to kill her if she remains in a relationship with the principal claimant.\n[26] According to NDP 5.4, domestic violence is a serious problem in Tunisia and has reached alarming proportions in some neighbourhoods and areas. There does not appear to be a difference between rural and urban areas. I find that \u2026 when I consider the associate claimant\u2019s circumstances as a whole, I find that both as a result of her imputed sexual identity and as a result of her family\u2019s view that she has dishonoured them, that she faces a serious possibility of harm at the hands of state, society and her family members, who are personally affronted by her choice of romantic partner. Does the harm faced by the claimant amounts to persecution? I find that the harm faced by the claimants in their respective countries of reference does amount to persecution. To be considered a persecution, the mistreatment suffered or anticipated must be serious and constitute the denial of a basic human right.\n[27] Persecution can be considered the sustained or systemic violation of basic human rights. I find that for each of the claimants in their respective countries of reference, they cannot express their sexuality or their sexual orientation or their gender identity freely without facing either pervasive discrimination, criminal sanctions, or physical harm and I find that these constitute serious violations of their basic human rights and amount to persecution.\n[28] STATE PROTECTION: I find that there is clear and convincing evidence before me that the state is unable to provide the claimants with adequate protection. States are presumed to be capable of protecting their citizens, except in situations where the country is in a state of complete breakdown and responsibility to provide international or surrogate protection only becomes engaged when national or state protection is unavailable to the claimants. To rebut the presumption of state protection, a claimant must provide clear and convincing evidence of the state\u2019s inability to protect its citizens. Claimant is required to approach the state for protection if protection might reasonably be forthcoming; however, a claimant is not required to risk their lives seeking an ineffective protection of the state merely to demonstrate the ineffectiveness.\n[29] In the case of both claimants, the state is in part the agent of persecution and as a result, I find that state protection would not be forthcoming. In the case of the associate claimant and her allegations of retaliation or domestic violence as a result of her family disapproving of a relationship and her family feeling that she has dishonoured them, I find that she is particularly vulnerable and would not\u2026 and state protection would not be forthcoming because if she was to seek state protection, she would be outed as a person who is in a relationship with a trans-man and as a result of the fact that the state is\u2026 give me.. . I am trying to find the right word. Given that the state also participates in the persecution of individuals from the SOGI community, I find that state protection for her would not be forthcoming and as a result, I find \u2026 and I will also note that according to NDP 5.4, domestic violence victims who go to the police, there is evidence in that NDP that the police treat those domestic violence victims deplorably and primarily because there is a lack of training and a lack of desire to conduct an objective investigation. So, I find that, as a result of the objective evidence, that the vulnerability to the associate claimant is compounded, one because of her imputed SOGI status, but also because of the fact that she is a woman who would be facing amongst various forms of persecution, a domestic violence at the hands of her family and so, I find ultimately that the claimants have rebutted the presumption of state protection with clear and convincing evidence.\n[30] INTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE: I have considered whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for the claimants. On the evidence before me, I find that there is no viable internal flight alternative for the claimants in either Lebanon or Tunisia. For an IFA to be viable, there must be no serious possibility that the claimants would face persecution or on the balance of probabilities face a section 97(1) harm in the putative IFAs. Further conditions in the putative IFAs must be such that it would not be unreasonable in all of the circumstances including those particular to the claimant in question for the claimants to seek refuge there.\n[31] Given that there are clear laws in both countries that criminalise same-sex relationships, homosexuality and that discrimination against members of the SOGI community is pervasive in both countries, I find that there is no safe place for the claimants to go in their respective countries and as a result, they do not have a viable IFA in their respective countries of reference. Have the claimants established that they face a well-founded fear of persecution if they return to Tunisia and in the case of the associate claimant and to Lebanon in the case of the principal claimant? As a result of their particular circumstances, the objective country evidence before me including the lack of adequate state protection and Jack of viable IFA, I find that the claimants have established that they face a well-founded fear of persecution if they return to Tunisia or to Lebanon and in conclusion \u2026 and I should state that more clearly that I find that, they face a serious\u2026 a serious possibility that they have a well-founded fear of persecution in their respective countries of reference. So, in the case of the associate claimant, that\u2019s Tunisia. In the case of the principal claimant, it is Lebanon.\n[32] CONCLUSION: Based on the analysis above, I conclude that the claimants are convention refugees and accordingly, I accept their claims.\n[33] So, to XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX, I wish you both the very best and thank you, Counsel, very much for your assistance and I wish everyone a very good day.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2021 RLLR 18\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: June 8, 2021\nPanel: David Jones\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Nicholas Woodward\nCountry: Bahamas\nRPD Number: VC0-03417\nAssociated RPD Number(s):\nATIP Number: A-2022-00665\nATIP Pages: 000074-000077\nDECISION\n[1] On June 8, 2021 the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) heard the claim of XXXX XXXX XXXX aka XXXX XXXX, who claims refugee protection under sections 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA). On that same day, the panel rendered its oral POSITIVE decision and reasons for decision. This is the written version of the oral decision and reasons that have been edited for clarity, spelling, grammar and syntax, where appropriate. At the request of counsel for the claimant and with the direction of the presiding member, paragraph 1 of the decision was amended to correct an error in the spelling of the claimant\u2019s name. The error in the spelling of XXXX has been corrected with thestrikethrough function and has been underlined to note the amendment of the transcript and replaced with the correct spelling of XXXX\n[2] MEMBER: This is the decision of the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada in the claim of XXXX XXXX XXXX, originally filed under the name XXXX XXXX XXXX (ph) who is a citizen of the Bahamas seeking refugee protection pursuant to Sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. I also reviewed and applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline on Proceedings Before the IRB Involving Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression.\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] The claimant fears persecution if she were to return to the Bahamas as a transgender person. Details of the claimant\u2019s allegations can be found in the narrative attached to her Basis of Claim form and amendment to her narrative found at Exhibit 6. The following is a summary of allegations and testimony.\n[4] The claimant knew from a small child that her gender identity was not accurate, and she always saw herself as a girl. In 2016, the claimant came out to her family. I\u2019m not going to detail all the incidents of abuse and discrimination described in her narrative, but I will note that it includes physical abuse from her father, receiving death threats after being in a documentary called the \u2018The Underneath Transgenders in the Bahamas,\u2019 numerous incidents of abuse at a workplace and being threatened with a knife while on a bus.\n[5] On XXXX XXXX 2019, a week after being threatened on the bus, the claimant applied for an ETA to come to Canada. The claimant did not have money to travel until she received assistance from a friend. On XXXX XXXX 2019, the claimant flew to Toronto. In June 2019 the claimant applied for refuge protection.\nDETERMINATION\n[6] I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[7] The claimant\u2019s identity as a citizen of the Bahamas has been established on a balance of probabilities by her Bahamian passport located at Exhibit 1.\n[8] The claimant was born in the Bahamas to Haitian parents. When the claimant was 18, she applied for Bahamian citizenship and in the process, she had to renounce her Haitian citizenship. A copy of her renunciation of Haitian nationality dated XXXX XXXX 2018, can be found at Exhibit 5. As such I find on a balance of probabilities that the claimant is a citizen of the Bahamas and no other country nor does she have status substantially similar to citizenship in any other country.\nNexus\n[9] The allegations establish a Nexus to a Convention ground for the claimant based on her particular social group, namely as a transgendered person.\nCredibility\n[10] I find on a balance of probabilities that the claimant is a transgender person. In making that finding, I\u2019m relying on the principle that a claimant who affirms, to tell the truth, creates a presumption of truthfulness unless there are reasons to doubt their truthfulness. In this regard, the claimant testified in a consistent and straightforward manner that was consistent with her Basis of Claim form narrative and supporting documents. The claimant was able to speak about her experience with the difference between Canada and the Bahamas, her experiences with transphobia including violence in the work, at school, at home, and out in the public. The consequences of living openly in the Bahamas, the lack of legal protection against discrimination, the transphobic attitudes of the police, and the claimant answered specific questions when asked. There are no relevant inconsistencies in her testimony or contradictions between her testimony and the other evidence. I find that the claimant was a credible witness.\n[11] The claimant also provided documents to support her claim. For example, Exhibit 5 contains eight (8) letters in support of the claimant including from the claimant\u2019s doctor in the Bahamas as well as friends and colleagues both in the Bahamas and in Canada. Exhibit 5 also contains (inaudible) news articles of the claimant participating in a pride event, Ontario documents related to her name change and change of gender designation, and other photographs of the claimant. I have no reason to doubt the genuineness of these documents as it relates to the claimants\u2019 gender identity and expression which is what puts her at risk. I give great weight to these documents to support the claimant\u2019s allegations and overall claim. As such I find that the claimant has established on a balance of probabilities the facts alleged in the claim including a subjective fear of return to the Bahamas.\nObjective Basis\n[12] The objective evidence supports the claimant\u2019s fears of returning to the Bahamas. As background, the US Department of State Report for the Bahamas found at Item 2.1 in the National Documentation Package as found at Exhibit 3 indicates that the law does not provide anti-discrimination protections to LGBTI individuals on the basis of their sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, or characteristics and that LGBTI individuals face a social stigma and discrimination and were not adequately protected by law enforcement authorities. A response to information request found at Item 6.1 quotes a source that describes the Bahamas as a place where \u201chypermasculinity is valued and black men especially are expected to perform their masculinity in compliance with the hegemonic norm. Openly gay men, feminine men, or transgender people are seen as betraying manhood. These values are rigidly policed, and it is culturally acceptable to exert physical violence against men who betray these gender norms.\u201d\n[13] That RIR cites other sources to indicate that the LGBTQ people feel being open about their gender identity or sexual orientation in the Bahamas due to fear of ostracization and physical violence. The RIR also indicates that LGBTQ people have been subject to violence including killings and that a lot of that violence goes unreported. Finally, the RIR further indicates that the police do not have any specific anti\u00adLGBT policies. Individual officers often deride ridicule and abuse to LGBTI people who attempt to report violence against themselves and community members. The claimant also provided 14 news articles and reports found at Exhibit 5 to support her claim. These include articles about the Canadian government warning LGBTQ people about traveling to the Bahamas given the anti-LGBTQ sentiments in the country and the risk of violence. Other news articles describe specific incidents of violence including murder and attempted murder charging LGBTQ people in the Bahamas. Based on the totality of the evidence, I find that the claimant has established a well-founded fear as well as a serious forward-facing risk of persecution if she were to return to the Bahamas.\nState Protection\n[14] With respect to state protection, the state is presumed capable of protecting its citizens and the claimant must establish on a balance of probabilities through clear and convincing evidence that the country\u2019 s protection is inadequate. Given the country conditions noted above including the indifference of the authorities to crimes against LGBTIQ persons, I find that there is adequate state protection available to the claimant. The claimant\u2019s testimony and narrative reflect the country\u2019s conditions and its regard as the claimant has successfully attempted to obtain protection from the police and she described in her testimony that there is no one that she can seek protection from and that she has never been protected in the Bahamas. I find that the claimant has rebutted the presumption of state protection with clear and convincing evidence.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[15] Give the country conditions outlined and above and the claimant\u2019s testimony regarding the conditions being the same throughout the Bahamas and the small size of the country. I find that the claimant would face a serious possibility of persecution throughout the country. Currently, I find there\u2019s no internal flight alternative available to the claimant.\nCONCLUSION\n[16] For the foregoing reasons, I determine the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to Section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act and the Board, therefore, accepts the claim.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

This is the written version of the oral decision and reasons that have been edited for clarity, spelling, grammar and syntax, where appropriate.\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: This is the decision of the Refugee Protection Division in the claim of XXXX XXXX XXXX, who also goes by the chosen name of, XXXX XXXX, and is referred to as \u201cthe claimant\u201d in this decision, as a citizen of Russia, who is claiming refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[2] In assessing this claim, I considered and applied the guidelines on sexual orientation and gender identity and expression; the SOGIE Guidelines, to ensure that appropriate accommodations remain in questioning the claimant, the overall hearing process, and in substantively assessing the claim.\nAllegations\n[3] The claimant alleges that they identify as a non-binary transgender person. They allege that they face persecution in Russia due to both their gender identity and because they are a person born biologically male and are married to another person who is male. The claimant alleges that they fear persecution and violence from Russian authorities, members of the public, and their family.\nDetermination\n[4] I find that the claimant has a well-founded fear of persecution and is, therefore, a Convention refugee under section 96 of the Act.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[5] I find that the claimant\u2019s identity as a national of Russia has been established on a balance of probabilities by their testimony and a copy of their passport.\nCredibility\n[6] When a claimant swears to the truth of their allegations, this creates a presumption that those allegations are true, unless there is a reason to doubt their truthfulness. In this case, I have found no reason to doubt the claimant\u2019s truthfulness. The claimant testified in a straightforward and convincing manner and answered all of the questions posed to them.\n[7] The claimant was able to speak in detail about their gender identity and their process of self-discovery, what it is like as a trans-gendered person in Russia, the discrimination they faced in Russia as a child, and the risks that they would face if they were to return to Russia.\n[8] In addition, the claimant has provided an extensive number of documents which corroborate their claim. These include the following: various documents which establish the ongoing spousal relationship between the claimant and their Canadian spouse, XXXX, including bene-fit payments, car insurance, property assessments, and mobile account information; various photographs depicting the claimant with their Canadian spouse, XXXX. There are a number of different photographs of different events in 2019 and 2020, including the claimant and XXXX wedding; an affidavit sworn by the claimant\u2019s biological father, which corroborates the claimant\u2019s allegations, and which outlines how and when the claimant disclosed their gender identity and relationship with XXXX to him in 2018; an affidavit sworn by the claimant\u2019s stepmother, which corroborates the claimant\u2019s allegations, which confirms that she and the claimant\u2019 s father are aware of the claimant\u2019s gender identity and consider it genuine, and which outlines how distressed and fearful the claimant was when they learned they may have to return to Russia; an affidavit of support from the claimant\u2019 s mother, which generally corroborates the claimant\u2019 s allegations and which confirms that she is aware of the claimant\u2019s gender identity and is aware of the claimant\u2019s relationship with XXXX; an affidavit of support from a friend of the claimant. The friend attests that she knows the claimant as a non-binary, transgender person, and provides evidence about her experiences living as a gender non-conforming person in Russia; an affidavit of support from the claimant\u2019s former partner, XXXX XXXX (ph), which generally corroborates the claimant\u2019s allegations, attests to the fact that they were in a romantic relationship before the claimant left Russia, and confirms that they had plans to both leave Russia, so that they could be together in another country; a letter of support from a representative of the XXXX XXXX XXXX. which provides services and supports to families in Oakville, Ontario. The representative confirms that the claimant identified themselves as non-binary when registering for this support, and that they seem pleased that other staff and volunteers were so accepting of their identity; a letter of support from a clinical psychologist who treated the claimant in the United States. Psychologist confirms that the claimant had a series of appointments in XXXX and XXXX 2019, which centred on issues of gender identity and the claimant\u2019s fear of having to return to Russia. The psychologist confirms that during this time the claimant presented openly as transgender and that they explored the claimant\u2019 s \u201cjourney to discover their gender identity as transgender and non-binary\u201d. The psychologist states that in his professional opinion \u2014\nCOUNSEL: Madam Member, I don\u2019t mean to interrupt, but it looks like the claimant\u2019s video is frozen.\nMEMBER: Can you still hear me?\nCLAIMANT: I can hear, yeah.\nCOUNSEL: Okay.\nMEMBER: Okay.\nCOUNSEL: It\u2019 s just your video\u2019 s frozen.\nMEMBER: I\u2019ll continue on.\nCOUNSEL: Yeah.\nMEMBER: I\u2019ll continue on, but if at some point you \u2018re not able to hear or you cut out, please try to let us know.\nCLAIMANT: Okay.\nCOUNSEL: If \u2014 if \u2014 if your audio cuts out, just come to the office where I am and then I\u2019ll let the Member know.\nCLAIMANT: Will do, yeah.\nCOUNSEL: Thank you.\n[9] MEMBER: Okay. The psychologist states that in his professional opinion, the claimant\u2019s expression of their gender identity as transgender and non-binary is genuine; a letter of support from the claimant\u2019s physician in Canada, which confirms that when taking their initial health history, the claimant identified themselves as a non-binary person and mentioned potentially being interested in gender affirming therapy; a letter of support from the claimant\u2019s former academic advisor in the United States, which generally confirms the claimant\u2019s allegations; a letter of support from a friend of the claimant and their spouse, who attests to the fact that he often drove XXXX to the United States to meet the claimant, and that he was present at their wedding; a letter of support from a friend of the claimant, which indicates that they came out as transgender in 2019, and which indicates that the claimant is a XXXX of a XXXX called XXXX XXXX, which provides support and advocacy to transgender and non-binary individuals; a letter of support from a co-worker and friend of the claimant which confirms that he and claimant have discussed their gender identity and fear of returning to Russia as a LGBTQ+ person; and, a letter of support from a close friend of the claimant in the United States, which generally confirms the claimant\u2019s allegations.\n[10] The claimant also indicated that their spouse, XXXX, was available to act as a witness. I did not find it necessary to ask XXXX to testify, given the extensive documentary evidence submitted and the credible nature of the claimant\u2019s testimony. I note that the claimant did not initiate a refugee claim in the United States even though they lived in that country for several years. They explained that this is because their spouse is Canadian and that they did not want to be separated from their spouse for the length of time it would take for their claim to be processed.\n[11] The claimant also explained that the political climate in the United States at the time was negative and hostile towards LGBTQ+ persons and that they were afraid of being detained in unsafe conditions, given their status as a gender non-conforming individual. I accept this explanation and do not find that it undermines the claimant\u2019s credibility or subjective fear.\n[12] I note as well that the claimant has visited their mother in France and did not make a refugee claim there. The claimant explained that this was because they did not want to be separated from their Canadian spouse. I accept this explanation and do not find that it undermines the claimant\u2019s credibility or subjective fear.\n[13] I find the claimant to be credible and I believe what they have alleged in support of their claim.\nNexus\n[14] The claimant alleges that they are at risk, due to both their gender identity and their perceived sexual orientation. I find that the persecution the claimant fears has a nexus to the Convention ground of particular social group; namely, transgendered individuals and individuals who are perceived to be LGBTQ+. I have, thus, assessed this claim under section 96 of the Act.\nThe Claimant\u2019s Status in the United States\n[15] The claimant lived in the United States from 2012 until 2019, during which time they were enrolled in a graduate program at the University of Massachusetts. The claimant testified that they had a student visa and has provided a copy of a certificate of eligibility for non-immigrant student status, as well as various other documents confirming their immigration status.\n[16] The claimant testified that they became scared about the possibility of having to return to Russia when they graduated from their university program because they did not have permanent status in the United States, and that they explored the possibility of obtaining and employment visa; although this was ultimately unsuccessful.\n[17] I find that the clamant does not have status substantially similar to that of a national or access to such status in the United States, and is, therefore, not excluded pursuant to Article 1(e) of the refugee Convention. I note that the claimant\u2019s father is an American citizen and has been living in the United States since approximately 1997, and that the claimant\u2019s mother is a citizen of France and has been living there since approximately 2010.\n[18] The objective evidence in the National Documentation Packages for both countries indicates that the claimant, as an adult, does not have a right to citizenship of either country by a virtue of the parent-child relationship.\n[19] I, thus, find that neither the United States nor France is a country of reference in this claim.\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution\n[20] The claimant identifies as a non-binary transgender person. They testified that their earliest memories are of being gender non-conforming and recounted being bullied and harassed at school for presenting as too feminine. The claimant explained that they started the process of discovering their identity when they started college in Russia through exposure to the internet and Western sources.\n[21] The claimant testified about the process of discovering their transgender identity and the role that their spouse, XXXX, played in that process. They reference the fact that they had experienced a lot of pressure to conform throughout their life and that XXXX was the first person who they could talk to about their gender identity and who supported their self-discovery.\n[22] The claimant testified about the risks they would face if they were to return to Russia. They indicated that transgender people who do not fit into gender norms are at risk of physical violence. They reference being aware of several cases where transgendered people have been killed or injured due to their gender identity. They also indicated that, in general, Russian society is very hostile to transgender people and that their family in Russia would not be accepting of their identity.\n[23] The objective evidence demonstrates that LGBTQI+ peoples, including those who are transgender and those who are perceived to be homosexual, face treatment in Russia that amounts to persecution. Although homosexuality has been decriminalised in Russia since 1993, in 2013, a law banning the promotion of \u201cnon\u00ad traditional sexual relations\u201d came into force.\n[24] Sources cited Item 6.1 of the National Documentation Package indicate that the law is frequently invoked to punish the exercise of free speech by LGBTQI+ persons and their supporters. The government uses a law to restrict any materials that directly or indirectly approve of persons who are non-traditional sexual relationships and to limit the rights of persons who advocate for LGBTQI+ rights or express the opinion that homosexuality is normal.\n[25] The United States Department of State Item 2.1 of the National Documentation Package identifies crimes involving violence or threats of violence against LGBTQI+ persons as one of the most significant human rights issues in Russia. There are reports of State actors committing violence against LGBTQI+ persons based on their sexual orientation or gender identity. There are also reports of government agents attacking, harassing, and threatening LGBTQI+ activists. Sources cited at Item 6.1 of the National Documentation Package further indicate that state controlled media engages in a \u201chomophobic campaign\u201d, which is directed against LGBTQI+ persons. Reports have identified a number of recurring themes and mainstream media coverage in Russia, including statements by public officials that portray LGBTQI+ identities as contradictory or Russian and Orthodox values and as a Western phenomenon imposed by Europe as part of an agenda to weaken and alienate Russia.\n[26] The UK Home Office at Item 6.4 of the National Documentation Package reports that politicians use transphobic hate speech, which encourages stigma and intolerance amongst the population. Sources indicate that LGBTQI+ persons in Russia face discrimination and are exposed to the threat of violence in their places of study or work when searching for housing and when attempting to access medical care. This is so, even if an individual is not officially out, but simply presents as gender non-conforming. According to one source cited at Item 6.1 of the National Documentation Package, \u201ceven if LGBT individuals are not officially out, it is enough for individuals to be suspected of being gay or lesbian for them to be the subject of verbal or physical abuse. Failing to adhere to established gender norms in dress or behaviour, being overly affectionate to someone of the same sex or living with someone of the same sex are tantamount to coming out and can thus result in the risks set out above.\u201d\n[27] Sources indicate that medical practitioners limit or deny LGBTQI+ persons health services due to intolerance and prejudice. The Russian LGBT network representative cited at Item 2.1 of the National Documentation Package indicates that upon disclosing their sexual orientation or gender identity, LGBTQI+ individuals often encounter strong negative reactions and the presumption that they are mentally ill.\n[28] Sources cited at Item 2.1 of the National Documentation Package also indicate that transgender persons are uniquely vulnerable to discrimination. This is in part because transgender persons face difficulty updating their names and gender markers on government documents to reflect their gender identity and because the government has not established standard procedures, and many civil registry offices deny their requests. When documents fail to reflect their gender identity, transgender persons face harassment by law enforcement officers and discrimination in accessing health care, education, housing, transportation, and employment.\n[29] Moreover, the United States Department of State at Item 2.1 of the National Documentation Package, reports that the LGBTQI+ persons are particular targets of societal violence and that the police often fail to respond adequately to such incidents. For example, the Russian LGBT network reported that a transgender man was attacked while he was leaving a supermarket in the Kursk Region in April 2020. The assailant grabbed a man by the neck, beat him, and threatened to kill him. The man sustained serious injuries. Although he filed a report, the police did not investigate the incident and refused to open a criminal case.\n[30] There are numerous other similar examples of the failure of the authorities to respond when violence or credible threats of violence are made against LGBTQI+ persons, and these are cited in the National Documentation Package.\n[31] There are also reports that Item 2.1 of the National Documentation Package that the authorities have conducted involuntary physical exams of transgender persons, physically and sexual abuse transgender people, and subjected transgender individuals to detention, assault, harassment, and humiliating treatment. The UK Home Office reports at Item 6.4 of the National Documentation Package, that law enforcement personnel used violence and torture to extract confessions. As well, as is set out in the SOGIE guidelines, it is well-established in law that being compelled to conceal one\u2019s gender identity or sexual orientation constitutes a serious interference with fundamental human rights, and a claimant cannot be expected to conceal their gender identity as a way to avoid persecution.\n[32] It is apparent that the claimant has engaged in a significant measure of behavioural self-censorship while living in Russia, they have been unable to live openly as a non-binary transgendered person in Russia. The objective evidence in the National Documentation Package is overwhelming regarding the persecution and ill-treatment of member of the LGBTQI+ community, which includes transgendered persons, such as the claimant. I find that the claimant would face a serious possibility of persecution by the government as Russia \u2014 of Russia, as well as from non-state actors, if they were to return to their country of nationality.\nState Protection\n[33] I have considered whether adequate state protection is available to the claimant in Russia and conclude that it is not. A State is presumed capable of protecting its citizens to rebut this presumption, a claimant must establish on a balance of probabilities with clear and convincing evidence that their State\u2019s protection is inadequate. In this case, I find it would be objectively unreasonable for the claimant to seek state protection in Russia because it is in part the State that the claimant fears due to its pattern of persecution and prosecution of sexual minorities.\n[34] Further, the objective evidence demonstrates that there is no government support for LGBTQI+ persons in Russia and that the law does not prohibit discrimination against LGBTQI+ persons in housing, employment, or access to government services such as health care.\n[35] I, thus, find on a balance of probabilities, that the State would be unwilling or unable to provide adequate protection to the claimant if they were returned to Russia. The presumption of state protection has been rebutted.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[36] I have also considered whether a viable Internal Flight Alternative exists for the claimant and find that it does not. The evidence before me indicates that transgendered persons are persecuted throughout Russia. I, thus, find that the claimant faces a serious possibility of persecution throughout the entire country. The claimant does not have an IFA.\nCONCLUSION\n[37] For these reasons, I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee, and I accept their claim. All right. So that concludes my decision in your claim.\nCLAIMANT: Thank you.\nMEMBER: You \u2014 I want to thank you very much for participating in this hearing today, and I want to welcome you to Canada.\nCLAIMANT: Thank you so much.\nMEMBER: Yeah. Thanks as well to you, Counsel. So, what I\u2019m going to do now, is I\u2019ll stop the recording and then I will disconnect the proceedings.\nCOUNSEL: Thank you Madam Member.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2021 RLLR 16\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: December 9, 2021\nPanel: Hannah Gray\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Preevanda K Sparu\nCountry: Bahamas\nRPD Number: VC0-03669\nAssociated RPD Number(s): VC0-03670\nATIP Number: A-2022-00665\nATIP Pages: 000061-000065\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: This is the decision of the Refugee Protection Division, the RPD, in the claim ofXXXX XXXX XXXX, the principal claimant, and her partner, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, the associate claimant of the Bahamas, who are claiming refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, the IRPA. I have considered and applied the Chairperson \u2018s guidelines on women refugee claimants fearing gender-related persecution. And I have also applied and considered the Chairperson\u2019 s guideline nine (9) proceedings before the IRB involving sexual orientation and gender identity and expression in this decision. I find that the claimants are Convention refugees pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA based on their well-founded fear of persecution in the Bahamas.\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] The specifics of the claims are stated in the claimants\u2019 Basis of Claim forms and narratives and evidence. The claimants are a common-law couple from the Bahamas, who are aged XXXX and XXXX respectively. The principal claimant identifies as a masculine and transgender and the associate claimant identifies as a lesbian. While living in the Bahamas, the principal claimant realised that they were non-gender conforming at a very young age and later began to date women as they got older. The associate claimant began to identify as a lesbian around the age of XXXX. They experienced threats and harm while living in the Bahamas and most of their family members did not accept their sexuality.\n[3] The associate claimant was robbed in her home and her private photographs were leaked publicly. The principal claimant was threatened and physically assaulted in a nightclub in 2019, causing her to Jose vision in her eye. The associate claimant and principal claimant both reported these incidents to the police. However, the police did not help. The associate claimant fled to Canada in XXXX 2019 as they feared for their safety and her godsister informed her that Canada was a safe haven for the LGBTQ community. She made her refugee claim at this time. The principal claimant had to recover from the assault in the Bahamas and then locate their passport and then they fled to Canada in XXXX 2019. They made their refugee claim in December 2019. They both fear returning to the Bahamas and being threatened or harmed by all of society due to their sexual orientation and gender identity.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[4] I am satisfied with the identity of the claimants as citizens of Bahamas, which is established by their testimonies and the copies of their passports in evidence.\nCredibility\n[5] When a claimant swears to the truth of allegations, this creates a presumption that those allegations are true unless there is reason to doubt their truthfulness. I find no reason to doubt the truthfulness of the claimants. They testified in a straightforward, forthright, detailed and candid manner. There were no material inconsistencies, omissions or contradictions between the claimants\u2019 testimonies and the other evidence in this case that were not reasonably explained, and they did not exaggerate or tailor their evidence. In summary, their testimonies were consistent with the other evidence on central aspects of their claims. I find the claimants also provided ample details to expand upon their allegations and they provided documentary evidence, which included medical reports and photographs from the physical assault of the principal claimant in 2019, XXXX assessments, photographs of them as a couple as well as with their friends from the LGBTQ community, letters of support from family and friends as well as support organisations, and country condition articles to name a few.\n[6] Both of the claimants travelled to the USA to visit family and friends between 2017 and 2018. When they were asked, if they considered making a refugee claim in the USA, the claimants testified that they did not. The associate claimant testified that she feared making a refugee claim in the USA as there had recently been a shooting at a gay club in Florida State and she feared that it would not be safe for them in the US. She further testified that her godsister who lived in Canada informed her that Canada was a country that offered refuge for the LGBTQ community. Based on their credible testimonies and reasonable explanation, I do not draw a negative inference on the claimants\u2019 credibility based on their failure to claim refugee protection in the USA.\n[7] Given the principle claimant\u2019s careful testimony and supporting documents, as well as the associate claimant\u2019s testimony and supporting documents, I find that both of the claimants have established on a balance of probabilities the facts alleged in their claims, including that the principal claimant identifies as masculine and non-gender conforming and that the associate claimant is a lesbian and they are in a lesbian relationship. I accept on a balance of probabilities that they have faced discrimination, a robbery, and an assault due to their sexual orientation, as well as general mistreatment from family members due to their sexual orientation and gender identity. I therefore accept the subjective fear they have of returning to the Bahamas. In sum, I find that the claimants are credible witnesses.\nNexus\n[8] To qualify for refugee status under the refugee convention, an individual must demonstrate that they have a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social group or political opinion. Based on the totality of the evidence, I find that the claimants have established a nexus to a convention ground, namely their membership in a particular social group as a lesbian woman and a non-gender conforming woman. Further, I find that the claimants face more than a mere possibility of persecution if they return to the Bahamas now. I will therefore assess this claim under section 96.\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution and Risk of Harm\n[9] I find that the claimants have a well-founded fear of persecution based on their sexual orientation and gender identity as a common-law couple who are non-gender conforming and in a same-sex relationship. In addition, the principal claimant testified that they are non-gender conforming and have intentions to undergo gender-affirming surgery in the future. The claimants both face threats and harm in the Bahamas in the form of a robbery, exposure of private information such as photographs, and an attack in a bar due to their sexual orientation. They also testified that they faced mistreatment from family members when they disclosed their sexual identities.\n[10] The SOGIE guideline states under section 8.5.9.1 that individuals with diverse SOGIE may also face instances of harassment or discrimination that cumulatively amount to a well-founded fear of persecution. The SOGIE guideline goes further to provide a non-exhaustive list of factors to consider regarding cumulative discrimination amounting to persecution, including restrictions, unemployment, social services, health care, and harassment by the police. The objective evidence in the National Documentation Package for the Bahamas at item 6.1 indicates that there are no constitutional protections for sexual minorities in the Bahamas and no protection against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in employment legislation. This report further states that same-sex marriage is not recognised in the Bahamas.\n[11] Homophobia permeates throughout cultural attitudes and it is culturally acceptable to exert violence against sexual minorities. This objective evidence also indicates that sexual minorities face violence, including killings in the Bahamas.\n[12] Sources in the NDP at item 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3 further indicate that LGBT people are generally afraid to be open about their sexual orientation and gender identity in the Bahamas and they don\u2019t live out in the sense. Activists and openly LGBTQ people are often perceived as having nefarious international agendas to spread and normalise homosexuality. They are marginalised from mainstream employment and other social and civic spaces, and young people who are LGBTQ reportedly are in many instances subjected to psychological, spiritual and physical violence at the hands of their parents, guardians, teachers, and peers.\n[13] These sources indicate that the LGBTQ people in the Bahamas have been subject to violence, including killings and physical attacks. And indeed, the claimants provided a substantial amount of detail about some of the violence that they experienced or their friends experienced in the Bahamas. Therefore, I find that the claimants have demonstrated a well-founded fear of persecution on both a subjective and objective basis. I find the claimants would face a serious possibility of persecution in the Bahamas based on their membership in a particular social group.\nState Protection and Internal Flight Alternative\n[14] I find that there is clear and convincing evidence in the documentation that the state is unable or unwilling to protect\u2026 to provide the claimants with adequate protection. Homosexuality was decriminalised in the Bahamas in 1991. However, the government officials have conceded that a significant stigma against homosexuality still persists and there is no official mechanism to document and monitor human rights violations and no recourse available to victims of discrimination and violence based on sexual orientation.\n[15] The objective evidence at item 6.1 of the NDP further indicates that there are no training programs or policies to counteract homophobia and sexual minorities do not have equal access to the law. There are also reports that the police insult and ridicule sexual minorities if they report crimes to them and their sexual orientation is discovered. Based on the totality of evidence, I find that, although there are some mixed evidence and some evidence of efforts by the state to make improvements, there continues to be an absence of operationally effective state protection available to sexual minorities such as the claimants.\n[16] Further, the objective evidence indicates at NDP item 5.3 that, in addition to the high levels of violence against women in the Bahamas, interlocutors noted that concern the apparent normalisation of violence against women and girls across the country. This normalisation of violence against women often leads to underreporting, as well as ridicule and stigmatisation of victims who do come forward. Ending such violence against women is one (1) of the most serious challenges facing the Bahamas today and where underreporting remains a concern reflecting a lack of trust in the justice system, as well as fear of ridicule and stigmatisation.\n[17] Given the absence of operationally effective state protection, as well as the small geographical size of the island country and the prevalence of homophobia and violence against sexual minorities and violence against women in the Bahamas, I find that the claimants would face a serious possibility of persecution throughout the Bahamas and it is not objectively reasonable in all the circumstances including those particular to the claimants for them to relocate. Accordingly, I find that there is no internal flight available to the claimants.\nCONCLUSION\n[18] For these reasons, I find that the claimants are Convention refugees under section 96 of the Act and I accept both of their claims. Thank you and thank you for sharing your experiences with me today.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

The claimant does not identify as a woman, but has a very feminine gender presentation.\n[4] Details of the claimant\u2019s allegations can be found in the Basis of Claim Form and attached Narrative at Exhibit Number 2.\n[5] In brief, the claimant has in Chile been harassed, attacked, verbally abused, and threatened in school and in public because of their appearance, mannerisms, and expressed gender and sexual identity. They studies make-up artistry and operated a business doing make-up for select clients.\n[6] They came to Canada and since then they have been involved in the LGBT community, and they have been open respecting their gender identity and expression.\n[7] They fear that if they return to Chile in order to be safe they would have to, once again, return to a partial or complete concealment of their genuine gender identity and sexual orientation because Chilean society is generally hostile to the queer community, and police and the State do not effectively protect that community.\nDetermination:\n[8] The claimant is a Convention refugee.\nANALYSIS:\nIdentity:\n[9] The claimant\u2019s personal identity and status as a citizen of Chile has been established by their testimony and their Chilean passport located at Exhibit Number 1. I am satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant is a citizen of Chile only.\nNexus:\n[10] The claim \u2026 the protection claim bears a nexus to the Convention, namely, membership in a particular social groups of gender fluid persons and persons with diverse sexual orientations. In this case, the claimant self-identified as gay or homosexual, and therefore I will assess the claim under Section 96.\nCredibility:\n[11] I find that the claimant is credible respecting their gender identity which is the crux of this case. I did not have to hear very much of the claimant\u2019s testimony today because the documentary evidence before is quite strong insofar it supports the claimant\u2019s identity in that respect.\n[12] There are ample support letters from \u2026 from friends, family, and members of the LGBT community in Canada attesting to the claimant\u2019s identity and their sexual orientation toward men.\n[13] There are ample photographs of the claimant\u2019s involvement in social activities within the LGBT community in Chile and in Canada. There are ample photographs corroborating the claimant\u2019s personal interest in the beauty industry, specifically make-up artistry, which the claimant has stated in their narrative is an important aspect of their gender identity and expression.\n[14] To state the obvious, the claimant presents, in person, with very long hair and a feminine appearance. Many of the photographs of the claimant in Chile depict them in public with short hair, little or no make-up, and what I would consider a limited or muted expression of their asserted gender identity.\n[15] Whereas, the photos of the claimant in Canada, where the claimant has indicated they feels safe and able to safely express their identity, show the claimant with very long hair and a much more feminine appearance, such as has been presented before the panel today.\n[16] I do not see this as any kind of inconsistency. Rather, I find the claimant\u2019s long hair and more feminine appearance now suggests that since arriving in Canada the claimant has been able to freely express and appear as they want.\n[17] The length of the hair suggests that the choice to appear too feminine has remained consistent since the claimant\u2019s arrival in Canada, and lends credence to the overall narrative that the claimant has been forced to conceal their true gender identity and their preferred expression in the past while living in Chile.\n[18] I draw no negative credibility inferences from the claimant\u2019s failure to claim protection in Europe or the USA before coming to Canada. The evidence in favour of the claimant\u2019s sorted gender identity overwhelms any negative credibility inference that may be drawn from a failure to claim protection elsewhere before coming to Canada.\n[19] In summary, I accept that the claimant is a gender fluid person, that he\u2019s attracted to men, that they are attracted to men, and I find that the claimant has a subjective fear of returning to Chile on that account.\nObjective Basis:\n[20] The objective evidence supports the claimant\u2019s subjective fears of returning to Chile.\n[21] The NDP found at Exhibit 3 indicates that violence and discrimination against the LGBTQ community continues to be prevalent throughout the country.\n[22] For example, the US Department of State report Item 2.1 of the NDP lists violence against lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex persons as a significant human rights issue in the country. It indicates that incidents of violence have increased 58 percent from 2018 to 2019, and the report also describes incidents of abuse perpetrated by the police in Chile.\n[23] Further, the report indicates that although there are laws prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation, police appear reluctant to use the full recourse of the anti-discrimination laws. And a survey found that a majority of LGBTQ \u2026 LGBTQ persons experienced discrimination in public services, especially with respect to police services, education, and healthcare.\n[24] This is also reflected in a 2018 UN report at Item 2.6 of the NDP. That report expresses concerns specifically about the reports of violence perpetrated by State agents against lesbian, bisexual, and transgender women.\n[25] Further, the report indicates that there is persistent discrimination against LGBTQ persons, particularly in the areas of employment, education, and health services.\n[26] There\u2019s another report by Freedom House at Item 2.4, and that indicates that while the government in Chile is taking some steps to pass anti-discrimination laws, LGBTQ persons continue to face severe and significant social bias.\n[27] The claimant has also provided country condition documents to support their claim. Those are found at Exhibit Number 4.\n[28] There are numerous news articles documenting recent violence, including murders against the LGBT community in Chile. Those news articles also refer to violent crimes perpetrated by the police. And there\u2019s another article referencing arise in anti-LGBT violence in recent years. And all of this supplements and aligns with the evidence in the NDP.\n[29] Of course, the claimant\u2019s own experiences as documented in their narrative of harassment and abuse in Chile reflect the objective evidence that I\u2019ve noted above.\n[30] Base on the totality of this evidence I find that the claimant has established an objective basis for their subjective fear of persecution in Chile based on their membership in the particular social groups of gender fluid queer persons and persons of diverse sexual orientations.\nState Protection:\n[31] With respect to violence and discrimination against the LGBT community, the objective evidence supports my finding that there is no operationally effective State protection available to the claimant in their particular circumstances.\n[32] In fact, as I\u2019ve noted the police are often the perpetrators of violence against the LGBTQ community, and the situation has not been shown to approving. In fact, it\u2019s been indicated to have been worsening in recent years. And so I find that the claimant has rebutted the presumption of State protection in this case.\nInternal Flight Alternative:\n[33] I\u2019ve considered whether there\u2019s an IFA available to the claimant in Chile. The evidence supports that there\u2019s a serious possibility of persecution for the claimant throughout the whole of the country.\n[34] There\u2019s evidence of a deep rooted prejudice \u2026 prejudice against the LGBT community in Chile, and the significant violence against the community in Chile supports that finding.\n[35] There\u2019s no good evidence before me to support a finding that the situation for gender diverse individuals might be more palatable in any other part of the country, other than where the claimant is from.\n[36] And based on the totality of the evidence I conclude there is no viable IFA in this case. The claimant would \u2026 would face a separate of persecution throughout the whole of the country.\nCONCLUSION:\n[37] For the reasons above I determine that the claimant is a Convention refugee under Section 96 of the Act, and therefore I accepted the claim before the panel today.\n[38] So, congratulations to the claimant.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

He received numerous threats and encountered several incidences of discrimination, due to his sexuality, while living in Trinidad and Tobago. The claimant was afraid of going out in public in order to avoid any confrontations or threats. In addition, the claimant could not access hormone therapy treatment and has been unable to change his gender marker, which makes circumstances where identification is necessary, problematic. The claimant also spoke out publicly about trans rights at a pride parade and was shamed and victimized in a subsequent news article. The claimant changed his name in 2017. The claimant left Trinidad and Tobago on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2019, entering Canada as a visitor. He fears returning to Trinidad and Tobago where he cannot live openly as a transgender man.\nDETERMINATION\n[5] I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the Act, for the reasons that follow.\n[6] The claimant\u2019s identity today has been established, on a balance of probabilities, from a certified copy of his passport on file and I find that he has established his identity as a citizen of Trinidad and Tobago.\n[7] In terms of credibility, XXXX, you were an entirely credible witness today, despite your concerns about not being understood. I found your testimony to be forthcoming and direct and straightforward. You testified to far more details of your story than what was contained in your Basis of Claim form and you shared that you had filled the form out yourself and have only recently retained counsel.\n[8] So, I don\u2019t draw a negative inference from anything that you left out of your Basis of Claim, as I do not find that these were omissions that in any way detracted from your credibility. Rather, you provided me with spontaneous details about your story without (inaudible) any prompting from me.\n[9] For example, you told me about the experience you had on your tenth (10) birthday where you looked in the mirror and realized that you just did not feel right.\n[10] You testified about coming out to your friends, some of whom were not surprised and your family, who you described as not the worst but at the same time, that they spent a great deal of time making you feel guilty for who you are and trying to convince you to change. You testified about attending the first public pride event in Trinidad and Tobago in 2018 and how you spontaneously decided to stand up and speak publicly about trans rights specifically. And then a newspaper reporter interviewed you and then published an article in which you were referred to incorrectly as a transwoman.\n[11] After this article was published and went live, you went online and realized that there were several hateful comments posted about you, many of which advocated for violence against you.\n[12] Your counsel initially asked for a postponement today to provide additional documents, which I decided ultimately was unnecessary, as I had sufficient evidence before me to accept your claim.\n[13] I have a copy of your birth certificate showing that you were born female with the name XXXX XXXX and I have a copy of your legal name changed documents, which were completed in 2017, when you turned XXXX. I also have a copy of a report from a XXXX in Canada, confirming that you suffer from various XXXX health issues, as well as XXXX XXXX and that letter indicated that you would be beginning hormone replacement therapy and that was in 2019. And so today, you testified that you\u2019ve now been on testosterone for two (2) years and will be undergoing a XXXX soon.\n[14] And so, based on the documents that I have and your credible testimony today, I accept your allegations. I believe that you are a transgender male and that you\u2019re telling the truth about everything that has happened to you.\n[15] And so, I must assess whether your allegations forma well-founded fear of persecution and in this case, I find that there is a Nexus to the Convention ground of membership in a particular social group, namely a sexual orientation.\n[16] I accept that you have established a subjective fear of returning to Trinidad and Tobago, where you feel that you would not be able to live openly and safely as a gay trans man.\n[17] You testified that you fear for your mental health, if you had to return and essentially, 1ive in hiding out of fear. You testified to feeling suicidal on many occasions and that conversely in Canada, you feel more accepted and that it feels like home.\n[18] I have reviewed the objective evidence and I find that it does support your allegations and I\u2019ll just go through a few of those documents.\n[19] And so, according to document 2.5 of the National Documentation Package, this is a document called Human Rights in the Americas, it states that a landmark judgement from a high court in 2018, decriminalized sexual activity between consenting adults of the same-sex. However, the government appealed the judgement, saying that it intends to have its voice heard by the country\u2019s highest appellate court, the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the UK. To date, there remains no legal protection against discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. In the NGO coalition advocating for inclusion of sexual orientation, Trinidad and Tobago received reports of incidents of discrimination and violence directed towards LGBTI people and this is also confirmed in the U.S. Department of State report, document 2.1, which confirms that as of November, the government\u2019s appeal of the court ruling was still pending.\n[20] I\u2019ve also reviewed the most recent Freedom House report at document 2.3, which states that discrimination against LGBTI people is widespread, affecting their ability to fully engage in political and electoral processes. Human rights groups have criticized the government\u2019s unwillingness to address discrimination and violence against the LGBTI community.\n[21] I\u2019ve also reviewed a Response to Information report that was prepared by the Board. It states that gay pride has technically been celebrated in Trinidad and Tobago for almost 20 years. However, these celebrations were neither outdoors nor public until very recently. According to the same source, there are numerous gay events within Carnival masquerade, but they are not publicly advertised. The report further states that sexual minorities faced discrimination in employment, education and housing. The report outlines cases of homophobic discrimination of youths within the education system, including youths being subjected to name calling and verbal abuse by schoolmates, teacher-led bullying, physical assaults and in some cases, suggested reparative therapy by school officials and basically a daily pattern of harassment. Sources indicate that the country\u2019s Constitution Reform Commission acknowledged that there is a high level of violence and abuse against LGBTI people and that they have faced bullying, physical assaults, verbal assaults and abuse in their homes and schools and by the general public.\n[22] And so, after reviewing the evidence, I find that while the court\u2019s ruling was clearly a step forward for the LGBTI community in Trinidad and Tobago, the pending appeal by the government, not only indicates that the ruling may not have any impact in practice, it also raises doubts as to the durability and overall effectiveness of this change in law.\n[23] In this case, the claimant cannot live openly as a transgender male without risk of discrimination with threats of violence.\n[24] Hormone replacement therapy is not available, and you cannot change your gender marker on your passport or other identification, which essentially forces you to identify as a female incorrectly.\n[25] And so, I find that the accumulative incidents of discrimination, coupled with the threats to your life and the inability to live openly, do amount to persecution.\n[26] Based on the totality of the evidence, I find that you would face a serious possibility of persecution in Trinidad and Tobago, due to your sexual orientation.\n[27] I have reviewed whether there would be any state protection available to you and I find that it would not be forthcoming.\n[28] For example, Amnesty International reports on the failure of the government to confront the issues of violence against LGBTI people. It refers to the failure to produce anywhere recommendations on achieving equality or preventing discrimination, despite acknowledging the high level of violence and abuse against LGBTI people in the country.\n[29] The Equal Opportunity Act protects against discrimination in areas of education and employment, but this does not extend protection to sexual minorities.\n[30] Many sources report that sexual minorities who have been victims of violence are hesitant to report incidents to police, out of fear of negative response by police and court officials.\n[31] I also note Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9, which indicates that the decriminalization of same-sex relations or sexual or gender non-conforming behaviours or the introduction to a new law, programmer (ph) of the government, which is designed to improve a situation, individuals with diverse sexual orientation need to be carefully assessed in order to determine whether state protection is adequate at the operational level, as a result of these new laws.\n[32] And so, as a decision maker, I need to examine the degree of the actual implementation of this law, its effectiveness and its credibility, in light of how state actors and general society continues to treat LGBTI individuals.\n[33] I find in this case there is insufficient evidence that the recent material change in the law translates into adequate state protection of LGBTI individuals, given the substantial evidence of police corruption and the unwillingness of authorities to address the protection needs of this community and this is particularly the case, given the government\u2019s own appeal of the court ruling.\n[34] And so, I find that in this case, the claimant has rebutted the presumption of state protection.\n[35] Finally, I find there is no internal flight alternative available, given the serious possibility of persecution throughout Trinidad and Tobago for LGBTI persons.\n[36] And so, in conclusion, I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the Act, and the Immigration and Refugee Board therefore accepts his claim.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

Her family had done their best when it came at first to \u201ctreating\u201d the claimant with hormones to later supporting her, for who she is. The claimant has campaigned since her youth to educate and promote acceptance among children and the community. She continued studying education to support her passion in anti\u00adbullying and inclusivity. The claimant decided to leave Mexico after her father had passed away, losing both of her parents, who were here \u201cpillars\u201d of support helped her to decide to move to a country that would accept her and let her live a peaceful life.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\/Country of Reference Mexico\n[6] The panel is satisfied on a balance of probabilities, in the claimant\u2019s identity and his citizenship, considering the certified copy of Mexico passport on file.4\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution\n[7] The claimant fears persecution due to her membership in a particular social group, due to her sexual orientation and gender identity. The duty of this panel is to find if there is sufficient credible or trustworthy evidence to determine that there is more than a mere possibility that this claimant would be persecuted if she returned to Mexico.\n[8] The claimant testified in a very genuine, straightforward, emotional, and unassuming manner. She was passionate about her educational activities, she provided photos and testimony about the events in question.5 She spoke about her challenges and violence directed towards due to her gender identity. She submitted support letters, attesting to her personal history and her socially non\u00adconforming gender identity.\n[9] According the Repot on Human Rights Conditions of Transgender Women:\nDespite the legal changes for same-sex couples in recent years, transgender women in Mexico still face pervasive persecution based on their gender identity and expression. Indeed, violence against LGBT people has actually increased, with transgender women bearing the brunt of this escalation. Changes in the laws have made the LGBT communities more visible to the public and more vulnerable to homophobic and transphobic violence. Increased visibility has actually increased public misperceptions and false stereotypes about the gay and transgender communities. This has produced fears about these communities, such as that being gay or transgender is \u201ccontagious\u201d or that all transgender individuals are HIV positive. These fears have in turn led to hate crimes and murders of LGBT people, particularly transgender women.6\nNegative attitudes towards the LGBT community remain very common in Mexico.165 Homophobic and transphobic comments from public figures, such as former President Felipe Calderon, diminish the quality and dignity of transgender women\u2019s lives by perpetuating widespread hatred and violence. There is also a nationwide backlash against advances in LGBT rights, resulting in increased levels of persecution against transgender women who tend to be the most visible and marginalized members of the LGBT community.7\n[10] Transgender women lack adequate healthcare in Mexico, many hide their transgender status to avoid hostility or threats from medical practitioners. There almost no availability of medical care for gender transition.8 The lack of positive protections on the basis of gender identity, leave transgender women vulnerable to employment discrimination. Few transgender women are able to sufficiently support themselves and end up resorting to sex work to survive, which results in yet more violence.9 Given the significant infringements upon the basic human rights of transgender women, the panel finds that evidence before it, establishes a systemic and pervasive treatment of transgender women, amounts to persecution.\n[11] Given the claimant\u2019s credibility as to her gender identity and the unequivocal country condition evidence of the treatment of individuals similar to the claimant, the panel finds the claimant would face more than a serious possibility of persecution if she were to return to Mexico.\nState Protection\n[12] State protection would not be reasonably forthcoming in this particular case. The panel has reviewed the country condition evidence of the situation of those with diverse SOGIE in Mexico and does recognize the Federal and some state protections in place.\n[13] In response to the growing public profile of sexual and gender minorities:\nSome Mexican communities have explicitly targeted transgender women by enacting morality laws that criminalize \u201ccross-dressing.\u201d Local transgender women reported a dramatic increase in police harassment following the law\u2019s passage. Transgender women stopped by the police frequently faced extortion; \u201c[t]he police used\u2026 the threat of arrest\u2026 to secure money or sexual favors from [transgender women]. The passage of morality laws like those in Tecate criminalizes transgender women and sanctions police harassment and private discrimination. The passage and retention of these laws reflect continued societal hostility towards transgender people.10\n[14] Persons seeking protection from harassment and violence are routinely re-victimized by police their claims downplayed. Regular harassment by police is also reported. LGBTIQ+ individuals are frequently beaten, mocked, and forced to pay bribes in order to escape custody and in the recent years, have also reported physical assaults against them.11\n[15] Despite the existence of these formal protections around sexual orientation, advocates maintain that these laws have not prevented discrimination and violence. LGBT individuals face many barriers in exercising their rights under the antidiscrimination statutes. LGBT individuals who experience discrimination may be afraid to disclose their sexual orientation or gender identity to a federal agency and may be concerned about potential retaliation by public officials. This concern is especially relevant since the law does not have a clear enforcement mechanism or any provision that protects against retaliation.12\n[16] Considering the lack of any positive respect for the rights of LGBTIQ+ persons, and numerous reports of mistreatment of those persons with diverse SOGIE by law enforcement in evidence, the panel finds there is clear and convincing evidence that claimant, or persons similarly situated to the claimant, are unable to obtain adequate state protection.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[17] The first prong of this assessment is to determine on a balance of probabilities if there is a serious possibility of persecution in the internal flight alternative (IFA) or no risk to life, cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or danger of torture in the IFA.\n[18] The situation for individuals with diverse SOGIE is prevalent throughout Mexico. Although there are support groups in the larger centers in particular Mexico City, they have little impact in assisting members from violence or harassment. Negative attitudes towards the LGBT community remain very common in Mexico. Homophobic and transphobic comments from public figures, such as former President Felipe Calderon, diminish the quality and dignity of transgender women\u2019s lives by perpetuating widespread hatred and violence. There is also a nationwide backlash against advances in LGBT rights, resulting in increased levels of persecution against transgender women who tend to be the most visible and marginalized members of the LGBT community.13\n[19] Although Mexico City, has been making serious efforts in assisting transgender women, including in documentation and identity changes, Mexico City also leads Mexico in the number or missing and murdered transgender women in Mexico. Considering, the evidence before this panel, there is no place in Mexico where the claimant would not face a serious possibility of persecution.\nCONCLUSION\n[20] For the foregoing reasons, the panel concludes that the claimant is a Convention refugee and therefore accepts her claim. As the claim is accepted pursuant to Section 96 of the Act, there is no need to assess the claim made under Section 97(1)(b).\n(signed) J.

The claimant also fears persecution due to her agnosticism.\n[6] The claimant submits in her allegations of her conflict of wanting live as a woman but being unable to do so in Pakistan. She also submits her lack of adherence and belief in Islam was known by her family but unacknowledged and unspoken about.\n[7] The claimant left Pakistan in XXXX 2016 to study in Canada. During her time in school in Vancouver the claimant became more open bout her gender and started coming out to friends an living as XXXX XXXX. In 2019 the claimant told her parents, but they were not supportive and reuse to accept her gender identity and has not had further communication with her father since.\n[8] The claimant now lives opening on social media but is a self-described introvert that infrequently socializes and has few friends in Vancouver. The claimant filed for protection and filed and signed her BOC September 2020.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\/Country of Reference Pakistan\n[9] The panel is satisfied on a balance of probabilities, in the claimant\u2019s identity and citizenship, considering the certified copy of the current Pakistan passport.5\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution\n[10] The claimant fears persecution due to her membership in a particular social group, as a person with non-conforming gender identity. The duty of this panel is to find if there is sufficient credible or trustworthy evidence to determine that there is more than a mere possibility that this claimant would be persecuted.\n[11] LGBTIQ+ is an umbrella term for the community of lesbian, homosexual, bisexual, non\u00ad heterosexual, transgender, non-binary, intersex, and queer people. The rights of LGBTIQ+ people are the same as human rights. There is not a single right that is inherent to transgender persons the issue lies in the ability to enjoy those rights freely and fully. The inequality of opportunities and access can manifest themselves at different levels, i.e., legal restrictions and social practices.\n[12] The country condition evidence before this panel, report that transgender woman, face discrimination in housing, education, medical care. Transgender people face harassment, mistreatment, and exclusion from society. Numerous incidents of violence, honour crimes and sexual violence is experienced by transgender people in Pakistan. Although authorities recognize transgender people including documenting individuals as a third gender as requested, there is little to no evidence that this recognition has diminished discrimination in society for this minority group.6\n[13] The panel finds, the country condition evidence clearly establishes that in Pakistan the basic human rights of persons of diverse gender identities are disregarded at all levels of society. The targeting of individuals even believed to be gay is an accepted practice by society and the state, given the increasing levels of violence and the impunity given to the perpetrators by the state. The panel further find that LBGTIQ+ persons, because of the current situation in Pakistan, are unable to live openly without fear of reprisals from the general public or the state. Persons of diverse gender identities have substantive violations against their right to life (Article 6), their right to prohibition of torture and cruelty, and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment (Article 7), their right to liberty and security of the person (Article 9), their right to freedom from discrimination (Articles 2 and 26) and their right to freedom of assembly and association (Articles 21 and 22).7 Given the significant infringements upon the basic human rights of these individuals, the panel finds this systemic and pervasive treatment of sexual minorities in Pakistan does amount to persecution.\n[14] The panel accepts the claimant\u2019s personal identity as a transgender woman, who lives openly here in Canada and has been open with her friends and family. The panel further notes, the claimant is outspoken with her anti-religious and gender opinions. Given the claimant\u2019s credibility as to her identity, and the unequivocal country condition evidence of the treatment of individuals similar to the claimant, the panel finds the claimant would face more than a serious possibility of persecution.\nState Protection\n[15] The panel must determine whether the claimant has access to state protection. The objective evidence before the panel is the Pakistan authorities routinely \u2013 intimidate, harass, and mock transgender complainants. There are reports of persons being illegally arrested by the police using provisions of the law that criminalize same sex relationships and they have been charged with cases related to defying the order of nature (unnatural offence against the order of nature), public nascence [sic], unnatural offences and indecent assault.8It is reported in the evidence that sexual minorities are discriminated and victimized by police.9 On the whole, the panel finds that in the case of the claimant it would be objectively unreasonable for her to approach authorities for her protection and therefore state protection is sufficiently rebutted in this case.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[16] The evidence before this panel is that discrimination and persecution of transgender persons is pervasive throughout Pakistan. Although pocket communities exist in large centres10, the panel finds these are nothing more than ghettoization of this vulnerable minority community. Considering the country condition evidence there is nowhere in Pakistan where the claimant could relocate and not continue to face more than a mere possibility of persecution for her identity, therefore the panel finds that there is no viable internal flight alternative for the claimant.\nCONCLUSION\n[17] For the foregoing reasons, the panel concludes that the claimant is a Convention refugee and therefore accepts her claim. As the claim is accepted pursuant to Section 96 of the Act, there is no need to assess the claim made under Section 97(1)(b).\n(signed) J.

I would like to give you the option of how you want to hear my reasons for decision. Would you prefer that I read everything, and Mister Interpreter would summarize for you? Or would you prefer a line-by-line interpretation? Or would you also prefer that I read everything in English, and then you can confer at the end of the hearing with your counsel and interpreter?\n[2] CLAIMANT: The last option, I agree with that one.\n[3] MEMBER: So, I read everything out in English, and then when we are done, you confer with Mister Interpreter and your counsel, correct? Okay, so I will proceed to read the Panel\u2019s reason for decisions today. So, this is a decision for the claimant, XXXX XXXX, who also goes by the name of XXXX (ph) XXXX XXXX You are claiming to be a citizen of Iran and claiming refugee protection, pursuant to s. 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. You identify as a transgender man, and prefer the \u2018he\u2019, \u2018him\u2019 pronouns, as well as the male name, XXXX, rather than your legal first name, XXXX. Although your identity documentation reflects your birth as a female, your preferred pronouns will be used in this decision.\n[4] In rendering in this decision, the Panel has applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guidelines on sexual orientation and gender identity, and the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline on women refugee claimants. The Panel has considered your testimony and other evidence in the case, and it is ready to render the decision orally.\nDetermination\n[5] The Panel finds that you are a Conventional refugee, pursuant to s. 96 of the IRPA, as there exists a serious possibility of persecution, should you return to Iran, on account of your membership of a particular social group, specifically as a transgender man in Iran. You alleged that you are a citizen of Iran, you self-identify as a transgender. You were born female, however, you allege that you have never associated with being female, and that, at first, you identified as being transgender when you turned XXXX. You also stated that in your early years, in your teenage years, you were attracted to a girl who was older than you, and that was your first recollection of your friendship. And in middle school, you were taught religion and life, where you were taught that feelings for the same sex is haram, and punishable by death. You further alleged that your family was in denial about your agenda, and this made you feel very hot, and you stopped making eye contact with people in school, but the shaming and hostility never disappeared. You allege that you had to identify as a woman in order to obtain employment in Iran, and that you have also lost jobs because of your failure to adhere to gender norms. You state that you have been arrested twice, and you are not safe in Iran.\n[6] You further allege that after graduation, you were determined on leaving Iran, and you immediately started studying English and taking the IELT\u2019s courses. You started searching and applying to different colleges in Canada, and after getting admitted to XXXX College in XXXX of 2019, you applied for a study permit. And in XXXX of 2019, you were refused. In XXXX of 2020, you received your Canadian student visa. You allege that if you return to Iran, you would not be able to exercise your basic human rights, as you would not be able to live life as you want, or dress as you want. You fear you be stoned or killed in Iran. Your persona) identity as a citizen of Iran has been established by your testimony and the Iranian passport with Canadian visa. The Panel finds that on a balance of probabilities that your identity and country of reference have been established, and the Panel is satisfied of your identity and that you are a citizen of Iran. The Panel has also considered this claim under s. 96 of the IRPA. I will conclude that the risk you face constitutes persecution, based on at least one of the grounds prescribed in the Refugee Convention. Specifically, your membership in a particular social group as a transgender man in Iran.\n[7] In terms of credibility, you gave your evidence in a clear and direct manner. At the hearing, you testified that you realize that you were different since you were a child but learned a lot about being a transgender male at XXXX, when you had a teammate who was transgender. You spoke about your experiences growing up in Iran and how you first realized that you were attracted to XXXX (ph), who you met at the university dormitory and became your roommate. You testified that you had a relationship with her for four years, and lived together at the dormitory, and later in a rented apartment. You testified to knowing a few other transgender people in your country, including your best friend, XXXX (ph). You further testified that you had to move away from the dormitory in order to prevent harm when XXXX was threatened. You testified that Iran issues trans certificate to individuals in certain circumstances. When asked if you attempted to procure one, you stated \u201cNo\u201d, as that would require permission from your father, who did not like the idea of you cutting your hair and would not have agreed to permission to procure the certificate. You testified that since coming to Canada, you have been involved in the LGBTQ community, particularly with the 519 LGBTQ community, where you have participated in programs organized, and have been a part of resume writing workshop, and you further testified that you have started the process of gender reassignment by taking testosterone. You further stated that you feel free in Canada and do not feel at risk in Canada, as there is freedom for members of the LGBTQ community. You also submitted evidence to corroborate your claim. This includes letters of support from XXXX XXXX (ph), XXXX XXXX (ph), XXXX (ph) XXXX (ph), and XXXX (ph). You also included picture of LGBTQ physical activity program event by 519.\n[8] There were no material inconsistencies or contradictions within your evidence that were not reasonably explained, or that undermined your credibility. Based on the presumption of truthfulness, your consistent testimony and the corroborative evidence provided by you in this claim, the Panel accepts you as transgender. The Panel finds that you have a well-founded fear of persecution, based on your sexual orientation as a transgender male. You were arrested twice when you were XXXX, and you father had to come and release you, and also in 2017, when you had to pay a bribe to be released. You were forced to hide your sexual orientation and your relationship with XXXX, and you took many precautions to keep your yourself out of harm\u2019s way. The Panel therefore finds that your subjective fear is established by your credible testimony, and the Panel believes what you have alleged on a balance of probabilities. Given that there are no serious credibility issues with respect to your allegation, coupled with the consistent manner you have testified, as well as documentary evidence set out below, the Panel finds that you have established a prospective risk of being subjected to detention, imprisonment, or other actions, for charges related to your status as a transgender man in Iran.\n[9] The allegation of risk is corroborated by the following document in the National Documentation Package, NDP for Iran, dated April of 2021. The objective evidence demonstrates that individuals who are transgender face treatment in Iran that amounts to persecution. NDP 6.6 states that a report produced by Outright Action International in October, 2016, titled, \u201cBeing Transgender in Iran\u201d stated the following. \u201cThe Iranian government officially uses the term \u2018gender identity disorder\u2019 to describe trans people. Although the medicalization of issues related to gender identity has allowed for some legal recognition for members of the trans community, it has also reinforced the stigma rooted in the notion that trans individuals suffer from psychological and sexual disorder and require treatment to become \u2018normal\u2019. Since the state and many members of the medical community see being trans as a disease, they regard trans experience as a condition to be \u2018cured\u2019 through medical transitional processes such as hormone replacement, therapy, and surgery. Iranian law allows for the legal recognition of trans individuals\u2019 gender identity; however, such recognition is only granted to individuals officially diagnosed with GID, and upon their successful completion of a long process of legal and medical transition. The government\u2019s position has led some observers to conclude that Iran is progressive on trans rights. While there are positive aspects to the government\u2019s policies, trans Iranians continue to face serious discrimination and abuse by both law and practice, and they are rarely treated as equal members of the society. Iranian law fails to recognize the gender identity of any individual who is not granted access, does not wish, or cannot afford to pursue the GCS. This deprives many of legal recognition and render them particularly vulnerable to harassment and discrimination.\u201d\n[10] NDP 6.5 further states, \u201cAs a result, trans individuals in Iran who do not wish to pursue medical transition processes, who cannot afford such processes, or who wish to pursue some forms of medical gender transition but not others, are wholly deprived of legal identity recognition and face severe barriers to maintaining and pursuing education, to accessing housing and employment, and to moving freely and safely through society. The law does not recognize such trans individuals, nor does it provide space or legal recognition for individuals who identify across or outside of the gender binary.\u201d In this case, you testified that you were not able to pursue a medical transition process in Iran, because you were not able to obtain the consent of your father. You are thus prohibited from living openly as a transgendered person in Iran and are subject to risks set out above. On this basis, and as such, the Panel finds that there is a serious possibility of persecution, should you be returned to Iran. The Panel therefore finds that you have established, on a balance of probabilities, a subjective fear of persecution in Iran due to your membership to a particular social group, namely as a transgendered man in Iran. In this case, in terms of state protection, the agents of the persecution is the state, as the persecution you will face, should you return to Iran, is at the hands of the authorities. This is evidenced in your past encounters with the police, twice at 16, and also in 2017. Accordingly, the Panel finds that there is no state protection for you.\n[11] The Panel also has considered whether there is a viable internal flight alternative for you. On the evidence before the Panel and given that the agent of persecution is the state, and the state has effective control over the entire country, the Panel finds that there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout Iran, and the Panel finds that there is no viable internal flight alternative for you in Iran.\n[12] In conclusion, based on the totality of evidence, including your narrative, the testimony, and supporting documents, the Panel finds you to be a Conventional refugee and therefore accepts your claim. Thank you very much. Carrie (ph), any words from you?\n[13] UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: That concludes our hearing here today. I want to thank you very much for participating in this hearing, and I want to welcome you to Canada. So, what we are going to do now is we are going to stop the recording, and then we will disconnect the proceedings.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013\n",

        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2021 RLLR 10\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: November 23, 2021\nPanel: Lesley Stalker\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Kerry Molitor\nCountry: India\nRPD Number: VC1-05726\nAssociated RPD Number(s):\nATIP Number: A-2022-00665\nATIP Pages: 000027-000033\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: This is a Bench Decision in the claim for refugee protection of XXXX XXXX. You are a citizen of India and are claiming refugee protection pursuant to Section 96 and Subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nAllegations\n[2] Your claim is based on your sexual orientation. You fear persecution in India at the hands of your family, the extended Muslim community and the Indian society and police at large because of your sexual orientation or your sexual identity. Given the nature of your claim, I have considered and applied the IRB\u2019s Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9 on sexual orientation and gender identity and expression, these are commonly known as the SOGIE guidelines.\nDetermination\n[3] I find that you face a serious risk of persecution in India because of your sexual orientation. My reasons are as follows.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[4] I am satisfied as to your identity on the basis of the various identity documents that you have filed. These include your passport, your Aadhar or identity card, your voter card as well as other identity documents.\nNexus\n[5] As your claim is linked to your sexual identity, I find that the harm you fear has a nexus to the convention ground of particular social group. I therefore assessed your claim under Section 96 of the Act.\nCredibility\n[6] The next question is whether I find your story to be credible and I do. You have provided a detailed Basis of Claim narrative which explained how you came to realize that you were not female, the sex which had been assigned to you at birth but rather were male. This created confusion for you as you tried to figure out who you were. Your cousins suggested that perhaps you were lesbian but you disagreed. You felt that you were a boy who was in a girl\u2019s body. You could not turn to your parents or siblings for guidance or support. Your parents are devout Muslims and very conservative in their beliefs and in their cultural practices.\n[7] You described\u2026 you described your father\u2019s efforts to control your behavior with violence, hitting you with bricks, and even administering electric shocks to punish behaviors that he deemed were inappropriate. You were able to confide in one cousin in particular, XXXX (ph) and in the woman you loved, XXXX. You described the pain you experienced when XXXX was forced to marry another man. You could never publicly declare your love for her because you were in the eyes of society a woman.\n[8] Moreover, your families would never have accepted the marriage as your family was Muslim and hers was Hindu. There were a number of times in the hearing when you became quite emotional. You described having to live a suffocated life and being trapped in a body that was not yours. You described your ongoing struggle with gender dysphoria and the pain of not being able to openly tell your family who you are. Your family expected you as a woman to behave in a certain way. They demanded that you wear the burqa as do you mother and your sisters. When you were 20 you told them that you were no longer willing to wear the burqa but this resulted in such conflict that at times you wore the burqa and took it off after leaving the home.\n[9] Your BOC and testimony reflect strong Indian cultural values relating the interaction between individuals and their families. When I asked you why you did not walk away from your family when they refused to respect your choices, you said, where would I go. Your BOC describes an incident in which you remained in the doorstep of your home throughout the night after your father had locked you out. And when I asked you why you did not simply go elsewhere, you said that you did not dare expose your parents to the shame of the rift between you and them.\n[10] When asked whether you know any transmen who were living openly in India, you said you know of two. You said their situation was somewhat unique. Their families are supportive of them and their assistance has enabled the men to survive openly. That is not the case for most transmen who did not have the support of their families. You provided a number of documents to corroborate your claim. These include, one, the detailed XXXX assessment from XXXX XXXX XXXX who diagnosed you as suffering from persistent XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX reports that you showed clinical degree of XXXX associated with memories of India and says that you are at risk of a complete XXXX collapse and suicide should you be required to return to India. Two, a letter from the ASAAP, a Toronto-based organization which assists LGBTQ persons from South Asia. This letter describes you as a valued member of their community and records your participation in various activities and services offered by the organization.\n[11] Three, a letter from XXXX, the woman with whom you had a relationship in India. XXXX says that it was dangerous for her to write the letter but felt it important to do so. She said she has known you for close to 15 years. She described you as having \u201ca husky voice and manly personality\u201d and said that you have always been drawn to females in a sexual manner. She says that you told her that you were a transman, a concept which was completely unknown to her. She says that the concept of transsexuality is \u201cnew in India and is regarded as a crime, disease or abnormality.\u201d She says that your family are very religious and traditional and could never accept that you are a man who needs to change his body.\n[12] Four, a letter from your cousin XXXX (ph), who says that you were very close to each other from childhood on. XXXX (ph) says that even as a child you behaved as a boy. Neither of you was familiar with the concept of trans males at that time, but it was not a surprise to him when you told him you were in fact a boy trapped in a girl\u2019s body. He also confirms that your family is extremely traditional and would never accept that you are not satisfied with the body that was given to you by god. And finally, you provided a letter from XXXX, a friend who is from a similar ethnic background and is like you transitioning from female to male here in Canada. Madura refers to your discussions about your gender dysphoria and your plans to begin your gender transition. I should not say to begin your gender transitions, your plans as to how you will transition.\n[13] Given your credible testimony and the corroborative documents, I accept your evidence about your gender identity. I further accept that you were born into a conservative Muslim family and that your family and the community from which you come hold very traditional notions of sex and gender. I further find that your father in particular has used violence against you and other members of the family to punish behaviors that he deems unacceptable.\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution and Subjective Fear\n[14] So having considered your evidence, I accept that you have a subjective fear of persecution including serious physical violence or death in India because of your sexual identity.\nObjective Basis\n[15] The next question I must consider is whether there is an objective basis to your fear of harm, and after reviewing the country reports filed by your Counsel and the reports from the IRB\u2019s National Documentation Package on India, I find there is. I will begin by referring to some of the changes in law affecting LGBTQ rights in India. In 2018, the Supreme Court of India decriminalized same-sex relationships and issued a judicial apology to the Indian LGBTQ community. This decision marked a significant step in the journey towards the full equality of LGBTQ persons.\n[16] Of particular relevance to the case or situation of trans persons, in 2014, the Indian Supreme Court affirmed the link between gender identity and other human rights. The court emphasized that it was the individual not the State who should determine one\u2019s gender. This decision was followed by another in 2015, when the Delhi High Court wrote, \u201ca transgender person\u2019s sense or experience of gender is integral to their core personality and sense of being, in so far as I understand the law everyone has a fundamental right to be recognized in their chosen gender.\u201d The decisions of the Indian courts are encouraging and they herald a chance in a society that has had difficulty accepting unusual or different approaches to sexuality and gender. The court decisions have had some effect.\n[17] The Immigration and Refugee Board Response to Information Request on the treatment of sexual minorities found at Tab 6.1 of the NDP says that after the decriminalization of same-sex sexual relations, there was a surge of pro-LGBTQ events and campaigns across the country. Most major cities saw Pride events taking place on a larger scale and an estimated 15000 people participated in the Queer Azadi Mumbai Pride Parade, and yet, LGBTQ persons continue to face severe discrimination and persecution on a day-to-day basis. The US Department of State report on Human Rights for 2020 found at Tab 2.1 of the NDP, says that LGBTI persons faced physical attacks, rape and blackmail as well as widespread societal discrimination and violence.\n[18] The report also say that transgender persons continue to face difficulty obtaining medical treatment and face particular challenges with the police. The IRB Response to Information Request at Tab 6.1 of the NDP similarly reports that social rejection of queer sexuality remains widespread. The RIR refers to a 2018 report of the International Commission of Jurists, the ICJ, who wrote that the \u201ctransgender community is continually harassed, stigmatized and abused by the police, judges, their family, and society.\u201d The ICJ report of 2019 says that LGBTI persons face extensive rights violations in relation to housing and within the home.\n[19] This includes discrimination in the rental market, denial of housing, segregation into poorly resourced neighborhoods and violence and harassment from landlords, neighbors, friends, family and the police. The result is widespread homelessness. The ICJ also says that LGBTI persons, I am using the acronym the ICJ uses, says that the community faces discrimination and persecution at all stages of the employment process and this includes unequal access to educational opportunities, discrimination during recruitment and discriminatory and gender work conditions, Jack of job security and so forth. And this accords with your own account of having been fired by your employer when you revealed that you were a transman.\n[20] The ICJ report emphasizes the vulnerability of trans persons who as a result of systemic discrimination are often affectively segregated into localities that Jack basic amenities even if they have the economic capacity to afford better housing. In 2019, India\u2019s central government passed a law which in theory is supposed to protect the rights of trans persons. However, the law has been widely condemned by human rights organizations who note that the law denies to transgender people the right to identify their own gender or sex. Rather, trans persons must first apply for a \u201ctransgender certificate\u201d from the district magistrate where they live. Once they have received this certificate they can then apply for a change in gender certificate.\n[21] This second certificate, the gender certificate signals to authorities that they should change the person\u2019s gender to male or female. The problem is that the second step requires the person to provide proof of surgery issued by a hospital official to the district magistrate for a second evaluation, and the issuing official must be satisfied with the correctness of such a certificate. This puts an extraordinary amount of power with one government office to arbitrate who qualifies to be recognized as who they say they are. This process also coerces people into medical procedures that they might not want including surgery, and this is a fundamental rights violation condemned by both Indian and international jurisprudence.\n[22] There are other problems associated with the law including the fact that it guarantees trans persons the right to be free from discrimination but does not provide a definition of discrimination nor does it offer a mechanism by which trans person can enforce the rights which are on paper accorded to them. The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade report found at Tab 1.5 of the NDP says that LGBTI persons lack protection, have poor health and education (unintelligible 00:18:48) basic tolerance, abuse and violence on a day-to-day basis. The report also indicates that police still use nuisance laws to arrest gay men while there are some gay evenings or nights in a few bars, there are no truly safe spaces for gay and bisexual men.\n[23] The articles that I have referred to come from the Board\u2019s National Documentation Package on India. You and your Counsel have also provided many articles which document the widespread and deep hostility towards the LGBTQ community generally and towards transmen in particular. The articles say that transmen are a minority within a society which is already\u2026 within a sector of society which is already marginalized. These men, transmen are confined to the shadows of society. The articles also record the murder of a number of trans persons who were assassinated in public settings because of their gender nonconformity. So far the reports to which I referred speak about the attitudes of Indian society generally. You have said that you also fear the reaction of your own family. Of course, your family belonged to Indian society at large but they are a particular group within that society.\n[24] They come from a conservative branch of Islam and would consider the notion of a trans man to be affront to themselves, to their community and to their god. When I asked you what your family would do if they learned that you are trans, you became very emotional. When you could speak you said you could not even think about it. You said that your dream is to be open with your family at some point but it is unclear how that will happen. The reports in the NDP confirm that honor-based violence within the family is still very common in India.\n[25] It occurs throughout the country and is often unreported or is reported as suicides or accidents and here I am referring to the report in the NDP found at Tab 5.10. And so when I consider the evidence cumulatively, I find that if you were to attempt to live openly as a trans man in India, you would face violence, harassment and discrimination in virtually all aspects of your life, from housing to services to employment, and I find that the cumulative impact of this violence and discrimination amounts to persecution. Moreover, I am satisfied that you face a serious risk of honor-based violence or killing at the hands of your father and other members of the conservative Muslim community from which you come. I therefore find that you are at risk, you face a serious possibility of persecution in India on a basis of your sex and gender.\nState Protection\n[26] The next question is whether you could seek State Protection against the persecution you fear and I find you cannot. As described above, the law changes articulated by the courts have failed to make significant inroads against the firmly entrenched negative perceptions of society towards those who come from diverse or nonconforming sexual orientation. The RIR at Tab 6.1 says that many police officers continue to hold outdated and negative views that affect their ability to provide adequate protection and the police are in fact known agents of persecution. Police still use nuisance laws to harass, manipulate and bribe the trans men whose family are not aware of the events or sexual identity and there are reports of police committing crimes against gay and trans men and the news and threats of arrests did discourage the victims from reporting the incident. Moreover, it is not uncommon for the police to refuse to investigate or even accept a complaint from an LGBTQ individual. In short, I find that you would not be able to avail yourselves of the police protection in the event that you were threatened, attacked or subject to other forms of violence or harm because of your sexual orientation and identity.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[27] I have also considered whether you might have a viable Internal Flight Alternative in India. I find you do not. Anti-LGBTQ attitudes are deeply entrenched across the country. The discrimination appears to be Jess severe in major cities and yet social contempt for members of the LGBTQ community is prevalent throughout India and I find on a balance of probabilities that if you were to live openly as a trans man as is your right, you would face severe problems in finding housing and employment, both of which are essential to survival and as noted above, it appears to be possible for some members of sexual minorities to survive if they have the support of family and independent means but that is not your situation. And I therefore find that you would not have a viable IFA.\nCONCLUSION\n[28] Based on the totality of the evidence before me, I find you are a Convention Refugee. I therefore accept your claim.\n\u2014\u2014\u2013 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2013\n",

Since early childhood, she would dress up and behave like girls and was bullied by other boys in school due to this. Tired of harassment, the claimant went to Germany in 2013, where she lived with her uncles and explored surgeries for transformation of her gender from male to female. In order to ease off the pressure of getting married to a female of her family\u2019s choosing, the claimant married her female friend in Germany. After the German authorities determined that the claimant\u2019s marriage with her friend was fake (of convenience), she was forced to return to Turkey as she could no longer stay in Germany. Her marriage to her friend was dissolved by the Turkish authorities after the claimant completed a series of gender reassignment surgeries in 2014 and got herself registered as a female. The claimant participated in rallies for the rights of LGBTQ community in Turkey and was detained by the authorities on two occasions in 2015 and 2016.\n[5] She travelled to Sweden and claimed refugee protection, which was denied by Swedish authorities as they ruled that she would be safe living in Turkey. The claimant returned to Turkey in 2017 and continued to live in Istanbul. She started getting threats from her extended family, who told her parents that she is bringing shame and dishonour to the family, and that she has to exit Turkey. Her uncle threatened to throw acid on her and make Turkey an unlivable place for the claimant. Fearing for her life, the claimant travelled to the United States (US) on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2019 and crossed over to Canada, where she filed for refugee protection.\nDETERMINATION\n[6] I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee as she has established a serious possibility of persecution on account of her membership in a particular social group for the following reasons.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[7] I find that the claimant\u2019s identity as a national of Turkey is established, on a balance of probabilities, based on a certified copy of her Turkish passport on file.iii\nCredibility\n[8] When a claimant swears to the truth of certain allegations, this creates a presumption that those allegations are true unless there be reason to doubt their truthfulness. (Maldonado [1980]\n2.F.C. 302 (C.A.))\n[9] The claimant testified in a straightforward manner and there were no relevant inconsistencies in her testimony or contradictions between her testimony and the other evidence before me which have not been satisfactorily explained. Apart from her oral testimony, the claimant has provided corroborating documentary evidenceiv to support her claim. I have no reason to doubt the genuineness of these documents and accept them as genuine. Amongst others, the documents contain proof of claimant\u2019s marriage in Germany with her friend and dissolution of the same by the Turkish authorities, proof of her gender reassignment surgery through an order of the courts in Turkey, threat note from the claimant\u2019s uncle in Turkey, and support letter from claimant\u2019s mother.\n[10] Based on the claimant\u2019s straightforward testimony and the corroborating documentary evidence, I find her to be a credible witness and accept her allegations to be true on a balance of probabilities. In particular, on a balance of probabilities, I accept that the claimant was borna male and underwent gender reassignment surgery to a female, and that she has a subjective fear of returning to Turkey as alleged.\nNexus\n[11] For a claimant to be considered a Convention refugee, the well-founded fear of persecution must be by reason of one or more of the five grounds: race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion. The persecution that the claimant faces in this case is due to her gender identity after the gender reassignment surgery she went through from male to female. I find that she has established nexus to a Convention ground \u2013 membership in a particular social group; namely a claimant fearing persecution due to her decision to convert from male to female. As such, her claim is being assessed under section 96 of IRPA and not under section 97.\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution and Risk of Harm\n[12] To establish her status as a Convention refugee, the claimant had to show that there was a serious possibility that she would be persecuted if removed to Turkey.\n[13] I find that the objective evidence supports her subjective fears and establishes a serious possibility of persecution for the claimant if she is forced to return to her country. My reasons are as follows.\n[14] The US State Department 2016 Human Rights Practices Report noted that:\n\u2018Minority groups, including \u2026lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex (LGBTJ) individuals, continued to face threats, discrimination, and violence and reported that the government took insufficient steps to protect them. Progovernment media used anti-LGBTI \u2026rhetoric.v\n[15] The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), Australia reports that:\nHuman rights observers report LGBTI individuals often feel the need to hide their sexual orientation or gender identity at work, and those \u00b7who do nor (or cannot may face negative repercussions. High unemployment rates in the economy as a whole make LGBTI individuals reluctant to complain about discrimination, for fear of losing their livelihoods. Turkish employment law allows the dismissal of a government employee who is found \u2018to act in a shameful and embarrassing way unfit for the position of a civil servant\u2019, while other statutes criminalise the undefined practice of \u2018unchastity\u2019. Human rights observers report employers have used these provisions to discriminate against LGBTI individuals. Social stigma against HIV\/AIDS leads many LGBTI individuals to avoid testing for fear the results may be used against them.vi\n[16] The International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association, in its report on the treatment of sexual minorities notes that this group faced bias-motivated violence through political rhetoric.vii\n[17] The objective evidence discussed above establishes that sexual minorities, including transgender individuals face continuous threats and violence in Turkey. This is based on societal perceptions and political rhetoric against this particular social group. Therefore, based on all the evidence before me, I find that the claimant will face a serious possibility of persecution if she is forced to go back to Turkey. Her fears are indeed well-founded.\nState Protection\n[18] I find that adequate state protection has not been forthcoming to the claimant in this case.\n[19] According to the UN Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary, or arbitrary detentions:\n\u2018The challenges relating to the protection of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons are exacerbated by the attitude of some family members of such individuals, as well as the trend observed by the Special Rapporteur during his visit, whereby law enforcement officials and the judiciary seem to take a lenient attitude towards crime committed against such individuals.viii\n[20] DFAT reports that:\nTransgender individuals can legally change gender, although a court must grant permission based on a medical report. Legal gender reassignment is conditional upon the individual remaining unmarried and undergoing surgery and sterilisation. Legislation does not explicitly prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity in social institutions, government offices or corporations. 171e law does not guarantee LGBTI individuals certain rights enjoyed by others, including but not limited to marriage and associated partnership benefits such as retirement, inheritance. insurance. social security and access to the corpse in case of death.ix\n[21] A Response to Information Request (RIR) on the treatment of LGBTQ community in Turkey states that:\nThe Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs report notes that the ban on public LGBTI activities in Ankara \u201cremains in force [as of 2019]\u201d (Netherlands Oct. 2019, 43). The Australian DFAT reports that \u201cin practice the ban in Ankara and many other provinces persists as officials refuse permission on a case-by-case basis, citing security concerns\u201d (Australia Sept. 2020, para. 3.89). The same source notes that in the months after the ban was reversed, police used water cannons, rubber bullets, and tear gas to disperse Pride Month gatherings (Australia 10 Sept. 2020, para. 3.89).x\n[22] The objective evidence shows that LGBTQ community in Turkey suffers from lack of favourable treatment from the authorities in that country. The government not only fails to protect such individuals from violence at the hands of non-state actors but also indulges in curbing their rights. Therefore, I am satisfied that the claimant will be unable to access adequate state protection in Turkey and that the presumption of state protection has been rebutted in this case.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[23] I have also considered whether the claimant will be able to live safely anywhere else in Turkey as a transgender person. On the evidence before me, I find, on a balance of probabilities, that she does not have a viable internal flight alternative in her country. The societal attitudes against sexual minorities are prevalent throughout the country, which results in violence, threats, and discrimination against them. Objective evidencexi shows that transgender persons have a lot of difficulty securing rental premises, have extremely limited job prospects, and do not have access to adequate housing. Therefore, for these reasons and for the ones similar to those of state protection, I find that the claimant will not be able to live safely anywhere in Turkey and that she does not have a viable internal flight alternative in her country.\nCONCLUSION\n[24] Based on the analysis above, I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee under section 96 of IRPA. Accordingly, I accept her claim.\n(signed) Sandeep Chauhan\nDecember 10, 2021\ni Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\nii Exhibit 2.\niii Exhibit 1.\niv Exhibits 6, 7.\nv Exhibit 3, National Documentation Package, Turkey, 16 April 2021, tab 1.14: Country Policy and Information Note.

        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2021 RLLR 8\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: September 8, 2021\nPanel: Jennifer Smith\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Marcia Pritzker Schmitt\nCountry: Iran\nRPD Number: VC1-05995\nAssociated RPD Number(s):\nATIP Number: A-2022-00665\nATIP Pages: 000012-000018\nREASONS FOR DECISION\nINTRODUCTION\n[1] These are the reasons for the decision in the claim of XXXX (AKA XXXX) XXXX XXXX, a citizen of Iran who is seeking refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).\n[2] This claim has been decided without a hearing, according to the Immigration and Refugee Board\u2019s Chairperson\u2019s Instructions Governing the Streaming of Less Complex Claims at the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) and paragraph 170(f) of IRPA.\n[3] In deciding this claim, I have considered all of the evidence before me, including the Basis of Claim (BOC) form,1 the referral documents,2 the country of origin information contained within the National Documentation Package (NDP) for Iran3 and the balance of the claimant\u2019s documentary evidence.4\n[4] In rendering my reasons, I have considered and applied Chairperson\u2019s Guidelines 4: Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution5 and Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9: Proceedings Before the IRB Involving Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression6 as it is, in my view, necessary to remain mindful of the intersecting relationship between gender, sexual orientation, and gender identity.\nALLEGATIONS\n[5] The claimant alleges that he has suffered past harms, including threats and discrimination, from his parents, school officials, healthcare workers and society generally because his gender identity does not follow the norms of Iranian society. The claimant describes himself as a \u201ctrans guy\u201d who was required to obey the rules as a \u201cfemale\u201d \u2014 which he describes as the binary gender he was born with.\nDETERMINATION\n[6] I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee, pursuant to section 96 of IRPA.\nIdentity\n[7] I find that the claimant\u2019s identity as a national of Iran is established by his sworn statements and the documents provided, including the certified copies of his passport in evidence.7\nNexus\n[8] I note that Canadian jurisprudence and the Gender Guideline makes it clear that RPD members are to consider the interplay between multiple grounds of persecution advanced by a claimant.8 The claimant fears continued mistreatment due his actual and perceived gender identity and actual and perceived sexual orientation. I find that the persecution alleged by the claimant has separate and intersecting connections to the Convention, relating to the claimants\u2019 membership in particular social groups.\nCredibility\n[9] Based on the evidence provided, I have noted no serious credibility issues. In particular, I am satisfied that the claimant has, through his statements and accompanying documentary evidence, established his transgender identity on a balance of probabilities. The relevant documentary evidence is extensive and includes the claimant\u2019s birth certificate, passport and school documents,9 all of which indicate that the claimant was, at the time of the documents\u2019 creation, identified by others as a female person. Other later documents include a social work report from XXXX 2018, counsellor\u2019s report from 2020, a letter from the claimant\u2019s girlfriend of several years10 a medical doctor\u2019s letter from 202011 and support letters from a 2SLGBTQ+ Youth Outreach Worker and Youth Sexual Health Coordinator.12 These documents are consistent with one another regarding the claimant\u2019s experiences and struggles relating to his gender identity and his efforts to seek medical and XXXX supports in Canada.13 These documents are also consistent with the claimant\u2019s own accounts of his experiences and provide corroborative support for his stated gender identity and the past harms to which he has been subjected in relation to this identity. After reviewing the documents, I find no reason to doubt their authenticity.\n[10] I note that, once in Canada, the claimant delayed approximately two years before seeking refugee protection. He arrived in Canada in XXXX of 2017 with a student visa and made a claim for refugee protection in XXXX of 2019. I also note that the claimant was a XXXX attending XXXX school at the time of his arrival in Canada. The claimant has explained that once in Canada he sought out community and peer supports for transgender people, and it was in this context that he received advice about applying for refugee protection. Despite this, however, the claimant also explained that he maintained hope that his parents would change their minds and support him. I find that the claimant\u2019s explanation for not seeking refugee protection immediately upon his arrival in Canada to be reasonable. I note that the claimant was a XXXX who was in Canada legally, with a valid study permit, and was in no danger of being deported to Iran. Given the claimant\u2019s circumstances and explanations, I find that it is not reasonable to draw a negative inference with respect to subjective fear or credibility because he did not seek protection sooner.\nObjective basis\n[11] To establish one\u2019s status as a Convention refugee or as a person in need of protection, a claimant must show that there was a serious possibility that they would be persecuted, or on a balance of probabilities be subjected to a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or a danger of torture if removed to their country of origin \u2013 in this case Iran. I find the claimant has met that burden.\n[12] The claimant has established his transgender identity. I have considered the claimant\u2019s gender identity in conjunction with the documentary evidence discussed below and find that the claimant has amply established a prospective risk of persecution. Further, by reference to the SOGIE Guideline and the claimant\u2019s evidence, it is apparent that the claimant has engaged throughout his life in a significant measure of behavioural self-censorship. Protecting oneself through continued self-censorship constitutes a serious interference with fundamental human rights. The claimant was unable to live openly as a transgender man in Iran. This provides a further basis for the well-founded fear of persecution by reference to Guideline 9.14 A person cannot be expected or required to conceal their gender identity orientation as a way to avoid persecution in their country of reference.\n[13] As noted above, the risk the claimant alleges is corroborated by the objective country conditions evidence provided by the claimant and in the National Documentation Package (NDP) before me.15 Iran is an authoritarian theocratic republic with a governmental human rights record that is extremely poor. The country conditions evidence amply establishes that transgender persons face discrimination in law and practice and are inadequately protected against violations to their human dignity and integrity. The documentary evidence indicates that transgender persons in Iran are harassed, abused, discriminated against, persecuted, and prosecuted by society and the state, reflecting the persistence of official and societal mistreatment based on sexual orientation and gender identity.16 Even in the absence of evidence of past mistreatment, which the claimant has provided, I find that he would face a serious possibility of persecution in Iran.\n[14] Transgender persons in Iran are considered to have a disorder that must be treated medically, via hormone treatment and sexual reassignment surgery (SRS). This perspective, however, perpetuates harms against both persons who do seek SRS and those who do not. According to a DFAT report, the law does not prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, and no criminal justice mechanisms exist to prosecute those accused of committing hate crimes against LGBTI persons.17 Post-surgery, transgender persons are advised to maintain discretion about their past due to stigma associated with being transgender. Only after SRS has been completed and legal documents (including identity card, birth certificate and passport) adjusted is a person legally allowed to dress according to the opposite sex and to move into the spaces reserved for this sex.18\n[15] Persons, including the claimant, who do not wish to undergo complete SRS are subjected to Iran\u2019s laws relating to \u201chomosexuality\u201d. The country conditions evidence also reflects \u201ca strong societal taboo against homosexuality. International LGBTI (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex) NGOs report that many young gay men face harassment and abuse from family members, religious figures, school leaders, and community leaders. Authorities have reportedly expelled individuals from university for alleged same-sex relations.\u201d Sexual minorities are unlikely to obtain protection from state officials, and may face harassment, abuse or arrest should they come to the attention of security forces. Both gay men and lesbians face considerable societal pressure to enter into a heterosexual marriage and produce children.19, 20\n[16] It is quite clear from the country conditions evidence that transgender persons, and persons who are perceived as transgender by broader society, are likely to experience violence and abuse by both state and non-state actors. For instance, transgender persons are often arrested for not wearing the mandatory hijab. This evidence is consistent with the claimant\u2019s past experiences of mistreatment by his family, school officials, classmates, health care officials and others who were unwilling to accept and respect his gender identity. Further, members of the trans community in Iran are targeted by the state based on alleged engagement in acts prohibited under the state\u2019s interpretation of Sharia law, such as same-sex sexual activities. For the claimant, this means any intimate relationship with a woman will be subject to criminal sanction.\n[17] Based on the evidence before me, I find that the claimant has a well-founded fear of persecution and faces a serious possibility of persecution by both state and non-state actors if he were to return to Iran.\nState Protection\n[18] A claimant is required to approach the state to access state protection if protection might be reasonably forthcoming or it is objectively reasonable for them to have sought state protection. The state is an agent of persecution in this claim. As such, I find it would be objectively unreasonable for the claimant to seek the protection of the state, particularly given that the documentary evidence demonstrates that the state does not provide adequate protection and the state is reported to harass and abuse transgender persons in Iran.\nInternal flight alternative\n[19] I find that there is no viable internal flight alternative for the claimant. In this case the claimant fears both state and non-state actors. The officers who are tasked with protecting the citizens of Iran are, in the case of transgender persons, targeting and persecuting them. There is nowhere in Iran where the claimant could live without this fear. I find that the claimant faces a serious possibility of persecution throughout Iran.\nCONCLUSION\n[20] I conclude that the claimant is a Convention refugee, pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA and I accept this claim.\n(signed) Jennifer Smith\nSeptember 8, 2021\n1 Exhibit 2\n2 Exhibit 1\n3 Exhibit 3, National Documentation Package (NDP), Iran, April 16, 2021.\n4 Exhibits 4 -7.\n5 IRB Chairperson\u2019 s Guidelines on Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution, Ottawa, Canada, March 1993, updated November 1996, Section C.4.\n6 IRB Chairperson\u2019s Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9: Proceedings Before the IRB Involving Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression, Ottawa, Canada, updated May 1, 2017.\n7 Exhibit 1.\n8 Kusmez v.

In assessing this claim, I have considered and applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline on Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution and the Guideline on Proceedings Before the IRB Involving Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression (or the SOGIE Guideline).\n[2] The principal claimant provided a letter of consent from the minor claimant\u2019s father as well as a copy of the minor claimant\u2019s birth certificate, Exhibit 6. The claimants are citizens of the Bahamas are claiming refugee protection pursuant to Section 96 and Subsection 97 (1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. Their allegations are set out in full in the Basis of Claim forms at Exhibit 2.1, 2.2, and amended BOC narrative in Exhibit 10.\n[3] In summary, the principal claimant is a XXXX XXXX year-old woman who grew up in a Christian family. While she was in school, she found women beautiful but suppressed these feelings out of fear as her family, her religious community, and Bahamian culture is deeply homophobic. She found high school difficult due to her struggles over her own sexuality and her fear of being rejected. The principal claimant came to realize that she was bisexual and had her first romantic relationship with a woman in XXXX 2014. They met at work and kept their relationship secret. ln 2015, she entered a romantic relationship with a man with whom she had a child, the minor claimant, in XXXX XXXX. This relationship ended shortly thereafter. In XXXX 2016, when the claimant started her job at the XXXX XXXX she met XXXX XXXX (ph) whom I will refer to as her ex-partner throughout. They soon began a relationship; she did not discuss her bisexuality with him as she feared how he would react. The principal claimant said she was very much in love and the two of them moved in together along with the minor claimant over whom the principal claimant had full custody.\n[4] The principal claimant eventually learned that her ex-partner was having a relationship with another woman; however, she felt unable to leave him. They eventually worked out their differences and got engaged in XXXX 2017, although she describes this relationship as emotionally abusive and him as obsessive. The principal claimant got a second job in the XXXXof a XXXX where she met XXXX XXXX in XXXX 2018. They quickly formed a close friendship and eventually it became romantic. XXXX XXXX XXXX identifies as a lesbian. The two women professed their love for each other in XXXX 2018 but kept the relationship a secret. A few friends of theirs suspected them of being romantically involved, however, they were careful to socialize in a group usually after work and with other co-workers. The principal claimant is not aware of any safe spaces for members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex (or LGBTI) community.\n[5] The claimant went to Florida in XXXX 2019 with XXXX XXXX XXXX and some other friends. They were secretly intimate with each other on this trip but were not open about it to their friends. The principal claimant\u2019s relationship with her ex-partner was deteriorating primarily due to her desire to be with XXXX XXXX XXXX. In XXXX 2019, her ex-partner went through her phone and saw messages between her and XXXX XXXX XXXX. He asked who it was, and the principal claimant brushed it off and responded that it was a misunderstanding. However, they argued, and the principal claimant left the home to clear her head and also to see XXXX XXXX XXXX. When the principal claimant returned late that evening, her ex-partner confronted her, and she confessed to being in love with XXXX XXXX XXXX. He was enraged and violently assaulted her. The minor claimant witnessed much of the violence including his mother being choked and her ex-partner saying that he would kill her. The principal claimant eventually grabbed a knife from the kitchen to defend herself, but her ex-partner knocked out of her hands and slapped her until she fell to the ground, then he walked away. She ran out of the home with her son and had a friend take her son to his grandmother\u2019s house and her to the police station. The police were nonchalant and told her to first get treatment at the hospital. She went to the hospital and received stitches to her face. She returned to the police station to report the assault the police did not take a report but offered to take her back to the house to get her clothes which she did. There was no discussion of a restraining order or a protection order and the police told the principal claimant to find somewhere to stay that night.\n[6] The principal claimant followed up with the police by telephone, in person, and with emails as she intended to follow through on the assault charges against her ex-partner. However, nothing happened, and the police did not take the matter seriously. The principal claimant immediately moved into her mother\u2019s home, stopped working at the XXXX XXXX and blocked all contact with her ex-partner. He stalked her wanting to know why she was not talking to him and demanding that she return to him and their relationship. He also followed her and XXXX XXXX XXXX as they left work one night until the principal claimant drove into the parking lot of the police station at which point, he left. He repeatedly tried to contact her on Facebook using different identities and demanding that she return to him. The principal claimant took her son to Disneyland with some friends in XXXX 2019 for a short trip. Her ex\u00ad partner intercepted her as she attempted to board the flight as he had access to the XXXX XXXX and to this area of the airport through XXXX XXXX. He grabbed her arm and told her not to run as he would find her and make things bad for her if she continued to avoid him.\n[7] The night the principal claimant returned from Florida her ex-partner went to her mother\u2019s house screaming at her to return to him and insulting XXXX XXXX XXXX, he also vandalized her car. The principal claimant called the police, but they did not come. XXXX XXXX XXXX convinced the principal claimant to go to the police station several days later, on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2019, to report these additional incidents. In explaining what her ex-partner had said and done, the police referred to the principal claimant and XXXX XXXX XXXX in a derogatory way, saying that they did not want to encourage this type of relationship. The principal claimant felt unsafe in Nassau and believed that her ex\u00ad partner would be able to find her if she moved given how small the Bahamas are and his broad community connections through the XXXX XXXX. She also did not want to have to hide and deny her sexuality any longer.\n[8] Feeling like she had no option but to leave the Bahamas, she purchased a flight for her and her son and departed the Bahamas a few days later, on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2019. Her ex-partner accessed her private accounts and sent personal and explicit photographs and videos of her with XXXX XXXX XXXX and a previous same-sex partner to friends and family members including her parents. The principal claimant\u2019s family members reacted with anger and told her that she was a disgrace. She is still estranged from her father and her siblings as a result of their learning about her sexual orientation. While her mother struggled with accepting the principal claimant, they eventually were able to re-establish a relationship. The principal claimant\u2019 s sexual orientation was disseminated more broadly throughout the community as well. She fears that if she returns to the Bahamas she would be assaulted or killed by her ex-partner.\n[9] The principal claimant also fears mistreatment by members of the public on account of her sexual orientation. She fears that the minor claimant will be harmed by her ex-partner either directly or in witnessing her being abused and harmed by him and that her son will also be mistreated due to her sexual orientation. I find that the claimants are Convention refugees as they have a well-founded fear of persecution in the Bahamas. My reasons are as follows.\nIdentity\n[10] I find that the claimants\u2019 identity as Bahamian nationals is established on a balance of probabilities by the principal claimant\u2019s testimony and a copy of each of their passports in evidence at Exhibit 1.\nCredibility\n[11] With respect to the claimant\u2019s sexual orientation, she provided testimony that was candid and direct. She testified in a spontaneous and natural fashion about her sexuality and her same-sex relationships. She explained in detail how she met previous girlfriends, how they were able to be together, and why their relationships ended. I find that this testimony was genuine and consistent. The claimant provided corroborative documentary evidence of her sexual orientation including a letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX attesting to their relationship and how they are currently taking a break but remain in love. As well as messages exchanged between her and XXXX XXXX XXXX, photographs, and videos of the principal claimant and XXXX XXXX XXXX as well the principal claimant with a previous same-sex partner in the Bahamas. Letters of support from close friends of the principal claimant about how and when they learned about her sexual orientation. Messages exchanged between the principal claimant and women she was chatting with within Canada and a screen capture of the principal claimant\u2019s registration with The 519 organization in Toronto and those are found in Exhibits 5, 7, 8, 9, and 10. The principal claimant also provided numerous articles about serious issues faced by the LGBTI community in the Bahamas and those are found at Exhibits 1 and 9.\n[12] With respect to the domestic abuse aspect of the claim, the principal claimant provided a detailed account of her ex-partner\u2019s attack in her BOC narrative as well as in her oral testimony. The principal claimant explained what the minor claimant experienced and witnessed during this attack. She also testified about what she believes would happen if she were to relocate to another area in the Bahamas. The principal claimant\u2019s response to my questions were emotional, genuine, and credible. The principal claimant also provided documentary evidence which corroborated her allegations of abuse including: a police report from XXXX XXXX XXXX 2019; an email sent by her to the police reiterating that she had been in several times with no progress and stating that she wants the matter to proceed, which was dated XXXX XXXX XXXX 2019; a video showing the damage to the principal claimant\u2019s car by her ex-partner on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2019; a letter of support from a friend the night of her attack about having received several missed calls from the principal claimant; letters of support from friends and co-workers saying that the principal claimant never returned to work at the XXXX after the assault and that her ex\u00ad partner was angry about her wanting to be with XXXX XXXX XXXX; messages in which the principal claimant was trying and locate the hospital records from the night of her assault; and photographs and videos of the principal claimant and her ex-partner; as well as a referral for XXXX treatment and support, and a XXXX report detailing the XXXX effects of domestic violence, Exhibits 5,7, and 9.\n[13] There were no material inconsistencies or contradictions within the principal claimant\u2019 s evidence that caused me to question her credibility. I find her testimony was credible and was supported by corroborative documentary evidence as such I accept that the principal claimant is bisexual and that she has experienced domestic violence as a result of her relationship with XXXX XXXX XXXX and that her ex-partner stopped, threatened, and harassed her following his assaulting her in XXXX 2019.\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution\n[14] The principal claimant fears persecution in the Bahamas on account of her identity as a bisexual woman. The principal claimant also fears persecution from her abusive ex-partner. According to the Gender and SOGIE Guidelines, bisexual women and women facing domestic violence both constitute a particular social group. As such, I find that her claim for protection has a Nexus to the refugee convention ground of membership in a particular social group. The principal claimant fears the minor claimant would face persecution in the Bahamas as the son of a bisexual woman. The sexual orientation of a family member in an overtly homophobic country can result in adverse consequences and here I refer to the Federal Court case Corneille which is found at 2014 FC 901. I also find that if the minor claimant returns to the Bahamas, he would be at risk of witnessing his mother\u2019s ex-partner subjecting her to further abuse or even murder. There is a Federal Court authority in the Modeste case at 2013 FC 1262 that children witnessing the abuse of a parent constitutes persecution in itself.\n[15] I find that the minor claimant\u2019s fear of persecution relates to the Convention ground of membership in a particular social group namely children of bisexual women in an overtly homophobic country and children subjected to domestic violence. The objective evidence in the NDP indicates that sexual minorities including bisexual women face serious mistreatment in the Bahamas. Furthermore, I find that the principal claimant\u2019s identity as a bisexual woman intersects with the risks that she faces from her ex\u00ad partner in a way that elevates her overall risk of persecution. While same-sex sexual activity is not criminalized in the Bahamas, individuals who identify as LGBTI face widespread stigmatization and discrimination in the country and l refer here to NDP Items 2.1, 2.3, and 6.3. According to NDP Item 6.1, there is strong anti-gay attitudes in the Bahamas as \u201chomophobia is permeated through cultural attitudes and is expressed in religion, music, and other expressions\u201d. The same source notes that due to the strong stigma against homosexuality. Sexual minorities generally hide their sexual orientation out of fear of ostracism, exclusion, ridicule, and violence.\n[16] The claimants provided recent media reports about homophobia in the Bahamas even against tourists and that\u2019s an Exhibit 5. Discrimination based on sexuality is not prohibited by law, so LGBTI individuals have no mechanism to seek redress from marginalization, systematic discrimination in the areas of employment and housing and that\u2019s NDP 2.3, 6.1, and 6.2. Sexual minorities face discrimination without redress and cannot live openly without facing various forms of mistreatment including violence and I find this amounts to persecution. Moreover, the principal claimant faces an additional risk of persecution from her ex-partner who attacked and threatened to kill after learning that she\u2019s bisexual and in love with a woman. He was infuriated, he continued to stalk and threaten her, and he refused to accept that she wanted to leave him for a woman. I find on a balance of probabilities that the principal claimant\u2019s ex\u00ad partner felt rejected and threatened by her sexuality and that this elevates the risk he poses to her and by extension the minor claimant who is at risk of witnessing the principal claimant being further assaulted or even killed by her partner.\nState Protection\n[17] In all refugee claims, the state is presumed to be capable of protecting its citizens unless a claimant presents clear and convincing evidence to the contrary. In this case, I find that this presumption has been rebutted and that the protection would not be forthcoming. NDP Item 6.1 notes that LGBTI people experience difficulties if they turn to the police for protection that they faced smirking, ridicule, and insults if they are open about their sexual orientation which is certainly reflective of the experience of the principal claimant when she went to the police with XXXX XXXX XXXX. This same source reports that \u201cif an LGBTI reports an incident of violence openly to the police, the police will come down against the victim and will say the person got what they deserved.\u201d The US Department of State Report found at NDP Item 2.1 also indicates there is inadequate protection by law enforcement authorities for members of the LGBTI community. Based on this evidence I find that the principal claimant would not have adequate state protection from persecution due to her sexual orientation. I also find that the claimants would not have adequate state protection from the principal claimant\u2019s ex-partner. While there is anti-domestic violence legislation in the Bahamas and some support for women fleeing violence, women\u2019s rights groups there report a hesitancy from law enforcement to intervene in domestic disputes and that\u2019s NDP Items 2.1 and 5.8. In the present case, the principal claimant reported her abuser to the police several times and attempted to follow up and move forward with assault charges. The authorities helped her to return to her home to get her personal effects the night of the attack but did not issue a protective or restraining order or pursued charges against her ex-partner. While she attended the station with XXXX XXXX XXXX, the nonchalance of the police turned to derision. In light of the circumstances, I find that state protection was inadequate. As the principal claimant lacks state protection from her abusive ex-partner, I find that the minor claimant also lacks state protection from the harm she fears namely bearing witness to violence against his mother.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[18] Finally, I\u2019ve considered whether an internal flight alternative available to the claimants. At the start of the hearing, I proposed San Salvador. The first prong of this assessment is to determine whether on a balance of probabilities there\u2019s a risk of persecution, a risk to life, cruel or unusual treatment or punishment, or danger of torture in the proposed internal flight alternative location. According to the objective evidence, the situation for LGBTI individuals is consistent throughout the Bahamas as a result I find there is no location within the Bahamas where the principal claimant would not face a serious possibility of persecution due to her sexual orientation. I also find that the principal claimant\u2019s ex-partner is likely motivated to pursue her throughout the Bahamas. Given the small size of the country, his ability to monitor her movements through his employment at the XXXX XXXX and his strong connections within the community through his membership in the XXXX XXXX XXXX. I find that the ex-partner would also likely have the ability to locate the principal claimant anywhere in the country. As the minor claimant lives with the principal claimant solely, I find that he would also face a possibility of witnessing violence against his mother which I have found amounts to persecution. For these reasons, I do find the claimants have a viable internal flight alternative within the Bahamas.\nCONCLUSION\n[19] Having considered the evidence, I find the claimants are Convention refugees under Section 96 of the Act and I accept their claims for protection. This matter is concluded.\n(signed) Kirsty Sim\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

She now fears that her daughters will undergo the same trauma as her father-in-law is adamant on carrying out the procedure on the female minor claimants.\n[7] The principal claimant also fears for her life at the hands of persons convicted of crimes by the courts in Nigeria as she is a bailiff and executes the court verdicts.\n[8] The principal claimant and the minor claimants travelled to Canada on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018. The associate claimant stayed behind in Nigeria. His father attempted to have him kidnapped, following which he quit his job and escaped to Canada on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018.\n[9] The claimants filed for refugee protection, fearing for their lives in Nigeria.\nDETERMINATIONS\n[10] I find that the principal and the minor female claimants are Convention refugees as they have established a serious possibility of persecution based on their membership in a particular social group upon return to their country. My reasons are as follows.\n[11] I also find that the associate claimant and the minor male claimant have satisfied the burden of establishing, on a balance of probabilities, that they would personally be subjected to a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or a danger of torture upon return to their country. My reasons are as follows.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[12] I find that the claimants\u2019 identities as nationals of Nigeria are established, on a balance of probabilities, based on certified copies of their Nigerian passports on file.iii\nNexus\n[13] For a claimant to be considered a Convention refugee, the well-founded fear of persecution must be by reason of one or more of the five grounds: race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion.\n[14] In this case, the evidence before me is that the principal claimant fears persecution in Nigeria due to her refusal to subject the minor claimants to FGM. I find that she has established a nexus to a Convention ground \u2013 membership in a particular social group: namely a woman fearing gender-based persecution. I also find that the minor female claimants have established a nexus to a Convention ground \u2013 membership in a particular social group: namely children fearing gender\u00ad based persecution. Accordingly, I have assessed their claims under section 96 of IRPA and not under section 97.\n[15] Victims or potential victims of crime, corruption or personal vendettas generally cannot establish a link between fear of persecution and Convention reasons (Kang, 2005 FC 1128 at para. 10). The associate claimant and the minor male claimant fear persecution in Nigeria due to the threat of kidnapping by the associate claimant\u2019s father and his extended family due to the associate claimant\u2019s refusal to subject the minor female claimants to FGM.\n[16] As victims of crime who fear future criminality which is not connected to one of the five Convention grounds, I find that the associate claimant and the minor male claimant have not established a nexus to one of the Convention grounds. Their claims will therefore be assessed under section 97(1) of the Act, and not section 96.\nCredibility\n[17] When a claimant swears to the truthfulness of certain facts there is a presumption that what he or she is saying is true unless there are reasons to doubt it. The determination as to whether a claimant\u2019s evidence is credible is to be made on a balance of probabilities.\n[18] In this case the principal claimant and the associate claimant testified in a straightforward manner and, there were no relevant inconsistencies in their testimonies or contradictions between their testimonies and the other evidence before me which have not been satisfactorily explained.\n[19] I canvassed the principal claimant why she did not seek protection earlier, since the threats of FGM by her father-in-law had commenced at the time her eldest daughter was born in XXXX. She explained that at that time they did not take the threats seriously and were able to talk the in\u00ad laws into postponing the consideration of subjecting their eldest daughter to female circumcision. There were discussions on this issue, but the threats never escalated. Following the birth of their second daughter in XXXX, there was more serious talk of revisiting this issue of female circumcision. It is only when the father-in-law and his relatives began demanding that the female minor claimants will have to undergo FGM, did they start to realize the gravity of the matter. Then, when her father-in-law tried to get the associate claimant kidnapped for his refusal to agree with him on the issue of FGM, did they realize that their lives were in danger. I accept the principal claimant\u2019 s explanation for the delay in seeking protection reasonable, as initially, it was just simple talk on the issue of FGM for the eldest minor female claimant. However, with the birth of their younger daughter in XXXX, the situation deteriorated, and the threats worsened with the escalation of those threats to physical harm for the principal claimant, the associate claimant, and the minor male claimant for refusing to honour the family tradition of subjecting the minor female claimants to FGM. I do not draw any negative inference on the issue of delay in seeking refugee protection.\n[20] Apart from their oral testimonies, the principal claimant and the associate claimant have provided corroborating documentary evidence to support their and the minor claimants\u2019 claims. These documents form part of Exhibits 5, 6, 8 and 9. I have no reason to doubt the genuineness of these documents and accept them as genuine. The evidence contains the following:\nMarriage certificate confirming the principal claimant and the associate claimant are married to each other, along with birth certificates of minor claimants confirming they are their children.Supporting letter from pastor of a church in Nigeria confirming the claimants were facing threats of persecution at the hands of the associate claimant\u2019s father and his extended family on the issue of FGM for the minor female claimants.Medical note from Nigeria showing that the principal claimant was treated for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXand XXXX.XXXX assessment report from Canada confirming that the principal claimant suffers from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX due to the events she faced in Nigeria.[21] Based on the principal claimant\u2019s and the associate claimant\u2019s straightforward testimony and the corroborating documentary evidence discussed above, I find them to be credible witnesses and accept their allegations to be true on a balance of probabilities. In particular, on a balance of probabilities, I accept that:\nThe associate claimant\u2019s father and his extended family want the minor female claimants to be subjected to FGM.The principal claimant and the associate claimant were issued threats of harm by the associate claimant\u2019s father.There was an attempt to kidnap the associate claimant at the behest of his father for refusal to have the minor female claimants undergo FGM.The associate claimant\u2019s father has threatened to harm all the claimants for refusing to honour the family practice and tradition of FGM.The principal claimant and the minor female claimants have a subjective fear of returning to Nigeria.Well-Founded Fear of Persecution and Risk of Harm\n[22] To establish their status as Convention refugees, the principal and the minor female claimants had to show that there was a serious possibility that they would be persecuted if removed to Nigeria.\n[23] I find that the evidence presented in support of their allegations does establish a serious possibility of persecution for the claimants. My reasons are as follows.\n[24] The principal claimant has been threatened with dire consequences by her father-in-law for refusing to subject the minor female claimants to undergo FGM as per the family\u2019s traditions and the Yoruba culture.\n[25] The claimants\u2019 subjective fear is supported by objective evidence.\n[26] The country condition documents for Nigeria corroborate the facts alleged by the principal claimant and the objective basis for her and the minor claimants\u2019 claims. FGM is widespread in Nigeria and the procedure has been performed on 20 million women and girls in the country, with some estimates indicating that 24.8% of all women between 15 and 49 have undergone FGM.iv\n[27] The claimants belong to the Yoruba culture and ethnicity. The objective evidence states that FGM is much more common amongst southern ethnic groups, and studies indicate that between 52-90% of Yoruba women and girls have been subjected to FGM.v\n[28] Although Nigeria has passed legislation to criminalize the FGM as well as the procurement, arrangement, and\/or assistance of acts of FGM, the prevalence of this social evil remains concerning and there are no reported instances of any prosecutions brought under federal legislation since its introduction in 2015 in Nigeria.vi\n[29] I also reference the Response to Information Request (RIR) on whether parents can refuse subjecting their children to FGM and the repercussions for doing so.vii The RIR states that the decision to subject a girl to FGM is generally up to her parents and that parents who refuse to let their daughters be mutilated do not face any significant consequences. The principal claimant testified that her in-laws are rooted in rural Yoruba culture and traditions and have subject all their females to FGM. She stated that her father-in-law is adamant that until the minor female claimants are subject to FGM, calamities will befall on the family. She testified that the father-in-law has threatened that he will forcibly take away the minor claimants and do what needs to be done. I agree with the principal claimant\u2019s argument that she and the minor claimants face a serious possibility of persecution as the RIR also states that the decision to refuse FGM without repercussions is dependent on whether the families are urbanites or rural folks, seeped in the traditions and culture. I accept the principal claimant\u2019s assertion that her in-laws, even though urbanites, uphold the rural and family traditions such as FGM.\n[30] Therefore, based on all the evidence before me, I find that the principal claimant and the minor female claimants will face a serious possibility of persecution if forced to return to Nigeria, especially since her father-in-law is motivated and has threatened the principal claimant of dire consequences and of forcibly taking away the minor female claimants to subject them to FGM. I find that their fears are indeed well-founded.\n[31] I now turn my attention to the claims of the associate claimant and the minor male claimant.\n[32] I find, on a balance of probabilities, that both of them face a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or a danger of torture if forced to return to Nigeria.\n[33] The associate claimant\u2019s father threatened him and his family of harm of he did not agree to uphold the family and Yoruba tradition of subjecting the minor female claimants to FGM. After the principal claimant and the minor claimants left Nigeria, the associate claimant\u2019s father attempted to have him kidnapped, even though the associate claimant had changed his place of residence and moved to another state without informing anyone about it. This is indicative of the agent of persecution\u2019 s motivation and ability to reach the claimants if they are forced to return to Nigeria. These threats of harm continue unabated through the claimants\u2019 relatives in Nigeria.\n[34] Therefore, based on all the evidence before me, I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the associate claimant and the minor male claimant will face a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or a danger of torture if forced to return to Nigeria.\nState Protection\n[35] I find that adequate state protection would not be reasonably forthcoming in this particular case.\n[36] States are presumed to be capable of protecting their citizens, except in situations where the country is in a state of complete breakdown. The responsibility to provide international (or surrogate) protection only becomes engaged when national or state protection is unavailable to the claimant. To rebut the presumption of state protection, a claimant must provide \u201cclear and convincing\u201d evidence of the state\u2019s inability to protect its citizens. A claimant is required to approach the state for protection if protection might reasonably be forthcoming. However, a claimant is not required to risk their life seeking ineffective protection of a state, merely to demonstrate that ineffectiveness (Ward [1993] 2 S.C.R. 689).\n[37] The principal claimant stated that she will not be able to seek police protection in Nigeria because the issue of FGM is considered private, in which the police do not intervene.\n[38] Objective evidence states that authorities often do not take complaints about FGM seriously. There are no reported instances of any prosecutions brought under federal anti-FGM legislation since its introduction in 2015. A recent study conducted by UNFPA and UNICEF does not list any arrests, cases, or convictions for FGM in Nigeria.viii\n[39] Objective evidence also states that there are reports which indicate that it remains extremely difficult for women and girls to obtain protection from FGM due to community support for these practices, the attitude of police, and treatment by the police of FGM as a community or family matter.ix\n[40] Finally, I quote the United Kingdom Home Office report, which indicates that the police may be discriminatory in their treatment of victims of ritual practices, including FGM, and that women often do not report such practices to the police due to a lack of trust. Police themselves can be part of the culture and thus fail to treat such practices as criminal.x\n[41] The objective evidence discussed above establishes that FGM is considered a private matter in Nigeria. It is a prevalent practice in the country, thereby influencing the response of the police as not taking such acts seriously and thereby failing to provide protection to victims or potential victims of FGM and gender-based violence. Therefore, I find that the claimants will not be able to access adequate state protection in Nigeria and that the presumption of state protection has been rebutted.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[42] The final issue is whether the claimants have a viable internal flight alternative (IFA) in Nigeria. In order to determine whether an IFA exists, I must assess whether there is any location in Nigeria in which the claimants would not face a serious possibility of persecution and whether it would be reasonable to expect them to move there.xi\n[43] The agent of persecution in this case is the associate claimant\u2019s father, who is extremely motivated to pursue the claimants in order to fulfill the long-standing family and Yoruba tradition of subjecting the minor female claimants to FGM. He has demonstrated through the kidnapping attempt of the associate claimant that he has the motivation and the reach to locate them within Nigeria.\n[44] Therefore, for reasons similar to those of state protection and the motivation and ability of the agent of persecution to locate the claimants, I find that they do not have a viable internal flight available in Nigeria.\nCONCLUSION\n[45] For the reasons above, I conclude that the principal claimant and the minor female claimants are Convention refugees under section 96 of IRPA. Accordingly, I accept each of their claims.\n[46] For the reasons above, I conclude that the associate claimant and the minor male claimant are persons in need of protection within the meaning of section 97 (1)(a) or (b) of IRPA.

So, this transcript constitutes the Member\u2019s written reasons for decision, as the decision was not given orally at a hearing.\n[2] This is the decision of the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada of the claims of the principal claimant, XX XXXX, her adult son, XX XXXX, her adult daughter, XXXX XXXX, and her minor son, XXXX XXX, who are all citizens of Nigeria seeking refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. The principal claimant was appointed as a designated representative for her minor son. I have also reviewed and applied the chairperson\u2019s guideline on women refugee claimants fearing gender-related persecution and the chairperson\u2019s guideline on child refugee claimants\u2019 procedural and evidentiary issues.\nAllegations\n[3] The claimants fear risk to their lives from the principal claimant\u2019s husband\u2019s former business partner, namely a XXXXXXXX (ph), if they were to return to Nigeria. During the hearing, the principal claimant also testified that she feared that her husband\u2019s family would harm her if she returned because they believe that she is responsible for his disappearance. The female claimants also raised fears of being \u2014 of persecution because of their gender if they were to return.\n[4] Details of the claimants\u2019 allegations can be found in the principal claimant\u2019s Basis of Claim form and attached narrative, including the amendments which are found at Exhibit 7 and 8. The following is a summary of their allegations and testimony. The principal claimant and her husband were married in 2002 and they had five children together. Three of the children are part of this claim. The principal claimant\u2019s husband had his own business XXX and XXXX XXXXX XXXX. In XXX 2017, the principal claimant\u2019s husband received a large contract and he needed to borrow XXXXXX naira from his associate XXXXXXXXX to in order to pay for the XXXXX. Around XXX 2017 the principal claimant\u2019s husband came home and said that the man he was to buy the XXXXX from had collected payment and had now disappeared, and that he was afraid of XXXXXXXX. In XXX 2017, XXXXXXXXX and some thugs came to the claimants\u2019 home and demanded money. The principal claimant\u2019s husband was beaten up and asked them for two months to pay back the money. After the men left, the principal claimant\u2019s husband went to the police but they just accused the husband of trying to steal the money. A month later, the principal claimant\u2019s husband and their oldest son were beaten up by some thugs on their way home. They were told that if XXXXXXXXX did not get his money soon they would both be killed. The principal claimant\u2019s husband was scared and he and the eldest son left a few days later. The principal claimant has only received one call \u2014 phone call from them, which occurred a few days after they left, and her husband apologized for leaving her and the other children. The principal claimant started receiving threatening phone calls at home after her husband left, saying that her husband should pay or else.\n[5] In XXXXX 2017, XXXXXXXX and some thugs appeared at the claimants\u2019 house asking for the husband. When the principal claimant said that he no longer lives there, they became angry and the claimants were all blindfolded and put into a van. They were taken to an abandoned warehouse. The principal claimant was told they would be released if her husband turned himself in or repaid the debt. The claimants were only fed one meal a day. On the third day, the principal claimant was taken away from where her children were held and she was raped by three men. The claimants were beaten daily. On the sixth day the principal claimant\u2019s youngest child XXXX was crying and he would not stop. One of the men started beating XXXX, and XXXX became quiet and stopped moving. The man told the principal claimant that XXXX was dead, and they took him away. On the 10th day, the claimants were alone in the warehouse when they heard a noise outside. They started shouting and some hunters broke down the door and untied them. The hunters took them \u2014 oh, sorry, told them where to go to the police station, and they went there and made a report. Afterwards, the claimants went to a chemist for treatment and then they went to the church for help. The claimants stayed at their church until they left Nigeria. A few days later, the principal claimant heard from her neighbour that some men, including XXXXXXXXXX, had come to their house with the police looking for the claimants and saying that they had stolen some money. The principal claimant called the police, and they said there is no report on file and that they had probably made the whole thing up. The claimants already had a valid US visa from a planned holiday in 2016 that never happened, and with the help of their neighbour, who retrieved their passports, and their church, who arranged for the plane tickets, the claimants left Nigeria on XXXXXXX, 2017. On XXXXXXX, 2017 the claimants arrived in the US, and three days later they made their way to Canada. In XXXX 2018, the claimants applied for refugee protection.\nDetermination\n[6] I find that the claimants are persons in need of protection.\nAnalysis\nIdentity\n[7] The claimants\u2019 identities as citizens of Nigeria have been established on a balance of probabilities by their Nigerian passports, located at Exhibit 1.\n[8] The allegations likely support a nexus to a Convention ground for the claimants, including, for the female claimants, a nexus to their membership in a particular social group based on their gender, but given my determination, I find it unnecessary to assess this claim under s. 96.\nS. 97 Analysis\n[9] I find that the claimants are persons in need of protection, as their removal to Nigeria would subject them personally to a risk to their lives, to cruel \u2014 or to a risk of cruel and [inaudible] punishment under subsection l(b) of the IRPA.\nCredibility\n[10] For the reasons below, I find that the adult claimants are credible witnesses. In making that finding, I am relying on the principle that a claimant who affirms to tell the truth creates the presumption of truthfulness unless there are reasons to doubt their truthfulness. In this regard, the principal claimant provided the vast majority of the testimony, as the other adult claimants were minors at the time of the incidents. The claimants all had some difficulties with details, including dates, during their testimony. As said, I do not make a negative credibility finding, given the personal characteristics of the claimants. The principal claimant never completed primary school. She is illiterate, and there is a XXXXXX report at Exhibit 5 that describes the principal claimant as suffering from XXXX that creates cognitive problems for her, including inability \u2014 an inability to retrieve specific details of her past, including dates. The other adult claimants, as mentioned before, were minors during the events that occurred. Given the claimants\u2019 particular circumstances and Jack of sophistication, I make no negative credibility findings based on their difficulties with some of the details, including dates. While the adult claimants who testified had some difficulties, as noted above, in the end, their testimony was consistent with their Basis of Claim forms, supporting documents, and each other. The claimants were able to clearly describe their fears for returning. to Nigeria. The principal claimant described details of how they escaped the warehouse and their travel back to the church. She also described the people she has been in contact with since leaving Nigeria, who have told her about how her agent of harm is continuing to pursue them. The claimants were all able to directly respond to questions asked. There were no relevant inconsistencies in the claimants\u2019 testimony or contradictions between their testimony and the other evidence. I find that the claimants who testified were credible witnesses.\n[11] The claimants also provided documents to support their claim. These documents can be found in Exhibits 5 through 2.11. They include, at Exhibit 5, photographs of the claimant\u2019s family including XXXX. Exhibit 7 contains documents such as a birth certificate for XXXX. I have no reason to doubt the genuineness of these documents and since they relate to significant part of the claimants\u2019 allegations, the unfortunate loss of their son, I put significant weight on these documents to support their allegations and overall claim. The claimants also provided some letters of support from different people in Canada. During the hearing, I asked the principal claimant why she did not provide letters of support from anyone in Nigeria, such as her neighbour. The principal claimant testified that she had asked people to provide letters and had expected them to come. She had also followed up with them when they didn\u2019t arrive, and she was told that they had been mailed. These letters never arrived in time for the hearing. I accept the claimants explanation, as the documents are outside of her control, and she has made reasonable efforts to try and obtain them. As such, I make no negative credibility finding as a result.\n[12] I also find the claimants have a subjective fear of returning to Nigeria even though they first went to the US before coming to Canada and make a claim. The principal claimant testified that her son had found a video showing Nigerian claimants coming to Canada, and given the Trump administration at the time, they decided to come to Canada to claim protection. I accept this explanation, especially given the claimants only spent three days in the US prior to coming to Canada, and I find that the claimants have a subjective fear of returning to Nigeria.\nCountry Condition Evidence\n[13] I find that the country condition documents support the claimants\u2019 fears of returning to Nigeria. As background, the 2020 US Department of State report in item 2.1, the national documentation package for Nigeria found in Exhibit 3, describes numerous human rights concerns in the country, including unlawful and arbitrary killings by both governments and non-state actors, forced disappearances by government, terrorists, and criminal groups, torture in cases of cruel, inhumane, or degrading treatment or punishment, arbitrary detention by government and non-state actors, serious acts of corruption, trafficking in persons, and inadequate investigation and accountability for violence against women. A 2020 report on Nigeria\u2019s security situation found at item 7.7 indicates that organized criminal forces in the southern and middle parts of the country committed abuses such as kidnappings, that while the level of violence declined in 2009, it had been \u2014 it has been rising since then. A 2020 crime and safety report found at item 7.28, while directed at a US audience, states that, and I quote, \u201cCrime is prevalent throughout Nigeria. Most crime directed towards US travellers and private security entities in the southern Nigeria seeks financial gain. US visitors and residents have been victims of a wide range of violent crime, including armed robbery, assault, burglary, carjacking, rape, kidnapping, and extortion. The most commonly reported crimes are armed robbery, kidnap for ransom, and fraud,\u201d end quote. Other reports in the NDP, for example, item 7.37, also describe the prevalence of financially motivated kidnappings throughout Nigeria. The claimants also provided three articles, found in Exhibit 4, that describe the risk \u2014 sorry, the rising risk of kidnappings throughout Nigeria.\n[14] Numerous reports in the national documentation package also indicate that discrimination and violence against women is prevalent in Nigeria. See, for example, items 1.4, 1.8, 2.1, 2.9, 5.1, and 5.3. For example, a 2019 OECD report found at item 5.1 describes how Nigeria has taken steps to reduce gender\u00ad based violence. However, the report states that, and I quote, \u201cDespite these national efforts, violence against women is endemic in Nigeria,\u201d end quote. This is also indicated in the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs reported in item 1.8, that states that, and I quote, \u201cWomen and girls frequently experience gender-based discrimination and violence in Nigeria. Nigeria remains a highly patriarchal society and cultural traditions, including forced child marriage, female genital mutilation, and so-called widowhood practices,\u201d end quote.\n[15] I find on a balance of probabilities that the agent of harm has targeted the claimant as a result of a debt incurred by the principal claimant\u2019s husband. I further find on a final balance of probabilities that the debt has not been repaid, and as such, it has created a risk for the claimants that is not faced generally by others Nigeria. Finally, given that the debt is still unpaid and the principal claimant\u2019s testimony that she has been advised by people including her former neighbour in Nigeria that XXXXXXX is continuing to look for the claimants, I find that the claimants face an ongoing risk if they were to return to Nigeria. As such, I find on a balance of probabilities that claimants face a personalized risk to their lives that is not faced generally by others in Nigeria.\nState Protection\n[16] With respect to state protection, a state is presumed capable of protecting its citizens, and a claimant must establish on a balance of probabilities, through clear and convincing evidence, that a country\u2019s protection is inadequate. Simply asserting a subjective belief that state protection is not available is not enough to rebut the presumption. The more democratic a state\u2019s institutions, the more a claimant must do to exhaust the options available to them. As discussed below, I find that the claimants have rebutted this presumption.\n[17] The objective evidence indicates that while the Nigerian government has taken steps to legislate protection, there remains no adequate state protection available for women fleeing gender-based violence. For example, a 2020 US Department of State report found at item 2.1 states that, and I quote, \u201cPolice often refuse to intervene in domestic disputes or blame the victim for provoking the abuse,\u201d end quote. That report lists one of the significant human rights issues in Nigeria as the inadequate investigation and accountability for violence against women. In addition, the 2018 DFAT report at item 1.8 indicates that while Nigeria passed the Violence against Persons Act that criminalized sexual violence and provided support for domestic violence victims, that the government\u2019s shelters are poorly equipped and do not provide adequate protection. Finally, a 2017 corruption report found at item 7.11 indicates that corruption is pervasive throughout all institutions in Nigeria. The report indicates the judicial system is perceived as corrupt and bribes to obtain favourable judgments is common, that almost \u2014 the report also indicates that almost all Nigerians believe that the police are corrupt, and the police are also considered very unreliable in enforcing the law, and that police officers continue to operate with impunity. This lack of adequate state protection can be found elsewhere in the national documentation package, including at the items noted previously. [inaudible] in the response \u2014 sorry, this is also shown in the response that the principal claimant received from the police when she tried to follow up on the two reports she made in person and they denied having any reports [inaudible]. Based on the evidence, I find on a balance of probabilities that there is no operationally effective state protection available to the claimants in their circumstances.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[18] The test for internal flight alternative is well-established. I must be satisfied that one, the claimant would not face a serious risk of \u2014 sorry, face a serious possibility of persecution or be subject personally to a danger of torture or to a risk of life or a risk of cruel and unusual punishment in the proposed internal flight alternative, and two, that conditions in that part of the country are such that it would be objectively reasonable in all the circumstances, including those particular to the claimants, for them to seek refuge there. For the reasons below, I find that the claimants do not have an internal flight alternative.\n[19] The issue of whether Abuja would be a viable internal flight alternative for the claimants was identified at the start of this hearing. The principal claimant testified that she would be at risk in Abuja because of Boko Haram, being unable to obtain employment as a single mother, and that XXXXXXX was able to locate the claimants \u2014 or would be able to locate the claimants through his connections with the police. XXXX also described fearing Boko Haram because he is a practicing Christian and described how he would be unable to find work or accommodations. Finally, XXXXX described her fears based on how women are treated in Nigeria\n[20] The country condition documents support the claimants\u2019 belief that it would not be reasonable for them to relocate to another part of Nigeria, including Abuja. For example, a 2019 response to information report at item 5.9 indicates that single women may encounter difficulties, including with respect to education, employment, and housing. With respect to housing, the report indicates that Nigeria has a lack of adequate housing, that prejudice exists against women, that landlords reject \u2014 that causes landlords to reject their applications. With respect to housing in Abuja, the report indicates that there is a deficit of 600,000 houses, and the report quotes a source who states that, and I quote, \u201cThe majority of women without support from male counterparts or family members have to engage in commercial sex work in order to pay for their rent,\u201d end quote. The report also indicates that women, particularly unmarried women, experience discrimination with respect to economic opportunities, wages, and conditions of work. It quotes two sources who indicate that female heads of household will be subject to sexual exploitation. Further, the report indicates concerns with the ability of women from out of state accessing public services, and that women not from the state would have to be married or reside in state for over 10 years to be eligible to access government welfare services. [inaudible] also states that the Nigerian government has no general support for women in need. Finally, the claimants are Christian, and a response to information request found at item 12.5 indicates that violence against Christians from Boko Haram occurs in Abuja and that Boko Haram has attacked churches, masques, and public spaces in Abuja. The claimants also provided, at Exhibit 4, a Human Rights Watch report that indicates the challenges faced by people trying to relocate to cities where they are not originally from, including the discrimination they face when it comes to education and employment. As noted previously, the principal claimant did not complete primary school. The other adult claimants have not completed high school. None of the claimants have significant work experience. The principal claimant has worked as a XXXX before leaving Nigeria, and XXXX has started working at an XXX XXXXX, but his experience is minimal. Given the country conditions noted above, I find that it would be objectively unreasonable in their particular circumstances for the claimants to relocate to Abuja or elsewhere in Nigeria. Given my finding under the section \u2014 second prong of the test, I find it unnecessary to consider the first prong. Accordingly, the claimants do not have a viable internal flight alternative available to them.\nConclusion\n[21] For the reasons above, I find that the claimants are persons in need of protection within the meaning of s. 97(1)(b) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, and accordingly the Board accepts their claim.\n(signed) David Jones\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n",

So, this is the decision for XXXX XXXX XXXX. The file number is TB9-15167. Now, I have considered your testimony, and the other evidence in the case, and I am ready to render my decision orally.\n[2] Now, you are claiming to be a citizen of Zimbabwe, and claiming refugee protection pursuant to s. 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, and today, I do find that you are a Convention refugee for the following reasons.\n[3] Now, the full allegations in your claim are set out in the Basis of Claim form, as well as the amendments. To summarize those, you allege a fear of persecution as a result of, first of all, your perceived political opinions as a member of the opposition, and, you know, those are your actual political opinions as well, as you have now joined the MDC, and, in your testimony, you have also alleged that you have supported the MDC. You allege that there is no state protection for you, or any internal flight alternative.\n[4] Now, your personal identity as a citizen of Zimbabwe has been established by the testimony, as well as the supporting documents, primarily, the certified copy of your passport, found in Exhibit 1. So, I do find on a balance of probabilities that identity and country of reference have been established.\n[5] Now, your testimony today was generally credible. There were no significant inconsistencies or discrepancies in your testimony today, and your testimony about the MDC is consistent with the documentary evidence. You testified in some detail about the history, and the current status of the MDC, you spoke quite knowledgably about the current government, and you also testified about your activities here in Canada, and you were able to elaborate on the information in your Basis of Claim form. While you have previously maintained a very low profile in terms of your political activities, I do accept your testimony about what you knew to be the risks about being a vocal supporter of the political opposition, and so, that did limit your participation when you were in Zimbabwe. So, I do accept that you were genuinely a supporter of the MDC, and your family also has links to the MDC, as your uncle was quite high-profile within the party. I also have a sample of your activities on social media, and that includes the post on Twitter that was commented on by the leader of the MDC party, Nelson Chamisa. This does demonstrate an ongoing engagement on social media, where you are clearly expressing your opposition to the regime in Zimbabwe.\n[6] In addition, there is also supporting documents, which include your MDC membership card and support letter from the MDC here in Canada, as well as a medical report, and affidavits, which are consistent with, and corroborate, your allegations in your Basis of Claim form. So, I did find your testimony was very straightforward, and you did not elaborate, or try to embellish your claim in any way. So, I accept what you have alleged in your testimony, and in your Basis of Claim form, and I find you have a subjective fear of return to Zimbabwe.\n[7] I do find that there is a link between what you fear and one of the five Convention grounds, specifically, your political opinions, and so this claim has been assessed under s. 96.\n[8] Now, looking at the country condition documents, the information in there indicates that the ZANU-PF government does continue to crack clown on dissenting voices. Authorities routinely suppress the right to freedom of association and peaceful assembly using lethal and excessive force to disperse peaceful demonstrations. Civil society space is continuing to shrink as a consequence. State security agents continue to use excessive force in dispersing protests and assemblies, opening fire on protesters. So, the information in the NDP also corroborates your allegations about what occurred to you in XXXX of 2019, so, during nation-wide protests in XXXX XXXX XXXX of 2019, following the announcement of the fuel price increase, security forces responded with lethal force, killing at least 17 people, shooting and injuring 81 people, and arresting over 1,000 suspected protesters during door-to-door raids. Following the protests, security forces rounded up and detained hundreds of people, many of whom brought before courts on charges of public violence and criminal nuisance.\n[9] With respect to your social media activities, the information in the NDP also confirms that the government is intolerant of critical online commentary and activism, often invoking vaguely written laws to arrest users. Numerous individuals were arrested for their activities online, and self-censorship remains common among Zimbabweans. The arrest of human rights defenders and opposition figures over their online activism, as well as the government\u2019s threatening statements about posting critical content, increased fear, and inhibited expression, according to local observers. So, the documentary evidence therefore does clearly establish in Zimbabwe, political opponents face serious, sustained, and systemic human rights abuses, as well as threats to free political expression, that cumulatively amount to persecution. So, I do find that you have established a well-founded prospective risk of being subject to a serious risk of persecution if you return to Zimbabwe.\n[10] Looking at the issue of state protection, or internal flight alternative, as the agent of persecution in your particular case is essentially the state, or the supporters of the ruling regime, I do not find that state protection would be reasonably available to you, and, as the government of Zimbabwe does remain in control of its territory, there is nowhere else in Zimbabwe you could safely reside. So, there is no internal flight alternative available for you.\n[11] So, based on all of this evidence, I do find you to be a Convention refugee, and your claim is therefore accepted.\n[12] Thank you.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n",

The minor claimants relied on the principal claimant\u2019s narrative.\n[7] In summary, the claimants allege persecution and risk to their lives at the hands of her ex- common-law husband, XXXX XXXX, a Zulu chief (\u201cChief\u201d) in the neighbouring village.\n[8] The principal claimant alleges that she was born out of wedlock in a rural area called XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in KwaZulu-Natal. Her maternal uncle assumed guardianship and betrothed her to the Chief in exchange for a bride price when she was twelve years of age. The Chief sexually abused the principal claimant.\n[9] The principal claimant alleges that she had an affair and became pregnant with another man\u2019s child and gave birth to her first son on XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. When the child did not resemble the Chief, he ordered a paternity test which revealed that the child was not his. The Chief ordered the child to be killed. The claimants fled XXXX and went to live with a friend in Umlazi, Durban and later found work at the XXXX XXXX XXXX.\n[l 0] The principal claimant alleges that the father of her son died in XXXX 2010 because of a car accident. According to the police, the brakes of his vehicle had been tampered with. The police arrested the perpetrator who confessed that he was hired by a Zulu man. In XXXX 2010, the Chief discovered where the principal claimant had work and sent men to threaten her and her son. These men sent her a message stating that the Chief could find her and her son and they would end up like her son\u2019s father.\n[11] The principal claimant moved to a different part of town. She became involved with another man at work and became pregnant and gave birth to her second son on XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The following year, the Chief found out where she lived and sent four men to assault her and her children. The men told her that since she refused to return home to be with the Chief that no one could have her. She was hospitalized for two weeks.\n[12] The principal claimant filed and received a protection order from the court in XXXX 2015. The principal claimant alleges that she moved to various cities and the Chief would cause problems for her in various placed she relocated to up until the time she left South Africa. The claimants left South Africa on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018 and stayed in the United States until XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018. They arrived in Canada and filed for asylum.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[13] The Panel finds that, on a balance of probabilities, the claimants have established their personal identities and identities as South African citizens through the principal claimant\u2019s testimony and the documentary evidence, in particular, the certified true copies of their South African passports.3\nNexus\n[14] The Panel finds that the claimants have established a nexus to section 96 of the IRPA on account of the principal claimant\u2019s membership in a particular social group \u2014 women fearing gender-based persecution in South Africa and the minor claimants\u2019 membership in a particular social group \u2014 family members of women fearing gender-based persecution.\nCredibility\n[15] Testimony provided under oath is presumed to be truthful unless there is a reason for doubting its truthfulness.4\n[16] The Panel finds that the principal claimant is credible and therefore believes what she has alleged in support of her claim. She testified emotionally, without any embellishments, and there were no inconsistencies in her testimony or contradictions between her testimony and the other evidence before the Panel. She submitted corroborative evidence, namely medical records, copies of protection orders, support letters as well as photos of attacks on one of her sons.5\n[17] The principal claimant\u2019s testimony provided the Panel with insight into the way that the critical events had unfolded and contributed favourably to the finding of credibility. Therefore, the Panel accepts that the claimant subjectively fears persecution at the hands of her husband in South Africa.\n[18] The objective documentary evidence supports the claimants\u2019 allegations regarding gender- based persecution in South Africa.\n[19] According to Tab 5.7 of the National Documentation Package (\u201cNDP\u201d),6 which is a comprehensive report on gender-based violence (\u201cGBV\u201d) in South Africa the two main drivers of intimate femicide are jealousy and possessiveness. These feelings are rooted in notions of masculinity where men see women as their property which they need to maintain power and control over. These men often use guns to intimidate partners especially when they threaten to leave the abusive relationship. In these kinds of relationships, some men kill their partners and themselves. Others kill everyone in the family including children.\n[20] Further, a Response to Information Request (\u201cRIR\u201d) in Tab 5.5 of the NDP states that \u201cthe female homicide rate in South Africa is six times higher than the global average and that approximately half of those women are killed by their partner,\u201d that \u201cdomestic violence is often perceived as \u2018normal,\u2019 contributing to the intergenerational transmission of violence.\u201d7\n[21] Considering the principal claimant\u2019 s testimony and the documentary evidence, the Panel finds that the claimants have established, on a balance of probabilities, that there is an objective basis for the subjective fear of persecution in South Africa.\nState Protection and Internal Flight Alternative\n[22] The implementation of legal instruments has not been shown to be having a positive effect on GBV against women in South Africa. According to a report found at Tab 5.3 of the NDP which assesses legislative amendments made in 1998 to better protect women:\n\u201cLegislators crafted a multi-dimensional system of accountability designed to compel both an individual and an organizational response to domestic violence in South Africa. But legislating accountability was only the minimum condition for its practice, and the mere fact of accountability mechanisms\u2019 existence is not sufficient to ensure effectiveness. Whatever the improvements it is reported that ambivalence still marks the exercise of accountability in relation to domestic violence in South Africa.\u201d8\n[23] Tab 5.7 of the NDP further reports that police do not take GBV seriously:\n\u201cCourts or police stations are often not easily accessible to women and the lack of an effective justice system seems to be an impediment to victims of GBV seeking help, and further increases the risk of more violence and even femicide. Further studies have found that many police officers are unwilling to assist victims of GBV as they see these cases as \u2018private matter between two partners.\u2019 Police officers\u2019 passive and negative attitudes in South Africa often result in secondary victimization and play a role in victims not reporting their cases to the police or withdrawing them after reporting. These studies conclude that legislation is good, but negative attitudes among police officers discourage victims from seeking help. A protection order should serve as a protective factor, but for some women, this actually increases their risk of further violence. Of those women who are killed by their intimate partners in South Africa some are known to have had only recently obtained protection orders.\u201d9\n[24] The police themselves are known to often exploit women and engage in the conduct that they are expected to protect women against. In the RIR found in Tab 5.5 of the NDP, according to sources:\n\u201cThere have been several instances in which police themselves have deviated from protocol and responding to domestic violence cases. Several complaints against police are noted and these include delays in attending to call outs, mediating cases instead of arresting perpetrators and police not taking the experiences of victims seriously. There are even reports of police officers treating abused women poorly. In 2013 there were reports that at least halfa dozen police officers had been arrested for rape themselves including an officer accused of raping a woman who came to the police station to report domestic violence. There are also reports that two police officers were arrested for alleged rape and one of those officers were sentenced to 15 years imprisonment for shooting and killing his girlfriend. And another officer was arrested in the shooting death of another woman he was involved with.\u201d10\n[25] Based on the objective documentary evidence mentioned above, the Panel finds that state protection is not reasonably forthcoming for the principal claimant or the minor claimants m South Africa.\n[26] Lastly, the Panel considered whether a viable Internal Flight Alternative exists. The principal claimant testified that she moved many times in different parts of South Africa. And everywhere she ended up settling down, the Chief had used his connections with the police and the government to locate her. The principal claimant testified that the Chief is motivated to find her because he paid a bride price for her and that he views her as his property. Despite the protection order she obtained against the Chief he continued to torment her and her children wherever they ended up. The principal claimant testified that the Chief was a prominent authority figure in his village and had five other wives prior to paying a bride price to marry the principal claimant. He has demonstrated that he has the resources to pay thugs to do his bidding of threatening and harming the claimants. The Panel, therefore, finds that the agent of persecution has the means and motivation to locate the principal claimant and her children. On the evidence before it, the Panel finds that there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout South Africa, as the objective evidence demonstrates that there is no state protection for victims of gender-based violence in South Africa. The Panel therefore concludes that an Internal Flight Alternative does not exist in the present case.\nCONCLUSION\n[27] Having considered all of the evidence, the Panel finds that the claimants have established that they face a serious possibility of persecution in South Africa based upon their membership in a particular social group \u2013 women fearing gender-based persecution and\/or family members of women fearing gender-based persecution.\nDECISION\n[28] The Panel finds that the claimants XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXandXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX are \u201cConvention refugees\u201d and their claims are accepted.\nNalong Manivong\n18 January 2021\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27, as amended, section 96 and subsection 97(1).\n2 Document 2.1 \u2013 Basis of Claim Form.\n3 Document 1 \u2013 Package of information from the referring Canada Border Services Agency \/ Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada;\n4 Maldonado v.

        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2021 RLLR 2\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: May 12, 2021\nPanel: Suraj Balakrishnan\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Johnson Babalola\nCountry: Uganda\nRPD Number: TB9-27084\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Pages: 000045-000052\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] The claimant, XXXX XXXX alleges that he is a citizen of Uganda, and is claiming refugee protection in Canada pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).\nDETERMINATION\n[2] Having considered all of the evidence, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant has established that he would face a serious possibility of persecution in Uganda because of his religion.\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] The specifics of the claim are set out in the narrative of the claimant\u2019s Basis of Claim Form, as amended.1 The following is a summary of the claimant\u2019 s allegations.\n[4] The claimant alleges to be a citizen of Uganda. He fears being persecuted by the Tabliq, a fundamentalist faction of Ugandan Muslims, because of his Christian proselytization efforts.\nIDENTITY\n[5] The claimant\u2019s personal identity and nationality have been established, on a balance of probabilities, through his testimony, as well as documentation filed; namely, a certified true copy of his Ugandan passport.2\nNEXUS\n[6] The panel finds that there is a nexus between the harms that the claimant fears and his religious views and practices. The claim will therefore be assessed pursuant to section 96 of IRPA. The test under section 96 is whether there is a serious possibility of persecution should the claimant return to Uganda and the panel has found that the claimant has met that test.\nCREDIBILITY\nIdentity as a Christian\n[7] When a claimant affirms to tell the truth, this creates a presumption of truthfulness unless there is evidence to the contrary. The claimant testified in a detailed manner consistent with his BOC about growing up as a Christian and becoming more interested in Christianity during his university days in the United Kingdom. The claimant testified that he became more interested in Christianity in the UK because he would encounter Muslims proselytizing, and he wanted to learn more about Christianity so that he would be able to defend his faith in these discussions.\n[8] The claimant was asked basic questions about Christianity, including the most recent church service he attended, the contents of the sermon, his favorite story from the Bible, and Easter. The claimant\u2019s responses were very detailed. The claimant also provided a copy of his Certificate of Baptism from XXXX XXXX XXXX3, as well as a supporting letter form XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in Canada.4 The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant is a genuine practicing Christian.\nProselytism and Incidents\n[9] When the claimant returned to Kampala, Uganda, he went to a park on three occasions with a friend during May of 2019 where Muslims were proselytizing. On the first visit to the park, the claimant shared his views of Christianity with two of the Muslim proselytizers who were old friends of the claimant\u2019s friend. The claimant did not sense any hostility from the two Muslim proselytizers; they shared a ride back to their respective homes as they had to go in the same direction. On his subsequent visit to the park, the claimant, in his efforts to defend and spread Christianity to the same two Muslim proselytizers, criticized, among other things, the Prophet Muhammad. In response, the Muslim proselytizers became angry and threatened to kill the claimant for insulting the honor of the Prophet Muhammad. The claimant and his friend left the park and decided to visit the park on another day so that they could preach to different Muslim proselytizers. On a third visit to the park, five or six Muslim proselytizers were expressing angry comments and threatening the claimant.\n[10] After his last effort to proselytize, the claimant testified that several incidents took place. First, his security guard informed him of two people behaving suspiciously near the claimant\u2019s home. While the claimant was briefly away in Nigeria to attend a Christian service that he believed would bless him for his personal safety, his mother informed him of an acid attack near her home that she believed, after speaking to others in the area, was an attack intended for the claimant and carried out by the Tabliq. The claimant returned to Uganda and hid in his mother\u2019s home, whereafter there were two additional incidents, including finding a padlock at his mother\u2019s home tampered with and hearing some commotion outside his mother\u2019s home along with Islamic chants. His friend later informed him that these were attempts made by the Tabliq.\n[11] The claimant\u2019s testimony about his proselytization efforts was detailed, consistent with his BOC, and his responses to matters not set forth in his BOC was candid. In particular, the claimant was very detailed in testifying about what he said in his efforts to proselytize. The claimant\u2019 s testimony about the incidents that followed was consistent with his BOC and somewhat detailed, and the claimant was emotionally expressive in his testimony.\n[12] The claimant provided supporting documentation to corroborate his proselytization efforts and the incidents that ensued, including an affidavit from his mother,5 attesting to the incidents that occurred near her home, as well as an original physical copy of a newspaper article in the newspaper titled XXXX XXXX,6 which contains the claimant\u2019s photo and states, apparently based on information provided by the claimant\u2019 s relatives, that the claimant insulted the Prophet Muhammad and has fled Uganda in fear of retaliation from the Tabliq. The claimant testified that the newspaper is circulated nationally, and that the author of the article likely found out about his situation through his mother. The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that these documents help corroborate the claimant\u2019s allegations regarding his proselytization efforts and the incidents that followed.\n[13] Specifically, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant engaged in proselytization efforts; that in the course of proselytizing, he expressed views critical of Islam and the Prophet Muhammad; and that he faced retaliation from the Tabliq.\n[14] Given the credible testimony by the claimant, as well as the corroborating documentation cited above, the panel finds the claimant to be a credible witness. Therefore, the panel believes what the claimant has alleged in support of his claim and finds that his subjective fear of persecution due to his religion is established, on a balance of probabilities.\nOBJECTIVE BASIS\n[15] The objective documentary evidence in the national documentation package is limited and mixed as it relates to problems faced by Christians in Uganda in connection with Islamic religious extremism. One article describes the Tabliq as a fundamentalist faction of Ugandan Muslims, but notes that \u201c[d]ifferent religions do not only coexist but even cooperate\u201d in Uganda.7 Another article, however, notes that Uganda ranks \u201cjust outside the top 50 countries in which Christians are persecuted\u201d8 and reports that \u201cChristian groups living in areas affected by the presence of Islamic extremists face persecution.\u201d9 The article documents several instances of Muslim who convert to Christianity being attacked.10 While the claimant himself is not a convert from Islam to Christianity, he was trying to convert Muslims to Christianity.\n[16] The claimant provided numerous news articles documenting attacks by Islamic religious extremists against Christians, including for expressing views that are offensive to some Muslims and for Christian proselytization.11 These articles document attacks from various regions in Uganda. The claimant also provided an article from the Africa Center for Strategic Studies, which describes the Tabliq as being religiously fundamentalist and having connections to terrorism.12\n[17] The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that while ordinary Christians do not face persecution in Uganda, there is an objective basis to the claimant\u2019s fear of returning to Uganda. This is because (i) the country conditions documents indicate that there are Islamic religious extremists in Uganda who attack Christians who express views offensive to Islam and for Christian proselytization, (ii) the claimant was involved in proselytizing to Islamic religious extremists and the nature of his proselytization involved expressing views that could be construed as offensive or blasphemous to Islamic religious extremists, and (iii) the claimant\u2019s identity and story have been publicized in a widely circulated newspaper. Accordingly, the claimant has a well-founded fear of persecution in Uganda.\nSTATE PROTECTION\n[18] In general, there is a presumption that state protection is available to the claimant and this presumption must be rebutted with clear and convincing evidence. Here, the claimant testified to going to the police after his security guard informed him of two people behaving suspiciously near his home. The claimant testified that the police requested a bribe and suggested that the claimant brought this upon himself by disturbing Muslims.\n[19] The claimant submitted country conditions news articles indicating that the police in Uganda are generally viewed as being very corrupt, including due to bribery.13 In the national documentation package, the Uganda 2020 Crime & Safety Report by the Overseas Security Advisory Council notes that \u201c[d]espite efforts to professionalize and modernize the force, the UPF still struggles with a lack of resources, corruption, and regular reports of human rights violations.\u201d14 Freedom House provides Uganda with a score of 1 out of 4 in each of the subcategories under Rule of Law, including whether due process prevails.15 The United States Department of State notes numerous issues with policing in Uganda, including bribery.16\n[20] The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant has rebutted the presumption of state protection in Uganda. This is because the claimant testified in a detailed and candid manner about trying to obtain state protection and being asked for a bribe, and the country conditions cited above indicate that such corruption is a serious issue in Uganda.\nINTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE\n[21] The panel considered whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for the claimant, particularly in Mbarara, a large city located approximately 270 kilometers away from Kampala, where the claimant engaged in proselytization and faced retaliation.\n[22] The claimant testified that proselytization of the kind of he engaged in is an important part of his religious practice that he would continue to engage in if he were returned to Uganda. Given the claimant\u2019s previous proselytization efforts and his very detailed and expressive testimony about his previous proselytization efforts, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant would continue to proselytize in the manner he did in the past if returned to Uganda. The claimant further testified that he is active on social media, which was supported by a copy of his Facebook activity log.17 According to the claimant, this could make it easier for those pursuing him to track him down. The claimant also testified, in a manner consistent with his BOC, that his mother has received threats directed toward the claimant.\n[23] The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant would face a serious possibility of persecution throughout Uganda. This is because (i) the country conditions documents indicate that attacks by Islamic religious extremists on Christians, including for Christian proselytization, occur in various regions across the country; (ii) the claimant testified that proselytization of the kind he engaged in is important to his religious practice, which suggests that the claimant could draw adverse attention to himself from Islamic religious extremists, including those who are already pursuing him; (iii) the claimant is active on social media, which could make it easier for him to be tracked down; (iv) the claimant\u2019s identity and story, including the allegation that he insulted Prophet Muhammad, have been publicized in a newspaper; and (v) the Tabliq group appears to remain interested in the claimant. These factors indicate that the religious extremists would have the means and motivation to pursue the claimant.\nCONCLUSION\n[24] Having considered all of the evidence, the panel finds that there is a serious possibility of persecution for the claimant in Uganda if the claimant returns to Uganda. The panel finds the claimant to be a Convention refugee and accepts his claim.\n(signed) Suraj Balakrishnan\nMay 12, 2021\n1 Exhibits 2 and 9.\n2 Exhibit 1.\n3 Exhibit 7.\n4 Id.\n5 Id.\n6 Exhibit 13.\n7 Exhibit 3, NDP 30 September 2020, Item 1.4, BTI 2020 Country Report \u2013 Uganda.

The principal claimant was a resident of Italy from XXXX 20056 to XXXX 20197 and was issued an EC Long-Term Residence Permit (\u201cthe Permit\u201d) in late 20188 before the claimants carne to Canada on XXXX, 2019.9 After growing up in Pakistan, the female claimant lived in Germany on a student visa from XXXX 2015 to XXXX 2019 on a series of term student visas.10\nDETERMINATION\n[3] The panel finds the claimants to be Convention refugees under section 96 of the IRPA, based upon their Ahmadi religion.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[4] The claimants\u2019 respective identities as citizens of Pakistan are established by the various documents on file11, including a copy of their respective Pakistani passports12 which were submitted into evidence at the hearing.\n[5] The claimants\u2019 religious identities as members of the Ahmadi faith are established, on a balance of probabilities by their credible oral evidence concerning the nature and history of their faith and their participation in religious activities; as well as various documents entered into evidence. These records include:\nCanadian Ahmadi Certificates13;Ahmadi identity cards;14Ahmadi donation receipts from Canada;15Ahmadi donation receipts from Pakistan;16Ahmadi donation receipts from Italy and Germany;17 andvarious other confirmations of their participation and recognition in the Ahmadi faith.18Credibility\n[6] Both of the claimants gave oral evidence at the hearing. Generally, the panel finds them both to be credible witnesses, particularly with respect to their official marital status in Europe; their status in Italy and the EU and the Permit; and the most significant elements of their claims, including the reasons why they had left both Pakistan and Europe and came to Canada.\nWell-founded fear of Persecution\n[7] As the panel has accepted the claimants\u2019 respective religious identities as members of the Ahmadi faith, and in view of the clear and consistent objective evidence from the National Documentation Package for Pakistan19 that Ahmadis face persecution on religious grounds throughout Pakistan from both state and non-state actors without adequate state protection, the panel finds that there is a serious possibility of persecution for the claimants should they return to Pakistan.\n[8] The claimants have persuasively testified that they fear persecution and violence in Pakistan from various sources including the Pakistani government and religious extremists. This subjective fear is confirmed pervasively in the objective evidence.\n[9] As summarized by the UNCHR in Item 1.8 of the NDP for Pakistan, at p.46, Ahmadis in Pakistan face systemic discrimination and persecution both state-sponsored and from numerous private actors (including religious extremists as raised in the claimants\u2019 oral evidence).20\n\u201cRepressive and discriminatory legislation coupled with State-sanctioned discriminatory practices have reportedly fostered a culture of religious intolerance and impunity. Consequently, members of the Ahmadi community are reportedly left vulnerable to abuse, violence including killings, harassment and intimidation at the hands of members of the community.\u201d\n[10] The British Home Office Report on Ahmadi Muslims21 documents that in 1974, the Pakistani Constitution was amended to declare Ahmadis to be \u201cNon-Muslims\u201c.22 This was followed by a 1984 Amendment to Pakistani Penal Code, which are \u201d \u2026 commonly referred to as the anti-Ahmadi laws\u201c.23\n[11] The objective evidence also records that the systemic state-sanctioned discrimination against Ahmadis is not palliated by correspondingly adequate internal protection. As noted in the aforementioned British Home Office Report at para. 2.5.4:\n\u201cThe perpetrators of violence against religious and sectarian minorities are rarely apprehended and sentenced. There is a pattern of appeasement amongst the police of, and in some cases collusion with, religious extremists pursuing hate campaigns against the [Ahmadi] community.\u201d24\n[12] Beyond police, the NDP also documents that despite the ostensible goal for the judiciary to be \u201c\u2026 the last resort for a persecuted individual\u201d to benefit from the rule of law25, the reality of like in Pakistan is that \u201d \u2026the judiciary itself sometimes promotes tyranny\u201c.26\n[13] The panel is persuaded, based upon the objective evidence from the NDP, that as members of the Ahmadi faith, the claimants face a serious possibility of persecution on this ground, throughout Pakistan, without adequate state protection.\nExclusion \u2013 Article 1E\n[14] The Minister has intervened in this matter in writing. In its \u201cNotice of Intent to Intervene\n-Exclusion 1E,\u201d27 the Minister has taken the position that because the principal claimant obtained the Permit in Italy in 2018,28 he is a permanent resident of Italy, who, along with the female claimant, \u201c\u2026enjoy basic rights substantially similar to those of [Italy\u2019s] nationals\u2026.\u201d29\n[15] According to the Minister, because of the Permit, the principal claimant has permanent status in Italy and rights substantially similar to nationals so as to warrant their exclusion under 1E. With respect to the female claimant, the Minister has offered that \u201cmore likely than not, [the female claimant] already has permanent resident status and\/or has access to permanent resident status as she is the spouse of a permanent resident\u201c.30\n[16] According to the Minister, because the claimants both have this status in Italy, the claimants are excluded from refugee protection under the IRPA by operation of s.98 of the IRPA and Article IE of the Convention which read as follows:\n\u201cA person referred to in section E or F of Article 1 of the Refugee Convention31 is not a Convention Refugee or a person in need of protection\u201d.32\nArticle 1E reads:\n\u201cThis Convention shall not apply to a person who is recognized by the competent authorities of the country in which he has taken residence as having the rights and obligations which are attached to the possession of the nationality of that country\u201d.33\n[17] The potential exclusion of the claimants was the principal focus of the hearing. The leading case on exclusion under Article 1E is the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v. Zeng34 which has been applied by the panel.\nCurrent Status of the Claimants in Italy\n[18] The Minister contends that because the claimants have status in Italy \u2013 the principal claimant by the Permit and the female claimant by marriage to the principal claimant- they have rights in Italy which are substantially similar to nationals of that country.\n[19] This determination for each claimant must be made on the evidence.\nCurrent Status of the Principal Claimant in Italy\n[20] The panel is satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, on the evidence before it, that the principal claimant was granted the Permit during 2018. However, the objective evidence of the NDP for Italy35 shows that the status and rights accorded under the permit are lost by a person spending more than 12 consecutive months outside of the European Union.36 Two Response to Information Requests in the NDP for Italy confirm that a Permit is \u201c\u2026 voided if the person is absent from Europe for 12 consecutive months\u201d.37 This objective evidence further stipulates that status accorded under the Permit can be revoked if the resident no longer meets the requirements38, such as an annual income requirement.39\n[21] The evidence before the panel is that the claimants have been in Canada (without leaving) since XXXX 2019. Accordingly, based upon this objective evidence, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities that, at the time of the hearing, having remained out of Italy for over 12 months, the principal claimant\u2019 s status in Italy will have expired.\nStatus of the Female Claimant\n[22] The Minister\u2019s position is the female claimant acquired status in Italy under the Permit by marriage to the principal claimant. As noted in the Minister\u2019 s Brief:\n\u201d \u2026 the Minister is of the opinion that the [female claimant] has permanent resident status in Italy via spousal sponsorship\u201d.40\n[23] However, in the panel\u2019s view, this conclusion is not supported, on a balance of probabilities, by the evidence before it. Both the principal claimant and female claimant credibly testified that despite their religious marriage by proxy (from Italy and Germany respectively through the Whatsapp application) in XXXX 2016,41 attempts by the previously-married principal claimant to obtain proof from the Pakistani Consulate in Milan Italy (in the form of a \u201cNo Objection Certificate\u201d) that he was free to enter into a civil marriage with the female claimant were refused.42 Similar efforts by the female claimant to register the marriage in Germany were also unsuccessful.\n[24] The evidence before the panel is that the claimants\u2019 marriage has not been officially registered with any European authority, including in Italy. Accordingly, the panel has no evidence before it to demonstrate, on a balance of probabilities, that any benefit would be extended to the female claimant as a spouse; or that there is any overt sponsorship or sponsorship of the female claimant under the Permit by operation of law.\n[25] Accordingly, the panel is not satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that the female claimant has permanent resident status in Italy or Europe or rights under the Permit.\nPrevious Status in Italy\/EU \u2013 Principal Claimant\n[26] The objective evidence from the NDP for Italy43 shows that the Permit, while conveying a wealth of substantive rights44, confers status which is vulnerable to being lost or taken away from individuals such as the principal claimant on a variety of listed grounds.45\n[27] As noted by the Federal Court in Shamlou v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration),46 (quoting with approval Lorne Waldman, Immigration Law and Practice) at para. 35:\n\u201cIf the applicant has some sort of temporary status which must be renewed, and which could be cancelled, or if the applicant does not have the right to return to the country of residence, clearly the applicant should not be excluded under Art. 1E.\u201d [emphasis added].\n[28] In the panel\u2019s view, the objective evidence clearly indicates that the principal claimant\u2019s Permit could be cancelled on a number of grounds,47 including that \u201d \u2026 the bearer no longer fulfills the requirements for its issue\u201d48 including a stipulated income requirement. 49 In the panel\u2019s view, the principal claimant has provided credible evidence of chronic income instability during most of his time in Italy. The panel is satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that the principal claimant is credible in his testimony s that because of the precarious status of his employment in Italy (comprised mostly by a series of contracts with various enterprises), aside from the issue of his absence (as noted above), he is vulnerable to having the Permit revoked on the grounds that he has not met the requisite income threshold.\n[29] Per Shamlou50, on the totality of evidence, because the Permit is vulnerable to being cancelled on multiple grounds, the panel finds on a balance of probabilities, that the principal claimant did not have status in Italy substantially similar to that of an Italian\/EU national.\n[30] Further, as the panel has no evidence before it to indicate that the female claimant was conferred any rights, transitory or otherwise, under the Permit, it finds that she does not have status substantially similar to that of an Italian or EU national.\n[31] Accordingly, the panel finds that the claimants should not be excluded under Article 1E of s.98 of the IRPA.\nCONCLUSION\n[32] For the reasons as above noted, the panel finds the claimants to be Convention refugees and accept their claims.\n(signed) Roderick Flynn\nJune 15, 2021\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c.27, as amended (hereinafter \u201cthe IRPA\u201d).\n2 Exhibit 2.1 and 2.2, \u201cXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, (hereinafter \u201cthe\nNarrative\u201d)\n3 Exhibit 2.1 and Exhibit 2.2.\n4 Narrative, para. 1.\n5 Ibid., para. 48.\n6 Ibid., para. 14.\n7 Ibid, para. 46.\n8 Ibid, para. 16.\n9 Ibid, para. 46.\n10 Ibid., para. 35, para. 43-46.\n11 Exhibit 4 includes multiple identity documents for both claimants, both photographic and non-photographic, including their National Identity Cards starting at p.66.\n12 Exhibit 1.\n13 Exhibit 4, p.1.-2.\n14 Ibid, p.3.\n15 Ibid., p.5-6.\n16 Ibid., p.16.\n17 Ibid, p.20-31.\n18 Ibid, p.37-60.\n19 Exhibit 3.1, NDP for Pakistan.\n20 Ibid.\n21 Ibid, \u201cCountry Policy and Information Note.
