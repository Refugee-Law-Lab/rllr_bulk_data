The principal claimant has alleged that both herself and her child have been pursued by ongoing threats and violence by her spouse\u2019s former partner, who has four children with him, and who has continued to be involved in his life.\n\nIdentity\n\n[7] The claimants\u2019 personal identities as citizens of the Bahamas have been established by certified copies of their passports.\n\n[8] The panel therefore finds that the claimants have established their identities, on a balance of probabilities.\n\nNexus\n\n[9] Given the claimants\u2019 allegations, their claim will be assessed pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA, with the nexus being the claimants\u2019 membership in a particular social group: women and their children facing domestic-related violence that is unique to women.\n\nCredibility\n\nIntroduction\n\n[10] When a claimant swears that certain facts are true, this creates a presumption that they are true, unless there is valid reason to doubt their truthfulness. Hence, as a corollary, there is no general legal requirement for a claimant to corroborate sworn testimony that is uncontradicted and otherwise credible.\n\n[11] In terms of the principal claimant\u2019s general credibility, and in light of the evidence below, the panel has found her to be credible witnesses and the panel therefore accepts what she has alleged in her oral testimony and in her basis of claim form. The panel found her testimony to be credible because there were no major contradictions or omissions that went to the core of her claim, and because her testimony was spontaneous and detailed. Additionally, the panel found her corroborative evidence to be reliable, trustworthy, and as such, the panel assigns it full weight in supporting her credibility in relation to her allegations as well as her allegations as they apply to the minor claimant.\nThe principal claimant provided credible evidence of how her persona! circumstances led bath herself and the minor claimant to be exposed to persecution\n\n[12] The principal claimant, who is currently 24 years old, testified that she was only 18 or 19 years old when she moved in with the father of the minor claimant, DW,[4] who was some ten years older than her. When her child, the minor claimant was born, she was about 21 years old. The panel accepts as credible the claimant\u2019s evidence that her circumstances in the Bahamas at the time that she started her relationship with DW were challenging. The principal claimant disclosed that her education comprised completing high school and that her only work history was as a XXXX for some three years. The principal claimant detailed how her mother had passed away in 2004, that she was not in contact with her father, and that her only other caregiver, her grandmother, with whom she lived after her mother passed away, also passed away about a year before she moved in with DW. She also testified about how she and her siblings all grew up separately because their mother passed away at such a young age. She also detailed how two out of her three brothers have left the Bahamas, with the third brother only recently returning. The principal claimant also testified, credibly, that the brother who returned to the Bahamas and who was her only remaining close relation in the Bahamas, has too many responsibilities at the time to be in a position to help her, should she and her child return. She also testified that she initially attempted to keep her relationship with DW a secret from her siblings, because she worried what they, as her older brothers, would think of it, and this isolated her. By way of corroboration, the principal claimant\u2019s brother who also attended the hearing to assist her, testified about their difficult family situation, and how they lost their parents at early ages. He also recounted the hardships that the principal claimant had experienced throughout her life by means of a detailed letter.[5]\n\n[13] The principal claimant also testified, credibly, that although her relationship with DW started well, it turned out to be an abusive one, and the panel acknowledges that after her child was born, she was left without many options. As the principal claimant detailed, her personal situation was made more precarious because DW had only recently ended a relationship with another woman, with whom he had lived with for some time previously and had four children with. The panel acknowledges that the principal claimant\u2019s familial and personal situation in the Bahamas likely left her without meaningful family or support mechanisms and this affected her domestic situation, as well as the situation of her child.\nThe principal claimant gave credible evidence about the nature of the threats that she and her child faced\n\n[14] The panel accepts as credible the principal claimant\u2019s evidence about the initial threats that she experienced from the former partner of her child\u2019s father, DW, which included confrontational visits to their apartment, and the panel recognizes that early into their relationship, her home became an unsafe place for her to reside in. The principal claimant testified, credibly, about how, while she was expecting her child, the former partner of the child\u2019s father reacted in a threatening manner. She testified that she knew that DW\u2019s former partner and her four children had been financially dependent upon him and that she feared how this new relationship would impact upon her and her four children, and this made her blame the principal claimant for her predicament. She testified that she had heard how the former partner, who was from a different settlement which was only ten minutes away, was making threats against her, and telling her own family that she would make the principal claimant\u2019s life a \u201cliving hell.\u201d She also testified that she feared the family and neighbours of the former partner, whom she heard came from a violent family which was known to be hostile to people from the principal claimant\u2019s settlement area.\n\n[15] The principal claimant described how these threats escalated by the time that she was four months pregnant, when the former partner came over to the principal claimant\u2019 s home and proceeded to call her by abusive name. The principal claimant testified that she hoped that she could deescalate their situation, but instead the former partner proceeded to physically assault her, putting both herself and her unborn child in danger. According to the principal claimant, she was ultimately able to protect her unborn child by lying on the floor in a particular position, and the assault only ended when the neighbours, who heard what was going on, came in to intercede. The claimant also described how she reported the attack by DW\u2019s former partner to the police, and how they simply told her to \u201ctalk it out\u201d with DW and his former partner.\n\n[16] Although the principal claimant did not provide corroborating evidence of this attack or her report of it to the police, the panel understands how it would be difficult to obtain such evidence under the circumstances, and, in any event, the panel accepts her evidence, which was uncontradicted and consistent, as credible. The panel also acknowledges that there is objective evidence of how violence against women is often not taken seriously by state authorities, as will be delineated in the country conditions evidence below. The principal claimant further described how the former partner made further threats, which the panel acknowledges were essentially death threats, against her. The principal claimant also detailed threatening text messages that she received from the former partner, but these stopped when she changed her mobile number. Even though the principal claimant did not provide printouts of these text messages, the panel accepts her evidence about the text messages as credible and understands why it was not likely feasible for the principal claimant to retain these messages. The principal claimant also testified, credibly, that she began to notice how cars were frequently following her, and she feared that this was at DW\u2019s former partner\u2019s direction.\n\n[17] The claimant therefore left the Bahamas for Canada in XXXX 2019, when her child the minor claimant was about three months old. She testified that even though she was still living with DW at the time, she did not feel safe, particularly because she had another altercation with his former partner. She also testified that she felt that she was living under a mentally abusive situation with DW by then, which was only exacerbated by the abuse coming from his former partner. The principal claimant further testified that her partner\u2019s abusive treatment of her was a symptom in large part because of his conflicted feelings over his previous relationship. As such, she testified that she did not tell DW that she was leaving the country at the time, because she could not trust him to support this decision, or even to let her leave. However, the principal claimant did clarify at the hearing, that since coming to Canada, she became aware that DW had also left the Bahamas for Canada and is here on a visitor\u2019s visa, and as noted[6], he retroactively gave his permission for the minor claimant to remain in Canada with the principal claimant. However, the principal claimant testified that DW is not living with her, and that she was not aware of what his long-term plans were or if and when he was going to return to the Bahamas. The panel acknowledges that the uncertainty that the principal claimant and the minor claimant likely face regarding DW\u2019s long-term plans likely add to the unpredictability and instability of their domestic situation, should they return to the Bahamas.\n\n[18] The panel also recognizes how the ongoing threats that the claimants from DW\u2019s former partner were a symptom of the precarious domestic situation that the claimants were living in, and were also a by-product of the abusive situation that the principal claimant found herself in. The panel acknowledges how, as the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline on Women Facing Gender-Related Persecution recognizes, the principal claimant, and by extension her child, are facing a persecution that is \u201coften unique to women,\u201d and how the situation she faces, together with the circumstances of her agent of persecution who is also a woman who likely also has experienced a difficult domestic relationship, are rooted in \u201cfemale-specific experiences.\u201d[7]\n\n[19] The panel therefore finds that the claimants\u2019 evidence of their living conditions and personal circumstances provide credible support to their allegation that were members of a particular social group: women and their children facing gender-related violence.\nThe claimants have established that they face a serious and forward-looking possibility of persecution\n\n[20] The panel finds that the principal claimant\u2019s former partner, DW, who is also the father of the minor claimant\u2019s father, is also corroborative of their allegations inasmuch as he acknowledges that there a dangerous situation still awaits them should they return, and he specifically mentions his fear that his son the minor claimant could be in danger should he return. In DW\u2019s recent letter of permission for the minor claimant to be in Canada with the principal claimant, he stated that he knew that his \u201cson was in danger and needed to be in a safe place with his mother. My son is in good health and now out of danger. I know during the time it was the best move to make for the safety of my son and I fully agree with it.\u201d[8]\n\n[21] One of the principal claimant\u2019s brothers, who assisted her as an unpaid counsel at the hearing, also testified about how members of different settlements tend to engage in violence against each other, and because DW\u2019s former partner was from another settlement, he feared that the claimants would face ongoing threats as a result. He also testified about how, while he lived in the Bahamas, he knew of how violent the former partner\u2019s family was, and how regretted that he was not living in the Bahamas, where he might have been able to help to protect her. He also expressed his fear that disputes between these two families had a tendency to become violent and potentially fatal, given that the occupants of these settlements that were known to engage in violence with each other. He also testified that these disputes also often also brought in the involvement of criminal gangs. In a letter of support that he wrote for the claimants, he stated, in part, that he was so concerned about the threats that he heard that both his sister and his nephew were experiencing, and \u201c[k]nowing that my sister is living on a small island with no other family members other than her newborn son\u2026 I just told her to \u2018pack your stuff and I\u2019ll pay for your ticket to come to me.\u201d[9] The panel acknowledges that given the personal situation that the claimants are likely to face should they return to the Bahamas, particularly in light of the fact that the minor claimant\u2019s father may not himself return to the Bahamas, could lead them to be even more vulnerable to danger as a result of their precarious domestic situation, and to harm at the hands of their agent of persecution, who is essentially also a party to the difficult domestic situation experienced by the claimants. The panel also finds that the principal claimant gave credible testimony about how, by the time they left the Bahamas, their domestic situation with DW was so precarious that she no longer felt safe living with him due to what she testified was the mental abuse she suffered from him due to his conflicted position caused by his relationship with his former partner and her children.\n\nConclusion\n\n[22] Therefore, in light of the claimants\u2019 credible evidence, the panel finds that the claimants have established their subjective fear of persecution in the Bahamas on the basis of their membership in a particular social group: women and their children facing domestic-related violence that is unique to women.\n\nObjective Evidence\n\n[23] The objective evidence reveals that violence against women is viewed to be a significant, and largely unresolved, problem in the Bahamas. A United Nations report has \u201clisted the Bahamas as one of the three Caribbean countries considered to be among the top ten countries globally recognized as having high rates of rape and sexual violence.\u201d[10] It has been observed that \u201cViolence against women [in the Caribbean] is widespread and normalised. It is estimated that one in three women in the Caribbean will experience domestic violence.\u201d[11] In addition, \u201cPatriarchal attitudes and deep-rooted stereotypes regarding the roles, responsibilities and identities of women and men in Bahamian families continue, including for example the belief that men are breadwinners and women are family caretakers. This stereotype persists despite the high academic and economic achievement of women and leads to unconscious bias and discrimination against women in public and private life. It also perpetuates sex-based inequalities in all areas of life and the normalization of violence against women.\u201d[12] According to one source, \u201c45 per cent of all homicides over the last 20 years [in the Bahamas] could be attributed to domestic violence.\u201d[13]\n\n[24] In a more general sense, objective observers have found the high crime rate to be a significant safety concern in the Bahamas. According to a 2020 report of the United States \u201cOverseas Security Advisory Council,\u201d travelers to the Bahamas should \u201cExercise increased caution in the Bahamas due to crime\u2026. Crime remains the country\u2019s primary security threat.\u201d[14]\nAccording to one international study, \u201ccrime and violence are permeating the social fabric of Bahamian communities\u2026. [T]he data reveals that the most violent crimes, -specifically murder,\nrape and armed robbery -have seen steady increases over the last five to ten years. The murder rate has more than doubled in the last 10 years\u2026. The primary victims of murder are young\nmales (18-25 years old), killed with a firearm as a result of unresolved conflicts and retaliation.\u201d[15] Gang membership in the Bahamas has been observed as being attractive to \u201cyouth who feel marginalized from society or disconnected from their extended family until due to the perception that \u2018gangs can offer protection, respect within their community, money and a sense of power.\u201d[16] One study has estimated that, as of 2010, some \u201c20,000 individuals belonged to a gang in the Bahamas, the majority of whom were between the ages of 14 and 35.\u201d[17] There are an estimated 46 known gangs in the Bahamas, creating an \u201c\u2018active gang scene\u2019 in the Bahamas that is \u2018comprised mainly of low-level street gangs\u2019 that engage in activities such as drug trafficking, human trafficking and arms smuggling.\u201d[18]\n\n[25] The panel therefore finds that there is an objective basis for the claimants\u2019 subjective fear of persecution on the basis of their exposure to the ongoing prospect of threats and violence at the hands of their agent of persecution that are rooted in domestic situations that are unique to women. Therefore, the panel finds that the claimants\u2019 fear of persecution is well-founded.\n\nState Protection\n\n[26] The claimants have established that their efforts to have the violence they were facing violence addressed by the police did not result in their concerns being taken seriously. Objective observers have \u201cnoted that crimes, including violence against women and girls, were often met with a lack of accountability and appropriate remedies, and practices that re-victimized those who made complaints. The US State Department Human Rights Report on the Bahamas noted that among the main concerns were police abuse and challenges within the judicial system evident in delays in trial and witness intimidation; all of this directly affects reporting by victims of violence, impedes effective remedies and accountability, and places doubt rather confidence in the system.\u201d[19] \u201cIn addition to underreporting by victims interlocutors suggested that violence against women was generally not seen as [a] priority or as a serious concern unless the crime was excessively gruesome and\/or involved a child victim.\u201d[20] Indeed, \u201csome women\u2019s rights groups have noted a hesitancy from law officials to intervene in domestic disputes.\u201d[21] Furthermore, \u201cBarriers faced by those who .. wish to report a rape case include discriminatory attitudes towards women and girls from law enforcement officials due to a culture of disbelief, victim blaming, as well as low conviction rates, the large number of cases that remain unsolved and\/or perpetrators never being identified.\u201d[22]\n\n[27] In a more general sense, the state has not been observed to be successful at bringing charges against suspected criminals, or in successfully convicting them. \u201cSince the beginning of 2010, it has been reported that the average clearance rate [percentage of cases where charges are laid][23] has been 61 percent for murder cases and 40 percent for rape cases.\u201d[24] International observers have noted that the \u201cinability of the OAG [the Office of the Attorney General] and the judiciary to expeditiously prosecute criminal cases has led to both a lack of faith in the rule of law and extreme prison overcrowding.\u201d[25] Furthermore, \u201cMany criminal cases remain among an ever-increasing backlog and a diminishing number of convictions \u2026 Of the small percentage of cases that went to trial, 42 percent resulted in convictions, 29 percent in not guilty verdicts, and 29 percent were dismissed (due to mistrial or lack of evidence, among other reasons\u2026. [O]nly\n5.1 percent of murder cases resulted in convictions.\u201d[26]\n\n[28] In light of the objective evidence of the poor rate of charges and convictions for violent crimes and violent domestic crimes, and of the inability of the state and of the police to adequately protect victims of violence, particularly female victims, as well as the state\u2019s inability to effectively violent crime in general, the panel finds that, should the claimants return to the Bahamas, adequate state protection will not be available to them. As such, the panel finds that the claimants have rebutted the presumption of state protection.\n\nInternal Flight Alternative\n\n[29] The test to be applied in determining whether there is a viable internal flight alternative is two-pronged.[27]\n\n[30] Firstly, the panel must be satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that there is no risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or danger of torture in the proposed internal flight alternative location, or, on a balance of probabilities, there is no serious possibility of persecution in the proposed internal flight alternative location. This part of the test is commonly known as the \u201csafety prong.\u201d\n\n[31] Secondly, the conditions in the proposed internal flight alternative location must be such that it would not be objectively unreasonable in all the circumstances, including those particular to the claimant, for her to seek refuge there. This part of the test is commonly known as the \u201creasonableness prong.\u201d\n\n[32] Both of these prongs must be satisfied for a finding that the claimants have a viable internal flight alternative.\n\n[33] In light of the claimants\u2019 evidence, as well as the objective evidence of country conditions, including the inadequacy of state protection, the panel finds that test for a viable internal flight alternative fails on the first prong.\n\n[34] The Bahamas is a geographically small country, totalling 10,010 square kilometers of land, and, for comparison purposes, it is slightly smaller than the U.S. state of Connecticut.[28] Although the country consists of a chain of islands, the population of the Bahamas is heavily urbanized, comprising 83.2% of its inhabitants, with two thirds of the Bahamian people living on New Providence Island, where Nassau is located.[29] Given the small size of the country and the heavy concentration of its population, the panel is left with few viable internal flight options to consider. The principal claimant gave credible evidence of how their agent of harm has continuously monitored the claimants, given that she too is essentially a member of their extended family via her status as the mother of four children of the principal claimant\u2019s former spouse. The principal claimant\u2019 s brother also corroborated how the families of the former spouse as well as their own family were well-known to the other and were prone to resolving their disputes with violence, possibly with the assistance of gangs. In light of these circumstances, the panel finds that the claimants\u2019 agent of persecution likely has the means to locate the claimants throughout the Bahamas, particularly in light of their credible evidence that she has a family known for its violent members and who are therefore likely to assist her. In contrast, the claimants have very few relatives remaining in the Bahamas to assist them, apart from one brother who as the principal claimant testified, credibly, was not likely to provide any support for her because he is experiencing problems of his own.\n\n[35] The panel also finds that the claimant\u2019s agent of persecution likely has the motivation to find them, given the principal claimant\u2019 s, as well as her brother\u2019 s credible testimony about how DW\u2019s former partner likely still harbours ill feelings over the claimant\u2019s supplanting her own relationship with DW, and in light of the claimant\u2019s credible evidence ofhow she, as the mother of four children, likely finds herself motivated by revenge due to the precarious personal and financial situation she likely faces as a result of her break-up with DW. DW himself also stated in his letter of permission for the minor claimant to remain in Canada that he was concemed for his son\u2019s safety,[30] and the panel finds that this, too, corroborates the claimants\u2019 allegations that his former partner likely still poses a threat to not only the principal claimant but to the minor claimant as well.\n\n[36] Therefore, the panel is not satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that there is no risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or danger of torture or, on a balance of probabilities, a serious possibility of persecution in an internal flight alternative location.\n\n[37] As such, the panel finds that there is no viable internal flight alternative for the claimants in their particular circumstances throughout the Bahamas.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[38] Based on the totality of the evidence, the panel finds that the claimants will face a serious possibility of persecution in the Bahamas pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA, should they return to the Bahamas.\n\n[39] Their claims for protection are therefore accepted.\n\n(signed) Joseph Berkovits\n\nMay 13, 2022\n\n[1] The principal claimant provided a letter from the minor claimant\u2019s father, dated March 22, 2022, to be found at Exhibit 6, Claimant Disclosure, whereby he grants his permission to her to have brought him to Canada with her, and states, in part, that \u201cMy son was in danger and needed to be in a safe place with his mother.

        "unofficial_text":"2022 RLLR 138\n\nCitation: 2022 RLLR 138\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: August 9, 2022\nPanel: Victoria Bragues\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Hart A Kaminker\nCountry: Iran\nRPD Number: TB9-35046\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2023-01023\nATIP Pages: N\/A\n\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n\n[1] XXXX (the claimant) claims refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).[1]\n\n[2] On June 28, 2021, the Board received a notice from the minister outlining their intent to intervene in this claim on the issue of credibility, in writing.[2] The minister did not appear at the hearing, and therefore they did not question the claimant or provide submissions regarding the credibility of the claimant\u2019s testimony at the hearing.\n\n[3] Counsel provided written submissions, as agreed upon at the hearing, which were received on July 25, 2022.\n\nDETERMINATION\n\n[4] I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee for the following reasons.\n\nALLEGATIONS\n\n[5] The claimant\u2019s allegations are found in his Basis of Claim (BOC) Form and the amendment made.[3] In summary, the claimant fears persecution at the hands of the Awami League due to his involvement and support of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).\n\n[6] He also raises a fear of persecution at the hands of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP-Jamat) due to his involvement in supporting the Awami League (AL) in the December 2008 elections; and the Jamat Ul Mujahideen Bangladeshi (JMB) due to his practice of the Christian faith in Canada. However, considering I have found this claim to be determinative based upon the claimant\u2019s allegations related to his support of the LDP, only those allegations will be addressed.\n\nIDENTITY\n\n[7] The claimant\u2019 s personal identity and Bangladeshi citizenship have been established, on a balance of probabilities, through the supporting documentation filed, namely, a certified true copy of his passport, and a copy of his birth certificate.[4]\n\nNEXUS\n\n[8] I find that there is a nexus between the harms that the claimant fears and a Convention ground, namely, real or imputed political opinion. Therefore, this claim will be assessed pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA. The test under section 96 is whether there is a serious possibility of persecution should the claimant returns to Bangladesh. I find that the claimant has met this test.\n\nCREDIBILITY\n\n[9] In considering credibility, I have considered all the evidence, including the oral testimony and documentary evidence entered as exhibits. I have also considered the claimant\u2019 s level of education,[5] and am cognizant of the difficulties faced by individuals in establishing their claims, including cultural factors, the milieu of the hearing room, and the stress inherent in responding to the questions put to them.\n\n[10] When a claimant swears the truth to certain allegations, this creates a presumption that they are true, unless there is reason to doubt their truthfulness.[6] The determination as to whether a claimant\u2019 s evidence is credible is made on a balance of probabilities.[7] An important indicator of credibility is the consistency with which a witness tells his story, and the existence of inconsistencies can be a valid basis for finding a lack of credibility.\n\n[11] The claimant\u2019s testimonies were consistent, credible, and straightforward with his evidence. There were no major inconsistencies or omissions that went to the heart of this claim, or that were not otherwise reasonably explained. As such, I find him to be a credible witness, and I believe what he has alleged.\n\n[12] The claimant submitted a number of documents in support of his claim, which include: a membership letter confirming the claimant\u2019s involvement and support of the LDP, that he leased his property to the LDP, and the issues he faced as a result; copies of police complaints made following the incidents that occurred at the hands of Awami League goons; documentation confirming the claimant\u2019s father\u2019s kidnapping in June 2020 at the hands of Awami League goons; medical documentation confirming that his mother sought treatment following the May 13, 2020 incident; as well as letters of support from the claimant\u2019 s family and relatives corroborating the issues the claimant faces at the hands of the Awami League.[8]\n\n[13] I find that, on a balance of probabilities, through his testimony and the supporting documents, the claimant has established that:\nhe began to support the LDP in XXXX 2008; he was involved in LDP functions, he XXXXduring the 2008 elections, because there was no local LDP candidate to vote for, he supported the Awami League in the elections; this led to him being targeted by the JMB, and ultimately led him to flee to the United States (US), where he lived for roughly 10 years without status;in March 2020, the claimant inherited land; renovations were done to this property; one room was eventually leased to the LDP so they could use it as a local office; the claimant signed the lease agreement on May 1, 2020, from Canada;as a result of this, the claimant and his family became known to the Awami League; on May 13, 2020, the claimant\u2019s family home was attacked and the claimant\u2019s mother required medical treatment; this was reported to the police, but to no avail;the claimant\u2019s parents attempted to relocated to Khulna; on May 20, 2020, the claimant\u2019s parents were attacked;they relocated to Sylhet; on June 21, 2020, the claimant\u2019s father was kidnapped, tortured, and held for ransom; he was forced to sign unknown documents; he required medical treatment upon release;the claimant\u2019 s parents then relocated to and remain in hiding in Rajshahi, where they continue to receive phone threats from the Awami League;his father has since passed away;he has not supported the LDP while in the US or Canada, out of fear of reprisals to his family; though, he wishes to continue to support the LDP if he were to return to Bangladesh.[14] As noted above, the minister intervened on the issue of credibility, specifically related to the claimant\u2019s allegations of fear at the hands of the BJP due to his support of the Awami League. First, the minister\u2019s position is that the claimant provided unclear or conflicting evidence regarding his involvement with the Awami League, and that ultimately the claimant did not have any involvement with the Awami League and therefore he was not at risk when he left Bangladesh in XXXX 2009.\n\n[15] I canvassed this issue at the hearing, and put these issues pointed out by the minister to the claimant. I found the claimant\u2019 s testimony regarding these perceived discrepancies to be clear and reasonable. Specifically, the claimant was straightforward and spontaneous in his responses, and he clearly explained how he supported the Awami League solely for the purposes of the 2008 elections, because he did not have an LDP candidate to support at that time. In fact, I found that his testimony in this regard, supports the claimant\u2019 s responses in the interview referenced by the minster. As such, I do not find that the claimant\u2019s credibility is undermined in this regard.\n\n[16] Secondly, the minister submits that the claimant lived in the US without status for almost a decade, without claiming protection, which ultimately demonstrates a lack of subjective fear. I canvassed this issue at the hearing. The claimant explained that he was fearful of making a claim in the US, because he spoke to people within the community, as well as a couple of lawyers in the US, who advised him that he would not be successful. I find this explanation to be reasonable. I further find that this alone is insufficient to undermine the claimant\u2019s subjective fear or credibility.\n\n[17] Notwithstanding I note that again, I found that this claim to be determinative based upon the claimant\u2019 s fear resulting from his support of the LDP, and most of those allegations transpired after the claimant arrived in Canada. I do acknowledge that the claimant did not make mention of this fear or related allegations in his original BOC. However, as credibly explained by the claimant at the hearing, he only became aware that he should include these allegations after he met with his current counsel around February 2022. Notwithstanding this, I also note that the claimant indicates that he supported the LDP in his interview with an immigration officer in March of 2021. In consideration of all the evidence before me, I find that the claimant has established that he supported the LDP, and I do not draw any negative credibility inferences in this regard.\n\n[18] Based upon the claimant\u2019s amended BOC, that he mentioned his support of the LDP in his interview with an immigration officer in March 2021, the supporting documentation file, and his credible testimony, I find that, on a balance of probabilities, he has established his subjective fear in this regard, and I believe what he has alleged, on a balance of probabilities.\n\nOBJECTIVE BASIS\n\n[19] I find that the claimant\u2019s fear in Bangladesh is supported by the objective evidence. First, the objective documentation contained in the National Documentation Package confirms that the Awami League is the ruling party in Bangladesh, and that they are known to take strong, strict or violent action against those who oppose them, including routine detentions, torture, extrajudicial killings by state agents.[9] The evidence also confirms that the Awami League and its auxiliary organisations are known to engage in criminal activities, including violence and extortion.\n\n[20] Secondly, the objective evidence is also overwhelming clear that corruption is an issue in Bangladesh generally, including within the police force and the judicial system.[10] Though the law provides for an independent judiciary, in practice, it is compromised. The United States Department of State reports that, \u201c\u2026 magistrates, attorneys, and court officials demanded bribes from defendants in many cases, or courts ruled based on influence from or loyalty to political patronage networks.\u201d[11] The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade states that \u201cvictims of abuse have limited avenues for effective recourse in cases where the perpetrator belongs to a state agency.\u201d[12]\n\n[21] Finally, I do acknowledge that the objective documentation indicates that the LDP is a small political party, and less likely to be a concern for the ruling party.[13] However, it also specifically indicates that:\nmembers are \u201clikely\u201d to receive the same treatment as members of other opposition parties \u201cif and when they take part in political programme\u201d \u2026 the Awami League government is \u201cincreasingly using imprisonment, detention without trial, and show trials to silence the opposition,\u201d and expressed the opinion that since the BNP has been the target of political violence, the LDP likely has suffered the same\u2026[14]\n[22] In this case, the claimant was directly supporting and providing office space to the LDP. He also established that he supported the LDP previously in Bangladesh in canvassing and events, and that he would continue to do so in Bangladesh.\n\n[23] In consideration of all the evidence before me, I find that on a balance of probabilities, the claimant has established an objective basis for their fear in Bangladesh. As the claimant has established their subjective fear and an objective basis for that fear, I find that he has established a well-founded fear of persecution, on a balance of probabilities.\n\nSTATE PROTECTION\n\n[24] Claimants are expected to exhaust all recourses of protection before making a claim, except in situations where the agents of the state are themselves the source of persecution.[15] Claimants cannot be expected to risk their lives in seeking ineffective protection.[16]\n\n[25] Considering that the agents of persecution in this claim are members of the Awami League, and that the Awami League is an agent of the state itself, I find that, on a balance of probabilities, the claimant has rebutted the presumption of state protection with clear and convincing evidence, and that adequate state protection would not be reasonably available to him, in his particular circumstances.\n\nINTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE\n\n[26] The test for an internal flight alternative (IFA) is two-fold, as set out by the Federal Court of Appeal in the case of Rasaratnam.[17] First, I must find that the claimant would be safe in this city, and secondly that it would be reasonable to expect that he relocates there. In order to render an IFA not viable, I must reject one of these prongs. I find that, on a balance of probabilities, the test for an IFA fails on the first prong in the present case.\n\n[27] The claimant has established that his agents of persecution is the Awami League, and therefore agents of the state. He has also established that they successfully located the claimant\u2019s parents after they attempted to relocate to Khulna and Sylhet, and that his mother continues to receive threatening calls from Rajshahi. Therefore, I find that the claimant has established that his agent of persecution has the means and motivation to locate and harm him anywhere in Bangladesh, and that it would not be able to relocate anywhere in Bangladesh to escape the harm that he fears, on a balance of probabilities, and he has established that an IFA is not available to him.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[28] In consideration of the totality of the evidence, I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA. This claim is accepted.\n\n(signed) V.

She was a Christian and she spoke about her religion. They had a secret relationship for a year, and he asked her to marry him. The claimant is a Muslim, and his parents were angry when he told them about this relationship. His mother said she would kill herself. He ceased his contact with the Christian girl, and he became disenchanted with religion. In 2008 he was introduced to his future wife, and they fell in love and married.\n\n[5] In 2009 he joined a company and met XXXX, a XXXX, XXXX told him he was whipped when he was caught XXXX. In March, a colleague, XXXX, talked about XXXX. He also talked about his Christian religion, Jesus Christ, and their monthly prayer meetings. On April 29, 2017, XXXX told the claimant about a prayer meeting the next day in his home. The claimant attended with 4 others. He was warmly welcomed and at the end of the meeting he accepted Jesus Christ as his saviour. He was also given a Farsi Bible and told to be quiet about the monthly meetings.\n\n[6] On September 20, 2019, the claimant\u2019 s brother who lives in Canada, sent him an invitation to visit, and he traveled to Canada on XXXX 2019. The claimant joined XXXX Church which had a Farsi service and began attending services and Bible study sessions. On October 5, 2019, the claimant\u2019s wife called and informed him that 3 plainclothes agents came to their home searching for the claimant\u2019s belongings. They took his laptop and camera and accused him of apostasy because of his attendance at Christian sessions. His wife told him not to return.\n\nDETERMINATION\n\n[7] The panel finds on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant is now a genuine Christian. The panel further finds that if the claimant were to return to Iran, he would be at risk of persecution because of his conversion to Christianity. Therefore, the panel finds the claimant is a Convention refugee and his claim is allowed.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nIdentity\n\n[8] The panel finds the claimant has disclosed sufficient identity documentation, including a passport and national identity card, to confirm his Iranian citizenship.\n\nCredibility\n\n[9] The claimant was questioned as to his allegations. The claimant testified that if he returned to Iran, he would be arrested, tortured, and possibly executed because of his conversion to Christianity. The claimant was asked whether merely attending a Christian service would result in an apostasy accusation. He responded his home was raided and he was accused of conversion. He was further asked how Iranian authorities would know he had converted to Christianity, and he responded he did not know.\n\n[10] The claimant further testified to his meeting with a Christian girl in Iran, his desire to marry her, their talks about Christianity, his parents\u2019 rejection of the marriage. The claimant was asked whether he was aware of the views of Iranian authorities and society in this regard. He responded he did not have a lot of information. He was asked what information he had. and he did not provide a credible response.\n\n[11] The claimant testified to his association with XXXX the whipping of XXXX his conversations about Christianity with XXXX and his attendance at Christian prayer meetings in XXXX home. He further testified he attended these monthly meetings for approximately 2 years and there were no problems from the authorities. He also testified as to the positive impact of the first meeting and his decision to accept Jesus Christ as his saviour. The claimant\u2019s testimony in this regard was consistent with his BOC statements.\n\n[12] The claimant testified he joined XXXX soon after is arrival in Canada in XXXX 2019. He was asked whether anything happened in Iran after he left the country, and he testified that 3 plain clothes officials came to his home and accused him of apostasy. The panel noted the claimant attended Christian prayer meetings in Iran for 2 years and he had no problems. He was asked why the sudden change a few days after he left Iran, and he responded he did not know. He was further asked whether he had any evidence other than his wife\u2019s letter that he his being sought by Iranian authorities. He responded: \u201cno, just my wife\u201d.\n\n[13] The panel noted that his claim in his initial hearing was dismissed because of similarities between his claim and another claim. The claimant was asked whether he had anything to say regarding the similarities in the background of the Christian woman he wanted to marry, the time frame, and the actions of Iranian authorities within XXXX days of his arrival in Canada. He responded the similarity was not clear and he was surprised.\n\n[14] The claimant was asked questions concerning his Christian knowledge, and his responses were substantive and made without delay. He testified to what it meant to be a Christian and why he left Islam. He emphasized Christian belief in forgiveness and the lack of this response in Islam. He further testified that there was compulsion in Iranian Islam, and harsh laws and punishments. He also testified that in addition to attending services, he evangelized others, prepared food for the needy and helped maintain the church.\n\n[15] The claimant described a typical service and indicated he attended services twice a week and he was baptised on XXXX 2020. He provided substantive explanations as to the purpose of Baptism and Communion and described the Last Supper. In addition, the claimant described the organization of the Bible and the Gospels as a source of information concerning the life of Jesus. He was also able to provide a substantive description of Pentecost.\n\n[16] In addition, the claimant disclosed documentary evidence corroborating his Christian identity. A letter from the senior pastor of his church confirms his membership since October 2019, his regular attendance at services and Bible study classes, and his baptism on August 2, 2020. A letter from a member of the congregation, XXXX, confirms the claimant\u2019s attendance at church sessions on Wednesdays and Saturdays and the use of zoom during the pandemic. A letter from the claimant\u2019s roommate, XXXX notes the claimant\u2019s commitment to Christian study and practice. A letter from another roommate, XXXX indicates he witnessed the claimant praying and his talking about Christianity. A letter from the claimant\u2019s wife indicates plainclothes officers came to her house on XXXX 2019, confiscated the claimant\u2019s laptop and camera and accused him of apostasy. A letter from the claimant\u2019s brother, XXXX confirms the claimant\u2019s Christian practice in Iran and receipt of his wife\u2019s letter.[1] In addition a letter from Iran XXXX confirms his being whipped for XXXX in Iran.[2]\n\n[17] The panel has some concerns as to the similarities between the claimant\u2019s alleged experience in Iran and that of another claimant identified in the initial hearing of this claim. The panel notes however, as did the RAD decision, that some of the similarities are legitimate or not similar. However, the panel does have concerns about the timing of the alleged raid by Iranian authorities at the claimant\u2019s home and the apostasy accusation only XXXX days after he left Iran. The panel notes in this regard that the claimant testified he attended Christian prayer meetings in Iran for approximately 2 years without a problem. The panel further notes the claimant had not yet joined XXXX in Toronto and there is no basis for an assertion that the claimant was being monitored by Iranian authorities. The panel further notes that the only evidence of the claimant\u2019s pursuit by Iranian authorities is the claimant\u2019s wife\u2019s letter, and in the context of the analysis above the panel finds there is insufficient credible evidence to support a finding that the alleged October 4, 2019 incident took place.\n\n[18] The panel notes however that the claimant has provided corroborative evidence as to his Christian practice in Iran and the panel has no basis to challenge the truthfulness of this evidence. In addition, the claimant\u2019s sur place testimony reflects a substantive knowledge of Christian teachings, and his identity as a genuine practicing Christian is confirmed in corroborative evidence disclosed in the hearing.\n\n[19] The panel finds the claimant testified in a straight-forward manner and without any significant inconsistencies with documentary evidence. The panel further finds on a balance of probabilities, the claimant\u2019s allegations are true.\n\n[20] The panel has reviewed objective country evidence as to the jeopardy of Iranian Muslims who convert to Christianity. The Dutch Refugee Counsel states that while house churches are illegal in Iran, they are quite common. These churches are monitored but intervention by authorities tends to be dependent on the size of the congregation. Primary targets are leaders and converts. Conversion alone may not lead to arrest if the person does not proselytize or promote the church. However, if a person is outspoken about conversion, arrest and interrogation are likely. Converts are not generally charged with apostasy but rather with a national security concern by the Revolutionary Guard. Conversion is considered a political as well as a religious issue.[3] Further objective evidence indicates conversion may result in arrest and prison.[4] Amnesty International states ethnic and religious minorities face entrenched discrimination and violence.[5] Human Rights Watch states there is discrimination against religious minorities and arrests.[6]\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[21] The panel finds that the claimant, as a Muslim convert to Christianity, would be at risk of persecution if he were to return to Iran and continue to practice his faith. Therefore, the claimant is a Convention refugee and his claim is allowed.\n\n(signed) Milton Israel\n\nSeptember 26, 2022\n\n[1] Disclosure, May 2, 2021, RPD Record to RAD, Exhibit 1\n\n[2] Disclosure, August 16, 2021, RPD Record to RAD, Exhibit 1\n\n[3] National Documentation Package (NDP), Iran, April 29, 2022, item12.10\n\n[4] Ibid, item 12.11\n\n[5] Ibid, item 2.4\n\n[6] Ibid, item 2.5\n\n",

Yerzy\nCountry: Russia and Armenia\nRPD Number: TB9-27796\nAssociated RPD Number(s): TB9-27868, TB9-27887\nATIP Number: A-2023-01023\nATIP Pages: N\/A\n\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n\n[1] This is a decision in the claims for refugee protection made by the principal claimant XXXX and the associate claimants, his wife XXXX and their daughter XXXX in RPD file numbers TB9-27796, TB9-27868 and TB9-27887. The principal claimant and the associate claimant AG are citizens of Russia and Armenia. The associate claimant AA is a citizen of Russia and has a right to citizenship to Armenia, having been born of parents of Armenian citizenship. The claimants seek refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97 (1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).[1]\n\n[2] Pursuant to section 167.2 of the IRPA, the claimant AG was appointed as the designated representative of the minor claimant AA.\n\n[3] I heard the claims jointly pursuant to Refugee Protection Division Rule 55.\n\nALLEGATIONS\n\n[4] The facts and circumstances alleged in support of the claims are set out in the claimants\u2019 Basis of Claim (BOC) forms.[2] In summary, the claimants fear harm and persecution in Russia from the Russian government and in particular, the FSB, due to the principal claimant\u2019s anti\u00ad government political opinion and activism. The claimants also fear harm and persecution in Armenia because the Armenian government cooperates with the Russian government and will also persecute and harm them due to the principal claimant\u2019 s opposition to the Russian government.\n\nDETERMINATION\n\n[5] I have determined that the claimants are Convention refugees pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA.\n\nANALYSIS\n\n[6] In making this assessment, I considered all the evidence including the oral testimonies and the documentary evidence.\n\nNEXUS\n\n[7] I find that the principal claimant\u2019 s claims against Russia and Armenia have a nexus to the Convention based on his political opinion against the Russian government. The political opinion nexus of his claim against Russia also intersects with the nexus of the principal claimant\u2019 s race or ethnicity, as an Armenian. I find that the associate claimants\u2019 claims against Russia and Armenia have a nexus to the Convention based on their membership in a particular social group, being members of the family of a political dissident.\n\nIDENTITY\n\n[8] The claimants\u2019 identities were established on a balance of probabilities by certified true copies of their Russia-issued passports.[3]\n\nCREDIBILITY \u2013 Claim Against Russia\n\n[9] The principal claimant and the associate claimant, AG, testified at the hearing in a detailed, spontaneous and forthright manner. The principal claimant testified with detailed knowledge about the political situation in Russia, the history and objectives of the opposition party, Republican Party of Russia- People\u2019s Freedom Party (RPR-PARNAS) (hereinafter\n\u201cPARNAS\u201d) and described with particularity various political events and his participation. He described the alleged events of persecution in an internally consistent manner and in a manner consistent with the documentary evidence. He was able to explain an inconsistency between the Basis of Claim narrative and the medical report pertaining to how he arrived at the hospital on XXXX 2015, whether he drove himself as stated in the narrative or taken by ambulance as\nstated in the report. He testified that he started to drive himself to the hospital but soon realized he could not be driving due to his injuries; he stopped driving and called an ambulance which took him to the hospital. I find that the explanation reconciles the two (2) statements; I accept the explanation as reasonable. I find that the principal claimant and the associate claimant AG to be credible witnesses, and believe what they have alleged in support of their claims.\n\n[10] The claimants also submitted documentary evidence which corroborate material aspects of their claim. These include the PARNAS Party Registration documents in XXXX[4] letter from PARNAS party confirming the principal claimant\u2019 s active membership since XXXX 2012,[5] photos of the principal claimant in protests,[6] April 26, 2016 Russian police summons,[7] letter from XXXX confirming the principal claimant\u2019s active participation in also confirming the principal claimant\u2019s active participation in PARNAS,[8] letter from XXXX also confirming the principal claimant\u2019s active participation in PARNAS,[9] medical report confirming principal claimant\u2019s XXXX and XXXX 2015,[10] and medical report confirming principal claimant\u2019s injuries sustained on June 9, 2019.[11] I have no reason to doubt the veracity and reliability of these documents and as such place great weight on them in support of the claimants\u2019 allegations.\n\n[11] Considering the credible testimonies and reliable documentary evidence, I make the following factual findings, based on a balance of probabilities:\nThe principal claimant was an active member of PARNAS, having joined the party in XXXX 2012. His political activism grew out of his experiences as a person of Armenian origin, a visible minority in Russia, subjected to name-calling and rude comments from Russian society and constant harassment, unjustified police checks and extortion by Russian police. The indignities he suffered, spurred a desire to be treated equally and respectfully by society and authorities, and led to his political activism.The principal claimant is XXXX the PARNAS party, which finally achieved its certification in 2016 after overcoming 4 years of bureaucratic obstacles. Between 2015 and 2019, he attended various party meetings, rallies, strikes and protests against government corruption, in support of patriots, against pension reform, in memory of slain PARNAS co-chair and prominent opposition figure Boris Nemstov and to demand the resignation of President Putin, Prime Minister Medvedev and the Rostov Governor. XXXX. He was effective in bringing more people to meetings because he had a common language with these people. He was also responsible for finding venues (often at orchards or parks because the local government did not rent spaces to them) and preparing posters for these events. He also XXXX. When the government banned political gatherings, he staged a one-man picket on XXXX 2019 in support of jailed investigative journalist XXXX and ethnic Armenia journalist XXXX.In the evening XXXX 2015, the principal claimant was at a local tram station when three (3) men with short haircuts and strong physiques and who looked like they were military, FSB or police, approached and attacked him. As they beat him up, they told him to stop working for the PARNAS party and to stop opposing the government or \u201cyou will end up like XXXX. The men also called him \u201cblack ass\u201d and told him he should go back to his country. The principal claimant suffered massive trauma and had to undergo XXXX. He reported the incident as a politically motivated attack to the police who attended the hospital. He was told that the Transportation Police would contact him, as the incident occurred at the tram station. After repeated follow-up visits, the Transportation Police sent him a notice to appear for interrogation. At the interrogation on April 28, 2016, the officers were negative toward him, and told him they had information that he was a political agitator, and that he must have provoked or started the incident. They also told him that he would cease to have problems if he stopped his political activities. The police refused to register a complaint on his behalf.The principal claimant spent five (5) months in the US from XXXX 2016 to XXXX 2016 during which he took a break from the stress he experienced in Russia and recovered his health. Asked why he did not claim asylum in the US at that time, the principal claimant explained that he did not want to stop his political activities at that time. He wanted to keep fighting for a better future.On XXXX 2019, after his one-man picket in the center of the city against the imprisonment of journalists IG and GA, he was heading home when three (3) men with short hair and well-built physiques and who appeared to be military or police, approached and started hitting and beating him. They told him to stop his political activities. They told him that this was his final warning or next time, they would kill him. He suffered a XXXX for which he received medical treatment. At the hospital, he told the police the attack was politically motivated. The police told him everything would be fine once he stopped his political activities. Asked why he was harmed while XXXX had not been harmed, the principal claimant replied \u201cbecause I\u2019m a non-Russian\u201d and suggested there would be no investigation or punishment for the perpetrators.Fearful for his safety, the principal claimant left Russia and went to Armenia on XXXX 2019. The associate claimants also feared harm and joined him in Armenia on XXXX 2019.The principal claimant and his daughter, the associate claimant, AA, returned to Russia on XXXX 2019 until XXXX 2019 to allow AA to say goodbye to her friends and obtain her school certificate. XXXX because of the XXXX 2019 attack on the principal claimant; she had seen a psychologist in Russia and another psychologist in Armenia who advised that the abandonment of her friends was making her situation worse. Asked why he returned to Russia, if he feared harm to himself, he explained that AA wanted her father, the principal claimant, to be the one to accompany her on her final trip to Russia. He explained that during their brief 8-day stay in Russia, he did not connect with anyone, did not advise any one from the party about his presence in the country and did not engage in any political activity. They also stayed in a relative\u2019s house. Considering that the well-being of his daughter underpinned his decision to return to Russia for the brief visit and considering the safety precautions he took, I do not draw a negative inference from the principal claimant\u2019s apparent re\u00adavailment.The claimants did not intend to stay in Armenia and came to Canada on XXXX, 2019.The principal claimant fears persecution by the Russian government and its agents, the FSB (Federal Security Bureau) and the Russian police, due to his political opposition to the government and asserts he is especially a target because of his Armenian ethnicity. The associate claimants fear harm and persecution to themselves as members of the principal claimant\u2019s family, indicating that the Russian government has tried to take the children of political dissidents.SUBJECTIVE FEAR \u2013 Russia\n\n[12] I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the principal claimant has established a subjective fear that he would be persecuted and killed if he were to return to Russia due to his political activism, and that he is especially a target because of his Armenian ethnicity. The associate claimants have established a subjective fear of persecution as family members of a political activist.\n\nOBJECTIVE BASIS \u2013 Russia\n\n[13] The National Documentation Package for Russia (NDP), in a report entitled \u201cThe Kremlin\u2019s Political Prisoners: Advancing a Political Agenda by Crushing Dissent\u201d, indicates that \u201c[s]ince [Putin] first became President in 2000, and especially since his formal return to the Kremlin in 2012, the Kremlin has engaged in a wide-ranging crackdown on civil society, political opponents, critical voices, unpopular minorities, and anyone else it views unfavorably or as a threat\u201d and that \u201cthis persecution is only increasing\u201d.[12] The evidence states that political opponents, civil society activists, and journalists are at particular risk and in an effort to sow fear and discourage dissent, prosecutors are bringing baseless treason and espionage charges, casting political opponents as \u201cenemies of the state.\u201d\n\n[14] The objective evidence describes Kremlin\u2019s \u201cunprecedented crackdown\u201d on civil society, dissenting voices, and regime opponents, which has continued unabated since 2012[13]. The list of targets includes not just opposition candidates, but also anyone who supports them or dares to criticize those in power. Even being associated with opposition leaders, however indirectly, can lead to arrest or imprisonment. Freedom House, for example, recently noted: \u201cOpposition politicians and activists are frequently targeted with fabricated criminal cases and other forms of administrative harassment apparently designed to prevent their participation in the political process.\u201d Amnesty International has similarly reported that \u201cprotest leaders and political activists supporting critical voices faced harassment, administrative and criminal proceedings and physical violence.\u201d[14]\n\n[15] The evidence indicates that authorities detained and prosecuted individuals for political reasons. Charges usually applied in politically motivated cases included \u201cterrorism,\u201d \u201cextremism,\u201d \u201cseparatism,\u201d and \u201cespionage.\u201d Political prisoners were reportedly placed in particularly harsh conditions of confinement and subjected to other punitive treatment within the prison system, such as solitary confinement or punitive stays in psychiatric unit.[15]\n\n[16] The United States. Department of State (DOS), Russia. Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2020 cites reports that police beat or otherwise abused persons, in some cases resulting in their death. For example, media reported that members of Russia\u2019s National Guard forcibly dispersed a peaceful political rally in Khabarovsk City on October 12. Several participants reported being beaten by police during the rally\u2019 s dispersal, at least one with a police baton; one victim suffered a broken nose. Two detained minors said they were \u201cput on their knees in a corner, mocked, had their arms twisted, and were hit in the eye.\u201d[16]\n\n[17] The news articles submitted by the claimant \u201cPeaceful Protests Didn\u2019t Produce Any Results: Three Russian Activists Who Left\u201d (dated March 24, 2021)[17] and \u201cExile or Jail: The Grim Choice Facing Russian Opposition Leaders\u201d (August 31, 2021)[18] chronicle the torrent of politically motivated emigration by Russian dissidents and activists as a result of the Russian government\u2019s brutal repression and persecution.\n\n[18] The objective evidence also describes the targeting of visible minorities. While the law prohibits discrimination based on nationality, officials discriminated against minorities, including through \u201cde facto racial profiling, targeting in particular migrants and persons from Central Asia and the Caucasus.\u201d The evidence confirms the scenario described by the principal claimant, indicating that police officers often stopped individuals who looked foreign and asked them for their documents, claiming that they contained mistakes even when they were in order, and demanded bribes. The evidence indicates that hate crimes targeting ethnic minorities continued to be a problem. As of August 3 [2020], one individual had died and 14 had been injured in racially motivated attacks since the beginning of the year. On June 13, a 17-year-old medical student from Azerbaijan, died after being stabbed 20 times in Volgograd. Police later detained Vitaliy Vasilyev, an unemployed local man, who confessed to attacking Gavrilov on the basis of his ethnic identity. According to media reports, Vasilyev had ties to radical right-wing organizations and attacked the student because he wanted to \u201ckill a non-Russian.\u201d[19]\n\n[19] I find that there is objective basis for the principal claimant\u2019s fear of persecution at the hands of government authorities due to his political activism, and that he is at increased risk of persecution and harm due to his Armenian ethnicity.\n\n[20] Regarding the risk of persecution faced by the associate claimants, the objective evidence indicates that there is a unified federal register containing information on all the country\u2019s residents, including their names, dates and places of birth, and marital status; and that Russian intelligence and security services have access to the database in their investigations. The evidence cites reports that authorities threatened to remove children from the custody of parents engaged in political activism or some forms of religious worship, or parents who were LGBTI persons. For example, on October 2 [2020], Russian media reported that authorities were threatening to arrest and take away the children of gay men who have fathered their children through surrogacy, accusing them of child trafficking. Several families reportedly left the country due to fear of arrest.[20]\n\n[21] The news article \u201cPeaceful Protests Protests Didn\u2019t Produce Any Results: Three Russian Activists Who Left\u201d (dated March 24, 2021)[21] quotes a political activist Yaroslav who was given asylum in the US:\nEven in Russia, even now, you formally have the right to express your opinions, but they persecute you for that\u2026 They threaten to take away some people\u2019 s children. Others are followed and not able to live normally. A student might get kicked out of his university. All of this is considered persecution.\n\n[22] A report entitled \u201cLike Walking a Minefield\u201d: Vicious Crackdown on Critics in Russia\u2019s Chechen Republic[22] describes the unlawful detention and ill-treatment by police officials of a woman and her three (3) under-aged daughters in retaliation for her husband\u2019s public remarks criticizing the authorities. The mother and the eldest daughter, age 17, were both beaten and threatened with death, with the objective of convincing them to persuade her husband to retract his comments. The mother was also subjected to a mock execution.\n\n[23] I find that there is objective basis for the associate claimant\u2019s fear of persecution at the hands of government authorities as members of the family of a political activist.\n\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution \u2013 Russia\n\n[24] Considering the claimants\u2019 subjective fear grounded on objective basis, I find on a balance of probabilities that the claimants have established a well- founded fear of persecution. Considering the principal claimant\u2019 s genuine political convictions and zeal for activism to bring about change, coupled with the fact that he is a visible minority of Armenian ethnicity, he faces on a forward-looking basis, a serious risk of persecution, should he return to Russia. Considering the associate claimants\u2019 membership in the principal claimant\u2019s immediate family, they face, on a forward-looking basis, a serious risk of persecution, should they return to Russia.\n\nState Protection \u2013 Russia\n\n[25] The agent of persecution is the state itself which has engaged in a wide-ranging crackdown on critical voices and unpopular minorities, and anyone else it views unfavorably or as a threat. The United States Department of State (DOS), Russia. Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2020,[23] cites a long list of significant human rights abuses including extrajudicial killings and attempted extrajudicial killings; enforced disappearances; pervasive torture by government law enforcement officers that sometimes resulted in death and occasionally involved sexual violence or punitive psychiatric incarceration; harsh and life\u00ad threatening conditions in prisons; arbitrary arrest and detention; political and religious prisoners and detainees; severe suppression of freedom of expression and media, including the use of \u201canti-extremism\u201d and other laws to prosecute peaceful dissent and religious minorities; severe suppression of the right of peaceful assembly; severe suppression of freedom of association. The report states that the government has failed to take adequate steps to identify, investigate, prosecute, or punish most officials who committed abuses, resulting in a climate of impunity.\nThe claimants will not be able to avail themselves of the protection of authorities in Russia. The presumption that the claimants will be able to receive adequate state protection in Russia is contradicted by the country conditions evidence.\n\nInternal Flight Alternative \u2013 Russia\n\n[26] The Russian government\u2019 s vicious campaign to crush dissent and to silence critics, exists throughout the Russian Federation, including Chechnya and Russia-occupied Crimea as described in the objective evidence.[24] The Kremlin has undertaken legal reform that has enabled it to target and punish its opponents more effectively. The Russian government has created new crimes and offenses and broadened existing ones, all of which have effectivity and enforceability nationwide. There is no internal flight alternative available to the claimants throughout Russian.\n\nCREDIBILITY \u2013 Claim Against Armenia\n\n[27] The principal claimant testified that the government in Armenia is pro-Russia. He described the cooperation between the Russian FSB and the Armenian security forces and testified that under an agreement between Russia and Armenia, Russian border guards do the work of guarding the Armenian border. The principal claimant testified that the Armenian government cannot oppose the will of the Russian government and can have him arrested and put in jail under false charges in Armenia.\n\n[28] The principal claimant testified that on XXXX 2019, the Armenian police came to the house of his mother and brother in Armenia; both his mother and brother were not home at the time. The police left a document with a neighbour. The document entitled \u201cSummons -Call for Questioning\u201d required the principal claimant to be present for questioning on XXXX 2019 in\nconnection with the investigation of a criminal case. The claimant\u2019s brother, XXXX (AA), attended the police station on XXXX 2019 and advised the police that the principal claimant left Armenia. A man who was not in police uniform identified himself as a member of the Armenian National Security Service (NSS) and told AA that FSB had contacted the NSS and informed them that the principal claimant was an \u201cenemy of Russia\u201d and a \u201cpolitical troublemaker\u201d. He told AA to tell the principal claimant he cannot engage in activities against Russia from inside Armenia and that he should not return to Armenia as enemies of Russia were not welcome in Armenia. After the incident, the Armenian authorities contacted AA two (2) more times, in XXXX 2020 and in XXXX 2021, asking if there was any information about the principal claimant\u2019s whereabouts.\n\n[29] I have considered the principal claimant\u2019 s detailed evidence, corroborated by a copy of the Summons dated XXXX 2019, issued by the Republic of Armenia Special Investigation Services of the Investigations Central Administrative Department[25] and a letter signed by his brother, AA, confirming the claimant\u2019s testimony.[26] I find on a balance of probabilities that the Armenian government has sought the principal claimant as an \u201cenemy of Russia\u201d and a \u201cpolitical agitator\u201d.\n\n[30] The claimants do not feel safe in Armenia and fear that the Armenian government will do the will of the Russian government and subject them to the same persecution they sought to escape in Russia.\n\nSUBJECTIVE FEAR \u2013 Armenia\n\n[31] I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the principal claimant has established a subjective fear that he would be persecuted by Armenian authorities at the behest of the Russian government if he were to return to Armenia due to his political activism. The associate claimants have established a subjective fear of persecution as family members of an individual deemed an \u201cenemy of Russia\u201d and a \u201cpolitical agitator\u201d.\n\nOBJECTIVE BASIS \u2013 Armenia\n\n[32] The BTI 2020 Country Report for Armenia indicates that in economic and security terms, Armenia is overly reliant on its ally, Russia, which also controls most of the country\u2019s strategic assets, including the entire gas distribution network, railroads and telecommunications and enjoys a near-monopoly on the gas market.[27]\n\n[33] The BTI 2020 Country Report for Armenia describes a crucial event in 2013 when Armenia made a sudden U-turn, away from a long-negotiated Association Agreement with the EU and announced its intention to join the Russian-led Eurasian Economic Union (EEU).[28] The move is widely believed to be the result of strong Russian pressure in the areas of economy, energy and security.[29]\n\n[34] The BTI 2020 Country Report for Russia explains Russia\u2019 s motive for creation of the EEU. It indicates that since Russia wants to be a global power, Moscow is interested in some cooperation and therefore created the Eurasian Economic Union with four former Soviet republics (Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan), which facilitates Russia\u2019s exertion of regional influence.[30] The report also refers to the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), formed after the 1991 dissolution of the Soviet Union, which promotes cooperation in economics, military, and political aspects and coordination of trade, finance, lawmaking, and security among its member states, namely, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. The report states that \u201cRussia treats the CIS region as its sphere of influence and reacts to conflicts that might threaten its own security with increasing assertiveness\u201d and that \u201c[s]ome CIS countries, like Kazakhstan, Belarus or Armenia, have accepted Russian dominance in return for preferential economic treatment and security guarantees.\u201c[31]\n\n[35] A Eurasian Daily Monitor news article \u201cArmenian Prime Minister Pashinian Wins New Political Mandate\u201d dated July 1, 2021,[32] submitted by the claimant about the re-election of Nikol Pashnian as Armenian Prime Minister reflects the close, cooperative and interdependent relationship between Armenia and Russia. It reports:\n\u2026On May 27, Pashnian\u2019s cabinet allocated several land plots in the country\u2019s southernmost region of Syunik in order to establish border service posts under the supervision of the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB); and already after the elections, Yerevan dispatched a delegation to Moscow in order to discuss a planned expansion of the Russian military base on Armenian soil. New Russian troops will likely be stationed in the Gegharkunik region, bordering Kelbajar, which was returned to Azerbaijan\u2019s control as a result of the war. The Pashinian government has also made other post-war concessions to Moscow. Most importantly, an inter-governmental agreement circumventing the law on audiovisual media, adopted earlier in 2020, allows state\u00ad controlled Russian TV companies to keep their slots on the Armenia airwaves.\n\n[36] A report entitled \u201cArmenia \u2013 Relations with Russia\u201d by Global.Security.org[33] describes the interdependency between Armenia and Russia:\nRussia counts on Armenia to be its ally in the Caucasus. Armenia recognizes its reliance\n\u2014 even dependence \u2014 on Russia\u2019s continued support on security and trade issues and will remain a loyal supporter of Russian policies where it counts. Russia can rely on continued Armenian support for its military presence and for the majority of its positions in international fora such as the OSCE. Armenia can count on Russia for its role as mediator in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. Complementarity remains the watchword of Armenian foreign policy, but when push comes to shove, Russia remains Armenia\u2019s key ally.\n\nRussia has a closer relationship with Armenia than with any other country in the South Caucasus. After the Soviet Union collapsed, Armenia\u2019s national security continued to depend heavily on the Russian military. The officer corps of the new national army created in 1992 included many Armenian former officers of the Soviet army, and Russian institutes trained new Armenian officers. Two Russian divisions were transferred to Armenian control, but another division remained under full Russian control on Armenian soil.\n\nThe Russian military presence in Armenia is a major component of Armenian security. The Russian 102nd Military Base, headquartered in Gyumri, dated from Soviet times and was intended to defend against the Turkish Third Field Army, which \u2026 is still considered a significant security threat to Armenia. The Turkish Third Army was not subject to CFE inspections. These forces and the Turkish support to Azerbaijani military forces stationed in Nakhichevan posed the greatest security threat to Armenia because they could easily cut Armenia into two\n\n[37] The Danish Immigration Service Fact Finding Mission to Yerevan, Armenia in its compilation entitled \u201cArmenia State Actors, Political Situation, Vulnerable Groups and Citizenship Report\u201d[34] indicates that anyone could arbitrarily be subject to persecution by Armenian police and other state actors. According to Civil Society Institute, it depends on numerous factors including, among others, whether the person is able to inspire others to join protests, the cause of the protests (especially anti-Russian protests trigger the authorities), and whether or not there is a specific instruction of the superior authorities. According to the Helsinki Association, political activists, human rights defenders, and journalists are somehow permanently targeted by the authorities, especially when they criticise the authorities and the ruling elite.\n\n[38] The report entitled \u201cRussia. Out of Sight, Not Out of Reach: The Global Scale and Scope of Transnational Repression\u201d[35] documents the Russian government\u2019s highly aggressive transnational repression activities beyond the boundaries of Russia:\nThe Russian government conducts highly aggressive transnational repression activities abroad. Its campaign, which heavily relies on assassination as a tool, targets former insiders and others who are perceived as threats to the regime\u2019s security. The government pairs this campaign with control over key cultural institutions operating abroad, in an effort to exert influence over the Russian diaspora.\n\nThe Russian campaign accounts for 7 of 26 assassinations or assassination attempts since 2014, as catalogued in Freedom House\u2019s global survey. It is also responsible for assaults, detentions, unlawful deportations, and renditions in eight countries, mostly in Europe. Of the 32 documented physical cases of Russian transnational repression, a remarkable 20 have a Chechen nexus. The Kremlin Since coming to power in 2000, Russian president Vladimir Putin has engaged in an ongoing subversion campaign in Europe and the United States, using tactics short of war.\n\nAs part of this \u201cpolitical warfare,\u201d the Putin government frequently builds influence networks through corrupt and corrupting means, disseminates disinformation, builds alliances with antiliberal parties and political actors, and conducts hacking operations. The government does all this while resisting and avoiding attribution, unlike in overt and clearly attributed public diplomacy efforts or soft-power efforts that rely on persuasion and attraction.\n\nThe Kremlin\u2019 s approach to transnational repression extends naturally from this \u201cpolitical warfare\u201d concept. When selecting individual targets, the Kremlin focuses its efforts on those who may have defected to NATO member states and cooperate with their intelligence agencies, those who were considered to have previously engaged in armed conflict against Russia, or those who have run afoul of security services through business or political activities.\n\n[39] The Washington Post news article \u201cThe long-terrifying history of Russian dissidents being poisoned abroad\u201d dated June 3, 2018 documents the systematic and ruthless killings carried out by Russia outside its borders, abroad, targeting those seen as betraying its interest. The cases cited include the poisoning of Sergie Skripal, a former Russian spy, and his daughter, Yulia.\n\n[40] I find that the objective evidence establishes the close, cooperative and interdependent relationship between Armenia and Russia, as well as Russia\u2019s highly aggressive transnational repression activities, against political dissidents and those deemed \u201cenemies of the state\u201d and as in the case of Yulia Skripal, including their families. I find on a balance of probabilities that there is objective basis for the claimants\u2019 fear that the long arm of Russia\u2019s persecution against political dissidents and their families, will reach them in Armenia and that they are not safe in Armenia.\n\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution -Armenia\n\n[41] Considering the claimants\u2019 subjective fear and the objective basis, I find on a balance of probabilities that the claimants have established a well-founded fear of persecution, that should they return to Armenia, the Armenian authorities will cooperate with Russia and persecute and harm them, due to the principal claimant\u2019s political opinion.\n\nState Protection and Internal Flight Alternative \u2013 Armenia\n\n[42] Given the objective evidence regarding Armenia\u2019 s close cooperation and coordination with Russia with regard to political aspects and security matters, as described, I find on a balance of probabilities that the Armenian state will not be able to provide adequate state protection to the claimants. I am satisfied based on the objective evidence that the presumption of state protection is rebutted. Given Russia\u2019 s acceptance of Russia\u2019 s dominance and sphere of influence within Armenia, as described by the objective evidence, I also find that there is no safe or viable internal flight alternative for the claimants anywhere in Armenia.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[43] I conclude that the principal claimant faces a serious possibility of persecution in Russia based on the Convention grounds of political opinion and race or ethnicity; and in Armenia based on the Convention ground of political opinion. I also conclude that the associate claimants face a serious possibility of persecution in Russia and Armenia based on a Convention ground, namely membership in a particular social group, as members of the family of a political dissident.

        "unofficial_text":"2022 RLLR 135\n\nCitation: 2022 RLLR 135\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: May 4, 2022\nPanel: Suraj Balakrishnan\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Jordan Duviner\nCountry: China\nRPD Number: TB9-27542\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2023-01023\nATIP Pages: N\/A\n\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n\n[1] The claimant, XXXX alleges that he is a citizen of China, and is claiming refugee protection in Canada pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).\n\nDETERMINATION\n\n[2] Having considered all of the evidence, the panel finds that the claimant has established that he would face a serious possibility of persecution in China due to his imputed anti-government political opinion.\n\nALLEGATIONS\n\n[3] The specifics of the claim are set out in the narrative of the claimant\u2019s Basis of Claim Form (BOC).[1] The following is a summary of the claimant\u2019s allegations.\n\n[4] The claimant alleges that he is a citizen of China. He fears persecution by Chinese authorities because of his imputed anti-government political opinion on account of his involvement in protests against land expropriation.\n\nIDENTITY\n\n[5] The claimant\u2019s identity has been established, on a balance of probabilities, through his testimony, as well as documentation filed; namely, copies of his Resident Identity Card,[2] household registration booklet,[3] and passport,[4] as well as his original passport that he presented at the hearing.\n\nNEXUS\n\n[6] The panel finds that there is a nexus between the harms that the claimant fears and the claimant\u2019s imputed anti-government political opinion. The claim will therefore be assessed pursuant to section 96 of IRPA. The test under section 96 is whether there is a serious possibility of persecution should the claimant return to China and the panel has found that the claimant has met that test.\n\nCREDIBILITY\n\n[7] When a claimant affirms to tell the truth, this creates a presumption of truthfulness unless there is evidence to the contrary. In general, the claimant\u2019s testimony was consistent with his BOC and his testimony was forthright, with no apparent attempt to embellish. The claimant testified and indicated in his BOC that he XXXX. In April of 2019, the claimant and other households in his village received notices indicating that the land would be expropriated. Members of the affected households disagreed with the compensation provided. They met with each other, obtained appraisals, drafted and signed a petition, and appointed the claimant\u2019 s brother and four others to be representatives.\n\n[8] The representatives tried negotiating with the village, town, and city level governments, but they were rejected. From May 10, 2019 to May 12, 2019, the members of the affected households protested in front of the city government building. They shouted slogans and held banners criticizing the government and government officials. On May 12, 2019, the police arrived to break up the protest. They arrested some protestors, including the claimant\u2019s brother. The claimant ran away and eventually came to Canada.\n\n[9] The claimant\u2019s credibility was not perfect. For example, the claimant had trouble remembering accurately the various dates of the various events in his BOC. However, the panel notes that the claimant has limited education and was visibly nervous during the hearing. Given these factors, and the strength of the rest of the claimant\u2019s testimony and supporting documents, the panel does not draw a material negative inference on the claimant\u2019s credibility or the credibility of his allegations. As another example, the claimant indicated in his BOC that he protested in front of the town government building, but at the hearing he testified that it was in front of the city government building. When asked about this discrepancy, the claimant testified that the information in his BOC must have been an error. While this is a significant discrepancy, given the quality of the claimant\u2019 s testimony about the protest itself and his supporting documents, the panel does not draw a material negative inference on the claimant\u2019 s credibility or the credibility of his allegations.\n\n[10] The claimant produced documentation in support of his claim. This includes (i) the land XXXX[5] related to the use of the land that the claimant XXXX, (ii) the land expropriation\nnotice,[6] corroborating the claimant\u2019s allegation that the government wanted to expropriate his land, and (iii) a detention notice for his brother,[7] indicating that the claimant\u2019s brother has been arrested on May 12, 2019, for engaging in \u201canti-government activities and slandering the government officers and impeding the officers from carrying out their duties.\u201d[8] The panel notes that the detention notice appears consistent with the samples available in the objective documentary evidence.[9] These submissions help confirm key aspects of the incidents described by the claimant in his testimony and BOC. There is no reason for the panel to cast any doubt on the veracity of these submissions and as such the panel places good weight on these submissions to support his allegations and overall claim.\n\n[11] Specifically, the claimant has established on a balance of probabilities that (i) Chinese authorities sought to expropriate the claimant\u2019 s land, (ii) the claimant took various steps to oppose the expropriation or receive higher compensation, (iii) the claimant shouted slogans and held banners criticizing the Chinese government and government officials, and (iv) Chinese authorities cracked down on the third protest, whereafter the claimant\u2019s brother was detained.\n\n[12] Given the claimant\u2019s credible testimony as well as the corroborating documentation cited above, the panel finds the claimant to be a credible witness. Therefore, the panel believes what the claimant has alleged in support of his claim and finds that his subjective fear of persecution is established, on a balance of probabilities.\n\nOBJECTIVE BASIS\n\n[13] The objective documentary evidence supports a finding that there would be a serious possibility of the claimant facing persecution upon return to China. The UK Home Office notes that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) deems land issues to be sensitive, and this can lead to little tolerance for public dissent.[10] There are about 100,000 incidents of protests, riots and other forms of social disorder in China a year.[11] This can lead to deaths, beatings, harassment and imprisonment; those who protest often face violence from police and thugs, and are arrested and placed in Re-education Through Labour Centres.[12] Recourses are limited, and harassment of residents is ignored.[13]\n\n[14] In this case, the claimant protested against the government and criticized the government and government officials. Further, the claimant\u2019s brother, who protested with him, was arrested. The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant\u2019s fear of returning to China has an objective basis. The claimant has a well-founded fear of persecution in China.\n\nSTATE PROTECTION\n\n[15] The panel finds that the Chinese government is the agent of persecution in this case. The country conditions cited above confirm that the state is in fact persecuting individuals like the claimant.\n\n[16] The panel therefore finds, that in this case, the claimant has rebutted the presumption of state protection in China.\n\nINTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE (IFA)\n\n[17] The panel considered whether a viable IFA exists for the claimant. The agent of persecution is the Chinese government. The documentary evidence cited above confirms that the oppressive treatment of persons with an anti-government political opinion is nationwide. The panel finds that there is a serious possibility of persecution for the claimant throughout China and therefore finds that there is no viable IFA.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[18] Having considered all of the evidence, the panel finds that there is a serious possibility of persecution by Chinese authorities if the claimant returns to China. The panel finds that the claimant is a Convention refugee and accepts his claim.\n\n(signed) Suraj Balakrishnan\n\nMay 4, 2022\n\n[1] Exhibit 2.\n\n[2] Exhibit 6.\n\n[3] Id.\n\n[4] Id.\n\n[5] Id.\n\n[6] Id.\n\n[7] Id.\n\n[8] Id.\n\n[9] Exhibit 3, NDP 5 November 2021, Item 9.6, CHN200762.E, Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada, 7 October 2021.\n\n[10] Exhibit 3, NDP 5 November 2021, Item 1.11, Country Police and Information Note.

It was postponed because of technical problems. The original claim was made by the claimant and his wife, XXXX the principal claimant. Since that time, the claimant\u2019s wife passed away and the claimant, who is 90 years old, was hospitalized as the result of XXXX. The claimant participated in the hearing while hospitalized. His son XXXX was appointed the claimant\u2019s designated representative, and his lawyer\u2019s services were terminated. The claimant\u2019s son disclosed documentation concerning his representation of the claimant, his father\u2019s Power of Attorney, his mother\u2019 s death certificate and medical documentation concerning the claimant.[1]\n\n[3] The panel provided an oral decision at the conclusion of the March 23, 2022, hearing granting refugee protection on the basis of the claimant\u2019s risk of cruel and unusual punishment if he were to return China. The following is the panel\u2019s written reasons.\n\nALLEGATIONS\n\n[4] The claimant alleged the following in his Basis of Claim Form narrative (BOC):\n\n[5] The claimant fears return to China where he faces arbitrary arrest and torture. He alleges he will be targeted for alleged religious affiliation because of his association with his friend XXXX was arrested with others by the PSB for their underground church activities. The claimant further alleges he is targeted because of his perceived religious affiliation and his failure to report as required.\n\nTHE ISSUE\n\n[6] The determinative issue as to this claim is credibility.\n\n[7] The claimant was questioned as to his allegations. The panel notes the claimant\u2019s son, his designated representative, indicated in his written disclosure noted above that the claimant could provide only one-word answers because of his medical condition. The panel further notes that the claimant was able to provide more substantial responses to the panel\u2019s questions, although there was clear evidence of some confusion and memory lapses.\n\n[8] The claimant was asked why he was making a claim and he responded that he would be punished at home. He further testified that there were arrests of members of a \u2018mafia group\u2019. The designated representative indicated that the claimant was referring to an underground church, but the claimant testified he was not.\n\n[9] The claimant further testified he feared return to China because the PSB believed he was connected to a group of people in his village who had been arrested.\n\n[10] The claimant was asked what these people did to attract the interest of the PSB. He responded they got together and gave speeches. He was further asked what they talked about. The claimant responded he did not know but he was deemed to be connected to them. He was further asked where they met, and he testified in a house. He was asked whether they met weekly, or every day and he responded he forgot.\n\n[11] The claimant was asked why they were arrested, and he responded he did not know. Her was further asked whether he had ever been arrested and he said no, but he was questioned. He testified as well that he was questioned but he did not know anything about their concerns. He further testified that whenever something was associated with the group, the PSB would look for him.\n\n[12] The designated representative indicated that after his father arrived in Canada, a neighbour informed them that the police came to look for him during the new year holiday. The designated representative further indicated that his father told him that he met a pastor many years ago at a wedding and the pastor came to his village to spread religion. Subsequently someone was sick, and the family came to his father and asked for help. His father introduced the family to the pastor and various activities were organized. As a result, the people who the claimant introduced to the pastor were arrested. The designated representative indicated this is what his father and mother told him.\n\n[13] The claimant was asked whether he met a pastor in China. He responded yes and he agreed with what his son said about his experience in China.\n\n[14] The panel acknowledges the claimant\u2019s age and medical condition made an impact on his responses to the panel\u2019s questions. The panel finds however, that the claimant was able to provide sufficient information consistent with his allegations to allow the panel to find on a balance of probabilities, that he is being pursued by the PSB because of his presumed association with underground church activities.\n\n[15] Therefore, the panel finds on a balance of probabilities, the claimant cannot return to China without a risk of cruel and unusual punishment, and his claim is accepted.\n\n(signed) Milton Israel\n\nApril 7, 2022\n\n[1] Document 6, CLOD\n\n",

        "unofficial_text":"2022 RLLR 132\n\nCitation: 2022 RLLR 132\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: June 23, 2022\nPanel: D. Kershaw\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Constance Nakatsu\nCountry: Peru\nRPD Number: TB8-29823\nAssociated RPD Number(s): TB9-06979\nATIP Number: A-2023-01023\nATIP Pages: N\/A\n\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n[1] These are the reasons for the decision in the claims of XXXX principal claimant (the \u201cprincipal claimant\u201d) and XXXX the associate claimant, who are sisters and who are both citizens of Peru who claim refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA)[1].\n\n[2] In rendering my reasons, I have considered and applied both Guideline 4: Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution (\u201cthe Gender Guidelines\u201d) and Guideline 9: Proceedings Before the IRB Involving Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Expression, and Sex Characteristics (\u201cthe SOGIESC Guidelines\u201d). I have considered these Guidelines when asking the claimant questions, and as set out below, when writing this decision.\n\n[3] I note that after these sittings, the claimants\u2019 counsel requested that she be permitted to do written submissions. Unfortunately, due to her health, they were delayed, and I received them toward the end of April 2022.\n\nDETERMINATION\n\n[4] I find that the claimants are Convention refugees because the principal claimant has established a serious possibility of persecution on account of her membership in a particular social group as a lesbian and as a woman facing intimate partner violence[2], and the associate claimant has established her membership in the particular social group of a family member of a lesbian and family member of a woman who has faced intimate partner violence.\n\nALLEGATIONS\n\nPrincipal Claimant\n\n[5] The allegations are set out in the claimants\u2019 Basis of Claim (BOC) forms[3].\n\n[6] In summary, the principal claimant fears ongoing persecution as a lesbian and woman not only at the hands of a former acquaintance who is also a XXXX but also by the wider community in Peru. The principal claimant requested that I refer to her former acquaintance as her aggressor, which I did at the hearing and do in my reasons.\n\n[7] The principal claimant is 31 years old and lived in Lima and Callao in Peru prior to coming to Canada. She also stayed for a short time in Mexico en route to Canada because she used a fraudulent Mexican passport to come to Canada.\n\n[8] The principal claimant alleges that her aggressor sexually assaulted her on more than one occasion at least partly because he knew she was a lesbian. She further alleges that she tried to move to a different city, but he found her and attacked her again. She also alleges that she is generally at risk of persecution in Peru because of her sexual orientation.\n\n[9] The principal claimant alleges there is no state protection or internal flight alternative for her in Peru.\n\nAssociate Claimant\n\n[10] The associate claimant fears ongoing persecution at the hands of the principal claimant\u2019s aggressor as the sister of the principal claimant.\n\n[11] The associate claimant is 37 years old and lived in Lima and Juancaya prior to coming to Canada. She, like the principal claimant, stayed for a short time in Mexico just prior to coming to Canada because she used a false Mexican passport to come to Canada.\n\n[12] The associate claimant alleges that she is at risk of persecution by the aggressor because he came to her residence looking for the principal claimant and threatened the associate claimant\u2019s life.\n\n[13] She further alleges that she is at risk of persecution because her sister is a lesbian.\n\n[14] The associate claimant alleges that there is no state protection or an internal flight alternative for her in Peru.\n\nNEXUS\n\n[15] I find there is a nexus between what the claimants fear and in the case of the principal claimant, her membership in the particular social group of lesbians and women facing intimate partner violence; and in the case of the associate claimant, being the family member of a woman facing intimate partner violence.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nIdentity\n\nPrincipal claimant\n\n[16] I find that the principal claimant\u2019s identity as a national of Peru was established on a balance of probabilities by a certified true copy of her Peruvian national identity card[4] and a copy of her birth certificate[5]. The principal claimant testified that she came to Canada using a false Mexican passport[6].\n\n[17] She testified with respect to how she found the person who helped facilitate her flight from Peru to Mexico and then from Mexico to Canada using the fraudulent passport. She was able to give me details of the process including the documents she gave the man, and her dealings with him.\n\n[18] I believe the principal claimant\u2019s testimony about this, and I find that she travelled to Canada using the fraudulent Mexican passport. I further find on a balance of probabilities based on her testimony and the documentary evidence in the file that she has established her persona! and national identity as a Mexican citizen.\n\nAssociate claimant\n\n[19] The associate claimant also testified that she used a fraudulent Mexican passport to travel to Canada. She too testified with respect to her travel to Mexico where she was kept for about three weeks by the man facilitating her journey prior to being told it was time for her to travel to Canada.\n\n[20] The associate claimant provided a copy of her birth certificate[7] and a copy of her Peruvian national identity card[8] and I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities based on her testimony and the documentary evidence that the associate claimant has established her personal and national identity as a citizen of Peru.\n\nCredibility\n\n[21] When a claimant swears to the truth of certain allegations, this creates a presumption that those allegations are true unless there is a reason to doubt their truthfulness[9].\n\n[22] I will first address the principal claimant\u2019s claim.\n\nPrincipal claimant\n\n[23] With respect to credibility, there were some contradictions in the principal claimant\u2019s testimony about the violence from her aggressor, particularly dates, and I spent a considerable length of time asking her questions because of this. However, after hearing the testimony of both her and her sister, I find that the contradictions do not go the heart of the principal claimant\u2019s claim as a lesbian and as a woman who faced intimate partner violence. In addition, on a balance of probabilities I believe the principal claimant\u2019 s testimony about the violence despite the contradictions.\n\n[24] Memory is fallible, particularly in cases of trauma. Whether the principal claimant remembers there being four instead of three incidents of violence, for example, does not change the fact that I believe she suffered violence. In addition, her testimony about when she first met her aggressor was not consistent with her interview at the border. She explained that she was very nervous at the border, to the point where she described herself as not knowing what she was talking about. I accept her testimony with respect to the inconsistency with respect to dates. While her testimony about the dates on which her aggressor hurt her, and while she was very poor at recalling dates, this does not change my finding that she was sexually assaulted by her aggressor on more than one occasion.\n\n[25] It was clear from her testimony that the sexual assaults traumatized her greatly. There was a date discrepancy between her testimony and what she said at the border respecting when she met her aggressor. She testified that she was very nervous during the whole process and did not know what she was talking about when I asked her questions. She further testified that when she arrived, she felt intimidated by the officer who asked her questions, and her mind went blank. She testified that she was fearful that she would be sent back to Peru. She was very afraid of what would happen when she arrived because she did not know whether she would be permitted to stay or not. She further testified that she had not been sleeping well for a month prior to coming to Canada and she was very scared and nervous.\n\n[26] After the first sitting of this hearing, the principal claimant wrote a letter which I accepted into evidence[10]. In it, she explained that despite my being, in her words, kind and generous with her, she was very intimidated when talking tome. She described how she was filled with panic and nerves and how her body started to tremble and shake when testifying because of the unpleasant moments she lived through and because she did not want to remember because it caused her to live it again which is to return to the past.\n\n[27] The principal claimant did an excellent job of describing how this process and having to talk about traumatic events made her feel. I only note how she described how I treated her for the purpose of detailing that even in the face of someone being kind to the principal claimant, she was in a state of confusion and anxiety throughout the hearing. I have taken this into account when assessing her evidence, particularly since I find that despite any contradictions, the principal claimant experienced exactly what she told me she experienced.\n\n[28] I have considered the date discrepancy in the context of all the rest of the principal claimant\u2019s testimony, including her letter, and the associate claimant\u2019s testimony, and I find that the fact that she told the border official a different date for when she first met her aggressor than the date she testified she met him is not determinative of her credibility with respect to the events themselves for the reasons set out below. In addition, I find on a balance of probabilities that the principal claimant is a lesbian, and my decision largely deals with that, though I have also addressed the intimate partner violence.\n\n[29] With respect to the principal claimant\u2019s testimony generally, I also note that it was sometimes very difficult to get the principal claimant to open up. It became apparent that she is not an open person in the sense that speaking about sex and even relationships is not easy for her. Having spent a lot of time listening to the principal claimant, I find that this is partly because of her personality and partly because of the trauma she suffered. I commend her for doing her very best to answer my questions even when it was visibly very difficult for her. I will address her sexual orientation first.\n\n[30] With respect to the principal claimant\u2019s identity as a lesbian, she testified that she knew at the age of 8 or 9 that she was attracted to other women. She testified that it made her feel weird and strange because in Peru one does not see gays or lesbians on the street.\n\n[31] She testified that she never acted on her attraction to another female when she was in school, though she went out with other women casually in a group. She testified that there was no way she could express her sexual identity openly in Peru, and she never had a stable relationship there.\n\n[32] The principal claimant testified that in school and on the street, she suffered a lot of bullying merely because of the way she walked and dressed, which made people assume that she was a lesbian. It was clear from her testimony that this caused her a significant amount of distress.\n\n[33] She testified that she has not had sex with anyone voluntarily. She equated me asking her about having a sexual relationship to living together, and when I asked about sexual relationships, she told me that she has not lived with anyone. Her reserve and hesitation were apparent from the fact that she has not had anything more than a casual dating relationship even since coming to Canada. She testified and I find that her experience with her aggressor traumatized her, and this has affected the way she approaches any relationship.\n\n[34] Her hesitancy to have any relationship that is not just casual does not change my finding that she is a lesbian. I accept her testimony with respect to her early recognition of how she was different, and that she is attracted to women and has been since she was quite young. I also find from her testimony that is not an easy thing for her to discuss, which in my view is not surprising given the violence and bullying she has endured.\n\n[35] The principal claimant testified that she told her sister, the associate claimant, and some friends about her sexual orientation while still in Peru. The principal claimant testified that her sister accepted her no matter what. The associate claimant testified that their grandmother who raised them also accepted the principal claimant for who she was and raised the claimants to know that there was nothing wrong with someone who was not heterosexual.\n\n[36] The associate claimant also testified however about how her sister was treated by others because they assumed she, the principal claimant, was a lesbian even though there was no way for them to know for certain. She further testified that in Peruvian society people treat people they assume are not heterosexual like garbage, including hurling insults at them on the street.\n\n[37] The associate claimant testified that she knew all along about her sister\u2019s sexual orientation. She testified that it was easy to see that she was not like the other girls on the block and described her as rougher. It is of note that even the associate claimant who supports her sister unconditionally assumed, like others, that her sister was not heterosexual just because of the way she appeared.\n\n[38] The principal claimant was fortunate to have friends who accepted her for who she was. She testified that some of her friends were also from the LGBTQ+ community. Despite finding some acceptance with these friends it was also clear that the effects of the bullying and violence perpetrated against her because of her sexual orientation have had a long-term effect on her. In addition, she testified, and I find that there was no way she could have openly shown any affection to someone of the same sex while in Peru.\n\n[39] Since coming to Canada, the principal claimant testified that she feels freer because she sees people like her. She joined the XXXX where she has been able to talk about her past experiences and also spend time with others who share her sexual orientation. She also joined\nGroup Hola and when I asked about it she spontaneously showed me on her phone that it is an LGBTQ group for Spanish-speaking individuals. The principal claimant also included some texts between her and someone with whom she had a casual dating relationship\n\n[40] I find that the principal claimant is a lesbian and is at risk of persecution in Peru.\n\n[41] I further find that the principal claimant experienced intimate partner violence at the hands of her aggressor in part because she was a lesbian. She testified in detail with respect to how she met her aggressor at a bar she used to sometimes frequent after work. She testified that he struck up a conversation with her once and that he seemed friendly. However, the second time she ran into him he offered to walk her home, and when they arrived, he forced his way into her home and sexually assaulted her, telling her he knew she was a lesbian and he would teach her how to be a woman. She provided a medical report[11] substantiating her injuries. She testified with respect to how she obtained this document, and I have no reason to doubt its authenticity. She also provided a statement from a neighbour whom she testified saw her after the attack happened[12]. The principal claimant also testified compellingly about the doctor saying: \u201cChild, please go and file a complaint. This is not something that should happen.\u201d\n\n[42] She testified how scared she was to report the attack to police, though she did so anyway and provided a police report[13]. I have no reason to doubt the authenticity of this report. The principal claimant also testified with respect to the other attacks in relation to which she also provided medical and police reports[14]. When she reported to police, she felt like the police did not take her complaints seriously, first because she is a lesbian, and second, because she discovered that her aggressor is a policeman. She testified that while she was at the police station, the policemen to whom she reported the incident knew her aggressor. Her complaints did not proceed.\n\n[43] I find that the principal claimant faced intimate partner violence at the hands of her aggressor partly because she is a lesbian.\n\n[44] On a forward-looking basis, the principal claimant testified that she saw her aggressor outside her house again in 2018, but nothing happened on that day. The fact that the principal claimant testified that nothing happened that day enhances her credibility with respect to the other incidents. Despite nothing happening to her that day, however, I find that her aggressor was still interested in finding her. His interest in finding her did not cease that day because he subsequently tracked down the associate claimant on three occasions looking for the principal claimant.\n\n[45] The associate claimant testified that after the assault and before she left Peru, she sent her children to live with their father and they have not been going to school in person both because of the assault and because of the pandemic.\n\n[46] The principal claimant testified that she is certain that her aggressor will find her if she returns to Peru. She testified and I find that even though she moved within Peru prior to coming to Canada, he found her and assaulted her again. As indicated, he then also tried to find her through her sister. I find that the only reason there has not been any contact since is because the principal claimant and the associate claimant are in Canada.\n\n[47] I find that the principal claimant has shown on a balance of probabilities that she is at risk of persecution both because of her sexual orientation and because of the intimate partner violence against her by her aggressor. I turn now to an assessment of the associate claimant\u2019s claim.\n\nAssociate Claimant\n\n[48] I did not have any credibility concerns with respect to the associate claimant\u2019s testimony. She testified spontaneously and without hesitation or exaggeration. In addition, her testimony was consistent with her Basis of Claim form and the other documentation in the file. I accept her testimony as given.\n\n[49] The associate claimant testified with respect to the assault perpetrated against her by the principal claimant\u2019s aggressor. She testified that a few months after the principal claimant left Peru, her aggressor came looking for her. She testified that she was on her way home from work when a man approached her, greeted her and then assaulted her. She testified that the man grabbed her by the hair and wanted to know where her sister was. He assaulted her and told her that he would kill her and her family. She testified that the only reason he stopped is because there were people going by who began yelling and telling him to stop.\n\n[50] The second time the principal claimant\u2019s aggressor found the associate claimant was in a different city where she was living in a rented room with her children. The aggressor yelled at the house and shot at the door. On the third occasion, the principal claimant\u2019s aggressor assaulted her, and when her son tried to defend her, he assaulted him. The aggressor threatened that he would kill the associate claimant and her children. The associate claimant provided medical reports[15] relating to the injuries she and her son suffered.\n\n[51] The associate claimant also tried to report the incidents to police (and provided police reports[16]), but nothing was done. She testified, and one of the reports shows, that the aggressor was arrested on one occasion, but he was released. I have no reason to doubt the authenticity of these reports. The associate claimant testified that when she went back to the police to ask about her reports, they gave her many excuses about why nothing was clone, including that they had lost their internet signal. After the third incident, the associate claimant left Peru.\n\n[52] I find that the associate claimant has established her subjective fear of the principal claimant\u2019 s aggressor on a balance of probabilities.\n\n[53] With respect to both claimants, there must also be an objective basis for their subjective fear, which I address next.\n\nObjective Basis\n\n[54] With respect to the principal claimant\u2019s sexual orientation, it is reported that Peru is a country where violence based on sexual orientation remains all too frequent[17]. Even though the country is ranked as being a moderate threat to LGBTI people, a survey showed that 63% of participants stated that they had been the victim of discrimination or violence[18]. It is reported that the environment of fear and frequent discriminatory experiences has very negative consequences for Peruvian LGBTI people, who tend to isolate themselves, feel guilty and powerless in the face of what happens to them, and even turn to the consumption of alcohol and drugs[19].\n\n[55] It is further reported that \u201cin Peruvian society, strongly-held prejudices against the LGBTI population [\u2026] continue today, and that in certain cases, these prejudices are expressed in acts of violence[20]. As in the case of the claimants, it is reported that these violent acts are sometimes committed by members of the national police[21]. I find that there is an objective basis for the principal claimant\u2019s subjective fear.\n\n[56] With respect to the intimate partner violence, it is reported that violence against women and girls, including sexual, physical and psychological abuse, was a serious, underreported national problem[22]. The Ministry of Women and Vulnerable Populations reported more than 57,000 cases of violence against women between January and July, including 92 femicides and 79 femicide attempts; 46 percent of reported cases included physical violence, 56 percent included psychological violence, 46 percent included physical violence, and 15 percent included sexual violence, which represented a 16 percent increase over 2020[23].\n\n[57] While the law prohibits domestic violence and criminalizes rape with penalties for rape of up to a minimum 14 years and a maximum of life imprisonment, enforcement of sexual and domestic violence laws was inadequate, and police action to enforce the law with respect to femicide was weak and slow, and prosecution was often lengthy and ineffective[24].\n\n[58] Generally, with respect to violence against women, it is noted that women in Peru are subjected to violence in all spheres of life, and that the continued existence of widespread traditional patriarchal attitudes and values (machismo) perpetuates a culture of violence against women[25].\n\n[59] I find that the claimants have established that there is an objective basis for their subjective fear and that they have a well-founded fear of persecution in Peru.\n\nState Protection\n\n[60] I find that adequate state protection would not be reasonably forthcoming in this particular case.\n\n[61] States are presumed to be capable of protecting their citizens, except in situations where the country is in a state of complete breakdown. The responsibility to provide international (or surrogate) protection only becomes engaged when national or state protection is unavailable to the claimant. To rebut the presumption of state protection, a claimant must provide \u201cclear and convincing\u201d evidence of the state\u2019s inability to protect its citizens. A claimant is required to approach the state for protection if protection might reasonably be forthcoming. However, a claimant is not required to risk their life seeking ineffective protection of a state, merely to demonstrate that ineffectiveness[26].\n\n[62] The claimants argued that they will not be able to get state protection in Peru. I agree and find that state protection would not be reasonably forthcoming to them if they go back.\n\n[63] First of all, it is reported by NGO representatives that law enforcement authorities in Peru repeatedly failed to protect and, on occasion, violated the rights of LGBTQI+ citizens[27]. In fact, in an April 2020 Inter-American Court case, it was found that Peru was responsible for discriminatory torture against and LGBTI person and ordered Peru to combat such discrimination[28], which included violence. As indicated, it was found that the violence is sometimes committed by members of the national police. In this case, the principal claimant reported the violence against her with no success.\n\n[64] Access to justice for victims of gender-based violence was also inadequate. This includes enforcement often being at the discretion of the relevant authorities and undue dismissal of charges being common[29]. It is further reported that although there are laws in place requiring police protection of victims, enforcement of the law was lax[30]. Violence against women was a serious, underreported problem[31].\n\n[65] In this particular case, both the claimants reported the violence against them with no real action taken by police. As such, I find that the claimant will not be able to access adequate state protection in Colombia and that the presumption of state protection has been rebutted.\n\nInternal Flight Alternative\n\n[66] The final issue is whether the claimants have a viable internal flight alternative (IFA) in Peru. In order to determine whether an IFA exists, I must assess the two-prong test of whether there is any location in Peru in which the claimants would not face a serious possibility of persecution and whether it would be reasonable in all the circumstances to expect them to move to the proposed IFA.[32]\n\n[67] With respect to the principal claimant, I find that with regards to possible viable IFAs, given that the treatment, including violence, of people from the LGBTI community is consistent throughout the country, I find there is a serious possibility of persecution for her throughout Peru and there is no viable IFA for her in Peru.\n\n[68] With respect to the associate claimant, I find that there is also no viable IFA. After the principal claimant\u2019s aggressor found the associate claimant and threatened her the first time, she moved to a different town. Despite this, he found the associate claimant and threatened and assaulted her again. The principal claimant also had moved and her aggressor found her, too.\n\n[69] The claimants testified that the principal claimant\u2019s aggressor appears to be obsessed with her. While the claimants cannot know this with absolute certainty, nor can they know with absolute certainty that he will try and find them again if they return to Peru, I find on a balance of probabilities that he will. His actions are consistent with someone who is obsessed with the principal claimant and showing her with violence, what it means, in his abhorrent view, to be a woman.\n\n[70] Given that the principal claimant\u2019s aggressor is a police officer and has access to information he may not otherwise have, and given he was able to track clown the claimants after they each moved, I find he has both the motivation and means to locate them, and therefore there is a serious possibility that the claimants would be at risk of persecution from him anywhere they went in Peru. I find that the principal claimant\u2019s aggressor will be able to find the claimants through his police connections if they return. As such, I find the first prong of the IFA fails.\n\n[71] In conclusion, I find that the claimants do not have a viable IFA in Peru.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[72] Based on the analysis above, I find that the claimants are Convention refugees pursuant to section 96 of IRPA. Accordingly, I accept their claims.\n\n(signed) D.

You are claiming to be citizens of Sri Lanka and are claiming refugee protection pursuant to Sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n\n[2] I have considered your testimony and the other evidence in this case and I am ready to render my decision orally. I find that you meet the definition of Convention refugees under Section 96 of the IRPA for the following reasons.\n\nALLEGATIONS\n\n[3] The specifics of your allegations are set out in your Basis of Claim forms as amended. In summary, you allege that you have been harassed and abused by army intelligence officials and religious extremists in Sri Lanka due to their belief that you were supporting the LTTE and converting Sinhalese Buddhists. You allege that if you return to Sri Lanka you will be persecuted due to your imputed political beliefs. You allege that there is no state protection for you or an internal flight alternative.\n\nIdentity\n\n[4] Your personal identity as citizens of Sri Lanka has been established by your testimony and supporting documents filed exhibits, specifically your passports issued by the government of Sri Lanka. I, therefore, find on a balance of probabilities that identity and country of reference have been established.\n\nNexus\n\n[5] I find that there is a link between what you fear and Convention Grounds. For the principal claimant, his imputed political opinion as an alleged LTTE supporter and for the associate claimant, her kinship to the principal claimant.\n\nCredibility\n\n[6] Overall, I have found you to be credible witnesses. You testified in detail about your initial arrest in October 2008, explaining how it stemmed from your work in XXXX. The police allege that you were XXXX and arrested you at your home. You provided details about the questions that they asked you, how they checked your phone conversations and eventually released you after three (3) days. You also spoke about a further arrest in March 2009, due to you renting an apartment to a Tamil man who had been accused of involvement with the LTTE. You also spoke about this event in detail, including the questions asked of you, the accusations that you were an LTTE Tiger and the physical assaults that you endured.\n\n[7] Both of you testified about an incident on May 1, 2018, where unknown individuals came to your home and drugged you so that you would fall unconscious and then raided your home, taking numerous things. The principal claimant was then arrested again in August by people that he believed to be connected to the state. So, you explained that the reason for this belief were that these individuals knew details, information about you and your prior activities in England as well as your past arrests. You provided a description of the location where you were held and provided details about the questions asked and the accusations made that you were working with the LTTE.\n\n[8] You also testified that the police came to your father\u2019s home on August 3, 2020, inquiring about your whereabouts. This information was not mentioned in your narrative, but it was provided in an affidavit from your father. When asked about this, you explained that you did not realize that you should include this information in your narrative, since it was included in the affidavit. I accept this explanation as reasonable and do not draw a negative inference from this omission.\n\n[9] Your testimony was spontaneous, detailed and otherwise consistent with your Basis of Claim form. There were no other omissions or contradictions going to the core of the claim. Your also provided documentary evidence to support your claim, including affidavits from individuals in Sri Lanka and photos of your charity work. I find that these documents are credible and support your allegations.\n\n[10 Based on the totality of the evidence, I find that your subjective fear is established by your credible testimony and I believe what you have alleged on a balance of probabilities. I find that you have been harassed and abused by on multiple occasions by intelligence officers in Sri Lanka, due to their belief that you are an LTTE supporter.\n\nObjective Basis\n\n[11] I also find that there is an objective basis for what you fear in Sri Lanka. Section 13.1 of the National Documentation Package for Sri Lanka states that security forces regularly monitor and harass community members, especially activists and former or suspected LTTE members. Community members report monitoring by authorities of public gatherings and protests and targeted surveillance and questioning of individuals in groups. Sources indicate that since the 2019 election, the human right situation has deteriorated significantly and that there has been an increase in repression and abuses, including increased incidents of police brutality. Arrests of former LTTE combatants have also significantly increased through search operations.\n\n[12] Based on your credible testimony and the objective evidence in the National Documentation Package, I find that your subjective fear of persecution is well-founded. I am satisfied that you face a serious possibility of persecution if returned to Sri Lanka and that this risk would continue due to your imputed political opinion as an LTTE supporters and for the associate claimant, her kinship to the principal claimant.\n\nState Protection\n\n[13] I find that state protection would not be available to you, were you to seek it in Sri Lanka. When agents of the state themselves are the source of one\u2019s persecution, the presumption of state protection may be rebutted without exhausting all avenues of recourse in the country. In this case, the agents of persecution are the state, who have detained you on multiple occasions.\n\n[14] The NDP at Item 1.9 states that Sri Lanka lacks in independent and efficient mechanism to address complaints of torture. At Item 2.2, it also states that limited steps are taken to hold perpetrators of serious human rights violations accountable.\n\n[15] So, in light of the objective country documentation as well as your personal circumstances, I find that you have rebutted the presumption of state protection and that adequate state protection would not be available to you in Sri Lanka, on a balance of probabilities.\n\nInternal Flight Alternative\n\n[16] I have also considered whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for you. You are known to the army, who believe that you are supporting the LTTE. Given that the state has targeted you, I find that you face a serious possibility of persecution throughout Sri Lanka.\n\n[17] Item 1.9 of the NDP states that Sri Lankan forces maintain effective control throughout the country and individuals are unlikely to relocate internally with anonymity. I also find that the risk created by the principal claimant\u2019s imputed political opinion extends to the associate claimant due to her kinship to him. State agents may assume that the associate claimant is also an LTTE supporter given her connection to her husband, where they may target the claimant in an effort to obtain information or influence her husband. I also note that the associate claimant has already experienced abuse as a result of her husband being targeted. Specifically, on May 1, 2018, when both she and her husband were drugged in their home.\n\n[18] I, therefore, find that there is no viable flight alternative for you in Sri Lanka.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[19] Based on the totality of the evidence, I find you to be Convention refugees as per Section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. Therefore, I accept your claims.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

Kaminker\nCountry: Georgia\nRPD Number: TB8-13724\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2023-01023\nATIP Pages: N\/A\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] These are the reasons for the decision in the refugee claim of XXXX who alleges to be a citizen of Georgia, and is seeking protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] The claimant\u2019s allegations are fully set out in his Basis of Claim (BOC) form and amended BOC forms, found at Exhibit 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3. In short, the claimant alleges that he was a XXXX. On August 1, 2017, some top officials from City Hall of Tbilisi ate at the XXXX but refused to pay for their meal. When the claimant confronted the men, a man named G.P. \u2013 who XXXX to the former General Prosecutor of Georgia (i.e., O.P.) with connection to criminal groups in Georgia \u2013 threatened him with serious harm by stating that he will soon regret his actions. On August 16, 2017, the claimant was confronted by three individuals at his home. In this exchange the claimant was told that he was to pay 50% of his profit every month. The claimant reported these threats to the police but did not receive any assistance. On September 12, 2017, the same three individuals attacked the claimant. A report was made to the police and despite follow ups he was later told that his complaint to the police was not registered. The claimant followed-up with the Office of the Prosecutor but no assistance was forthcoming.\nOn January 2, 2018, the claimant was attacked by a group of unknown men who forced him to sign papers, handing over his business to a man name G.G. He was beaten and found unconscious by the gravedigger the next day. He was taken to the hospital where he received medical treatment and stayed for eight (8) days. Following this, he received calls from an unknown person who threatened him with death. The claimant was told by a friend, a former police officer, that those threatening him are likely those who cooperate with O.P. The claimant and his family hid in Khashuri. With the help of an agent, he left Georgia on XXXX 2018. When he arrived in Montreal, Canada, he made a claim for refugee protection at the airport.\n[3] After his arrival in Canada the claimant asked his spouse to talk to a lawyer in order to take steps to have his possessions returned, including his XXXX which he had been forced to\nRPD.52.08 (June 1, 2021) sign away during the January 2018 attack. On January 18, 2019, the claimant\u2019s spouse was threatened with death by an unknown individual who told her that she and her family would be killed if she did not stop pursuing the lawsuit. Following this, the claimant withdrew his legal pursuit.\n[4] The claimant alleges that those persecuting him are in collusion with the Georgian Police and General Prosecutor\u2019s Office. As such, there is no state protection or internal flight alternative.\nDETERMINATION\n[5] The Panel finds the claimant to be a Convention refugee for reasons of his imputed political opinion, for the following reasons.\nANALYSIS\n\nIdentity\n[6] The claimant\u2019s identity has been established on a balance of probabilities by way of a certified copy of his Georgian passport on file, found at Exhibit 1.\nNexus\n[7] There is a nexus between the harm the claimant fears and his imputed political opinion. When the claimant confronted the government officials and G.P., this was perceived as an act of defying them. Following this, he was targeted for extortion and beaten. This claim will therefore be assessed pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA. The test under s. 96 is whether there is a serious possibility of persecution should he return to Georgia, and the claimant has met that test.\nCredibility\n[8] The claimant\u2019s testimony has been consistent with the other evidence on file. The claimant provided spontaneous details of the events that took place in Georgia and explained why he left. He testified in a straightforward manner and made no attempts to mislead the Board. There were no relevant contradictions that would go to the core of his claim.\n[9] The claimant tendered the following documents to support the credibility of his claim, found at Exhibit 6.l and 6.2:\nMedical record of his hospitalization from XXXX, 2018, to XXXX, 2018, corroborates the admission period and injuries he suffered as a result of being attacked on January 2, 2018.Police statement dated July 4, 2019, corroborates that the police statement was taken at the hospital on XXXX 2018, that he was found at the Kukia graveyard, and his injuries are consistent with the alleged attack. Additionally, the document indicates that the case (i.e., file number N52148\/18) was closed and investigation terminated on May 10, 2018, due to inadequate evidence and no witnesses. No perpetrators were named.Business registration for the XXXX corroborates that the claimant is the owner of a commercial entity in Tbilisi.Letters from friends, family, and a neighbour attest to the harm the claimant faced in Georgia, and the ongoing threat to him and his family.Letter from the claimant\u2019s lawyer attest to the legal proceedings his wife initiated and reasons why they withdrew is consistent with the claimant\u2019s testimony.[10] After reviewing these documents, the Panel finds no reason to cast any doubt on its veracity. As such the Panel places weight on these documents to support the claimant\u2019 s allegations of threat from G.P. and the men that attacked him.\n[11] The claimant\u2019s wife participated as a witness on the day of the hearing. Her testimony was straightforward and consistent with the material evidence on file. The Panel finds no reason to cast doubt on the veracity of her allegations. As such, the Panel determined that she was trustworthy and credible, on a balance of probabilities.\n[12] The Panel finds that, on a balance of probabilities, the claimant has established that because of his action on August 1, 2017, his imputed political opinion has made him a target for\nG.P. and the men responsible for his attack. The Panel accepts the claimant\u2019s full allegations.\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution\n[13] The Panel look to the objective evidence to assess the claimant\u2019 s risk of persecution in Georgia. The National Documentation Package (NDP) for Georgia, found at Exhibit 3, established that those who opposes the Georgian government are at risk of persecution in that country. The United States Department of State Report at Tab 2.1. indicates that there are significant human rights issues in Georgia including serious problems with the independence of the judiciary along with detentions, investigations, and prosecutions for those considered to be politically motivated and the problem spans nationwide. It also states that the courts are only independent in theory, and that the principle of due process is not respected by the state.\nImpunity remains a problem, including a lack of accountability of the police and security force. According to a 2021 report from Freedom House, at Tab 2.4, the source indicates that corruption persists within government authorities. These sources provide clear and convincing evidence of corruption, which is pervasive throughout Georgia.\n[14] The Panel also consider the claimant\u2019 s country condition documents, found at Exhibit\n6.2. The first article, from the US department of treasury, dated December 22, 2017, states that the Thieves-in-Law is a Eurasian crime syndicate that has been linked to a long list of illicit activity across the globe. The Treasury has designated the Thieves-in-Law as part of a broader strategy to disrupt the financial infrastructure of transnational criminal organizations that pose a threat to the United States and their allies.\n[15] At Exhibit 6.2, the second article from June 8, 2018, by INTERPOL identifies the Thieves-in-Law as the highest-ranking organized crime members who control the activities of less powerful criminal groups following their own code of honour. Their influence can extend across multiple crime networks and involve numerous crimes or property crime, or trafficking in drugs or human beings. The source indicates that the Thieves in Law often manipulate businesses and control entire sectors of a country\u2019s economy. Georgia was among delegates attending the INTERPOL meeting represented.\n[16] Exhibit 6.2, an article titled, \u201cFormer chief prosecutor Otar Partkhaladze was acquitted in the case of beating Lasha Tordia\u201d (page 60 of the claimant\u2019s disclosure) it reports that he was acquitted of beating former Auditor General Lasha Tordia. Page 63 reports that Transparency International Georgia continued a systematized process of collecting information about cases of alleged high-level corruption in Georgia which have been revealed in recent years and have not been investigated. At page 67 there is a report that property was unlawfully transferred to Otar Partskhaladze\u2019s company BSR-CDG Development which was believed to be the result of a corrupt deal.\n[17] The Panel also considered the IRB\u2019s evidence on the Thieves-in-Law and state corruption, found atExhibit4.4. At page 3, the source indicated that the Thieves-in-Law group has grown into a vast criminal organization that has spread throughout the former Soviet Union, Europe, and the United States, and they are linked to crimes such as money laundering, extortion, bribery, and robbery. At page 4, the source indicates that elite corruption persists and there has been significant backsliding as rulers consolidate power, cut deals with senior judges, and effectively capture and manipulated the state for their own benefit.\n[18] The Panel finds that the objective evidence supports the claimant\u2019 s testimony that the Thieves-in-Law have targeted him for extortion, on a balance of probabilities. Additionally, the claimant\u2019s evidence supports that O.P. have been linked to the acquisition of unlawfully transferred property and acquitted of corrupt activities in Georgia, on a balance of probabilities.\n[19] Taken together, the Panel finds that the claimant faces a risk of persecution in Georgia due to his imputed political opinion. The Panel finds that, on a balance of probabilities, the claimant has established the objective basis for his well-founded fear of persecution.\nState Protection\n[20] The claimant testified that he approached the state for help on January2, 2018. He testified that help and state protection did not materialize. As indicated in his police statement, found at Exhibit 5.1, the investigation was dismissed.\n[21] At Exhibit 4.4, page 59 the document indicates that the authorities have reportedly failed to respond to credible allegations of corruption made against high-ranking government officials and other influential individuals with ties to the ruling party.\n[22] At Exhibit 3, the Freedom House report found in the National Documentation Package states that despite ongoing judicial reforms, executive and legislative interference in the Courts remain a substantial problem as does a lack of transparency and professionalism surrounding judicial proceedings. Thus, there is evidence of high-level corruption which has continued in Georgia with impunity. The evidence indicates that authorities have failed to grapple with and interfere in this continued high-level corruption.\n[23] The claimant was subjected to corrupt activities from high level individuals. In this case the claimant lost his business and was seriously beaten. Further, when efforts were made to try to recover his business, his wife was threatened in no uncertain terms.\n[24] With clear and convincing evidence, the Panel determined that, on a balance of probabilities, the claimant has rebutted the presumption of state protection.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[25] The Panel considered whether a viable interna! flight alternative exists for the claimant and named Kutaisi and Batumi as potential locations.\n[26] The claimant testified if he were to return to Georgia he could easily be located because the agents of persecution in this case are connected to the government and connected to individuals who have ties to high levels of the government. Further, he testified that they would seek him because they would be concerned that he would take steps to try to reclaim the property that had been unlawfully taken from him during the attack in January of 2018. In fact, his wife had made efforts to reclaim that property after the claimant departed Georgia only to be met with threats against both her and her family.\n[27] Given that the Panel finds that the evidence reviewed above, confirms that the oppressive treatment of those perceived as political opponents is nationwide and given that the claimant\u2019 s agents of persecution is associated with the government, the Panel finds that there is a serious possibility of persecution for the claimant throughout Georgia. Additionally, the Panel notes that the country is small and given this geographical limitation, an internal flight alternative is less viable for him in Georgia. Taken together, the Panel finds that there is no viable interna! flight alternative for the claimant anywhere in Georgia. The IFA test has failed on the first prong.\nCONCLUSION\n[28] Having considered the totality of the evidence, the Panel determined that the claimant faces a serious possibility of persecution in Georgia if he were to return. The claimant is a Convention refugee, and his claim is therefore accepted.\n(signed) H.DAM\n\nNovember 16, 2022\n\n",

The Panel has considered the claimant\u2019s testimony and all the evidence she has provided, and the Panel is ready to render its decision orally. The claimant is a stateless individual from Kuwait and is claiming refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n\n[2] The claimant alleges she fears persecution by the government of Kuwait due to being a Bidoon individual. The claimant also alleges she fears the Kuwaiti government because she alleges that if she were to return to Kuwait, then they will arrest her and put her in prison because the government will assume she has criticized the government.\n\n[3] The claimant has demonstrated a well-founded fear of persecution based on a Convention ground. The Panel concludes that the claimant is a Convention refugee as per section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act by reason of her membership in a particular social group, namely a Bidoon individual from Kuwait.\n\n[4] The identity of the claimant is established by a copy of her passport issued by the authorities of Kuwait along with the US Visa. The testimony that is given under oath is presumed to be true unless there is a valid reason to doubt the truthfulness. The Panel does not have any valid reasons to doubt the truthfulness of the claimant\u2019s allegations. The claimant was consistent and credible in her evidence. She testified in a straightforward manner and there are no inconsistencies in her evidence. The claimant provided a detailed account of how she was denied certain rights, such as education, employment, and healthcare, because she is Bidoon. The claimant then explained that with the (inaudible), Bidoons were able to get some food from the government, apply for a passport, and receive basic medical care. However, without a security card, they will receive none of these things. The claimant then provided a detailed account of how she attempted to renew her security card in 2019. She explained she went to the centre for the Bidoons and filled out the paperwork. She then explained that the official told her that they would call her. She then said she received the call, and an employee told her that she had limitations on her card. The employee told her she had to sign a white piece of paper, or she could not get the card. The claimant then explained that the employee said that he could possibly help her if she had relations with him. The claimant then testified she did not have relations with the employee because they are liars who just wanted sex and she did not sign the piece of paper because she would be acknowledging that she had another nationality, like Iraqi. As a result, she did not get to renew her security card. The claimant also provided documentary evidence to establish that she is a Bidoon individual. The claimant provided a copy of her security card, a copy of her birth certificate, which states that her parents are stateless residents of Kuwait. The claimant also provided documents regarding her father\u2019s identity, which included the 1965 census form and the letter from the International Committee of the Red Cross stating on her father, who is stateless, was released from a prison in Iraq in 1991 and repatriated back to Kuwait. The Panel therefore finds on a balance of probabilities, the claimant has established herself as a Bidoon, and the Panel further finds that the claimant has a subjective fear of returning to Kuwait.\n\n[5] The claimant was born to a stateless father. As a result, she has been denied the rights enjoyed by citizens. She was denied public education and healthcare, she faced problems in getting employment. The Panel then finds cumulatively her experience amount to persecution which demonstrates, in perspective, similar problems if she were to return to Kuwait. (inaudible) of the objective country evidence corroborates the fact that Bidoons face serious problems in Kuwait. Tab 1.6 of the National Documentation Package states that Bidoons are marginalized native Nomadic tribes who settled in Kuwait territory at a much later stage than the rest of the citizens. Many tribal groups were naturalized. However, some were not, and today, they constitute a group of over a hundred thousand persons without legal documents. For decades, the Bidoons have been denied full citizenship rights, such as access to social welfare, favourable employment, and voting rights despite often having lived in Kuwait all their lives. According to the United States Department of State at Tab 2.1 of NDP, the Bidoons face problems obtaining authorization for foreign travel and have restrictions on obtaining travel documents. They have no access to the judiciary to present evidence and plead their case for citizenship. Bidoon leaders alleged having some members of their community attempt to obtain government services; Officials routinely deceive them by promising to provide necessary paperwork only if the Bidoon agrees to sign a blank piece of paper. Later, officials would write a letter on the signed paper (inaudible) confessing the Bidoon\u2019s true nationality, which renders them ineligible for recognition or benefits as a Bidoon. This is consistent with the claimant\u2019s allegations such that when she tried to renew her security card, the government employee required her to sign a form which indicated she had Iraqi citizenship, which she refused. The UK Home Office report at Tab 13.1 of the NDP indicates that Bidoons are prevented from working and receiving the most basic government services and are denied rights to medical treatment, housing, documentation, education and driver licenses. It also finds that their lack of legal status means that they are not allowed to participate in the political process. The source also states that they are constantly at risk for arrest or detention and their family relationships are effectively illegitimate. The source also states that Bidoon girls and women have been particularly vulnerable to discrimination and abuse; They have faced sexual harassment from government officials while applying for documentation. Again, this is consistent with the claimant\u2019s allegations when she attempted to renew her security card.\n\n[6] Freedom house at Tab 2.3 of the NDP indicates that Bidoons often leave in poor conditions, have difficulty accessing public services, and obtaining formal employment. While the law provides for a process which Bidoons may try to prove their Kuwaiti nationality, it is opaque and largely ineffective. Amnesty International 2.2 of NDP note that the Bidoon people remain unable to access a range of public services, including healthcare. Human Rights watch at Tap 2.5 in NDP confirms that they face obstacles to obtaining civil documents, consistently receiving social services, interfering with their fundamental rights to health, education, work, among others. The Minority Rights Group International at Tab 13.4 of NDP explains that Bidoons face discrimination in employment by virtue of their illegal status. And when they can secure civil service employment, they are offered little job security and none of the benefits provided by law to citizens, such as paid sick leave, annual leave, and pension. Salaries offered to Bidoons in both private and the public sectors are generally lower than those offered to citizens. Many Bidoons are forced to earn a living in informal sectors, such as selling fruits and vegetables on the streets. However, since they cannot attain commercial licenses or own property, they are at a constant risk of being arrested or having their goods confiscated for operating businesses illegally. In terms of healthcare, Bidoons can purchase low-cost insurance plans from the government that allows them to be treated in public hospitals. However, these healthcare plans exclude many types of tests, medications, and operations. The only other option for undocumented Bidoons is to attend one (1) of the private hospitals, which is (inaudible) expensive for many. Discriminatory policies towards Bidoons have contributed to communities\u2019 relative poverty and social segregation over the long term. Most Bidoons live in (inaudible) on the outskirts of cities where they lack adequate housing and protection from Kuwait\u2019s extreme weather conditions. The evidence before the Panel established that Bidoons do not have a pathway to citizenship, which leaves them consigned to unending generations of statelessness, rendering them unable to access many basic services, such as employment, housing, health care, and education. The Panel finds that cumulatively, discriminations and restrictions on central aspects of life amount to persecution. Based on the claimant\u2019s status as a Bidoon, the problems she faced, and the treatment of Bidoons generally, the Panel finds that there is a serious possibility of persecution if you were to return to Kuwait.\n\n[7] The (inaudible) the claimant fears stem from the Kuwaiti authorities. Based on the country condition documents above, The Panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that it would be unreasonable for the claimant to seek protection from the state.\n\n[8] The Kuwaiti authorities have effective control throughout the country, and the laws and the persecution the claimant fears are prevalent throughout Kuwait. Therefore, Panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant would face a serious of persecution throughout Kuwait and therefore does not have an internal flight alternative.\n\n[9] Based on the totality of all the evidence, the Panel finds the claimant has established a well-founded of persecution and that there is serious possibility that she would be persecuted on a Convention ground should she return to Kuwait today. As such, the Panel finds the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, and her claim is accepted.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

The panel finds that the claimant was generally credible, in that his testimony was free of any contradictions, inconsistencies or omissions that were not explained to the panel\u2019s satisfaction.\n\n[8] The claimant testified that he identifies as a bisexual man. He stated that he had been in relationships with women, but only until 2000. Since 2000, he has only dated men because he feels more comfortable with men. He stated that he discovered his attraction to men as a teenager. He had two children with his former spouse, but while he was in a relationship with her, he was also seeing a man named XXXX XXXX XXXX. in secret. He stated that he was in a relationship with this man for 12 years, but that he hid the relationship during this time because same-sex acts between men are considered a crime in Jamaica.\n\n[9] The claimant stated that he was first attacked by a group of individuals who saw him with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXand assumed they were a couple. After the attack, he fled to Suriname for five years. He stated that the perception of the LGBTQ community in Suriname is similar to how it is perceived in Jamaica. He was therefore discreet about his sexual orientation while he was there. He explained that he returned to Jamaica in 2018 because his father was seriously ill. After returning there, he was attacked a second time. Following this second attack, he took refuge in the city of Kingston, but travelled discreetly a few times to see his father. When his father died, he decided to come to Canada. He initially arrived in Canada on a work permit and claimed refugee protection a few months later.\n\n[10] The panel had some concerns, but the claimant addressed them satisfactorily. The panel asked why the claimant had returned to Jamaica in 2018 after having fled the country. The panel also asked why the claimant had not come to Canada earlier and why he had not claimed refugee protection immediately upon his arrival. The claimant stated that he had been forced to return to Jamaica in 2018 because his father was ill. He explained that his father was alone and that he was the only person who could look after him. He also stated that he had been looking for a way to leave Jamaica and had been researching ways to do so, but had not wanted to leave while his father was still alive. He explained that during the last months he spent in Jamaica, he had been sneaking around to avoid being spotted by the individuals who had previously assaulted him. As soon as his father died, he left the country for good. He also stated that he had travelled here on a work visa. When he left his job in Canada, he was told that he would have to return to Jamaica, and because he was afraid for his life, he decided to claim refugee protection. The panel is of the opinion that the claimant has provided satisfactory explanations in the circumstances and that his conduct does not demonstrate a lack of subjective fear or undermine his overall credibility.\n\n[11] Accordingly, the panel concludes that the claimant has established his sexual orientation as a bisexual man and his fear by reason of this profile, on a balance of probabilities.\n\nWell-founded fear of persecution\n\n[12] The objective evidence in the National Documentation Package[3] indicates that homophobia is widespread in Jamaica and that members of the LGBTQI community face widespread persecution. As a result, SOGIESC individuals \u201cface both general societal discrimination as well as discrimination in access to services, including healthcare, housing, and employment.\u201d[4]\n\n[13] According to some sources, same-sex acts between men are illegal in Jamaica. Thus, SOGIESC individuals face arrest and detention because of their sexuality.[5] Physical and sexual violence, including beatings and even murder, are part of the real experiences of many SOGIESC individuals in Jamaica. The level of brutality leads many to fear what could happen if their sexual orientation or gender identity were discovered.[6]\n\n[14] With regard to employment, sources report that \u201cemployment discrimination continues to be a significant issue for the LGBT community\u201d and that members of sexual minorities who live in the open are \u201cbasically unemployable.\u201d SOGIESC individuals are also discriminated against with respect to housing, as there are reports of people facing evictions because of their sexual orientation.[7]\n\n[15] Conditions for SOGIESC individuals in Jamaica have improved, although they remain a problem given the deeply rooted homophobia in Jamaican society. Human rights advocates in Jamaica have actively promoted respect, acceptance, and inclusion of sexual and gender minorities, leading The Guardian newspaper to report in December 2018 that Jamaica was \u201cno longer the most homophobic place on Earth.\u201d[8]\n\n[16] The latest US State Department report on human rights in Jamaica states that the law does not extend antidiscrimination protections to SOGIESC individuals and \u201clegitimizes violence towards LGBTI+ persons.\u201d[9] Harassment and violence against SOGIESC individuals are frequently ignored by the police, and discrimination is pervasive.[10]\n\n[17] Based on this objective evidence, despite recent progress, LGBTQ individuals continue to face widespread persecution in the country, and the country\u2019s laws do not protect SOGIESC individuals from the discrimination they face in various aspects of their lives, including housing and employment. Furthermore, violence against SOGIESC individuals remains a major concern in the country and is frequently ignored by the police.\n\n[18] For these reasons, the panel considers that the claimant has established a well-founded fear of persecution as a bisexual man in Jamaica.\n\nState protection\n\n[19] According to the objective evidence, although the situation for SOGIESC individuals in Jamaica has improved somewhat, sources reported as recently as 2020 that \u201c[h]arassment and violence targeting LGBT+ people remains a major concern, and such instances are frequently ignored by the police.\u201d[11]\n\n[20] While Jamaica\u2019s police force implemented a diversity policy in 2011, which includes guidelines on the treatment of sexual minorities, Human Rights Watch reports that the police continued to make derogatory comments when people tried to report homophobic violence and failed or refused to take a report, \u201ceven well after the Policy on Diversity was established.\u201d[12]\n\n[21] Given this objective evidence that Jamaican police officers often ignore requests for protection from SOGIESC individuals, the panel concludes that it is not reasonable to expect the claimant to approach the police.\n\n[22] In light of the objective documentary evidence mentioned above, the panel concludes that there is clear and convincing evidence that the claimant would not have access to adequate state protection. The presumption of state protection is therefore rebutted.\n\nInternal flight alternative\n\n[23] As stated earlier, sexual relations between men in Jamaica are prohibited under the Offences Against the Person Act 1864, which criminalizes acts of \u201cbuggery\u201d and \u201cgross indecency.\u201d This law carries a maximum penalty of 10 years\u2019 imprisonment with hard labour.[13] The law is applied indiscriminately, and the state has full governance over the entire territory. Moreover, the claimant cannot be expected to conceal his sexual orientation in order to avoid persecution.\n\n[24] Accordingly, the panel concludes that the claimant would face a serious possibility of persecution throughout Jamaica and that he would have no viable internal flight alternative should he return to his country.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[25] For these reasons, the panel determines that the claimant is a \u201cConvention refugee\u201d under section 96 of the IRPA.\n\n[26] Accordingly, the panel allows the claim for refugee protection made by XXXX XXXX XXXX.\n\nJessica Khalil\n\nOctober 18, 2022\n\n[1] Document 1 \u2013 Information package provided by the Canada Border Services Agency or Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada: Passport.\n\n[2] Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9: Proceedings Before the IRB Involving Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression, issued by the Chairperson pursuant to paragraph 159(1)(h) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.

It\u2019s RPD file number TB6-18589.\n\n[2] The date of the hearing is March 14, 2022, and the date of the decision and reasons are the same date.\n\n[3] The claimant was represented by counsel, Patricia Ritter, and also, XXXX XXXX was appointed as a designated representative to represent the interests of the claimant, due to her medical condition.\n\n[4] The file has a somewhat complicated history.\n\n[5] The claimant filed her claim for protection in Canada, in late 2016. She underwent an initial hearing, a first hearing, in December 2017 at the RPD, and reasons for refusal were issued by the first instance, RPD decision, in January 2018.

It would be unfair, inappropriate to stand, based on the claimant\u2019s mental health at the time of her testimony, at the first hearing.\n\n[8] The allegations are set out in the claimant\u2019s BOC and amended BOC forms, in Exhibit 1, in the RAD file.\n\n[9] In short, the claimant alleged that she\u2019s a practicing member of the Falun Gong faith. That her past activities came to the attention of the Public Security Bureau in China, and that she came to Canada, and continued to practice here.\n\nDETERMINATION\n\n[10] For the following reasons, on a balance of probability, the Panel finds that the claimant would face a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground, in China today, if she were to return.\n\n[11] Therefore, the Panel finds the claimant to be a Convention refugee.\n\n[12] The identity of the claimant was not challenged during the process.\n\n[13] The Panel accepts, on a balance of probabilities, the claimant is who she claims to be, her personal identity, as well of being a citizen of China. She obviously received the temporary resident visa in 2016, so Canadian officials in the source country did not have any concerns about the genuineness of her identity.\n\n[14] And in terms of preliminary matters, the Counsel, for the claimant, provided several items of medical, the disclosure in Exhibit 3; Exhibit 4; Exhibit 5. These materials were from two (2) doctors: a XXXX XXXX XXXX, and a XXXX XXXX XXXX. The claimant has been diagnosed with a XXXX XXXX XXXX, and as well as other mental health challenges that might cause her memory to become difficult for her. And also, she has had some experiences with XXXX XXXX XXXX.\n\n[15] So in light of this, firstly, the Panel accepts that evidence as credible and trustworthy, and finds no reason to dispute what it says. But for those reasons, in advance of the hearing, the RPD appointed a designated representative suggested by Counsel, Madam XXXX XXXX, who was present today, and at the pre-hearing conference provided guidance to the Member on the limitations of the claimant\u2019s testimony today, in order to not traumatize her.\n\n[16] And in conjunction with that, the Member made a formal declaration that Guideline 8, the vulnerable claimants\u2019 Guidelines, would be invoked. And the claimant benefitted from the procedural accommodations in there to have, for example, Counsel questioned the claimant first instead of the Member, and to break briefly, and ensure active communication with the claimant, to ensure that the process wasn\u2019t causing her undue emotional distress.\n\n[17] The central issue of the claim was credibility, and, in particular, whether the Panel accepts as credible the claimant\u2019s assertions that she\u2019s a practicing member of the Falun Gong faith. In this regard, her counsel questioned her about some of the history of the movement, some of the doctrines, the leadership, and other significant characteristics of the Falun Gong practice.\n\n[18] The claimant was able to corroborate the three (3) universal principles of the faith; the five (5) exercises; the intellectual author, Master Li, and other in his books; when Falun Gong was banned in China; and other major features of the faith.\n\n[19] The claimant also testified to her participation in events in the Toronto area upon her arrival, before she moved to Kitchener, and before the advent of the coronavirus prevented in-person gatherings.\n\n[20] The claimant\u2019s testimony is accepted as credible and trustworthy. There was no major concerns concerning her statements, and the objective country and origin information concerning the Falun Gong movement, set out in the NDP at Item 12, in the items under religion and Item 12 of the NDP.\n\n[21] Internal flight alternative and state protection were not canvassed as (inaudible) issues because the agent of persecution is the Chinese state, Public Security Bureau, and it would not be appropriate to ask the claimant to seek protection from authorities that are responsible for banning the Falun Gong practice.\n\n[22] The objective country origin evidence indicates little to no tolerance of the Falun Gong faith today in China, and also sets out numerous examples of practitioners being jailed and being persecuted.\n\n[23] So for all of these reasons, the Panel finds that the claimant has satisfied her burden of establishing a serious possibility of persecution in China today.\n\n[24] And as such, in conclusion, the Panel finds the claimant is a Convention refugee under Section 96 of the IRPA and accepts her claim.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

Williams\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Adetayo G. Akinyemi\nCountry: Nigeria\nRPD Number: TB8-23088\nAssociated RPD Number(s): TB8-23148, TB8-23149\nATIP Number: A-2023-01023\nATIP Pages: N\/A\n\nDECISION\n\n[1] MEMBER: These are the reasons for the decision in the refugee protection claim of Ms. XXXX XXXX, the principal claimant, as well as her two minor children, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, who claim to be citizens of Nigeria and are claiming refugee protection pursuant to Sections 96 and 97.1 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. File number for the claim is TB8-23088. In rendering these reasons I\u2019ve also applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guidelines on women refugee claimants fearing gender related persecution.\n\n[2] The specifics of the claim are set out in your Basis of Claim form. In summary, you allege that you face a risk of persecution at the hands of your ex-husband in Nigeria as you have been a victim of domestic violence throughout your marriage and after your marriage ended, and because your husband has threatened to kill you and to kidnap your children.\n\n[3] I find that you are a Convention refugee as you have established a serious possibility of persecution on account of your membership in a particular social group as a female fearing gender-based persecution and domestic violence. I find that your children are Convention refugees as you have established that your children face a serious possibility of persecution on account of their membership in a particular social group, family members.\n\n[4] In terms of your identity, I find that your personal identities and identities as nationals of Nigeria has been established by your oral testimony as well as the copies of the Nigerian passports filed in evidence at Exhibit 1.\n\n[5] With respect to the nexus, your fear of persecution is linked to the Convention ground of membership in a particular social group, that being referring to being a woman, women fearing gender-based persecution and domestic violence, and your children\u2019s fear of persecution is connected to the Convention ground of membership in a particular social group of family. Accordingly, the claims are assessed under Section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n\n[6] In terms of credibility, I find that you are a credible witness. You testified in a straightforward manner. There were no inconsistencies in testimonies or contradictions between your testimony and the other evidence that is before me that has not been satisfactorily explained. Therefore I find that you are credible and that the allegations you laid out in your testimony and in your Basis of Claim form have occurred as you have alleged.\n\n[7] You explained that you suffered a long history of domestic violence abuse at the hands of your ex-husband, Mr. XXXX XXXX, and that your children were also victims of abuse and intimidation by their father, Mr. XXXX. You testified that you took measures to protect them from being exposed to abuse often. You provided information in your narrative as well as your testimony regarding your husband\u2019s social status as a former XXXX and member of the All-Progressive Congress, APC, the ruling party of Nigeria, and his involvement in politics around the year 2009. You described your knowledge of his involvement in politics as you observed him participating in political rallies and meetings and that he contested for political positions.\n\n[8] You explained that your ex-husband blamed you for his failure in a certain political endeavour as he stated that the family court matters related to your file for child support against him had negatively impacted his reputation. You stated that you fled Nigeria after suffering continuous harassment including numerous telephone calls, threats to your life, and threats to harm your children made by you ex-husband, his relatives, and his friends.\n\n[9] After you left Nigeria your husband continued to display an interest in harming you as he has brought police officers to your family home around the year 2018 to arrest you on false accusations that you stole funds from him during your marriage. You provided documentary evidence in support of your claim. This is found at Exhibit 5. I will highlight some of the most relevant documents here.\n\n[10] Firstly, there is a copy of your marriage certificate to Mr. XXXX XXXX, and photographs of your wedding. You also provided a copy of the dissolution of marriage divorce document. You provided additional legal documents from Nigeria at pages 25 and 26 and these demonstrate that you have sole custody of your two children and that you filed for child support from your ex-husband. There are also two letters of support here, one from your sister as well as one from your uncle.\n\n[11] And lastly I\u2019ll highlight that there is a biopsychosocial assessment report from a mental health professional and this report describes your experience with symptoms of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The report also describes incidents of abuse against your children perpetrated by your ex-husband as you reported to the mental health professional. I find the above listed documentary evidence to be detailed, relevant, and to corroborate your allegations as stated in your Basis of Claim form and your oral testimony, and I give full weight to the documents listed above.\n\n[12] In light of the evidence before me, I accept on a balance of probabilities that you were married to a man named Mr. XXXX XXXX, that you and your children were the victims of physical and emotional abuse at the hands of your ex-husband, that he threatened to end your life, and that your ex-husband is a former XXXX and member of the All-Progressive Congress. I accept on a balance of probabilities that your ex-husband continued to show interest in harming you after you fled Nigeria, and that members of his network including police officers have aided him in his efforts to control you in the past.\n\n[13] On the issue of subjective fear, you testified that you travelled to United Kingdom and United States of America and that this travel did occur after you began suffering from domestic abuse at the hands of your husband. I\u2019ve considered whether your decision not to claim asylum in the United Kingdom and United States undermines your subjective fear or detracts from your credibility.\n\n[14] You explained the reason you did not claim asylum during your travel to United Kingdom is because you believe that you could manage the situation. You explained that you had already left your marriage and for these reasons you felt that you would be safe if you returned to Nigeria. I find your explanation to be reasonable. Considering the fact that your marriage had ended during your trip to UK, I find that it\u2019s understandable that you believed that you may no longer face a significant risk of harm at the hands of your ex-husband at that particular time. I accept your explanation and I find that your decision not to claim asylum in the UK does not undermine your subjective fear or detract from your overall credibility.\n\n[15] You testified that you also travelled to the United States and you discussed one particular trip in the year 2018 where you travelled to United States prior to entering Canada. You explained the reason you did not claim asylum in the United States in the past is because you believed that your children would not obtain proper treatment if you resided in the United States.\n\n[16] You testified about a personal experience you had at which time police officers questioned you about your intentions in the United States. You explained that you were also aware of certain information about the Trump administration which made you feel that it would be safer for you to seek protection in Canada. I find your explanation to be reasonable.\n\n[17] I accept on a balance of probabilities that you made the decision not to claim asylum in the USA due to personal experiences and your understanding of the Trump administration policies. I find your decision not to claim asylum in the USA under these circumstances does not undermine your subjective fear or detract from your overall credibility.\n\n[18] I\u2019ve also considered the Chairperson\u2019s Guidelines on women refugee claimants fearing gender related persecution and I\u2019ve thus taken into account your state of mental health at the time you fled Nigeria, including your history of trauma and your lack of trust in authorities, which may be related to other experiences you testified about today such as your experience having become aware of police abuse of power in Nigeria. For these reasons I find that your credibility and your subjective fear have been established on a balance of probabilities.\n\n[19] In terms of the well-foundedness of your fear of persecution. I\u2019ve considered the objective basis of your claim and I find that your allegations are consistent with the objective documentary evidence concerning gender related violence in Nigeria. Domestic violence is described as very prevalent in Nigeria including physical, sexual, and psychological abuse. I\u2019m referring here to information found in the National Documentation Package for Nigeria or the NDP. This is NDP item 5.2.\n\n[20] There is additional information in the NDP package at item 5.3 and it discusses the high level of prevalence of domestic violence, specifically discuses here incidents of intimate partner violence, abuse by husbands. It says 30 to 50 percent of women have experienced domestic violence in Nigeria.\n\n[21] Also at NDP 2.15 the United Nations Human Rights Council reports that domestic violence and gender-based violence has been on an increase in Nigeria and the relevant authorities have not given adequate attention to the issue. Accordingly, I find your fear of persecution in the form of domestic violence in Nigeria to be objectively well-founded.\n\n[22] Now in terms of state protection. You testified that your ex-husband utilized the support of other state actors including police officers in his efforts to harm you and threaten you in the past. Therefore you believe that Nigerian authorities are corrupt and that the agent of persecution would be able to influence government agents and prevent you from accessing state protection.\n\n[23] The objective evidence before me is consistent with your allegations surrounding police protection for victims of domestic violence in Nigeria. The United States Department of State report indicates that victims and survivors have little or no recourse to justice. And here I\u2019m referring to NDP item 2.1 and it also addresses the risk to children, stating that child abuse remained common throughout the country and that the government took no significant measures to combat it. It also says here that despite the introduction of the Violence Against Persons Prohibition Act to address physical violence including spousal battery, domestic violence remained widespread and many considered it socially acceptable.\n\n[24] There is additional information here including the fact that sources report police often refused to intervene or placed blame on the victim of domestic violence abuse and that they often consider this a family affair. In summary, the evidence shows that the laws in place and the mechanisms of protection for domestic violence are not effective at an operational level.\n\n[25] Also additional information here, I\u2019m referring to NDP item 1.22, this speaks to state protection generally in Nigeria. It says that Nigerian Police Force is the principal law enforcement agency in Nigeria and it\u2019s often described as corrupt and violent. It discusses inefficiencies in the justice system and the fact that police officers are the public officials whom bribes are most commonly paid in Nigeria. And what would be relevant in this particular case is that reports indicate that the National Police Force focuses its\u2019 resources on protecting important persons including politicians and wealthy individuals rather than community policing. I say this is particularly relevant considering the fact that in this case the agent of persecution is a former XXXXand is someone who continues to be associated with current politicians and individuals who are members of the police force currently. Accordingly, I find that adequate state protection would not be available to you in Nigeria.\n\n[26] I\u2019ve also considered whether a viable Internal Flight Alternative may exist for you in the city of Lagos however, I find that you have demonstrated that you face a serious possibility of persecution throughout Nigeria. You provided testimony about your husband\u2019s social status including the fact that he is a former XXXX, member of the ruling party of Nigeria, and that he is well connected to other influential people in Nigerian society, including a high-ranking police officer, that being his brother.\n\n[27] The objective evidence before me confirms that the APC party has governed the country of Nigeria since the 2015 elections and this is found at NDP 1.4. The evidence from the NDP clearly demonstrates widespread corruption and violence committed by Nigerian authorities sponsored by politicians, and information on this subject can be found in a variety of places in the National Documentation Package. For example, there is information at NDP item 1.3, 1.4, 7.29, and 1.13, and considering the fact that the Nigerian Police Force operates nationally, I find that this poses a risk to you even in the IFA location.\n\n[28] Given that the agent of persecution is a former XXXXand member of the APC party, I find on a balance of probabilities that the agent of persecution and his political network have the means of locating you and your children in the IFA location by use of political and government resources, including police assistance. Considering the fact that the two of you were married and that he is the father of your minor children, I find that the agent of persecution has ample personal information about each of you which could be used to assist him in locating you in the IFA location.\n\n[29] I find that the agent of persecution would be motivated to locate you in the IFA location because he has accused you of interfering with his political ambitions, and because he has demonstrated his continued interest in harming you and maintaining power and control over you by continuing to threaten you, harass you, and attend the home of your relatives even after your marriage ended. I\u2019ve also considered the nature of domestic violence relationships and considered the fact that you endured physical, emotional, and financial abuse at the hands of your ex-husband for many years including threats to your life dating back to around the year 2006, I find the fact that your ex-husband engaged in controlling and manipulative behaviours for such a long duration of time demonstrates his firm intent to maintain control over you and the children.\n\n[30] For these reasons I find the Internal Flight Alternative test fails on the first prong, and on a balance of probabilities the agent of persecution could locate you and your children in the IFA location. Accordingly, I find there is no viable Internal Flight Alternative for you.\n\n[31] Having considered all of the evidence in this case, I find that there is a serious possibility that you and your children would face persecution if you returned to Nigeria. Therefore I accept the claim and conclude that you are Convention refugees in accordance with Section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

You are claiming to be a citizen of China and are claiming refugee protection pursuant to Sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. I have considered your testimony and the other evidence in the case, and I am ready to render my decision orally.\n\n[2] For the following reasons, I find that you are a Convention refugee pursuant to Section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n\nALLEGATIONS\n\n[3] Your allegations are fully noted in your Basis of Claim form narrative found at Exhibit 2. In summary, you allege a fear of persecution at the hands of Chinese authorities, specifically, PSB, due to your membership in the Church of Almighty God.\n\nIDENTITY\n\n[4] Your personal identity as a citizen of China has been established by your testimony and the supporting documents filed in the exhibits, namely copies of your resident ID card, your household register, and a photocopy of the biodata page of your passport which was originally taken by the smuggler. I note today you have provided testimony that you now have the passport and you did show me it on the record, these documents can be found at Exhibit 5.\n\n[5] I therefore find that on a balance of probabilities that identity and country of reference have been established.\n\nNEXUS\n\n[6] I find there is a link between what you fear and a Convention ground, namely religion given your membership in the Church of Almighty God. I have therefore assessed your claim under Section 96.\n\nCREDIBILITY\n[7] I find you to be a credible witness and I therefore believe what you have alleged in support of your claim. You testified in a straightforward manner and I found no inconsistencies in your testimony or contradictions between your testimony and the other evidence before me. Your testimony regarding the Church of Almighty God I found was heartfelt and spontaneous. You explained the reason that you became interested in joining the church and even your own initial reactions when you were first introduced to it. Throughout your testimony, you provided natural details about the church and your responses were consistent with the objective evidence and your alleged level of knowledge and experience. In my assessment, I have also considered your level of education and my expectations of your responses. In particular, you have also provided details about your own work spreading the gospel in Canada and about the ways in which your church group in China would meet and precautions that were taken to avoid detection by authorities. I therefore believe what you have alleged in your oral testimony and your Basis of Claim form and find that you have established your membership with the Church of Almighty God on a balance of probabilities.\n\n[8] You also provided documents which support your claim such as your hospital discharge form, a social maintenance fee for having a second child, a copy of the detention summons, a letter from the Church of Almighty God in Canada which supports your practice in Canada, and a screenshot from your attendance at Church of Almighty God events over Zoom. I find these documents consistent with your allegations and BOC narrative and find they further support your testimony and credibility. I note the Minister has intervened in this case and submits that the claimant has made three previous visa applications to the United States and one to Canada and that the one to Canada was not disclosed to Canadian officials. The Minister further submits that these applications were made at a time when you did not fear persecution and that undermines your credibility. The Minister also argues that you would not have been able to flee China given its rigorous exit controls and the claimant being somewhat of interest to the PSB, you wouldn\u2019t have been able to leave given these controls. I asked you about these issues and you stated that you used the services of a snakehead in order to get yourself a better chance of leaving China. You further stated that your family experienced a penalty when you had your second child and you were fearful that your wife would suffer a further and more serious penalty given that she was pregnant with your third child. Given your credible testimony, I accept that you filed these applications at a time when you and your wife were about to have a third child. As a result, that alleviates the concerns regarding the visa applications to the United States.\n\n[9] With respect to the Canadian visa, sorry, I also just want to add, I do note you were forthcoming with this. You did provide this information in your Schedule A and it was not something that was withheld from Canadian authorities.\n\n[10] With respect to the Canadian visa which you did not disclose, I asked you about this and you told me you have no memory of making this application. You further stated that you informed me, you informed me of the U.S. visas that were rejected and if you knew about the Canadian one, you would have told me. I do have a hard time with this because the fact is before me, I have a TRV application with your name on it; however, you did state that you did not do it. With that being said, I do note that you were forthcoming in disclosing your visa applications to the U.S. in your Schedule A when you first filed your claim for refugee protection, as well as the fear you had with your wife\u2019s pregnancy. Since you were forthcoming with these applications, I do find it reasonable that if you remembered or knew about this Canadian application, you would have stated so. I make this finding while also considering the credible and forthright testimony you have provided me today.\n\n[11] Finally, the Minister refers to documentary evidence indicating very thorough screening procedures at airports and submits that the Chinese authorities efficiently control the exit of citizens and that criminal fugitives are flagged in the computer database which would be inconsistent with the claimant being able to leave the country on his own passport. While I do not dispute the Minister\u2019s evidence, it appears to be based upon either a misunderstanding of the claimant\u2019s evidence or misreading of the documentary evidence as it relates to this case. The claimant never alleged to be arrested in China and instead his evidence indicates that he was questioned about his connection and that he was being investigated but it was not until he was in Canada that he received a summons to appear under Article 82 of the Criminal Procedure Law of Canada, of China, correction.\n\n[12] For these reasons, it is very plausible that the claimant\u2019s name did not appear in the police net database in XXXX 2018 when he fled China. I further note that refugee determination is a forward looking assessment and having found the claimant to be credible and genuine in regard to his membership and practice in the Church of Almighty God, I therefore find that the claimant has a forward looking risk of persecution and I also find the claimant\u2019s ability to leave China on his own passport does not mean that he is not wanted nor does it mean he is not a member of the Church of Almighty God. I find the claimant\u2019s credible testimony and the evidence before me to clear up the issues noted in the intervention. I therefore find that your subjective fear if established by your credible testimony and I believe what you have alleged on a balance of probabilities.\n\nOBJECTIVE BASIS\n\n[13] The documentary evidence further supports your position that your fear of persecution is objectively well founded. The U.S. Department of State\u2019s most recent International and Religious Freedom Report indicates that, while freedom of religion is included in the Chinese constitution, it is limited to so-called normal religious activities and practice by unregistered religious organizations which is illegal and vulnerable to punitive official action. The same document indicates that, the government exercises state control over Religion and restricts activities and freedom of religious adherents. U.S. Convention on International Religious Freedom has classified China as a country of particular concern. The report notes that, the 2018 regulations on religious affairs have effectively banned unauthorized religious teachings and have revved up the CCB\u2019s campaign to sinicize faith by erasing independent practice of religion. The report notes that, the government raided and closed hundreds of house churches in the east during the reporting year. The same report indicates wide-spread reports of Chinese authorities closing churches, destroying and confiscating bibles and otherwise restricting or interfering in religious activities and they estimate that five (5) thousand Christians and one (1) thousand church leaders were arrested in 2018 because of their faith and religious practice.\n\n[14] The U.S. Department of State Report in 2.1 indicates, there continue to be reports of deaths in custody and that the government tortured, abused, arrested detained, sentenced to prison, and harassed adherents of both registered and unregistered religious groups for activities related to their religious beliefs and practices.\n\n[15] I do note there is some evidence in the NDP suggesting that there are millions of Christians in China and that many members of unregistered churches do not face harassment from the states, for example a 2014 Response to Information Request highlights variation in the treatment of unregistered groups by local authorities and notes that according to some sources, the majority of unregistered churches are tolerated by the government. However, I find that the more recent reports in the NDP including the 2019 U.S. Department of State and U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom Reports indicate widespread and increasingly severe crackdowns and restrictions on unregistered churches throughout China resulting at least in part from the 2018 regulations being implemented.\n\n[16] Based on the objective country evidence, I find your fear of persecution is objectively well founded and that you have established that you would face a serious possibility of persecution if you were to return to China.\n\nSTATE PROTECTION\n\n[17] In terms of state protection, the state is the agent of persecution in the present case so I find you have rebutted the presumption of sate protection and would not have access to it in China.\n\nINTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE\n\n[18] Given that the state is the agents of persecution, I similarly find that you would face a serious possibility of persecution in all areas of China and do not have a viable Internal Flight Alternative.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[18] In conclusion, based on the totality of the evidence in your case, I find you are a Convention refugee and I accept your claim.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

And I therefore find that you are a Convention refugee, and I accept your claim.\n\n[2] The allegations are found in your Basis of Claim form marked as Exhibit 2. And to summarize your Basis of Claim form, you testified to \u2014 left India \u2014 sorry, left China, because you owe a loan shark money, and that you would \u2014 you were threatened to be killed. You further testify that you paid the loan shark after you arrived in Canada, and that you do not owe the loan shark anymore. You testified that you joined the democratic party of Canada after you arrived in 2019 April. And because \u2014 you joined this party because you had interest in fighting for the democratic right of the people of China.\n\n[3] Your father testified that you are a registered member of the DPC, and you attend all the party\u2019s activities. And that your party activities have come to the attention of the authorities in China, as a warrant of arrest was issued against you while you were here in Canada. I found that your identity as a national of China is established by your testimony, and by the document that you provided, which includes a copy of your Chinese passports, and other documents on file. There is a clear nexus between what you fear in China and section 96. And namely on the grounds of your political opinion as a member of the Democratic Party of Canada \u2014 so \u2014 of China, sorry. And this claim is assessed under section 96.\n\n[4] Overall, I find that you were a credible witness, and there were no material inconsistencies between your testimony and the documents you disclosed. I found that your testimony was straightforward and spontaneous. And based on your testimony, the documents you disclosed, and the information provided in your Basis of Claim form narrative and your amendment, I noticed there were no serious credibility issues.\n\n[5] You testified about why you joined the DPC. You testified about the activities of the party since you joined in April (inaudible) and the role you played at each of these activities. You explained the (inaudible) events and all the parades that took place at the city hall once every month. You are also testified about the weekly meetings you attended online every XXXX. You explained what the mission of the DPC is, and why it resonates with you. You testified that you would have that you have participated in various programs organized by the party, and that you have appeared in various public events of the party. And your pictures, photographs, and videos have been captured at this event.\n\n[6] And so, part of your political activities \u2014 you provided a package of documents which includes various letters from your party leaders, photographs of attending and participating in the DPC public activity \u2014 and events here in Toronto, Ontario. You also provided an arrest warrant issued against you by the PSB. I have assessed this document and I find each of them to be reliable evidence and assign them full weight in support of your allegations.\n\n[7] I find that your subjective fear of persecution in China due to your political activities and being a member of the DPT in Canada \u2014 sorry, of the DPC in Canada, is objectively well-founded. The country documentation before the Panel is the most NDP package for China, dated May 31st, 2022. And this NDP package corroborates your claim, that the Chinese authorities continue to persecute whistleblowers and political presidents. For example, 8.1 states that one (1) of the most significant human right problems in China is the arbitrary detention, physical attack, and criminal prosecution against human rights activists, dissidents, and those seeking redress for injustice of the current government.\n\n[8] Item 2.7 also indicates that China is not free with respect of \u2014 with respect to political rights and civil liberations. And the regime has become increasingly repressive in recent years. The fact that human right defenders, dividends (sic), and anti-corruption activists in China \u2014 and monitored and detained is also highlighted in Item 2.2 and 2.11. With regards to your membership in the DPC in Toronto, Ontario. The country information at Item 2 \u2014 sorry, at Item 4.4 and 4.1 of the NDP confirms that the \u2014 confirms your allegation that the DPC is a banned organization. And that the government monitors, detains, and imprison \u2014 current and former DPC members.\n\n[9] Based on the above cited country conditions evidence in the most recent NDP for China, and as well as the documentary evidence \u2014 country condition disclosed by the claimant\u2019s Counsel, and the claimant\u2019s credible allegation, I find that you have established there is a serious possibility that you will be prosecuted if you were to return to China by reason of your political opinion.\n\n[10] Since the state is the agent of persecution in this case, I found that it would be objectively unreasonable for you to seek the protection of the state. And therefore, you have rebutted the presumption of state protection. I further find that there is no \u2014 there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout China. And there is no viable internal flight alternative, given that the documentary evidence states that the authority operates similarly throughout the country in China. Therefore, based on the totality of evidence in this case, I found that you would face a serious possibility of prosecution if you were to return to China. And I therefore find that you are a Convention refugee, and I accept your claim.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

Rose\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Denis Onek Olwedo\nCountry: Uganda\nRPD Number: TB9-06429\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2023-01023\nATIP Pages: N\/A\n\nDECISION\n\n[1] MEMBER: Okay. So, this is the decision for XXXX XXXX. The file number is TB9-06429. In \u2014 I\u2019ve had the opportunity today to consider your testimony as well as the other evidence in this case. I have also taken into account the SOGIE guidelines, and I am at this point ready to render my decision orally. You are claiming to be a citizen of Uganda and claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. And today, I do find that you are a Convention refugee for the following reasons.\n\n[2] In terms of the allegations, those are fully set out in your Basis of Claim form as well as the amendment. But to briefly summarize the allegations, you allege a fear of persecution in Uganda as a result of your sexual orientation. You identify as a bisexual and your sexual orientation has become known. I will note that there were also allegations in your Basis of Claim for regarding your father and his political opinions. However, for the circumstances of this case I\u2019ve just focused on the allegations related to your sexual orientation.\n\n[3] Now, your personal identity as a citizen of Uganda has been established by the testimony and the documentary evidence. So, while I note that there was no original passport provided as you\u2019ve indicated, that it was taken by the agent who brought you to Canada, you did provide a copy of the biodata page. There\u2019s also a copy of your birth certificate as well as some education documents which do corroborate your identity and date of birth. And furthermore, I do note that the passport that I have a copy of was used to obtain temporary resident visa in order to come to Canada as well. So, as a result of all of the documentary as well as the testimony, I do accept on a balance of probabilities your identity and the country of reference as Uganda.\n\n[4] Now, in terms of your testimony I have taken into account your particular circumstances and that does include your relatively young age, especially at the time that you came to Canada. In terms of your testimony about the one same tax relationship you had in Uganda, I did find that your testimony about that was very straightforward and was consistent with the Basis of Claim form as well as the other evidence you\u2019ve provided. There were no inconsistencies or discrepancies that went to the core \u2014 the central aspect of your claim, that is your sexual orientation. And I did find that your testimony was genuine. You also spoke about some of the activities and things that you\u2019ve been doing here in Canada, you have been involved with a number of LGBT support organizations. And you yourself have provided assistance and you volunteered at those organizations as well.\n\n[5] So, in addition to your testimony, you have provided a number of documents in support. Those do include affidavits from your mother and your grandmother as well as the woman that you stayed with while you were in hiding. And with respect to the allegations regarding your sexual orientation, those were consistent with and they do corroborate your allegations. I will note as well there\u2019s a letter from your sister\u2019s friend who attended the same school as you in (inaudible) and she does corroborate the information in your Basis of Claim form that you left after the rumours about your relationship started. In addition to that, there are numerous letters of support from both individuals and organizations here in Canada that all the attest to your involvement with the LGBT community, which can corroborate the allegations regarding your sexual orientation. So, all this documentary evidence is consistent with and corroborate the testimony. And so I\u2019m satisfied that the evidence is sufficient to establish on a balance of probabilities that you are bisexual and you have been involved in a same sex relationship. And have therefore established a subjective fear of returning to you Uganda.\n\n[6] Now, I do find that there is a link between what you fear and one of the five Convention grounds. Specifically, particular social group. That is your sexual orientation as a bisexual. So, this claim has been assessed under s. 96. Looking at the treatment of those involved in same sex relationships, the documentary evidence in our National Documentation Package, which is Exhibit Three is very clear about that. So, those items \u2014 sorry, for example, in Item 2.1 of the NDP, the US Department of State Report, it does indicate that LGBTI persons face discrimination, legal restrictions, harassment, violence, arbitrary arrest and intimidation. Authorities incited, perpetrated and tolerated violence against LGBTI individuals and blocked some meetings organized by LGBTI persons and activists. Item 6.4 tells us that sexual acts with a member of the same sex are illegal under Uganda\u2019s penal code, and those convicted face a possible sentence of life in prison.\n\n[7] Well, members of the LGBTI community are rarely prosecuted under the penal code, the police do arrest members of the community in an attempt to elicit bribes and the police do not usually investigate cases of violence against numbers of the LGBTI community. Homophobic views our widespread in society especially because elements of the media, politicians and religious groups have inflamed anti-LGBTI sentiment. For example, President Museveni has called homosexuality a decadent culture being passed on by Western nations and described homosexuality as abnormal, deviant and disgusting behaviour. So, this causes societal harassment, intimidation, blackmail, threats, poor employment prospects and loss of accommodations for LGBTI individuals in Uganda. So, as a result, I do find the documentary evidence does support your allegations and you have established a well-founded fear of returning to Uganda based on your sexual orientation.\n\n[8] Regarding the issue of state protection, as noted, the police are one of the biggest perpetrators of rights violations against LGBTI individuals. And there are no protections for LGBTI community. So, I do not find that state protection would be available or forthcoming you in your particular circumstances. And similarly as the laws and the attitudes are consistent through Uganda, there is nowhere else in Uganda that you could safely reside. So, there is no internal flight alternative for you. So, based on all of this evidence, I do find you to be a Convention refugee and your claim is therefore accepted.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

You are claiming to be citizens of China and are claiming refugee protection pursuant to Sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n\n[2] I have considered your testimony and the other evidence in the case and I am ready to render my decision orally.\n\n[3] The Minister has intervened in this case on the ground of credibility. I find that you are Convention refugees due to your religious belief and practice.\n\nALLEGATIONS\n\n[4] MsXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXMr. XXXX XXXX, you are husband and wife. MrXXXX XXXX XXXX, you testified that you are the cousin of MrXXXX XXXX XXXX. The details of your allegations are set out in your Basis of Claim forms and your oral testimony.\n\n[5] In short, you allege that if you return to China, you would be persecuted by the Chinese government because all three of you are Christians and because you practiced your faith at house churches which are not permitted by the government.\n\n[6] MrXXXX XXXX XXXX, you allege that you have joined a house church in China in April 2017 and continued to attend that church on a weekly basis until you came to Canada.\n\n[7] Ms. XXXX, you allege that you started to learn about Christianity around August to October 2017 and that you started attending a house church from October 2017 on a weekly basis.\n\n[8] MrXXXX XXXX XXXX, you allege that you started attending the house church in January 2018 on the invitation of your wife.\n\n[9] You allege that you had separately decided to come to Canada because you heard news of members of nearby house churches facing problems with authorities. You allege that Mr. XXXX XXXX and Ms. XXXX first revealed to Mr. XXXX XXXX in April 2019 that they were planning on leaving China because they had become Christians. At this time, Mr. XXXX XXXX also revealed that he had also become a Christian and was planning to leave China.\n\n[10] You all came to Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2019 with the assistance of a snakehead and made refugee claims at the end of June 2019. You all allege that you have been attending church in Canada either in person or virtually since you came to Canada.\n\nIDENTITY\n\n[11] I find that your personal and national identities have been established on a balance of probabilities by your Chinese passports which I observed remotely during the hearing and copies of which have been provided in Exhibit 7 and 8.\n\nNEXUS\n\n[12] The nexus in this case is your religion; therefore, your claims are assessed under Section of IRPA.\n\nCREDIBILITY\n\n[13] When a claimant swears that certain facts are true, this creates a presumption that they are indeed true unless there is valid reason to doubt their veracity. The determination as to whether a claimant\u2019s evidence is credible is made on a balance of probabilities.\n\n[14] In terms of your general credibility, I found all three of you to be credible witnesses. You all testified in a straightforward and spontaneous manner about your religious practices in China and in Canada. There were no significant or material inconsistencies or contradictions in your evidence. I expected a relatively high level of religious knowledge from you as you allege to be practicing Christianity for over four years. I have questioned you rather extensively on your religious knowledge and found that all three of you possess religious knowledge that is consistent with the duration and frequency with which you have practiced your faith.\n\n[15] You have submitted corroborative documents in support of your claim; these documents include photos of you at church in Canada and a letter from our pastor in Canada. I give these documents full weight in corroborating your testimony.\n\n[16] There was one inconsistency between the schedule A forms of Ms. XXXX and Mr. XXXX XXXX about whether or not they lived at the same address for some time in Chia. This is a peripheral matter and I find this to be a minor inconsistency which I cannot draw a negative inference from. My main concern was regarding the sincerity of your faith as both Mr. XXXX XXXX and Mr. XXXX XXXX testified that your children have not been baptized despite you all having access to pastors in your village in China and your belief in the sacrament of baptism. You both testified that you want your children to decide whether they want to be baptized later in life. Given the totality of the evidence and your level of religious knowledge, I find that the issue of your children\u2019s baptism is not a matter based on which I can draw a significant inference and it is not sufficient to rebut the presumption of truthfulness.\n\n[17] With respect to the Minister\u2019s evidence that you all entered Canada at the same time, I note that the Minister\u2019s counsel has not provided submissions on this matter and what inference, and has not stated what inference the Minister\u2019s counsel believes the panel should draw from this. I do not find it relevant to your allegation that you are Christians. I am aware of the prevalence of immigration fraud and the use of fraudulent documents; however, these are matters that should be dealt with at the border and at visa offices, not at refugee hearings.\n\n[18] I do find the issue of a relative who is also a Christian fleeing to Canada at the same time to be relevant to the claim; therefore, I asked you why you had not mentioned in your narratives that your cousin was also a Christian and had fled China at the same time. Both Mr. XXXX XXXX and Mr. XXXX XXXX testified that you were not aware you needed to state this as you had made your claims separately. As there is nothing in the Basis of Claim form or other refugee intake forms that asks claimants to identify any other Christians whom they know and who traveled with them to Canada, I find your explanations to be reasonable and do not draw a negative inference from this omission.\n\n[19] Considering the totality of the evidence, I find on a balance of probabilities that you are all Christians and that you have a subjective fear of persecution in China.\n\nOBJECTIVE BASIS\n\n[20] The objective documentary evidence regarding the treatment of Christians in China is mixed. According to Freedom House, religious groups\u2019 ability to practice their beliefs varies dramatically based on religious affiliation, location, and registration status. Similarly, Australia\u2019s de facto states that unregistered Christian churches face restrictions that vary widely according to local conditions effectively making it difficult to form general conclusions. However, the trend that I can discern based on the totality of the objective evidence is that the crackdown on religious practice has increased in China since 2018.\n\n[21] Item 12.28 of the NDP reference a representative of the Asia team of CSW, an NGO based in the UK that advocates for religious freedom rights and protections in 20 countries citing their conversation with a Christian legal expert that what had previously been religious rules that were not strictly enforced between the 2018 regulations have since turned into a push for Christians to only have religious activities at designated sites.\n\n[22] The same source reports that since the implementation of the 2018 regulations on religious affairs, Chinese authorities have increased crackdowns on unregistered religious groups. The China Aid Association states in its 2019 annual report on the treatment of Christians in China that authorities have continued to carry out the central government\u2019s orders to force religion to place the Chinese government\u2019s ideals at its centre and officials arrest those resist. Amnesty International adds that authorities have removed crosses and Christian slogans from church buildings, confiscated or vandalized church properties, ordered churches to close, and questioned church leaders and members.\n\n[23] Specifically with respect to treatment of protestants, item 12.23 states unregistered protestant churches risk adverse treatment by authorities due to their illegal status. Adverse treatment can include raids and destruction of church property. Pressure to join or report to government sanctioned religious organizations and on occasion violence and criminal sanction particularly in regard to land disputes with local authorities.\n\n[24] You all testified that you frequently attend church and that you spread the gospel. The federal court has held that religious persecution can include prohibitions on public or private worship and on giving or receiving religious instructions; therefore, I conclude that there is sufficient objective country evidence to ground the objective basis of your claims.\n\nSTATE PROTECTION\n\n[25] As the state is the agents of persecution in this case, I find that the presumption of state protection has been rebutted and that there is no adequate state protection available to you.\n\nINTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE\n\n[26] I find that there is no viable Internal Flight Alternative for you anywhere in China because the government is the agents of persecution and that there are various levels of restrictions on the practice of Christianity across China.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[27] I conclude that you would face a serious possibility of persecution if you were to return to China and therefore I find you to be Convention refugees and accept your claims.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

You are claiming to be a citizen of Pakistan and are claiming refugee protection pursuant to Sections 96 and 97.1 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. I\u2019ve considered your testimony and the other evidence in the case and I am ready to render my decision orally.\n\nDETERMINATION\n\n[2] I find that you are a Convention refugee on the grounds of your perceived political opinion, perceived religion, and membership in a particular social group for the following reasons.\n\nALLEGATIONS\n\n[3] You allege to be a citizen of Pakistan, a Sunni Muslim, and allege a fear of persecution at the hands of religious extremist groups in Pakistan due to your social work through your membership with the Greenland Welfare Group, which you state was responsible for assisting the needy and religious minorities. You allege that extremist groups including Sepah-e-Sahaba (SSP) have deemed you to be an infidel due to your willingness to help people from religions other than the Sunni sect. You allege that there is no state protection for you or an Internal Flight Alternative.\n\nEXCLUSION\n\n[4] I note an exclusion under Article 1FB at the beginning of the hearing given your statement and your narrative of being charged with public drunkenness and uttering threats. I canvassed the issue with you and I found your testimony on the matter to be credible. You stated that it was a false charge created by XXXX XXXX (ph), a member of the Greenland Welfare Group. You stated that you believed XXXX was forced into this by the extremist group that is after him and you.\n\n[5] Given your credible testimony which I\u2019ll discuss in more detail in a moment, I accept that these charges are false and created by your agents of persecution. As a result exclusion under Article 1FB is not applicable in this case. As I further note, you have provided a copy of the FIR, this is found in Exhibit 4 where these charges are explained. I find the accusations against you even if true, do not meet the threshold of a serious crime when considering the factors set out in the (inaudible-2:26).\n\nIDENTITY\n\n[6] Your personal identity as a citizen of Pakistan has been established by your testimony and the supporting documents filed in the Exhibits, namely the certified true copy of your valid Pakistan passport found in Exhibit 1. I also note that in Exhibit 4 you have provided a copy of your national identity card from Pakistan, your driving license from Pakistan, birth registration certificate, and your family registration certificate. I therefore find on a balance of probabilities that identity and country of reference have been established as Pakistan.\n\nNEXUS\n\n[7] I find there is a link between what you fear and a Convention ground, namely perceived religion, or political opinion as a result of your work with minority religious groups and your membership in a particular social group of social activists. I have there assessed your claim under Section 96.\n\nCREDIBILITY\n\n[8] When a claimant swears to the truth of allegations this creates a presumption that the allegations are true unless there is valid reason to doubt their truthfulness. In this case I find no valid reason to doubt the overall truthfulness of your allegations. You testified in a candid and straightforward manner. You seemed not to exaggerate or tailor your evidence, and there were no significant material discrepancies, inconsistencies, or omissions. Sir, I find your testimony to be genuine and you experienced great emotion while recounting the incidents that occurred to you in Pakistan.\n\n[9] While I did not ask you to recount all the incidents that occurred to you, I asked you about the first and last which I found to be a central incidence of your claim. You told me about March 7, 2018, and how four men blocked your way and warned you that you have become an infidel for helping non-Muslims. You further told me about the incident that occurred on June 4, 2019, where you were kidnapped, beaten, and cut, when they tried to get information on Greenland Welfare and your friend XXXX.\n\n[10] I also asked you a number of questions regarding your work with the Greenland Welfare Group including when you joined, your knowledge of the group, your role and activities, and your motivation for joining the group. You told me how you were a XXXXwho was responsible for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. You told me how you grew up with Christian and Hindu friends and this aspired you to help out religious minorities when given an opportunity to do so. You further added how your goal was to bridge the gap between religions in Pakistan.\n\n[11] I note you provided a number of photos of you in Christian churches and with priests, and I found your testimony surrounding your motivations to be genuine and credible. You provided a significant amount of documents that support your claim. These can be found in Exhibit 4, 5, and 6, 7, 8. I won\u2019t go through each of these documents but as a summary you\u2019ve provided documents regarding the Greenland Welfare Society which includes your personal documents as a member of the group and photos of you with other members, which I just discussed. Of note are photos of you in a catholic church, as again I just discussed. You\u2019ve also provided copies of police complaints, an FIR, and court affidavit, an order which were filled by you and your friend XXXX.\n\n[12] You also provided affidavits from your wife and sister whom you stayed with in Lahore, and three friends, XXXX, XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX who are aware of your issues in Pakistan. I will also note that at some point during your issues in Pakistan you resided with each of these individuals while in hiding. I further note that you have provided a significant of other photos including photos of the injury you suffered on June 4, 2019, prior to leaving for Canada, as well as a medical report from Pakistan where you given stitches, and from Canada where your stitches were removed.\n\n[13] I note the abundance of credible documents further supports your credibility and given that I have noted no issues on the surface of these documents as they relate to your story, I find them to further strengthen the credibility of your allegations. I find on a balance of probabilities you have established your profile as a social activist who was and continues to be targeted by religious extremists due to your work in support of religious minorities, which they now see as you converting to Christianity and therefore designated as an apostate.\n\n[14] I note that I did have some concern regarding your trip to Canada in XXXX 2018 and subsequent return to Pakistan. I asked you about this and you told me how your family remains in Pakistan and that you did not want to leave them and your country behind. You further stated how you would have never stayed if it weren\u2019t for the last incident that occurred on June 4, 2019. I accept your explanations as reasonable especially considering the kidnapping and false case had not been initiated until your return to Pakistan.\n\n[15] I therefore do not find your actives demonstrative of a lack of subjective fear and do not find them to undermine your overall credibility. I therefore find that your subjective fear is established by your credible testimony and I believe what you have alleged on a balance of probabilities.\n\n[16] I also find there is an objective basis to what you fear in Pakistan. The National Documentation Package, NDP, corroborates your allegations regarding your fear of religious extremist groups resulting from your involvement with minority groups.\n\n[17] At item 7.7, it talks about the TTB, which I note is not the group you fear however, I refer to it given the forward-looking assessment I am required to conduct. I note they are a Sunni extremist militant organization primarily based in the federally administrated tribal areas and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) and among its\u2019 main objectives is to enforce Sharia law in Pakistan and to secure an Islamic caliphate state. I note that as a Sunni Muslim who is seen to have converted you would potentially be at risk from the TTP upon return.\n\n[18] Item 7.7 and 7.8 also notes reports of the TTP carrying out attacks on Shia and Christian communities including group precessions and places of worship. In the federally administrated tribal areas, the KPK, Punjab, and (inaudible-8:32), evidencing their strong opposition to any faith that is not Sunni Muslim. This ideology is shared by various other Sunni extremist organizations including the Sepah-e-Sahaba SSP, which you alleged to fear, Lashkar-e-Jhangvi LEJ, Lashkar-e-Taiba LET, and Jaish-e-Mohammed JEM. I further note that you are at elevated risk because of your involvement in helping to promote and provide goods for religious minority communities in Pakistan, that is your social activism.\n\n[19] The United States Department of State report at item 2.1 indicates that state and non-state actors including militant groups routinely targeted social activists and human rights defenders for violence and harassment. Amnesty International at item 2.3 likewise confirms that activists and other human rights defenders in Pakistan faced harassment, intimidation, threats, violence, and enforced disappearance.\n\n[20] The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan at item 2.5 further notes that the scourge of enforced disappearances continued unchecked across the country in 2018. Political activists, students, human rights defenders, journalists, members of religious groups, and various ethnic minorities have all fallen victim in recent years. No one has ever been held accountable.\n\n[21] I further note that Sepah-e-Sahaba SSP has been renamed to the ASWJ after being banned by the Pakistan government in 2002. Sources indicate that the objective of the ASWJ is to proclaim Pakistan as a Sunni state. Sources state that the ASWJ also aims to declare Shias kafirs or infidels or to declare all other sects to be non-Muslim minorities.\n\n[22] According to the Christian Solidarity Network, an organization that advocates for and documents violations of religious rights, the ASWJ advocates for Shiites to be legally declared non-Muslim and as a violent offshoot that targets Shiites mosques. Given the objective sources I just referred to, I find that you have a well-founded fear of persecution on a balance of probabilities.\n\nSTATE PROTECTION\n\n[23] I find you have rebutted the presumption of state protection with clear and convincing evidence that the authorities in Pakistan would be unwilling or unable to provide you with adequate state protection. I note you testified that you attempted to report the threats to you on two occasions and you were not provided with any assistance or protection.\n\n[24] I further note that there has been a false case filed against you and you now state to fear the police as an additional agent of persecution. Moreover, according to the documentary evidence before me, Pakistan remains among the most dangerous places in the world for social activists and human rights defenders. The objective documentary evidence is also clear that there is a high level of corruption among the police in Pakistan, therefore inhibiting their ability to provide adequate protection to those who seek it.\n\n[25] A recent Response to Information Request regarding police corruption states that the police are ranked as one of the most corrupt institutions in Pakistan. This can be found at item 10.1. The United Kingdom Home Office report indicates that Pakistan\u2019s police force is under resourced, poorly trained, badly paid, low in moral, and viewed with suspicion by the courts and society because of its\u2019 poor human rights record. Most police are regarded as corrupt, inefficient, and unprofessional. This can be found at item 1.12 of the NDP.\n\n[26] Based on your personal circumstances as well as the objective country documentation, I find that you have rebutted the presumption of state protection on a balance of probabilities.\n\nINTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE\n\n[27] I\u2019ve also considered whether a viable Internal Flight Alternative exists for you. At the beginning of the hearing I note the cities of Hyderabad and Islamabad. Item 1.8 of the NDP indicates that armed militant groups such as the SSP have wide geographic roots and would be able to reach you in Islamabad and Hyderabad. Item 7.2 of the NDP reports that SSP is responsible for some of the most violent attacks on religious minorities and these attacks have been widespread.\n\n[28] I further note your credible testimony surrounding how you were discovered when you fled to your sister\u2019s home in Lahore, and that as recent as June 2020 and March 31, 2021, your wife was approached by members of the SSP. I find this establishes the means and motivation of your agents of persecution.\n\n[29] I therefore find that you do not have a viable Internal Flight Alternative available for you anywhere in Pakistan on a balance of probabilities.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[30] Based on the totality of the evidence, I find XXXX XXXX XXXX, to be a Convention refugee. Therefore I accept your claim.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

        "unofficial_text":"2022 RLLR 117\n\nCitation: 2022 RLLR 117\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: February 22, 2022\nPanel: Candida Quinn\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): James Hill Lawson\nCountry: Georgia\nRPD Number: TB9-17568\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2023-01023\nATIP Pages: N\/A\n\nDECISION\n\n[1] MEMBER: This is the decision of the Refugee Protection Division in the claim of XXXX XXXX on February 22nd, 2022, claim number TB9-17568.\n\n[2] The duty of this Panel is to find if there is sufficient credible trustworthy evidence to determine if there is more than a \u201cmere possibility\u201d that the claimant would be persecuted if returned to Georgia. In doing so I have considered in its totality the testimony, the documentary evidence and submissions by your counsel. I have also applied the principles of the IRB Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9: Regarding Sexual Orientations, Gender Identities and Expressions of Sexual Characteristics that differ from societal norms in their country\u2019s cultural environments.\n\n[3] After reviewing the evidence in its totality and applying these guidelines the Panel has decided that Mr. XXXX is a Convention refugee.\n\nAllegations\n\n[4] COUNSEL: I\u2019m sorry, Madam Member, I couldn\u2019t hear what you said you determined that he?\n\n[5] MEMBER: Is a Convention refugee.\n\n[6] COUNSEL: Is, okay, nice and clear, good. Thank you.\n\n[7] MEMBER:\n\nAllegations\n\n[8] The claimant\u2019s allegations are laid out in full in his Basis of Claim form and accompanying narrative. In summary he alleges multiple attacks and threats by opponents of the SOGIESC community in Georgia on account of his bisexual identity and relationships including hostility by Georgian law enforcement. He fears continued abuse on this basis if returned to Georgia.\n\nIdentity\n\n[9] The Panel finds that the claimant has established his identity, his personal identity and his citizenship and his national identity by his Georgian passport issued October 2017.\n\nNexus\n\n[10] The Panel finds a connection between the claimant\u2019s allegations and one (1) of the protected grounds namely the particular social group of Georgian men perceived by others in society as other than heterosexual. That is to say with other sexual orientations, gender identities and expressions of sexual characteristics.\n\nCredibility\n\n[11] I have found the claimant to be a credible witness and therefore accept what he has alleged in support of his claim. The claimant testified in a straightforward manner and there were no material inconsistencies in his testimony or contradictions between his testimony and the other evidence before me.\n\n[12] Claimant\u2019s testimony described three (3) attacks from his narrative that caused him to be afraid of returning to Georgia, in XXXX 2019, XXXX 2018 and XXXX 2019. He testified about the details of these physical and verbal attacks, the injuries received, the medical treatment and a dismissive or abusive response by the police including at the police station.\n\n[13] The claimant has supplemented his testimony with a detailed narrative of events, three (3) medical reports and three (3) letters of support each of which corroborate the details of the attacks. He has also provided and testified about photos of himself at a gay pride event in Canada with a former partner in Georgia and as a child wearing a skirt which he testified he enjoyed doing. The photos corroborate his SOGIESC identity, these details are all probative of the claim.\n\n[14] I find on the balance of probabilities that the claimant has suffered repeated humiliation, threats and beatings that rise to the level of harm sufficiently serious to amount to persecution. I also find that the claimant has established a subjective fear of the agents of harm. I find that the persecution suffered is linked and suffered and cleared, excuse me is a linked to the Convention ground of the particular social group of SOGIESC persons in Georgia.\n\nCountry Conditions\n\n[15] Objective evidence of the treatment of SOGIESC persons in Georgia establishes on a balance of probabilities the well-foundedness of the claimant\u2019s fear of persecution. Both the National Documentation Package, NDP. dated June 30, 2021 and claimant\u2019s disclosure provide evidence of persecution of bisexual persons. Legal protection for this group among others has been on the books according to NDP Tab 6.2, legal situation of LGBTI persons in Georgia, human rights, education and monitoring centre, Lakajalagnea (ph) 2016 that protection has not been forthcoming however and going to the police is frequently futile or results in even more abuse.\n\n[16] The US Department of State Human Rights report for 2020 at Tab 2.1 of the NDP reported about \u201csystemic violence, oppression, abuse, intolerance and discrimination\u201d against LGBTQ persons that year. NGOs within Georgia reported last year that the governmental institutions appointed to deal with the persecution were either ineffective or complicit in furthering it, IBID at 61.\n\nState Protection\n\n[17] The Panel has also considered whether state protection is available to the claimant and concluded that it is not because of the complicity of the police. I therefore find that state protection would not reasonably be forthcoming for this claimant. Indeed the claimant reported the attacks he described to the police in Georgia and received no help along with derogatory, dismissive, abusive comments by them.\n\nInternal Flight Alternative\n\n[18] Finally the Panel has considered whether a viable Internal Flight Alternative exists for the claimant. Given the totality of the evidence I find on a balance of probabilities that the claimant cannot live freely in Georgia and that therefore no IFA exists for him there.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[19] Consequently for the reasons given and upon consideration of the whole of the evidence the Refugee Protection Division determines that the claimant has established a serious possibility of persecution on the basis of the claimant\u2019s sexual orientation per Section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. This concludes this hearing at 12:05 p.m.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX has been designated as representative for his minor children included in the claim, being XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXand, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.\n\nAllegations\n\n[3] The allegations are fully set out in the claimants\u2019 Basis of Claim forms (BOC).[2] They allege they fear persecution, due to their political opinions, as they are opposed to President Daniel Ortega\u2019s government which is controlled by his political party Frente Sandinista de Liberacion Nacional (\u201cFSLN\u201d).\n\n[4] XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX are adult siblings. XXXX, the principal claimant (\u201cPC\u201d) left Nicaragua in XXXX 2019. Her brothers and their families left Nicaragua in XXXX of 2019. Their hearings were joined as required by Rule 55 of the RPD Rules[3], however they each have distinct allegations, which I will summarize below.\n\n[5] The PC became an active member of Citizens for Freedom and Democracy Party in 2017. In light of the 2018 political crisis the PC attended protests in dissent of the Ortega regime, first on April 23, 2018, then on April 29, 2018. On May 9, 2018, at another march the PC was detained by police, assaulted in detention before finally being released with a threat to stop protesting. In the months that followed the PC provided financial support to those protesting at barricades, and provided food, medicine, and water to the protesters. After her detention she was threatened by phone, surveilled, and arbitrarily stopped by police at check points. On July 5, 2019, she discovered there was a warrant out for her arrest. She fled the country on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2019, with her young son, who is a Canadian citizen.\n\n[6] XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (\u201cAC1\u201d), the PC\u2019s brother, and his wife (\u201cAC2\u201d) joined the April 23, 2018, civic protest, and thereafter the April 29, 2018, and May 9, 2018, marches. AC1 and AC2 were unharmed at these events, despite violence and detentions by the government. At a march on May 30, 2018, AC1 and AC2 had to hide for 5 hours from gunfire and arrest fearing their death before finding safety. AC1 provided food, water, and clothing to the protesters at blockages. Both claimants attended express pickets and provided refuge to an independent journalist targeted by the government in December 2018, and later to his sister before she fled in XXXX 2019. They began noticing that they were being surveilled. On December 5, 2019, AC1 was accused of fraud, and summoned to the police station where they coerced and threatened him to support the regime before being released. Shortly after a warrant was issued for his arrest on terrorism charges, and he and his family fled to Canada on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2019.\n\n[7] XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (\u201cAC3\u201d) and his family fled Nicaragua on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2019, with AC1 and his family. AC3 operated a XXXX XXXX XXXX His wife (\u201cAC4\u201d) was the XXXX XXXXof aXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. In 2018 AC3 used his XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Thereafter he was targeted by the Ministry of Transport and National Police who would stop his vehicle and threaten him. In the end of June 2018, he noticed that his family was being surveilled. He became a member of the Citizen for Freedom party and hosted small gatherings at his house to discuss politics. The XXXX run by AC4 and her family supported national work stoppages and strikes done in protest of the Ortega-Murillo regime and faced backlash and eventually closed. In XXXX 2019 their house was broken into, and in XXXX 2019 they were chased by motorcycles when on route to an express picket in Managua. The family fled the country after the AC3\u2019s father received a warrant for his arrest on terrorism charges.\n\nDecision\n\n[8] I find that the adult claimants are Convention refugees, pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA, as there exists a serious possibility of persecution, should they return to Nicaragua, on account of their political opinion. I further find that the minor claimants would face a risk due to their membership in a particular social group as a family member of persons who hold a political opinion contrary to that of the Nicaraguan government. My reasons are as follows.\n\nIdentity\n\n[9] I find that the claimants\u2019 identity as nationals of Nicaragua are established by the documents, specifically their certified true copy of their Nicaraguan passports.[4]\nCredibility\n\n[10] The PC and her two brothers, AC1 and AC3 testified at the hearing. I found them all to be credible witnesses and I believe what they allege in support of their claim. All three testified in an impassioned and straightforward manner with respect to their political beliefs and their fear for themselves, their families, and their country. They were each able to provide details easily and elaborately of their experiences in Nicaragua, and their reasons for finally fleeing the country. There were no relevant inconsistencies in their testimony or contradictions between their testimony and the other evidence before me which was not satisfactorily explained.\n\n[11] Specifically, the PC, AC1 and AC2 each provided a letter from Cuidadanos por La Libertad confirming their collaboration with the party,[5] copies of the arrest warrant and capture order provided to the claimants\u2019 father.[6]\n\n[12] I note that the warrant for arrest provided by AC1 was dated April 10, 2019;[7] however his narrative and testimony detailed that this warrant was issued on December 10, 2019. When asked for an explanation for this discrepancy, AC1 testified he was not able to comment as he was not sure why it would say that. He further testified that this document was dropped off at the same time as the capture order, dated December 10, 2019. Upon close examination of the original copy of the document, I note that the date of the warrant is very difficult to read. I accept, as submitted by counsel, the \u201cApril\u201d translation might have been in error and find this explanation reasonable. I draw no negative inference.\n\n[13] In support of her claim the PC also provided a letter from another member of Cuidadanos por La Libertad corroborating her support of the protesters, a letter from her father corroborating his knowledge and receipt of the warrant for her arrest, and a letter from her brother (AC1) corroborating that he and his wife housed her prior to her leaving the country. The PC also indicated that her son had a traumatic encounter with state forces while on his school bus and provided a psychological report to corroborate that event.[8]\n\n[14] In support of his family\u2019s claim, AC1 also provided a copy of his summons to police for an alleged fraud on December 5, 2019, a letter from the journalist he and his family had given refuge to prior to his flight from Nicaragua, a letter from AC2\u2019s sister who housed the family prior to their departure, and pictures of AC1 and AC2 at various protests and with the exiled journalist and persons who were vocal opponents of the Ortega regime. AC1 had also indicated that the church where his family were active congregants was violently attacked, he provided a letter from the Father of the Parish corroborating that they were parishioners there.[9]\n\n[15] In support of his family\u2019s claim, AC3 also provided letters from friends who attended political meetings at the family home and corroborated their attendance at protests. He also provided documents corroborating the struggle at AC4\u2019s XXXX, including the notification of an act of infringement from the Labor Inspector, a letter form AC4\u2019s mother to the Ministry of Labor in response to this purported infringement, a notification card for AC4\u2019s parents, and a circular to the XXXXfrom the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX notifying the XXXXof a breach of their obligations. They also provided photographs at protests, of surveillance outside their home, of AC4 with critics of Ortega, of the XXXX, and Facebook posts pertaining to the XXXXclosure.[10]\n\n[16] I find that the above-mentioned evidence establishes the claimants\u2019 allegations and, given their credible testimony and after reviewing the documents, have no reason to doubt their accuracy. I find that the claimants have established on a balance of probabilities that they were opposed to the Ortega regime and were targeted by the state because of their participation in protest and their opposition to the government.\n\nSubjective Fear\n\n[17] While I have found that the claimants are credible with respect to their political opinion, each claimant had a timeline which raised questions about whether their behaviour substantiates subjective fear.\n\n[18] The PC travelled to Miami in XXXX 2018. She did not claim asylum and returned to Nicaragua after her vacation. She left Nicaragua for Canada in XXXX 2019. AC1 and his family went to the United States in XXXX 2019, and to Costa Rica in XXXX 2019. They did not claim asylum at that time, fleeing Nicaragua in XXXX 2019. AC3 and his family went to the United States in XXXX 2019. They did not claim asylum, leaving Nicaragua in XXXX 2019.\n\n[19] Given the claimants faced repression, surveillance and political pressure since the civil protests in 2018, these timelines raise issues about delay in departure, failure to claim in another country, and reavailment. While delay,[11] failure to claim in another country[12] and reavailment are not in itself determinative, they can cast doubt on a claimant\u2019s subjective fear.\n\n[20] All the claimants testified that they had travelled for tourism and had no intention of leaving Nicaragua, their lives, and their parents prior to their asylum claim in Canada. For each claimant the triggering event was the discovery of a warrant for their arrest for terrorism related charges, which immediately proceeded their final departure.\n\n[21] I have considered the explanation pertaining to these subjective fear issues and find the explanations for returning or staying in Nicaragua to be reasonable. Accordingly, I find that the claimants have established a subjective fear of persecution based on their political opinion.\n\nObjective basis\n\n[22] The claimants\u2019 fear is supported by the National Documentation Packages of April 23, 2021[13] and, November 30, 2021.[14]\n\n[23] Civil protests in 2018 against the reform of the social security system expanded into general protest of the Ortega government. This political crisis resulted in the violent repression of protest by police and paramilitaries, and systematic violation of human rights in the country, including murder, imprisonment, forced disappearance and torture.[15] Since this time, the country has witnessed growing state violence, with the freedom of association and assembly increasingly restricted. These restrictions preclude any meaningful choice in elections.[16] The government has criminalized social protest to \u201cdismantle citizen mobilization\u201d and are prosecuting protesters for terrorism offences and alteration of the constitutional order.[17]\n\n[24] The Country Report on Human Rights Practices for 2020 details that by 2019 the country was in a state of terror where basic civil rights were not guaranteed to those who were not Ortega partisans.[18] The 2020 report further details that within the nine months proceeding the report, 350 people were killed, 2000 injured and several hundred imprisoned or disappeared.[19] Further, item 2.5 of the NDP documented harassment and threats of family members of those perceived to be dissidents, pointing specifically to an incident where pro-government armed groups fired shots into a funeral of a 16 year old killed in an extrajudicial execution; an act the family perceived to be intimidation and punishment for the protests.[20]\n\n[25] In the lead up to the recent election of November 7, 2021, the NDP documents a \u201ccascade\u201d of arrests of government critics and serious human rights violations as a broader strategy to suppress dissent, instill fear, and restrict political participation.[21] This included documentation of police arresting government critics at checkpoints, on the street, or in their homes, in most cases without showing a warrant.[22] This source also documented that those people who had previously been arrested during the brutal crackdown in 2018 suffered regular police harassment and surveillance since being released.[23]\n\n[26] Counsel for the claimants provided additional country condition documents,[24] including a statement by Canadian Minister of Foreign Affairs Melanie Joly on the illegitimacy of the November 7, 2021, Nicaraguan elections, which robbed citizen of their right to vote in free and fair elections:\nWe reiterate our call on the regime of Daniel Ortega to fulfill its international obligations, release all political prisoners, end the repression of independent media, allow for the return of international human rights observers and establish a meaningful national dialogue.[25]\n\n[27] Further articles document the recent events in the lead up to the November election, including the exile of Kitty Monterrey, the president of Cuidadanos por La Libertad, the arrest of former Foreign Minister Mauricio Diaz[26], and the disappearance of opposition leaders, arbitrary arrests, and a dismantling of opposition parties amid a crackdown on dissent by Daniel Ortega[27].\n\n[28] The claimants\u2019 narratives are all consistent with the documentary evidence. Given that there are no serious credibility issues with respect to their allegations, coupled with the documentary evidence set out above, I find that all of the claimants have established a prospective risk of persecution at the hands of the Nicaraguan government.\n\nState protection\n\n[29] Nicaragua has a centralized, authoritarian pollical system dominated by President Ortega and his wife, Vice President Murillo. The party exercises total control over executive, legislative, judicial, and electoral functions.[28] Given the evidence discussed above and given that the agent of persecution is the state, it would be objectively unreasonable for the claimants to seek protection of the state. I find that there is clear and convincing evidence that the state is unable or unwilling to provide the claimants with adequate protection.\n\nInternal flight alternative\n\n[30] Based on the evidence on file, I find that the claimants face a serious possibility of persecution throughout Nicaragua. These documents demonstrate that the control of the Sandinista-led Nicaraguan movement extends to the entire country and the claimants would not have any safe place in Nicaragua. Therefore, I find the claimants do not have a viable IFA as they would face a serious possibility of persecution throughout the country.\n\nConclusion\n\n[31] In light of the preceding, I conclude that the adult claimants are Convention refugees, pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA because of their political opinions. I find that the minor claimants are Convention refugees pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA because they are family members of persons who hold a political opinion contrary to that of the Nicaraguan government. Accordingly, I accept their claims.\n\n(signed) Lindsay E.

        "unofficial_text":"2022 RLLR 115\n\nCitation: 2022 RLLR 115\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: June 21, 2022\nPanel: Dawn Kershaw\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Seyfi Sun\nCountry: Nigeria\nRPD Number: TB9-25934\nAssociated RPD Number(s): TB9-25988, TB9-26018\nATIP Number: A-2023-01023\nATIP Pages: N\/A\n\nDECISION\n\n[1] MEMBER: So, this decision is being rendered after the hearing and in the absence of the parties by dictation using Microsoft Teams on June 21st, 2022. This transcript may be edited before being signed and sent to the parties.\n\n[2] At the conclusion of the hearing, I told you that I was accepting your claims. By that, I mean, I am accepting the claims for refugee status of the principal claimant, XXXX XXXX XXXX, in file number 2 \u2014 sorry, TB9-25934, the associate claimant, XXXX XXXX XXXX, in file number TB9-25988 and the minor claimant, XXXX XXXX XXXX, in file number TB9-26018. I note that this was a new hearing ordered by the Refugee Appeal Division in its decision dated October 21st, 2021, from the original Refugee Protection Division, decision dated March 10, 2021. These claims were heard jointly. Ms. XXXX was appointed as the designated representative for the minor claimant.\n\n[3] I considered your testimony and examined the evidence before me, and I am reading my decision orally. You three (3) claimants claim to be citizens of Nigeria and claim refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. I find that you three (3) claimants are Convention refugees for the following reasons.\n\n[4] Your allegations are found in your Basis of Claim forms in Exhibits 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3. The details were elaborated upon in your testimony. In summary, you, the principal claimant, primarily fear persecution in Nigeria as a bisexual woman. In the case of the associate claimant and the minor claimant, you fear you will be persecuted as family members of a bisexual woman. You also fear harm at the hands of the police and or the community because of the principal claimant\u2019s relationship with another woman when in Nigeria. I have based my decision on your identity Ms. XXXX, as a bisexual woman and the familial relationship to you of both the associate claimant and the minor claimant. In holding this hearing and making my decisions, I have carefully considered and applied Chairperson Guidelines four (4), women refugee claimants fearing gender-related persecution, as well as guideline nine (9) regarding sexual orientation and gender identity expression.\n\n[5] With respect to your identities, I find that all three (3) of your personal identities and your identities as nationals of Nigeria are established on a balance of probabilities, both by your testimony and by the supporting documents in Exhibit 1. Both the principal claimant and associate claimant testified that the passports in Exhibit 1 were the ones used to come to Canada.\n\n[6] I find there is a link between what, you, the principal claimant fears and a Convention ground, specifically, a particular social group, namely being a woman who is a bisexual. And in the case of the associate claimant and the minor claimant, the particular social group of being family members of a bisexual woman. I accept on a balance of probabilities that you, Ms. XXXX, are a bisexual and that the associate claimant and minor claimant are your family members. I analyzed your claims pursuant to section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n\n[7] In terms of your general credibility, I found you, the principal claimant and associate claimant to be credible witnesses. You both testified in a straightforward manner and without embellishment. I found you both to be very forthright and forthcoming. You did not exaggerate your testimony, and you readily answered all my questions and added details when I asked about certain areas. There were no inconsistencies in your testimony that went to the heart of your claims.\n\n[8] There was a question in the first hearing about the arrest warrant that was disclosed in Exhibit 4 and adverse credibility findings were based on the authenticity or lack of authenticity of that document. I have not made any determination about the authenticity of this document as I have decided this claim based on the sexual orientation of the principal claimant, and whether or not there is an arrest warrant out for the claimants is not the crux of this case in my view. As such, I did not draw any adverse credibility inference from this arrest warrant.\n\n[9] I did ask you both about your status in the United States and why you had not made claims there. In the case of you, Ms. XXXX, you told me that because you were outside Nigeria, you thought you could raise the issue of your sexual orientation with people in the Nigerian community where you lived in the United States. But you quickly realized by their reaction that their beliefs about sexuality, that includes an attraction to someone of the same sex, was not accepted. As such you became isolated within your community in the United States as well. And in fact had to move once because of that. As such you were not able to get any assistance from the Nigerian community in the United States. In addition, you testified that you did not have any money to pay an immigration lawyer in the United States. You also testified and I find that you never intended to stay outside the United States for more than a month or two (2) until things settled. You also had a baby in the United States in November 2017, which you felt gave you the status of someone who would not be harassed. I accept your explanations for why you did not make a claim in the United States. And I draw no adverse credibility inference from your failure to do so.\n\n[10] In respect of you, Mr. XXXX, you testified that after Mr. XXXX \u2014 sorry, Ms. XXXX, left you in the United States, you were not yourself and could not sleep. You began to drink which you had never done in your life. You made some decisions that were affected by that, including entering into another relationship with an American woman who you married. You testified and I find that that relationship was difficult for you as you had hoped that you would reconcile with Ms. XXXX and also because your new wife was American and you were not, and that caused some difficulties in the relationship. You told me that your American wife filed an application to sponsor you for US immigration, but you left the US prior to that being decided because you reconciled with Ms. XXXX. I accept what you say about why you did not finish obtaining your status in the United States and do not draw negative credibility inference based on what you told me about the American marital relationship along with what you told me about how you feel about Ms. XXXX. And the progression of your relationship from being together to being apart to being back together again and the reasons for that.\n\n[11] The central issue of your claim is your sexual orientation, Ms. XXXX. You testified that you established a relationship with a young woman while in secondary school. You carried on that relationship discreetly, testifying it was easier to hide because you were both female and no one suspected that you would be in a relationship. You told me about how the relationship started, who initiated the first contact and how you kept the relationship going, until you had to go your separate ways when you finished high school. You also told me about your second same-sex relationship that occurred when you were already married to Mr. XXXX. You told me how that began and how for you, it was supposed to be something to occupy your time because you were apart from your husband and were lonely, as was she. However, you told me about how that progressed and how you tried to remove yourself from that relationship when she became possessive of you because she threatened to expose your relationship. This also is the reason you ended up telling Mr. XXXX about your sexual orientation.\n\n[12] I asked you about your current relationship with the associate claimant, Mr. XXXX. You told me how you met and explained that because you were attracted to both men and women and because you were at an age when it became time for you to be married, and have children, you got into the relationship with Mr. XXXX. You told me how it felt to realize you were attracted to both men and women, including that for a time you thought there was something medically wrong with you. It was not until you were able to read about same-sex relationships and bisexuality, that you realized that there was nothing wrong with you. And that this is just who you are. However, the path was not as easy as that because you told me that you were faced with having learned in society and in your Muslim religion, that having an attraction to someone of the same sex was taboo. You also told me that that now that you have children, your preference would be to have a same-sex relationship. But you and Mr. XXXX have decided together to remain committed to each other, both because of the children and because you love each other. It was clear from your testimony that the path has not been easy for you two (2). It was clear that it has been difficult for you, Ms. XXXX, to have had to give up your own XXXX XXXX XXXX and you, Mr. XXXX, to give up your job in Nigeria, that you still had when you came to the United States because you thought you were going to return to Nigeria. It was also clear that it has not been easy for you, Ms. XXXX, to have lost contact all your family, including your mother to whom you used to be close and your sister who to some extent supported you, even after your sexual orientation was discovered. In Mr. XXXX case, it was clear it is difficult for him to be away from his mother who remains in Nigeria and for whom he is really the main support.\n\n[13] I believe your testimony about how you both have had to come to terms with Ms. XXXX sexuality. Your testimony, Mr. XXXX was very frank and how you felt when she first told you and the negative impact it had on your relationship. You testified that in your mind there was no such thing as bisexuality and your questioned how she could be with you. However, you testified that Ms. XXXX has educated you and reassured you that she is attracted to both men and women and you testified that you are certain that she is now committed to your relationship. You both testified about how you have decided to move ahead in the relationship because you have a family and your children are the most important thing to you.\n\n[14] I also asked you, Ms. XXXX, generally about your sexual orientation and how you felt about it. You testified that once you know it was not a medical problem and that it is just nature, you were able to accept it, even though you were never able to be open about it in Nigeria. I believe that you, Ms. XXXX, are bisexual based on all of the testimony. This is despite you not having been involved in any activities in Canada related to the LGBTQ+ community. I asked you about that and you told me that even though you are now in a community where your sexual orientation is accepted, and you would love to learn and know more, you are putting your partner first by not becoming involved in the community. You testified that instead you read and watch programs on your own about the LGBTQ community because as you put it, \u2018it is you who is not straight, not him.\u2019 Having heard Mr. XXXX testimony, I find that this is a loving choice by you Ms. XXXX because despite Mr. XXXX accepting you for who you are and putting the family first as he testified, it is not easy to put behind him all of the bad things he learned about the LGBTQ Community in Nigeria.\n\n[15] All of the evidence supports that you, Ms. XXXX, are bisexual and I accept that you are. You further testified that because of your bisexuality, you and your family will be persecuted if you return to Nigeria. You testified credibly about the risk you all would face at the hands of the police or the community given that your sexual orientation is known. In addition, you would not be able to live openly as a bisexual in Nigeria. You also testified that your husband, the associate claimant and your children would be and ostracized and stigmatized because people know you are bisexual. I find on a balance of probabilities that you, Ms. XXXX, are a bisexual and that the associate claimant, Mr. XXXX, and the minor claimant, are the partner and son of you as a bisexual and that you three (3) have a subjective fear of returning to Nigeria.\n\n[16] I further find that there is an objective basis for your subjective fear. The overall objective evidence supports your claim for Convention refugee protection based on your membership in a particular social group, namely your sexual orientation as a bisexual. The National Documentation Package for Nigeria, April 29, 2022, version in Exhibit 3 and Items 6.16, 6.2 and 2.1 states that same-sex relationships are criminalized specifically as set out in the same-sex marriage prohibition act enacted in January 2014. Which effectively renders illegal, all forms of activity supporting or promoting LGBT rights. Item 6.1 goes on to say that LGBTQ persons have suffered violence from many angles of society, mostly from vigilante groups and mob justice. It further states that the violence is omnipresent. It is reported in item 6.2 that Nigeria is one (1) of the most homophobic countries in the world.\n\n[17] I also find that the associate claimant\u2019s and the minor claimant\u2019s subjective fear is supported by the objective evidence in the NDP. Item 6.11 states that family members of sexual minorities, including children, face ostracism, stigmatization and embarrassment from the community members and other extended family members. In addition, family members of sexual minorities can be cut off from their community and they can be insulted and assaulted by community members. Overall the objective country condition evidence supports the conclusion that the subjective fear you three (3) have has an objective basis. As such, I find that you have a well-founded fear of persecution.\n\n[18] Because same-sex relationships are criminalized, I find it would be objectively unreasonable for you to seek the protection of the authorities in Nigeria. Adequate state protection would not be available to you as you fear the state.\n\n[19] With regard to possible viable internal flight alternatives in Nigeria, given the federal laws of Nigeria, criminalizing same sex relationships that are applicable throughout Nigeria, I find there is a serious possibility of persecution for all of you throughout Nigeria. And no viable internal flight alternative exists for you in Nigeria.\n\n[20] Having considered all of the evidence I find there is a serious possibility that you three (3) claimants would face persecution in Nigeria pursuant to section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. And I find that you are Convention refugees based on your membership in a particular social group and I therefore accept your claims.\n\n[21] In summary, based on the totality of the evidence before me, I find that you are Convention refugees pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA, and I accept your claims.\n\n[22] End of recording. Thank you.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

And I have found that you are a Convention refugee based on the risk that you face in returning to Turkey, the risk persecution as a gay man. So, I have accepted your claim today.\n\n[2] CLAIMANT: Thank you very much. Like, for saving my life, I do not know what to say. I really appreciate it.\n\n[3] MEMBER: You do not need to say anything. But I appreciate that, and welcome. I am glad that I was able to accept your claim. I do need to provide more fulsome reasons for my findings. You will receive a copy of those reasons in the mail, and your Counsel will also receive a copy. Mr. Radin, I just wonder would you like to have my more fulsome reasons fully interpreted?\n\n[4] COUNSEL: Madam Member, I think it is okay, because if the claimant has any questions, he can speak to me about the decision as well.

So, if you could just explain to Mr. XXXX that I am going to be giving, just my full reasons, but that the main thing that he needs to know is that I am accepting his claim. My full reasons will not be interpreted today, but if you have any questions at the end, we will be happy to answer them. Okay. All right. Thank you. So, this is the decision in the claim for refugee protection made by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, file number TB9 31315. I have considered your testimony and the documentary evidence, and I have found that you are a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. The details of your claim are documented in your Basis of Claim form and the amendments to that claim at Exhibits 2 and 5. I have also reviewed all the documents that were entered at Exhibit 6. As I indicated, you will receive a notice of this decision in the mail, and your Counsel will also receive a copy. You, XXXX XXXX, claim to be a citizen of Turkey, and you are claiming refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. In reaching my decision, I have considered and applied the chairperson\u2019s guideline number 9, proceedings before the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada involving sexual orientation and gender identity and expression, the SOGIE guidelines.\n\n[6] In summary, you fear persecution in Turkey at the hands of your family, society, and the Turkish state, due to your membership in a particular social group as a gay man. You are a 27-year-old man who is a Turkish citizen. You indicated that you began to discover your attraction to boys when you were between the ages of 11 and 13 as you realized that you were different from the other boys that you knew. You were attracted to boys and men when they seemed to be attracted to girls and women. You could not share your understanding of your sexual orientation with others, and in fact, you tried not to believe it as it was difficult for you to be able to live in this way, and you knew that it would be difficult. You had your first sexual relationship with a man when you were about 16, who was a friend from school. Again, you could not share your relationship with anyone else, out of fear of what could happen to both of you should your relationship be discovered. You were aware that your father and other family members were homophobic and had often heard them express opinions that gay men were unnatural or unhuman. Your family is Muslim, and gay relationships are not accepted in the Muslim faith. You are also very aware of the expectations of men in Turkish society, and that you were to marry women and have children. Gay men were not to be tolerated as they tainted the Turkish society and so therefore, they should be killed.\n\n[7] When you were 16 or seven (7) (sic) you began to attend gay bars where you met another man and had a relationship. At that time, you also attended and supported the LGBTQ community at protests, and you were once detained by police who stopped you on your way to attend such a protest. At the time of these protests, you also heard your uncle and father make homophobic slurs while speaking about the protests. You had a number of casual relationships after your relationships when you were younger, and in 2018, you and some friends were harassed when you were leaving a gay bar, and you were threatened by the men who then damaged your friend\u2019s car. You explained how you could not report this incident of damage to the car to the insurance, as this would require a police report. When asked why that would cause difficulty or danger to you, you indicated that the police would ask questions, and the answers to the questions would reveal where you had been, that you had been at a gay club, and therefore reveal that you were a gay man. You said this could then remain on your file, which could be released as information to future employers or to the military if you were called to serve. In 2019, you began a relationship with XXXX (ph). At time you and XXXX would exchange intimate photos through messages sent between your phones, and in XXXX 2019, XXXX was detained by police, who you learned took and examined his phone. You were called to the police station, and when you arrived, you were taunted by the police for being gay. You were called the wife of the gay man and you were only able to get XXXX released after paying a large amount of money as a bribe. After his release you went to XXXX home. Your brother called you and told you that he and your father were at the police station, had gone there to find you, and that the police had told your brother and your father that you were a gay man, and they had shown you the photos that they had from XXXX phone. Your father made homophobic slurs to you and threatened to harm you. Out of fear you went to stay with another friend. You later called your brother, and you were able to safely meet him. He warned you not to return to your home as your father and uncle were planning to kill you. He encouraged you to try to go to Canada, as he understood that you could live safely in Canada as a gay man. Your brother then assisted you in leaving Turkey, and you arrived in Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2019. Since your arrival in Canada, you have been surprised, as you indicated, you had been surprised to see the freedom of people with diverse sexual orientation and gender identity, and that they have the ability to openly express themselves and show their attractions to one another without being any risk to their safety, and they can do this openly and freely. You have expressed that due to COVID and the restrictions placed in society, you have not been able to get involved in any LGBTQ positive groups, but that you look forward to joining such groups and supporting others when things are open again and you are able to attend.\n\n[8] On XXXX XXXX, 2019, after arriving in Canada, you received an email from your father, which you had submitted as part of your documents. You indicated that in this letter, your father uses many homophobic slurs and threats, and he threatened to kill you for disgracing your family, threatening that you cannot hide and that you will be found, and you will be killed. Given your circumstances, I accept that you are and have shown that you are a national of Turkey, and you have established on a balance of probabilities that you are a citizen of Turkey through a copy of your passport, which is at Exhibit 1, as well as your other national identity documents and your family registry. These are all at Exhibit 6.\n\n[9] With regard to credibility, I found you to be a very credible witness. You testified in a sincere and forthright manner about the difficulty you face as a man in Turkey, and things that you have experienced both from your family and from society at large, and how you have felt since coming to Canada after you have left that situation in Turkey. Your testimony was free of embellishments, there were no relevant inconsistencies in your testimony or contradictions between your testimony, the other evidence in your documents, and your allegations you made in your Basis of Claim form. Given that I found to you to be credible witness, I accept what you alleged in support of your claim and that you have provided us with evidence to demonstrate that you are a gay man. Some of the evidence you provided in support of your claim, which are at Exhibit 6, include witness statements from your friend who knew you and knew about your experiences when you lived in Turkey, from XXXX your former partner, medical documents, text messages between you and some other friends, which you revealed were just exchanges that you have on applications for gay men here in Canada, as well, as indicated earlier, you provided this email from your father. So, based on the totality of the evidence, I am satisfied that you have established your sexual identity as a gay man, and I find this on a balance of probabilities. I therefore find that you have credibly established your subjective fear in returning to Turkey.\n\n[10] With respect to the objective evidence, the National Documentation Package for Turkey, which is at Exhibit 3, the version of December 17th, 2021, they provide consistent account that members of the LGBTQ community face persecution and discrimination in Turkey. Item 6.5 of the NDP notes that while there is no legislation prohibiting sexual acts between people of the same sex in Turkey, same-sex marriage is not legal in Turkey, and same-sex relationships are not recognized by law. Further, there is no legislation to protect people from discrimination based on their sexual orientation or gender identity, and there are no hate crime legislation projecting LGBTQ persons. Item 2.1 of the NDP is the US Department of State Report for 2020. It states that LGBTQ individuals experience discrimination, intimidation, and violent crimes in Turkey. Human rights groups reported that police and prosecutors frequently failed to pursue cases of violence against members of the LGBTQ community for accepted justification for the perpetrator\u2019s actions. Police rarely arrest suspects or hold them to pretrial detention as is common for other defendants. When arrests were made, defendants could claim unjustifiable provocation under article 29 of the penal code and request a reduced sentence. Judges would routinely apply the law and reduce the sentences of persons who killed LGBTQ individuals. Courts of appeal previously upheld these verdicts based in part on the immoral nature of the victim. Item 1.17 of the NDP, the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade report for 2020, notes that Human Rights Groups report police have used legal provisions relating to offences against public morality, protection of the family, and unnatural sexual behaviour to justify harassment of LGBTQ persons in Turkey. Human rights groups claim that LGBTQ individuals are vulnerable to street crime and general violence due to the lack of hate crime legislation for the LGBTQ community. Item 6.5 of the NDP is a July 2020 article from Politico, which confirms the above and notes that a lack of legal protection has created a culture of impunity around hate crimes directed at LGBTQ people, and there are many instances where crimes against the LGBTQ community are not fully prosecuted. Politico also notes that numerous LGBTQ organizations report that restrictions on the freedom of speech, assembly, and association continue. LGBTQ advocates also described a rise in hate speech following controversial remarks by the President of the Directorate of Religious Affairs, which was supported by the President of Turkey. High-level government officials employed anti-LGBTQ speech, and the president warned against those who exhibit all kinds of perversions that our god\u2019s prohibit. Again, in Item 6.5 of the NDP, Freedom House March 2020 report states that LGBTQ person\u2019s face discrimination, police harassment, and occasional violence. The government has targeted LGBTQ events in recent years, noting that in 2019, Istanbul\u2019s pride parade was banned for the fifth consecutive year. Furthermore, LGBTQ face discrimination in employment, healthcare, and education. In Item 6.5, the May 2020 Kaos GL report indicates there is an increase in human rights violations against LGBTQ individuals in Turkey in 2019 that originated directly from authorities and law enforcement. As well, the Australian DFAT report notes that LGBT detainees are vulnerable to physical violence, harassment, and denial of medical services, and have complained about the use of solitary combined as a form of inhumane treatment.\n\n[11] In summary, I find that the objective evidence is consistent with and supports your allegations of persecution and harm that would come to you if you were to live openly as a gay man in Turkey, not just from your own family who have threatened to harm you, but also from society and state. Thus, having found that you have a well-founded fear of persecution from the Turkish authorities and society, I must consider whether the state protection is available to you, or whether you could safely live elsewhere in Turkey without facing such risks. With regards to state protection, the context of Turkey and in light of the objective evidence noted earlier, I find that there is sufficiently clear and convincing evidence that state protection would not be reasonably available to you as a gay man. In regards to internal flight alternative, in light of the objective evidence I have noted, I find that there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout Turkey, and therefore, a viable internal flight alternative does not exist.\n\n[12] So, given the above and having considered all of your evidence, I find on a balance of probabilities that there is a serious possibility that you would face persecution in Turkey because of your identity as a gay man. I therefore conclude that you are a Convention refugee, and I accept your claim. So, unless anyone has any questions, that concludes our hearing for today.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

Gayda\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Aisling Eileen Bondy\nCountry: Bahamas\nRPD Number: TB9-32744\nAssociated RPD Number(s): TB9-32745, TB9-32789\nATIP Number: A-2023-01023\nATIP Pages: N\/A\n\nDECISION\n\n[1] MEMBER: This is the decision in the refugee protection claims of XXXX XXXX XXXX, she is the 58-year-old principal claimant. The principle file number is TB9-32744. Also claiming refugee protection is the principal claimant\u2019s younger sister XXXX XXXX XXXX, who is 47 years old, and the third claimant is the principal claimant\u2019s XXXX XXXX daughter, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and she is now 18 years old.\n\n[2] The claimants are citizens of the Bahamas and are claiming refugee protection pursuant to Sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. I\u2019ve heard testimony from the principal claimant as well as the associated claimants today.\n\n[3] I have considered their testimony and the other evidence that is before me as set out in the consolidated list of documents, those are our Exhibits in this claim. I have also considered and applied the applicable IRB Guidelines, and that includes Guideline 4, the Gender Guidelines.\n\nMY DETERMINATION\n\n[4] I find that the claimants are Convention refugees and I therefore accept their claims. I find that the claimants would face a serious possibility of persecution in the future pursuant to Section 96 of the Act. The claimants allegations are set out in detail in their Basis of Claim form and the amendments to that form. This is found at Exhibits 2 and 4.\n\n[5] In summary, they allege to face ongoing physical and psychological violence at the hands of the principal claimant\u2019s former boyfriend\u2019s wife and her family. This former boyfriend is the father of the principal claimant\u2019s first child, a son who remains in the Bahamas and is 21 years old. I will reefer to this woman as CC, as these are her initials.\n\n[6] The principal claimant and her sister, the associated claimant, allege to have become targeted by CC and CC\u2019s family when they were forced to return to Nassau on the island of New Providence in early XXXX 2019 after their home and most of the infrastructure on Abaco Island were destroyed by Hurricane Dorian. They were in fact evacuated to Nassau. CC viewed their return to Nassau as a threat as there was a past history of threatening violence from CC toward the principal claimant and that this was a primary reason that the PC had originally relocated to Abaco in the mid 1990\u2019s.\n\n[7] The claimants allege that CC. is angry at the PC, and when I say PC I mean principal claimant, sorry. The claimants allege that CC is angry at the principal claimant due to her belief that the principal claimant and now the associated claimant, her sister, as well has some kind of plan to take her husband away from her given that the principal claimant previously had a relationship with CC\u2019s husband. And as noted he is the father of the principal claimant\u2019s son and the principal claimant had previously been in this relationship with the father of her son while CC was also in a relationship with this man.\n\n[8] The claimants allege that CC\u2019s cousins harass them, driving them off the road in Nassau, and also physically assaulted the associated claimant, XXXX. They also allege that CC and her family threatened them to leave Nassau as well as vandalize the principal claimant\u2019s brothers cars.\n\n[9] The claimants also allege that as women they fear pervasive gender-based violence in Bahamas such as sexual assault, and that they are particularly vulnerable to this form of gender-based violence as internally displaced women who\u2019s home was destroyed in Hurricane Dorian and who also lost their sources of employment as a result of this natural disaster.\n\n[10] The associated claimants allege to have faced past experiences of being targeted for sexual violence while residing at a government temporary relief shelter for displaced persons after the hurricane. The principal claimant and her sister, the associated claimant, have also described past experiences of living through former physically abusive relationships with men in Bahamas and also surviving other forms of gender-based violence as young persons growing up in Bahamas.\n\n[11] The claimants allege that they attempted to obtain police protection but that this was ineffective and that CC has more than one family member who is in the police, which meant that the police would not do anything to assist them. The principal claimant also alleges that CC\u2019s family has some affiliation with gangs in Bahamas.\n\n[12] The claimants fear that they will continue to be stalked and harmed by CC and CC\u2019s family in Bahamas, and that there is nowhere that they could live in Bahamas where they would not be safe from gender-based violence as single displaced women and where it would not be unduly harsh to live for them due to the continuing problems and aftermath of the 2019 hurricane.\n\n[13] Moving to the issue of identity, I find that the claimants personal and national identities as citizens of the Bahamas has been established on a balance of probabilities through their credible testimony and their supporting documentation. Before me in Exhibit 1 are the certified true copies of their Bahamian passports and these were seized by the Canada Border Services Agency at the airport when they started their refugee claims. I therefore find that the claimants have credibly established their personal and national identities on a balance of probabilities and that the country of Bahamas is the only country of reference.\n\n[14] The nexus in this claim to the refugee Convention ground is the claimants membership in two particular social groups, namely women and family. The claimants have been targeted for harm due to their gender and their relationship to the principal claimant. They face harm from the principal claimant\u2019s former boyfriend\u2019s present wife and that wife\u2019s family. They are also placed in this position of harm due to the way in which Bahamian society treats women through prevailing discriminatory attitudes and the treatment of women. The risk of being internally displaced persons after the natural disaster of Hurricane Dorian in September 2019 also exacerbated the threat that they faced as women as the two associated claimants were targeted for sexual violence outside the relief shelter where they were forced to live after this disaster.\n\n[15] I find that the associated claimants face a serious harm in relation to their gender and that this intersects with their membership in the particular social group of family in that it is their relationship to the principal claimant who\u2019s connection to the father of her son and that is the man who\u2019s wife and the wife\u2019s family is targeting the principal claimant and now the associated claimants, that it\u2019s this family connection that also puts them in harms way. I have considered the intersection of the claimants gender and their relationship toward each other in terms of their family and how this impacts the risks that they face.\n\n[16] Moving to the issue of credibility. I find that the claimants were credible witnesses. Their testimony was generally consistent with their amended Basis of Claim form narrative and the other forms before me. There were no relevant inconsistencies or contradictions that would lead me to disbelieve their core allegations. The claimants also credibly testified with respect to certain aspects of their claim and they did not appear to be evasive or to be embellishing facts of their claim and their testimony.\n\n[17] I find that the claimants have credibly established on a balance of probabilities that they were targeted by the wife of the principal claimant\u2019s former boyfriend and this woman\u2019s family for both physical and psychological harm in terms of being stalked, threatened, and physically attacked by them. I also find that the claimants have credibly established that the associated claimants faced an attempted sexual assault outside the temporary relief shelter where they were residing after the hurricane.\n\n[18] The principal claimant and the associated claimant, her sister, testified credibly as well about their experiences of past gender-based violence in Bahamas, and also about their personal experiences and their fears in returning to that country. I asked the claimants about their interview at the airport when they arrived given that they had only described their concerns for their well-being in being homeless and without government assistance after the hurricane and they did not refer to the targeted risk that they have alleged from CC and her family.\n\n[19] The claimants before me today provided credible and reasonable explanations for this omission in that at the airport they did not mention the risks that they faced from CC and her family given that they had just arrived after a major disaster where they had lost everything and that was only 17 days prior to them arriving at the airport in Canada. And speaking about gender-based violence was not something that came naturally to them based on the culture in which they were raised. These topics were not discussed openly as there was a fear of being blamed as the victim as well as internalized shame, and that to bring up issues of attempted sexual assault with an airport immigration officer would not have been something that they could\u2019ve done based on their own personal circumstances and the culture that they came from.\n\n[20] Therefore I find that based on this explanation and the objective country conditions evidence before me about the treatment of women and girls in Bahamas society and specifically the attitudes that exist in that country towards gender-based violence, I accept these explanations for this omission as credible and reasonable.\n\n[21] I also find that the claimants have credibly established on a balance of probabilities the threats of physical violence from CC and her family, that this remains and is a continuing motivation for CC to harm them in Nassau, Bahamas. I\u2019ll note that the claimants provided some corroborating documentation, a copy of a birth certification of the principal claimant\u2019s former boyfriend showing that he is married to CC.\n\n[22] The principal claimant testified credibly about how she obtained this document from her son in Bahamas who was able to get it from the registry office and take a photo of it and send it to her. Also provided is a letter from a lawyer in Bahamas who indicates that he made a request on the claimant\u2019s behalf for documents from the police in Bahamas about the principal claimant\u2019s complaint against CC and this request was made at the end of August 2021.\n\n[23] The principal claimant testified that no response had been received from the police and that this lawyer had told her that he followed up with the police three or four times but was not able to get anything from the police in writing. Also provided were letters with photo ID attached to them from the principal claimant\u2019s and the associated claimant\u2019s, her sister\u2019s brother, and the principal claimant\u2019s son, which corroborate their first-hand knowledge of some of the experiences in Nassau when the claimants were residing with the brother and that the incidents that had happened based on the son and the brother being with the claimants at the time.\n\n[24] For example, the brother of the principal claimant and the associated sister claimant speaks of his car being vandalized when the claimants came to reside with him in Nassau after the hurricane and that the claimants were also facing physical harm at the time that they were living with him, and it was due to fearing for the safety of his own family that he asked the claimants to leave to stay at the relief shelter in Nassau and drop them off there. I note that these letters are not near recitations of the Basis of Claim form information, rather they appear to have details that are outside the four corners of the Basis of Claim narrative and forms, and that they are written from first hand knowledge of these family members. I find them to be credible evidence.\n\n[25] I\u2019ll note that the information in these documents are also consistent with the allegations that the claimants have made in their amended Basis of Claim form narratives and as noted the claimants have reasonably testified and provided clarification in responses to my questions about certain aspects of this corroborating documentation. I therefore find that the claimants have credibly established the core allegations of their claims.\n\n[26] Moving to the issue of the well-foundedness of the claim. I find that the claimants have established that their claims are well-founded subjectively. The claimants left Bahamas very soon after the associated claimants were attacked and almost sexually assaulted on September 14th. They also made their claims at the airport and Canada upon their arrival. Therefore I find that the claimants have a genuine subjective fear of persecution.\n\n[27] With respect to the objective basis of their fear of persecution. I find that there is a well-founded objective basis for the claimants fear of gender-based violence targeting them as women who will be internally displaced and single without savings if they were to return to Bahamas, and also that the objective evidence supports that targeted violence is a concern in Bahamas and this is with respect to the principal claimant\u2019s, or rather all the claimants fears of CC and her family.\n\n[28] The National Documentation Package for the Bahamas, Exhibit 3, and Counsel\u2019s country conditions evidence, this is Exhibit 6 and 7, these sources in these documents note the high rate of gender-based violence as well as domestic violence in the country. Sources note that there is a high prevalence of violence against women in the Bahamas.\n\n[29] For example, item 5.8 it indicates that Bahamas has the highest number of rape cases reported throughout the Caribbean in spite of the fact that a small percentage of survivors actually report incidents of rape to the police. Therefore the numbers may not necessarily reflect the actual rate of those impacted. Item 5.5 is a UN report from 2018 and it notes that the Bahamas Crisis Centre describes domestic violence in the country as an epidemic on the island and that due to the over riding attitude that it is seen as a private matter, there are low levels of reporting of domestic violence.\n\n[30] In 5.3 is another UN report and this report confirms that violence against women in the Caribbean is widespread and normalized. Patriarchal attitudes and deep-rooted stereotypes regarding the roles in Bahamian families continue and that this perpetuates the normalization of violence against women. This normalization of violence against women leads to under reporting as well as the stigmatization of victims who do come forward. Gender based violence is directed at women because they are women and includes acts that include physical, mental, and sexual harm. This is also included in the item 5.3 UN report.\n\n[31] In Bahamas I\u2019ll also note that violence against women and girls is evident in not just in the home but also in the community and work place. This is found in item 5.3. I will also note that the United States Department of State report at item 2.1 notes that violence against women in the Bahamas has worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic and that this is due in part to lockdowns and curfews that have prevented victims from seeking assistance. I\u2019ll also just note that the causes of the high prevalence of gender-based violence is also noted in another UN report, which is the report of the special repertoire on violence against women from 2018, and this is item 5.7. It notes that despite Bahamas being what can be considered one of the wealthiest Caribbean countries, there is this dichotomy that in reality violence against women in the Bahamas is deeply rooted in existing patriarchal attitudes and persisting gender stereotypes. It is embedded in sex and gender-based laws, customs and practices that discriminate against women. It describes violence against women as being widespread in the Bahamas and largely perceived as a private matter and it is accepted as normal.\n\n[32] Now turning to the issue of state protection. I find that the claimants have rebutted the presumption of state protection with clear and convincing evidence, and that state protection is not available to them from gender-based violence.\n\n[33] I will note for example item 5.8 indicates that there is no stand alone legislation that explicitly addresses violence against women in Bahamas however, it can be addressed under the Domestic Violence Act, Protection Orders Act, and in this piece of legislation it is noted that protection orders are available when there are certain forms of violence against a spouse, partner, child, any other person who is a member of the household or a dependent, and that such conduct it is limited to conduct which takes place in the home. I do note that in the particular circumstances of this claim the agent of persecution is the principal claimant\u2019s child\u2019s father\u2019s current wife and her family, and they do not appear to meet this definition.\n\n[34] Moreover, they have been threatened outside any kind of joint family that they would\u2019ve shared with the perpetrator. They in fact do not live with the principal claimant\u2019s former boyfriend or his wife. I therefore find that even the legislation related to protection orders in Bahamas for victims in domestic violence situations would, on a balance of probabilities, not extend to these particular claimants in their situation. I note that this is in addition to the ineffective enforcement of laws as they relate to violence against women in the Bahamas.\n\n[35] For example at page 5 of that same report at item 5.8, barriers faced by those who report cases of sexual violence and other situations of violence against women include discriminatory attitudes towards women and girls from law enforcement officials due to a culture of disbelief, victim blaming, as well as low conviction rates. The large number of cases that remain unsolved and or perpetrators never being identified.\n\n[36] I also note that there are concerns noted in all of the UN documents I previously noted with respect to how the state goes about attempting to respond to the issue of violence against women in the Bahamas, and that while in some situations the police response may be effective, I find that for these particular claimants given their particular circumstances, I accept that state protection would not be adequate for them. Their own experiences were that when they went to report the threats and acts of violence against them they were either not assisted in the sense that for example one time the police came down to take the report, that\u2019s when the principal claimant\u2019s brothers cars were vandalized.\n\n[37] Another time the principal claimant was told that were no police vehicles available and they could not come, and another time the police officer who they were speaking with told the principal claimant that the police could not help her given that one of CC\u2019s cousin was the sergeant and that there was nothing there were going to be able to do to help her.\n\n[38] The claimants also described not receiving any adequate assistance from the National Emergency Management Agency, NEMA, which was the agency that was taking care of the disaster relief in Bahamas after the hurricane. They went to report the attack and attempted sexual assault by the associated claimants to this agency and this occurred outside of the relief shelter where they were staying when the associated claimants went to use the washroom. The claimants described that they were not able to describe what had happened to them in any kind of private manner to the agency that was running the shelter, and that in fact in their Basis of Claim forms they describe the normalization of gender-based violence in Bahamas through their experience of hospital staff saying that they were not the only ones being molested at the relief shelter that was set up in the wake of the hurricane.\n\n[39] I also note there is a source before me, item 5.7, that even before Hurricane Dorian in 2019, the lack of shelters and services for women fearing violence in Bahamas was noted as a concern. For example in this source it notes at paragraph 58 that there were only three shelters for victims of domestic violence in operation at that point, and once again this is before the hurricane. It notes that even in Nassau the options are sparse and that even the shelters that do exist, it\u2019s not clear that women would qualify for them given that one has only three bedrooms and the last one is selective as to which individuals it will assist.\n\n[40] It does also note in this same source that the community in Bahamas is small and interconnected and that the provision of safe and confidential places where women victims can be protected is highly needed. Even where there are shelters they do not always have space readily available for women victims. I will note as well once again this was before the devastation of the hurricane. Based on all of the objective country conditions evidence before me therefore, and the claimants personal experiences as they testified to and in their Basis of Claim forms, I find that state protection would not be adequate to them if they were to return to Bahamas.\n\n[41] Finally I\u2019ve considered whether there is a viable Internal Flight Alternative for the claimants. I proposed the possibility of the claimants relocating to Freeport on Grand Bahamas Island. Based on the evidence before me, I find that they do not have a viable IFA and that the IFA test fails for them on the second prong. I find that the claimants fearing CC and CC\u2019s family appears to be connected to CC\u2019s motivation that the principal claimant and the associated claimant, XXXX, were somehow trying to have a relationship with CC\u2019s husband. The demand of CC and her relatives was that the claimants leave Nassau.\n\n[42] The principal claimant acknowledged that during the many years she lived in Abaco Island, CC did not cause her problems. The principal claimant testified that she did not believe that they would be safe from CC and her family in Freeport because she believes that CC has family everywhere including in Freeport. She testified that CC did not grow up in Nassau. She is from another island called Eleuthera. I do not find however that the evidence establishes that the claimants would face an ongoing risk from CC and CC\u2019s family in Freeport.\n\n[43] I find that the principal claimant\u2019s belief that she and the other claimants would be harmed in Freeport by CC or one of CC\u2019s family members is speculative as I do not see that the evidence establishes that CC would have the motive to have her family seek the claimants out in Freeport. CC\u2019s goal appears to have been to make the claimants leave Nassau and to not be around her husband.\n\n[44] Now as I indicated, or as is well known, the IFA test consists of two prongs. While the claimants have not established, and both prongs of that test must be satisfied in order for there to be a viable IFA, I find that the claimants have established that the second prong of the test it is met in the sense that relocating to Freeport would be unduly harsh for them given their personal circumstances. As noted, they are single women. The principal claimant is 58 years old and the mother to the 18-year-old claimant.\n\n[45] The other associated claimant is the principal claimant\u2019s 47-year-old sister. The principal claimant and her sister, the associated claimant, described facing various forms of gender-based violence in their past and that this was something that they could not talk about openly as society tended to blame victims who reported this abuse. It was also seen as something as normal and which was accepted.\n\n[46] The principal claimant expressed a fear that as internally displaced women with no home to go to, with no one at all that they know in Freeport, with no savings, and that in this situation they would be very vulnerable to gender-based violence if they were to relocate there. They also indicated both the principal claimant and associated claimant that finding employment would be very difficult for them and that while they did not have familiarity with Freeport itself given that the principal claimant and her sister had only visited there very briefly for one day each many years ago, they were able to testify about the destruction of the island of Abaco after the hurricane, and how people still do not have electricity in any reliable way there. There is a lack of clean drinking water and that things are still destroyed. Property is still destroyed there. The infrastructure is lacking.\n\n[47] For example, the Abaco Airport may be working again but it is only with limited flights and a skeleton crew of workers. They believe that these sorts of things and conditions would be the ones that they would face also in Freeport on Grand Bahama Island. I find that given the objective country conditions evidence before me, that these concerns are made out and that the claimants relocating to Freeport would not be objectively reasonable for them. In other words, it would be unduly harsh for them given their personal circumstances.\n\n[48] The objective country conditions evidence before me notes that the destruction from the hurricane on Grand Bahama Island, and that\u2019s the island where Freeport is located, was similar to that on Abaco Island and therefore the claimants testimony with respect to their firsthand knowledge of the destruction on Abaco Island, I find is applicable to the situation on Grand Bahama. Some objective country condition sources compare the destruction on both Abaco and Grand Bahamas Islands as quite similar, with some other sources saying perhaps Abaco was slightly more damaged but nonetheless that Grand Bahama also faced a great deal of damage.\n\n[49] For example in Exhibit 6, this is Counsel\u2019s country conditions evidence at page 58, it is a source that is from a relief web source called The Facts, Hurricane Dorian\u2019s Devastating Effect on the Bahamas, and this is from August 15, 2020. So this was from one year after the hurricane. It notes that in addition to the loss of lives, 29,500 people were rendered homeless and or jobless by the hurricane. It was the strongest Atlantic hurricane on record and the strongest hurricane to have ever hit the Bahamas.\n\n[50] It notes that with the added crisis of COVID-19 and other hurricanes that come about, recovery efforts are still adapting to the new normal. It notes the great devastation that was noted on Abaco and Grand Bahama Islands immediately after the storm. It notes the main airport terminal on Grand Bahama Island was destroyed. Roads were littered with debris and downed trees and fuel supplies were limited. In Grand Bahama, satellite data suggested that 76 to 100 percent of buildings in some areas had been destroyed. Also it notes that 200 wells that provided clean water on Grand Bahama Island were contaminated with salt water due to the high storm surge and extensive flooding.\n\n[51] Today this article notes these, what are called aquifers, are still being restored and that Hurricane Dorian effected about 2,500 small and medium sized businesses in the Bahamas, that\u2019s overall, but in particular on the island of Grand Bahama, 50 percent of Freeport businesses and all businesses on the hardest hit east side of the island were forced to close. This article notes that on the one-year anniversary in the midst of the Coronavirus pandemic, rebuilding efforts were even still challenging. One relief worker is noted as saying that rebuilding efforts on the islands of Abaco and Grand Bahama are slow and in some areas haven\u2019t even started. Residents still do not have safe drinking water flowing through their pipes.\n\n[52] Also before me is an article in Exhibit 6 at page 55. This article is also from 2020 and it notes that the road to rebuilding following Hurricane Dorian will be long given that most personal property and key infrastructure were damaged and even though the Bahamian government implements progressive economic measures such as efforts at rebuilding, policy and economic response gaps remained. This article notes that the implementation of government initiatives to increase employment on the disrupted islands is nescient.\n\n[53] And finally I will note another article in Counsel\u2019s country conditions package and while it refers to the Abaco Islands, it is a more recent article from May 10, 2021. It\u2019s at page 50. It\u2019s from NBC Miami and it is entitled Dorian\u2019s Destruction, Abaco Still Recovering Two Years After the Hurricane. So this is an article that is addressing the situation two years after the hurricane from 2021. It notes that there is still a great deal of work to do.\n\n[54] The individuals on the ground from the Bahamas disaster reconstruction authority indicates that they are still very much in the reconstruction phase and trying to bring back Abaco. It also notes the impact the COVID-19 had on the recovery and rebuilding efforts. It indicates that once the pandemic began, the groups that were helping rebuild left the islands and recovery came to a halt. All the NGO\u2019s that had been there, that\u2019s non-government organizations, all the aid groups they were here and they had to leave. So a lot of the reconstruction and rebuilding stopped dead in the water.\n\n[55] So therefore I find that based on this country conditions evidence, it is indicative that the living conditions that the claimants would be returning to in Grand Bahama Island are likely such that finding suitable accommodation would be a tremendous challenge and would be, even if anything was available, it is likely to be extremely costly given that issues with basic infrastructure and that includes things like clean running water, as well as the rebuilding of businesses and the economy are still in its early stages of rebuilding and likely such search for accommodation would be extremely difficult for them.\n\n[56] I also note that given their personal circumstances as women not having savings, that this will be a particularly unduly harsh for them. I also note with respect to employment, just some of the statistics with respect to Bahamas, even before Hurricane Dorian, the CEDAW (ph) report from 2017, and this is at item 5.4, notes that the unemployment rate for women in the Bahamas was 17 percent and that was in comparison to, for men it was 12 percent.\n\n[57] Another report at item 5.5 notes that, and this is another UN CEDAW report, the disproportionally high unemployment rate among women not withstanding their higher level of educational attainment was a concern, as well as was a concern the concentration of women in low wage jobs in formal sectors.\n\n[58] And finally, I note for the younger claimant who is 18 years old, the unemployment rate for youth as noted in item 1.2, and once again this is before Hurricane Dorian, it notes that for unemployed youth, for women who are in the age group of 15 to 24 years of age, and this is based on 2016 statistics, the unemployment rate was 31.6 percent.\n\n[59] I therefore find that the overall unemployment rate of 10 percent as noted in the CIA World Fact Book which of course is pre-hurricane and pre-pandemic, that peeling that back and looking at the particular statistics as they apply to women indicates, and particularly female youth, that the unemployment rate in Bahamas is quite high and that this would have a particular impact on these claimants given their personal circumstances as women.\n\n[60] And finally, item 7.8 is a report from March 2021 from the US Department of State on narcotics control strategy, and it notes the dramatic increase of the overall unemployment rate that is attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic in the Bahamas, and it notes that the pandemic induced unemployment rate increased from an estimated ten percent to 40 percent. So that is a great jump as well, and once again that is a statistic that is for the overall employment rate and is not addressing the unemployment rate rather for women in particular.\n\n[61] I therefore find that when I consider all of this country conditions evidence and apply it to the claimants personal circumstances as women who would be returning without savings to a devastated economy, an island, that it would be unduly harsh for them in terms of finding employment, and as I\u2019ve already noted in terms of finding a place to live as well. I therefore find that Internal Flight Alternative fails for them on the second branch of the test.\n\n[62] I will also note that the country conditions patriarchal attitudes toward gender-based violence as well as the inadequate police response towards such violence against women, that it is not noted as being concentrated only in one area of the country, these are prevalent throughout the entire country. So these particular claimants would also be facing such concerns in the IFA location that was proposed of Freeport. I also find that this contributes to the location of Freeport not being one that is objectively reasonable for these particular claimants based on their particular circumstances.\n\n[63] Therefore in conclusion, I do find the claimants to be Convention refugees pursuant to Section 96 of the Act and I therefore accept their claims.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

Robinson\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Kingsley I. Jesuorobo\nCountry: Cameroon\nRPD Number: TB9-32762\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2023-01023\nATIP Pages: N\/A\n\nDECISION\n\n[1] MEMBER: I have considered your testimony and the other evidence in this case, and I am ready to render my decision orally. These are the reasons for the decision in the claim of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, who claims to be a citizen of Cameroon and is claiming refugee protection pursuant to Sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n\nALLEGATIONS\n\n[2] Your allegations are found in your Basis of Claim form and narrative in Exhibit 2 and in the oral testimony heard today. In summary, you allege persecution in Cameroon at the hands of the Cameroonian government and society for your sexual orientation, which you described as being bisexual.\n\nDECISION\n\n[3] I find that you are a refugee pursuant to Section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, as there exists a serious possibility of persecution should you return to Cameroon on account of your membership in a particular social group, which is as a bisexual man.\n\nIdentity\n\n[4] I find that your identity as a national of Cameroon is established by the certified copy of your passport given in Exhibit 1.\n\nSubjective Fear\n\n[5] I do note that you originally entered Canada in 2013 on a study permit and that your claim was initiated in 2019. You testified that you were on a valid student\u2019s visa until 2017 but did not feel safe returning to Cameroon after this. You explained that you sought counsel and did make efforts to initiate an agency application after this. However, you did not complete this application.\n\n[6] You further explained in your testimony that you had experienced difficulty due to your background in opening up about your true self and did not learn about Canada\u2019s protections for LGBTQIA+ community members until a few months before you initiated a major claim.\n\n[7] So, this explanation does seem reasonable in your particular alleged circumstances and therefore does not raise significant concerns with respect to your subjective fear or your overall credibility.\n\nCredibility\n\n[8] I did find you to be a credible witness and therefore believe what you have alleged in support of your claim. You testified in a candid, forthright, and straightforward manner. And there were no relevant inconsistencies in your testimony or contradictions between your testimony and the other evidence before me.\n\n[9] You spoke naturally and spontaneously about your strict and religious upbringing in Cameroon. You explained that you felt you had to repress any attraction to the same-sex throughout your life because of this upbringing and wanting to distance yourself from any trouble that you saw other LGBTQIA+ persons experiencing in Cameroon. You also stated that you were concerned if you ever did open up to others in Cameroon that, it would have negative repercussions for your family. You also very credibly described what life is like in Cameroon, hiding from your sexual orientation and how there is no freedom to express yourself and your sexuality openly.\n\n[10] You also quite credibly described your experiences with the FrancoQueer Community and how it has taught you about being LGBTQIA+ in Canada and as well as assisting you in integrating into Canadian society.\n\n[11] You provided testimony about how your current same-sex relationship, which I found consistent and credible as well. I do note you were hesitant to provide any identifying details of your partner, but as you had explained, your partner was very concerned about privacy and did not wish to participate in this hearing. Regardless, you have provided some text message correspondence between you and this partner on both the Grindr app and in regular text messages. This does appear to show an ongoing relationship.\n\n[12] You also explained that although it is new to you, your partner identifies as female, and you are trying to learn to refer to your partner under their desired feminine pronouns now. You refer to your partner in both masculine and feminine pronouns at times during this hearing which is also consistent with what you have described. And the photograph is consistent with this as well, that is shown in the text message correspondence in Exhibit 6.\n\n[13] After further reviewing the personal disclosures in Exhibits 4 to 7, I have no reasons to doubt their authenticity. I do give weight, in particular, to the above-mentioned text and correspondence in establishing your sexual orientation and current relationship. I, therefore, find on a balance of probabilities that you do identify as bisexual and that you are in a non-heterosexual relationship.\n\n[14] I find your subjective fear has been established.\n\nObjective Basis\n\n[15] Given that there are no serious credibility issues with respect to your allegations, coupled with the documentary evidence, I do find you have established a prospective risk and well-founded fear of persecution in Cameroon. This risk is corroborated by the National Documentation Package, the NDP in Exhibit 3, as well as country documents in Exhibit 4.\n\n[16] Item 2.1 of the NDP indicates that consensual same-sex acts between adults is illegal and punishable by imprisonment and up to five (5) years and a fine in Cameroon. The constitution provides for equal rights for all citizens but does not prohibit discrimination against LGBTI persons in housing, employment, nationality, and access to government services such as healthcare. Discrimination in these areas is reported to have occurred and also in the private sector.\n\n[17] Item 6.1 notes that during a reform of the penal code adopted in 2016, laws penalizing same-sex sexual activity were reformed. Additionally, criminalized is \u201cThe sexual propositioning of an adult of the same-sex by means of electronic communication.\u201d This law effectively criminalizes any same-sex correspondence between consenting adults.\n\n[18] It is also noted in the same item that Cameroon does subject sexual minorities to arrest and prosecution, often merely on suspicion of stereotypes as evidence. Arrests are made arbitrarily and in violation of the criminal procedure code. And it is reported that Cameroon prosecutes people for consensual same-sex activity more aggressively than almost any other country in the world. And is the highest jailer of the LGBTQ+ community in Africa.\n\n[19] Item 2.1 reports that the security forces harassed persons based on their real or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity. And there are reports in instances where these persons are arrested, often family members will not support them or provide bail or fines for their release. The courts have also accepted guilty pleads under these conditions and allegations of confessions given under threat and torture while in custody.\n\n[20] The same item notes that a high percentage of legal proceedings for same-sex relations have been marked by serious violations of human rights, including acts of torture, extorted confessions, denial of access to legal assistance as well as discriminatory treatment from law enforcement officers and judicial authorities.\n\n[21] Item 6.10 also confirms that this kind of activity is consistent and ongoing and that security forces have arbitrarily arrested, beaten, or threatened dozens of people for alleged consensual same-sex activity or gender nonconformity, since February 2021. It is reported by Human Rights Watch that this is part of an overall increase in police action against LGBTQIA+ persons in Cameroon.\n\n[22] The country documents in Exhibit 4 also corroborate the above and confirm this targeting as well as the police abuse and violence faced by LGBTQIA+ persons in society.\n\n[23] I, therefore, find your subjective fear has an objective basis.\n\nNature of the Harm\n\n[24] I have examined your claim under Section 96 of IRPA as I conclude the risk you describe constitutes persecution based on at least one (1) of the Grounds in Section 96. In this case, it is specifically your membership in a particular social group as a bisexual man. I find you are at risk of discrimination, harassment, arrest and detention, possible torture while in custody, as well as violence and possible death.\n\nState Protection\n\n[25] I find it would be objectively unreasonable for you to seek the protection of the state in light of your circumstances. Clearly noted in the NDP objective evidence that Cameroon actively prosecutes LGBTQIA+ persons for their same-sex activities and do so without due process. And so, the primary agent of persecution is the state itself.\n\nInternal Flight Alternative\n\n[26] I have also examined whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for you. Based on the evidence on file, I find that you face a serious possibility of persecution throughout the entirety of Cameroon. The laws condemning same-sex activities are consistent throughout the country, and the evidence also indicates that the anti-LGBTQ+ community and atmosphere is prevalent throughout the country.\n\n[27] I, therefore, find there is no internal flight alternative available to you.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[28] In light of the preceding, I conclude that you are a refugee pursuant to Section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. And accordingly, I accept your claim today.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

XXXX XXXX XXXX, the principal claimant and her children, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, the minor claimants, citizens of Nigeria, claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act or the IRPA. I have considered and applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9, proceedings before the IRB involving sexual orientation and gender identity and expression and sex characteristics as well as the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 4, women refugee claimants fearing gender related persecution. The principal claimant was the designated representative for the minor claimants. I heard the claims jointly pursuant to the refugee protection division rule 5 point \u2014 55. The names of all third parties have been redacted to their initials for privacy and safety reasons.\n\n[2] For the reasons given below, I find that you, the claimants, are Convention refugees because you have established a serious possibility of persecution in Nigeria on the basis of your membership in a particular social group, bisexual women and their children.\n\n[3] Your allegations are in summary. That as a bisexual woman, you face legal sanctions as well as harm from family members and people in your community, should you return to Nigeria. You also alleged that as the children of a bisexual woman, the minor claimants, or your children, would also face community disapproval and sanctions, should they return to Nigeria.\n\n[4] Your personal identities as citizens of Nigeria have been established by certified copies of your passports. I therefore find that you have established your identities on a balance of probabilities.\n\n[5] Given your allegations, your claims will be assessed pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA with the nexus being persons of a particular social group, bisexual women and their children.\n\n[6] Going to talk about credibility now. When a claimant swears that certain facts are true, this creates a presumption that they are true unless there is a valid reason to doubt their truthfulness. Hence, as a corollary, there is no general requirement for a claimant to corroborate sworn testimony that is uncontradicted and otherwise credible. In terms of your general credibility and in light of the evidence below, I have found you to be a credible witness and I therefore accept what you have alleged in your oral testimony and in your Basis of Claim form on both your own behalf and on behalf of the minor claimants. As the principal claimant, you provided detailed and credible evidence about your life in Nigeria as a bisexual woman. You described how you came from a traditional Christian family and grew up in an environment where same sex relationships were not mentioned.\n\n[7] You testified how at the age of 14, you met a slightly older female classmate in college and you \u2014 who you became close friends with and then entered into a romantic relationship with her. A relationship that left until you left school. You then testified about how you got married to your husband and how you had three (3) children together. You testified credibly about how you ultimately entered into a long-term relationship with a close female friend, E.O., who was somebody you met in church and who taught bible studies to your children. You detailed how you made every effort to keep this relationship a secret from your family and your community. However, you detailed how by 2019 September, your sister in-law, E.U., who was living with your family, accidentally discovered you and E.O. together. As you described it, your sister in-law operated under a type of traditional belief that made her believe that if she did not inform upon you to your husband and the rest of her family, some type of spiritual consequence where even death would befall your husband.\n\n[8] As you incredibly testified, when your husband and the rest of his extended family became aware of your sexual orientation, they demanded that you participate in a cleansing ritual, which you described as hazardous and demeaning. You testified credibly how you were frightened of this ritual, which you described as likely being physically dangerous to you and as well as not being in accordance with your spiritual beliefs as a Christian. You also testified about how your husband ostracized both you and your children as a result of his discovery of your sexual orientation and your refusal to undergo the cleansing ritual and how he treated you in an oppressive and demeaning manner. You described how when you refused to carry out your husband\u2019s family\u2019s demands, they made good on their threats to report you to the police. You detailed how even after you moved from your home city of Warri to Oyo with your children, which was at a distance of some eight (8) hours by car, they persisted in their demands. And at your husband\u2019s (inaudible), he received a phone call from a local police inspector demanding that you report to the police station on the grounds of a report that was made about your sexual orientation. And you described how you were threatened that you would be declared a wanted person unless you reported to the police. And you also described how fearful you were of the harm that would you befall upon you should you ever come in contact with the police given their oppressive practices.\n\n[9] You also spoke about the harm that you feared would befall your children, the minor claimants because they were the children of someone who is known to be bisexual. You detailed your fears of how they would be ostracized and possibly harmed by the family and the community on the basis of their connection to you and therefore, possibly imputed to be bisexual themselves and also subject to cleansing rituals or other dangers at the hands of your traditional community, in your husband\u2019s community. It is for this reason that you testified credibly that you brought them out of the country with you. It is for this reason too that you credibly explained that you did not seek to obtain the permission of your husband before you took them out of Nigeria given his position as an agent of persecution in his own right, As you stated in your affidavit to be found in Exhibit 5, involving your husband in your decision to leave Nigeria with the children, would effectively defeat the purpose of your claim for asylum because this would expose your plan to leave the country to your husband and provide your location to your husband, and therefore, bring you and your children into harm. And I accept all of this is as a credible reason for why you do not have written permission for your children to come with you to Canada.\n\n[10] You also testified credibly that your husband contacted you by telephone and made further threats against you after you left Nigeria. I therefore find that you have established the credibility of your allegation that your agents of persecution were members of your extended family, including your husband, the community as well as agents of the state who are the police. You also gave credible evidence of how as a complicating factor, your husband\u2019s other relationships also likely led you to XXXX XXXX XXXX. And you provided a number of corroborative documents that documented the medical and psychological challenges that you have faced and would likely continue to face as a result and how a return to Nigeria would pose challenges to your ongoing health and personal security. These documents are to be found in Exhibit 6 and 7 and they include detailed letters from professionals at the hassle-free clinic, the Black Coalition for AIDS Prevention and two (2) medical doctors in Canada. You also testified about how shortly you \u2014 before you left Nigeria, news of your XXXX XXXX became disclosed within your community, leading to you and your children to become stigmatized and ostracized. I wish to acknowledge the intersectionality of your status as a woman, a bisexual woman, and a person XXXX XXXX and the additional personal challenges that you would likely face as result should you return to Nigeria.\n\n[11] And from a medical standpoint alone, there is objective evidence contained in the latest National Documentation Package that outlines some of the difficulties that a person in your circumstances would likely face. And these are to be found for example, at Items 1.9 and 2.2. By way of corroboration of what occurred in Nigeria, you provided a detailed letter from your sister, A.J., who testified quite credibly was the only family member or even person in Nigeria who you were able to still be in contact with and could be trusted not to harm you or to betray your confidences. Your sister confirmed how you were treated by your husband\u2019s family. And she also described how she feared that you will continue to be threatened by your husband if you come back to Nigeria. She also detailed how your husband has been continuing to \u201cmonitor your movement everywhere.\u201d And we will also inform the police and the traditional elders if you come back to Nigeria. This letter which was written last night \u2014 last month is to be found at page 4 of Exhibit 6. And I found it to be corroborative of your allegations as well as of the ongoing possibility of persecution that you face in Nigeria.\n\n[12] Taking into account the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9, I also found that the corroborative evidence that you provided was sufficient. You also gave credible testimony about your life as a bisexual woman in Canada. By way of corroboration, you provided a letter confirming your participation at the LGBTQ positive Metropolitan Community Church as well as in the Black Coalition for AIDS Prevention and you described credibly your involvement in a support group for women XXXX XXXX XXXX. You provided photos of online meetings that you participated in the Metropolitan Community Church as well. So, letters and photos from these various organizations are to be found in Exhibit 6. Although you did not come to Canada directly, but first went to the United States, I found that you only stayed there for about two (2) weeks, and I do not find that your credibility on the matter of your subjective fear of persecution has been undermined as a result of your short stay in the United States or your failure to claim asylum in the United States.\n\n[13] You testified credibly that it was faster and easier to leave Nigeria on the basis of pre-existing travel visas to the United States that you had obtained for a trip that you planned for yourself and your children prior to your sexual orientation being disclosed and which your husband was not in any event, planning to go with you on because of work commitments. You also described how the information that you obtained about the asylum process in the United States made you fear that you would be unsuccessful and that you could be deported back to Nigeria. All in all, I find that this credible evidence has established your personal profile as a bisexual woman and by extension, your minor claimants \u2014 the minor claimants\u2019 profiles as children of a bisexual woman. I therefore find that you have established a subjective fear of persecution on the basis of your membership in a particular social group that is bisexual women and their children.\n\n[14] I am now going to talk about objective evidence and all the citations are to be found in the National Documentation Package for Nigeria, cited in Exhibit 3. And this is the April 29th, 2022, version. The objective country evidence supports your allegations of bisexual people and the family members of bisexual people are at a serious risk of persecution by the state, which criminalizes same sex relationships as well as by society in general, which is not accepting of same sex relationships in Nigeria and considers them to be alien to traditional African culture. This is from Item 6.12, page 25. Because same sex acts are criminalized in Nigeria, pursuant to the Nigerian Federal Criminal Code, anyone having physical relations with a member of the same sex is considered to be acting against the order of nature and is to be committing an unnatural offence and is subject to a 14-year prison term.\n\n[15] The same sex marriage prohibitions act also criminalizes same sex marriages and civil unions as well as gay clubs, gay organizations, meetings of gay people and the support of LGBTQ organizations. For example, anyone who supports or participates in a pro LGBTQ organization is liable to a 10-year prison term. This is from Item 1.4, page 46. As a result of this law, Human Rights Watch has observed that the law has created opportunities for people to engage in homophobic violence without fear of legal consequences contributing significantly to a climate of impunity for crimes against LGBTQ people. This is from Item 1.13, page 123. Nigerian society has also been documented to be generally hostile to LGBTQ persons. According to an international study, societal perceptions of homosexuality are founded on opinions that homosexuality is unnatural, sinful, and an abomination. Additionally, the main religions in Nigeria which are Christianity and Islam have both been documented to be opposed to same sex relations and activities. And this is from Item 1.3, page 124.\n\n[16] According to an International observer, it is not possible to live openly as a sexual minority in any area of Nigeria. Not even in big urban areas like Lagos, Port Harcourt or Abuja. When sexual minorities live in urban areas, they are still required to live in the closet and behave in a clandestine manner. This is Item 6.11, page 38. The family members of LGBTQ people also face stigma and discrimination. Objective observers have noted that family members of sexual minorities including spouses, parents, children and siblings can face ostracism, stigmatization and embarrassment from community members and other extended family members. Family members of sexual minorities can be cut off from their community and can be insulted and assaulted by community members. This is Item 6.11, page 144.\n\n[17] The LGBTQ are also known to be living in fear of community sponsored violence. Vigilante groups have been documented to set up \u2014 to be set up within communities to target LGBTQ people and attacks can be perpetrated by spontaneous mobs, particularly, when rumors begin to circulate that a couple was engaged in same sex relations. And this is from Item 6.1, page 2. And ritual cleansing practices are also known to take place in Nigeria and have been documented to involve violent and brutal practices. This is from Item 6.11, pages 28 to 29. Overall, I find that there is an objective basis for your subjective fear of persecution on the grounds of being members of a particular social group. That is bisexual women and their children. Therefore, I find that there is a well-founded fear of persecution.\n\n[18] In light of the country evidence above, I find that adequate state protection would not be available to the claimants, especially, because the state is in many respects, an agent of persecution in its own right, particularly, through the state institution of the police and evidence of the police treatment of LGBTQ people as documented in Item 1.22, in particular, paragraph 4.2. And there is also documented evidence of how a culture of impunity has arisen in Nigeria when it comes to acts of violence against LGBTQ people as well as discriminatory laws. And this is from Item 6.11, page 39. As such, I find that the objective evidence demonstrates that adequate state protection is not available to members of the particular social group that you are part of. The presumption of state protection has therefore been rebutted.\n\n[19] In terms of internal flight alternative, because I find that an agent of persecution is the state by way of sexual minorities being criminalized and because I find that there is evidence to support the fact that the state officially condones social violence against sexual minorities, I find that there is, on a balance of probabilities, no place in Nigeria where you, the claimants, could reside safely. Therefore, there is no viable internal flight alternative throughout Nigeria for you, the claimants, in your particular circumstances.\n\n[20] In conclusion, based on the totality of the evidence, I find that you will face a serious possibility of persecution pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA, should you return to Nigeria. Your claims for protection are therefore accepted.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

The police required the claimant to locate his friend, and when he could not, they extrajudicially detained and severely beat him. They took his photograph, fingerprints and signature. After releasing him, the police told the claimant that he needed to stay in the area, but he fled to Canada. The police have been searching for the claimant since.\n\nDecision\n\n[3] The claimant alleges, that should he return to India, the police will discover his presence and resume persecuting him with threats, extrajudicial detentions and beatings. Given that I find below that there are no serious credibility issues with respect to the allegations, coupled with the documentary evidence set out below, I find that the claimant is a convention refugee, pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA, as there exists a serious possibility of persecution, should he return to India, on account of his imputed political opinion. My reasons follow. There is no need for me to determine whether the claimant is a person in need of protection, pursuant to section 97(1)(b) of the IRPA.\n\nDeterminative issues\n\n[4] The determinative issues in this case are credibility, state protection, and internal flight alternative (IFA).\n\nIdentity\n\n[5] I find that the claimant\u2019s identity as a national of India is established by the claimant\u2019s Passport and Aadhaar card seized by Citizenship and Immigration Canada officials when he made his claim.\n\nCredibility and Subjective Fear\n\n[6] The claimant described in his Basis of Claim (BOC), and in his testimony at the hearing, events that led to his flight to Canada. The claimant is from the district of Nawanshahr in Punjab. While attending college in XXXX in that district, he befriended a fellow student who is from Chandigarh. The claimant and his friend stayed in touch after college, and the claimant was aware that his friend started to support the Shiromani Akali Dal (\u201cSAD\u201d) party.\n\n[7] The claimant\u2019s evidence is that during the December 2017 elections, the claimant\u2019s brother XXXX for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The claimant\u2019s friend happened to visit the claimant during the campaign, and helped the claimant campaign for the claimant\u2019s brother, staying with the claimant. According to Item 4.9 of the National Documentation Package (\u201cNDP\u201d)[1], the BJP and the SAD were campaigning together in 2017 in Punjab\u2019s state assembly elections, but the Indian National Congress won. In the election, the claimant\u2019 s brother XXXX the Congress Party.\n\n[8] The claimant\u2019s evidence is that after the election, the claimant\u2019s friend decided to stay in Nawanshahr to work for the SAD (Mann) party. In XXXX 2018, the claimant co-signed for him to rent an apartment from someone the claimant had met in his shop. The landlord took photocopies of the claimant\u2019 s identity information, and gave the claimant a set of keys for the apartment. The claimant neither lived in the apartment, nor did he pay rent.\n\n[9] The claimant\u2019 s evidence is that on XXXX, 2018, the police attended the claimant\u2019s shop, and questioned him about his friend. They had already attended his friend\u2019 s apartment, but the friend was not at home, and the landlord had told the police that the claimant was a co-signor.\nThe police asked the claimant to telephone his friend, but the friend\u2019s telephone was switched off.\n\n[10] The claimant\u2019s evidence is that the police then took him to his friend\u2019s apartment, and took the claimant\u2019 s keys to enter while the claimant remained outside. The officers came out of the apartment with the friend\u2019s computer equipment and discs that they confiscated because they found records of the friend giving speeches in favour of Khalistan, and criticizing the government and the police for atrocities on minorities, particularly Sikhs. The claimant told the police that he had no knowledge of his friend\u2019s political activities, and had not participated in such activities, but he agreed to find his friend for the police.\n\n[11] According to the NDP\u2019s Item 4.4[2], \u201cSAD (Mann)\u201d is the name used interchangeably with the \u201cSAD (A)\u201d, and it is the party that is a faction of SAD that holds itself out to revolutionary. SAD (A) came into being after the government raided the Golden Temple in 1984, killing Sikh militants who sought independence for Punjab. The objective of the SAD (A) is the creation of a separate Sikh country, called Khalistan. While the SAD(A), as a party with legal status, is generally non-violent, it had members who sympathized with armed Sikh separatists. The police monitor individuals who support or advocate for Khalistan, and they are often included on police lists, and charged in terrorism-related cases, which can result in being detained for years before being released due to lack of evidence.\n\n[12] The claimant\u2019s evidence is that by XXXX, 2018, he was unable to locate his friend, and the police brought him to the police station where they took his photograph, his fingerprints and signature. During the night, they interrogated and brutally beat the claimant who they believed maintained links with his friend, and supported his friend\u2019s anti-government activities. The police maintained that all SAD (Mann) supporters are separatists involved with the Khalistani movement.\n\n[13] The claimant\u2019s evidence is that the next day, XXXX, 2018, the police released him to his father, but the police told him that he would need to find his friend, and to return to the police station in the future when directed to do so. He couldn\u2019t walk, and his father took him to a hospital where he was treated for multiple injuries.\n\n[14] The claimant\u2019s evidence is that the police called the claimant soon after to check whether he had made progress in finding his friend. The police warned that if he tried to move to another state, he would be located and arrested. The claimant tried again to locate his friend in various ways, but he gave up hope that he could do so. He received legal advice that if he could not assist the police, then he should leave.\n\n[15] The claimant\u2019s evidence is that he travelled to Delhi the first week of XXXX, where he hid while living with another friend who encouraged the claimant to leave India. The claimant retained an agent. The agent obtained a visa for the claimant in XXXX 2019. Out of concern that the claimant\u2019s exit could be blocked because the Punjab police would be looking for him, the agent arranged for someone at the airport to ensure that the claimant would succeed in boarding a plane at the Delhi airport.\n\n[16] According to Item 14.9 of the NDP[3], it is unlikely that the claimant would have been prevented from departing at the airport given that there is no direct information sharing between police and airport officials other than in exceptional cases, but the NDP confirms that the claimant would have to fill out a departure card with contact information, and airport authorities do some screening for departing passengers. I find that it is reasonable that the claimant wanted extra safeguards from the agent in departing from the airport.\n\n[17] The claimant arrived in Canada on XXXX 2019, but delayed over four months before claiming refugee protection. The claimant testified that when he fled from India to Canada, his objective was to escape India and flee to safety. He didn\u2019t know that he could claim refugee status in Canada. His friends with whom he lived in Brampton, after arriving in Canada, helped him to learn about his right to claim refugee status, and assisted him in moving to Montreal where, in XXXX he retained counsel to make his claim. I find that this explanation for the delay in Canada in making a claim is reasonable in his alleged circumstances. He had no idea in India of the possibility of making a refugee claim, and only learned about the process once safe in Canada. I also note that the claimant said that he was depressed while hiding in Delhi after his detention and beating in Punjab. The delay does not raise significant concerns for me with respect to subjective fear or credibility.\n\n[18] The claimant\u2019s evidence is that since arriving in Canada, he has been told by his father that the police continue to enquire about his whereabouts, threatening to charge the claimant if his friend cannot be found. The claimant testified that the police had visited his family looking for him as recently as XXXX, 2021.\n\n[19] I find the claimant to be a credible witness and therefore believe what he alleges in support of his claim. He testified in a straightforward manner, and there were no relevant inconsistencies within his testimony or contradictions between his testimony and the documents he filed. When I asked about parts of his narrative attached to his BOC, the claimant provided details of what he himself had witnessed, without embellishment. Also, he did not hesitate in indicating when he had not personally witnessed something, but believed it to be true because the information was given to him by someone else. For example, he described in detail the day he was taken by police officers to his friend\u2019s apartment for which he had co-signed. He witnessed two of the police officers entering the apartment, having been told to wait outside with other police, and he witnessed later the two officers exiting with his friend\u2019s confiscated computer and records. The police told him what they found and viewed, and I, like the claimant, can see no reason why the police would have lied about that given the context of that day.\n\n[20] The documentary evidence filed by the claimant[4] supports the allegations as set out above. After reviewing the documents, I have no reasons to doubt their authenticity: 1) the portrait of his college class of 2010-2011 corroborates the claimant\u2019 s description of attending college with his friend; 2) the sworn statements by the claimant\u2019s father and brother corroborate the relationship that the claimant had with his friend, the friend\u2019s assistance in the claimant\u2019s brother\u2019s campaign, and the friend\u2019s support of the SAD (Mann); 3) the police beating was corroborated by his father\u2019s statement, and by a medical document from a hospital where he stayed for three days after being released from the police station; 4) the letter from a lawyer confirms that he advised the claimant to move away because the police would continued to target him as long as they were unable to locate his friend; and 5) the ongoing inquiries by the police are corroborated by the claimant\u2019 s father\u2019 s sworn statement.\n\n[21] When a claimant swears to the truth of certain allegations, this creates a presumption that those allegations are true unless there is reason to doubt their truthfulness. (Maldonado [1980]\n2.F.C. 302 (C.A.)) Given this presumption and the lack of relevant inconsistencies in the evidence provided by the claimant, I find, on a balance of probabilities, that 1) the claimant had a friend from college who was a member of the SAD (Mann) party; 2) the claimant entered into a rental agreement as a co-signor for the friend\u2019s apartment, and 3) the friend was wanted by the Punjab police who found evidence in the apartment of the friend\u2019s pro-Khalistan, anti-government advocacy; 4) the Punjab police believed that the friend was operating in an illegal and anti-government movement, and that the claimant was also involved; 5) the police directed the claimant to locate his friend, 6) when the claimant was unsuccessful, the police detained and beat the claimant in the police station, trying to force the claimant to reveal information about the claimant\u2019s and his friend\u2019s anti-government activities and his friend\u2019s whereabouts; 7) the police threatened the claimant with more violence if he did not continue to assist in locating his friend; and 8) the police continue to inquire about the whereabouts of the claimant, as recently as\nXXXX, 2021, and have told his father that the claimant may be charged with the same offences as his friend.\n\n[22] Finally, I find that the claimant fled from Punjab, hid in Delhi and escaped to Canada to avoid being apprehended by the police who continue to look for him there.\n\n[23] I find that the claimant has established his subjective fear of the police.\n\nNexus and Objective Fear Established\n\n[24] The evidence demonstrates that the Punjab police are targeting the claimant because they perceive the claimant to be a sympathizer with the anti-government, Khalistan movement. The reasons for this perception are that the police learned from the friend\u2019s landlord that the claimant was a co-signor of the friend\u2019s apartment, and that the claimant was closely associated with his friend. Then the police found files and recordings in his friend\u2019s apartment which confirmed that his friend is an anti-government activist and a supporter of the Khalistan movement. I note that the police found no direct proof that the claimant himself was actively campaigning for the Khalistan movement or involved in anti-government activities, as they found for the friend, but there was circumstantial evidence, particularly the claimant being a co-signor and having keys to the apartment where the police found the anti-government materials. The police threatened to arrest the claimant unless he located his friend for them. On a balance of probabilities, I find that the police perceive the claimant as an anti-government, pro-Khalistan sympathizer and supporter, because of his close association with his friend and because of his renting the apartment with his friend where the materials were found. I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the risk described by the claimant constitutes persecution based on imputed political opinion as prescribed in section 96 of the IRPA.\n\n[25] The claimant did not believe that his friend used any weapons, and, for that reason, he tried to convince the police during their interrogation of him that they were wrong to accuse his friend of illegal activities. I recognize that the claimant never alleged that the evidence the police found regarding his friend\u2019s activism demonstrated that his friend was promoting violence to attain a separate state for Punjab, but the objective documentary evidence makes clear that the police are known to impute a violent militancy on supporters of the Khalistan movement, even without proof that those accused persons are promoting anything beyond a legal, peaceful movement. Item 12.4 of the NDP[5] confirms that the police have historically monitored, detained and tortured Sikhs believed to be supporters of the Khalistan separatist movement, even when there exists no evidence of violent militancy. There has been a pattern of the police falsely charging Sikhs as \u201cdangerous terrorists\u201d to justify the illegitimate arrest of young Sikh men who are perceived as political opponents to the ruling state party. In 2019, the Indian Parliament passed an amendment to the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act which allows authorities to designate individuals as terrorists and detain them for up to 180 days without charge,[6] a particularly useful tool when police exploit it to intimidate opponents of the ruling party.\n[26] According to a report in the NDP from the Asian Centre for Human Rights, police throughout India have extrajudicially detained, tortured and killed individuals, fabricating evidence of encounters that the police hope will discourage investigations. The report contains dozens of references to extrajudicial killings in Punjab state alone. The report also confirms that the police have been known to target those supporting a Sikh activist, like family members.[7] The NDP contains many more recent documents which confirm that extrajudicial police arrests, beatings and torture of detained persons, as well as encounter killings continue with impunity for the police involved.[8]\n\n[27] I find that the documentary country evidence described above establishes objective corroboration for the claimant\u2019s subjective fear of being targeted by the police because of his association and support for his friend, an activist in the Khalistan movement. I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant has a well-founded fear of persecution because of his imputed political opinion.\n\nState Protection\n\n[28] There is a presumption that states can protect their own citizens, but the agents of persecution in this case, the Punjab police, are part of the state. I therefore find that it would have been objectively unreasonable for the claimant to seek protection from the state in Punjab given his justified fear of the police there. As for seeking the protection of the government in a place in India outside of Punjab should the claimant return to India and relocate to an IFA, I find that it would also be unsafe for him to seek protection in states outside of Punjab. This is because police departments in each state are connected to each other, as discussed below, and thus the claimant would risk discovery by the Punjab police if he were to seek protection from police in any other state. The claimant has rebutted the presumption of state protection in Punjab, as well as in the rest of India.\n\nInternal flight alternative\n\n[29] Refugee protection is provided to claimants in Canada who face risks pursuant to section 96 or 97 of IRPA, upon return to their country of citizenship \u2013 risks for which there must be no reasonable safe harbour anywhere reasonable in that country.[9] At the commencement of the hearing, I identified Delhi and Mumbai as possible IFAs.\n\n[30] For a refugee claim to succeed, the claimant has the burden to establish that there is no viable IFA within their country of nationality. The test for an IFA was articulated by the Federal Court of Appeal in Rasaratnam.[10] For a claim to succeed, a claimant has the onus to satisfy the panel, on a balance of probabilities, that a proposed IFA:\n1) is not safe from a serious possibility of persecution, or likelihood of risk to life or cruel and unusual treatment; or\n2) is objectively unreasonable or unduly harsh in all the circumstances for the claimant to live there.\n\n[31] The claimant fears that even if he relocated to Delhi or Mumbai, or anywhere else in India, he would be found, detained and seriously harmed by the Punjab police because of his imputed political opinion as a Khalistani sympathizer, and because of his friend\u2019s proven history as a Khalistani, pro-separatist, anti-government activist. In this case, I find that the claimant has established that he faces a serious possibility of persecution anywhere in India, and therefore, there is no IFA for him. My reasoning follows.\n\nFirst Prong of the Test: Safety\n\n[32] Regarding the first prong of the test, the claimant has established, on a balance of probabilities, that the agents of harm, (the Punjab police), have both 1) the motive; and 2) the means to find and to persecute or harm him if he were to relocate in the proposed IFAs.\n\nMotive of the Agents of Harm to Search for Claimant\n\n[33] Regarding the question of whether the police have the motive to search for the claimant throughout India, it is important to bear in mind that a search would be electronic in nature, and not a scenario of officers and agents physically travelling the vast and densely populated country, hoping to find clues of the claimant\u2019s whereabouts. It is the claimant\u2019s position that if he were to return to India, he would continually need to provide his personal information to various authorities who routinely require verification of a person\u2019s trustworthiness in the context of renting housing, finding employment or using financial institutions. It would just be a matter of time, then, before the Punjab police would be alerted to the claimant\u2019s whereabouts by someone verifying the claimant\u2019s status through the national police database, the Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and Systems (CCTNS), a system that connects police stations across the country, integrating data.[11] The question about the Punjab police, then, is whether they had the motivation to place the claimant\u2019 s name and other particulars in the CCTNS.\n\n[34] The claimant was detained, threatened, intimidated and beaten by police who were trying to force the claimant to reveal information about his friend\u2019 s activities, and to reveal the whereabouts of his friend. The police had found proof in the apartment for which he was a co\u00ad signor that his friend was involved in the Khalistan movement, and, as I found above, they therefore believed the friend to be a Khalistani militant with the claimant having some role in his activities. Given that the allegations by the police against the claimant and his friend appear to involve allegations of terrorism, given that the claimant contravened the Punjab police\u2019s specific instructions and left the state, and given that the police have been looking for the claimant but have not been able to locate him, I find that it is more likely than not that the police have been motivated to place the claimant\u2019 s name in the CCTNS, indicating that he is a suspect and that his location is unknown. There have been decisions made by other members at the Refugee Protection Division, who have inferred from the lack of proof of a First Information Report (an \u201cFIR\u201d) in police records that a claimant would not be included in the CCTNS. I make no such adverse inference in this case because, according to the NDP, while the CCTNS contains 70 million records, only 25 million are FIRs, meaning that the majority of the records in the CCTNS are not FIRs.[12]\n\nMeans of the Agents of Harm to Locate Claimant\n\n[35] The NDP describes a tenant registration system that is mandatory[13] for landlords to use when renting to a new tenant. It is used in tandem with the CCTNS to check on the tenant\u2019s background, particularly to see if they have a criminal record or are a fugitive from another state.[14] The objective evidence indicates that it is not clear about how many landlords and police stations in India faithfully and effectively comply with using the tenant registration system. However, according to Item 14.8 of the NDP, it is an easy and accessible procedure either online or on paper form, whereby the landlord must input, amongst other things, the names, dates of birth and previous addresses of the persons to whom they rent. Also, not complying with the requirement to register can result in a police prosecution against a landlord.[15] On a balance of probabilities, then, I find that many landlords do comply.\n\n[36] The claimant\u2019s evidence is that he would need to rent housing in Delhi or Mumbai if he were to relocate there, and, in order to do so, would need to show his identity to any landlord. I find that it is likely that he would be expected to provide his Aadhaar card to the landlord from whom he rented upon arriving back in India, and to every landlord of every new rental unit subsequently. The NDP also indicates that 95% of adults in India have an Aadhaar card as a proof of identity.[16] The claimant presented both a passport and his Aadhaar card to Canadian authorities when he filed his claim. Visible on both documents are the claimant\u2019 s name, birth date, and address in Punjab.[17] Even if the claimant provided to a landlord another document to prove his identity, one that did not indicate his Punjab address or date of birth, the landlord would still require that information to complete the form, and the claimant would be required to reveal it. I find, therefore, that the information the new landlord would provide to police in the new location would reveal, if entered into the CCTNS, that the police in Punjab are searching for him.\n\n[37] In terms of the likelihood of the police in the new location taking the new landlord\u2019 s information on the claimant and inputting it into the CCTNS system, I find that it is very high, particularly given that the claimant\u2019s previous address is in Punjab, a state with a history of militancy as discussed above. According to a very recent RIR in the NDP, CCTNS is deployed in 95 percent of the police stations in the country, with connectivity available in 97 percent of the police stations. By the end of 2020, 81% of data from police stations across India was synced with CCTNS data on the same day as entered. The CCTNS is now the central repository on crime and criminals, with 91% of old data migrated to the platform.[18]\n\n[38] In conclusion, I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant\u2019s landlord in the claimant\u2019s new location would cause a search in the CCTNS to be made for the claimant\u2019s history. Having also found above that the Punjab police are more likely than not to have included the claimant\u2019s personal information on the CCTNS, I therefore find, on a balance of probabilities, that there is a serious risk that the claimant\u2019s new location would be disclosed to the Punjab police through the tenant registration system. Once the police in Punjab are advised of the claimant\u2019 s relocation, they are likely to want to have him returned to continue trying to get information from him on his friend and the Khalistan movement\u2019 s activities in their area. This establishes a serious possibility of persecution by the police anywhere in India based on an imputed political opinion.\n\nSecond Prong of the IFA Test: Reasonableness\n\n[39] Having found that the first prong of the test was met, namely, that an IFA would not be safe for the claimant, there is no need for me to consider the reasonableness of an IFA\n\nConclusion\n\n[40] In light of the preceding, I conclude that the claimant is a convention refugee, pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA. Accordingly, I accept his claim.\n\n(signed) Mary Truemner\n\nMay 2, 2022\n\n[1] Exhibit 3, Item 4.9, Response to Information Request (\u201cRIR\u201d) #IND106097.E, \u201cIndia: Treatment of political activists and members of opposition parties in Punjab; treatment of perceived supporters of Sikh militancy by authorities (2017-April 2018)\u201d, 14 June 2018.\n\n[2] Exhibit 3, Item 4.4, RIR # IND200258.E, \u201cThe Shiromani Akali Dai (Amritsar) (SAD(A)) [Shiromani Akali Dai (Mann); SAD(M); SAD(Amritsar); Shiromani Akali Dai (Amritsar) (Simranjit Singh Mann)], including origin, structure, leadership, objectives, and activities; requirements and procedures\u201d, 3 June 2020.\n\n[3] Exhibit 3, ltem14.9, RIR # IND200495.E, \u201cExit controls and security measures for Indian citizens leaving the country, including use of computerized identity verification; information sharing between police, security and airport officials, including access to the Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and Systems (CCTNS); travel restrictions placed upon persons of interest to authorities; instances where persons wanted by the police, including those with suspected ties to militants, were able to leave the country (2018-Febmary 2021)\u201d, 2 March 2021.\n\n[4] Exhibit 5.\n\n[5] Exhibit 3, Item 12.4, RlR # IND105132.E, \u201cTreatment of Sikhs in Punjab (2013-April 2015)\u201d, 12 May 2015.\n\n[6] Exhibit 3, Item 2.1, India: Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2020, United States, Department of State, 30 March 2021.\n\n[7] Exhibit 3, Item 10.8, \u201cThe State of Encounter Killings in India: Target, Detain, Torture, Execute,\u201d Asian Centre for Human Rights.

XXXX is the principal claimant and XXXX is the associate claimant.\n\nALLEGATIONS\n\n[2] The claimants allege that the principal claimant will be subject to persecution by police in India because he has been falsely accused of being a militant.\n\nDETERMINATION\n\n[3] I find that the claimants are persons in need of protection under section 96 of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).\n\nANALYSIS\n\nIdentity\n\n[4] The identity of the claimants is established by their testimony and identity documents including passports from India. The associate claimant confirmed that she has only one name \u2013 XXXX. She indicated that it is common in India for a person to have only one name. I note that her passport and other identity documents use only the one name.\n\nNexus\n\n[5] The claimants seek protection under section 96 because of a fear of persecution based on imputed political belief because the police have accused the principal claimant of being a militant or militant supporter and also because of his support for a Dalit family. In addition, they fear harm because of their association with the principal claimant\u2019 s father, a convicted murderer.\n\nCredibility\n\n[6] When a claimant swears that certain facts are true, this creates a presumption that they are true unless there is valid reason to doubt their veracity. The presumption of truthfulness may be rebutted by contradictions in the evidence presented by the claimant, which could establish a lack of credibility. Omissions and vagueness with regards to the claimant\u2019s allegations can also be determinative. The determination as to whether a claimant\u2019s evidence is credible is made on a balance of probabilities.[1]\n\n[7] The principal claimant testified that he had a difficult upbringing. His father was a drug dealer who is currently in prison serving a XXXX.\n\n[8] The principal claimant testified that he has had different encounters with the police. In XXXX 2016, the police came to the family home to arrest the principal claimant\u2019 s father for XXXX. His father was not at the home and the police arrested the principal claimant instead. He was released after a few days when his father was arrested.\n\n[9] In XXXX 2017, the principal claimant came to the aid of a Dalit boy who was being attacked by a group of militant Hindis. He supported the boy and his family, but the police alleged that the boy was a militant. The boy was able to escape and leave the country. The principal claimant testified that the police claimed that the boy had named the principal claimant as a person who was a militant supporter.\n\n[10] The principal claimant testified the police raided his house in XXXX 2017, searching for material to connect the principal claimant to militants. He was released after a few hours.\n\n[11] The claimants were married in XXXX 2017, and they were both arrested when they were on their honeymoon. This time he was accused of racketeering. The principal claimant was tortured, and the associate claimant was tortured and sexually assaulted and detained for a few hours. On both occasions, release from custody was arranged with the payment of a bribe. The principal claimant testified that he was required to report to the police three times in XXXX 2017 although he was only questioned and not detained.\n\n[12] The principal claimant testified that he was arrested again on XXXX, 2018. He was released on XXXX with the payment of a bribe. The principal claimant alleged that when he was in custody on this occasion, he was subjected to significant torture, including being forced under water.\n\n[13] The principal claimant emphasized that he was told by the police who interrogated him during the XXXX 2018 detention that he had been entered \u201cin the system\u201d because he matched the description of a known terrorist. He testified that the interrogation included questioning from police officers from a number of states including Jammu Kashmir, Pradesh, Haryana, and Rajasthan, as well as the local Punjab police. He explained that he could tell that the officers were from these states because of their uniforms and because they told him. He was interviewed sequentially by the different officers.\n\n[14] When he was released, the principal claimant was told that he must report monthly. He did this in XXXX and XXXX. After the release of the principal claimant on XXXX, 2018, the claimants found an agent who started the process of getting Canadian tourist visas. These were issued on XXXX, 2018, but they did not leave India until XXXX, 2018. The principal claimant testified that in the interim they were waiting to hear from the agent about when they could safely leave and this did not happen until XXXX. They stayed in the family home while waiting to hear from the agent. The principal claimant testified that when he did not report to the police in XXXX 2018, his brother was arrested. He was detained for two days until the principal claimant sent documentation proving that he was in Canada.\n\n[15] The principal claimant testified that since he left India, family members have told him that the police come by the family home every few months enquiring about the whereabouts of the claimants.\n\n[16] The principal claimant testified in a straightforward manner. I did not find any significant omissions or embellishments or other factors that would raise doubt about the truthfulness of the claimant\u2019 s testimony. His testimony was in accord with the Basis of Claim form narrative.\n\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution\n\n[17] In accepting the credibility of the principal claimant\u2019s testimony, I find that he has established a well-founded subjective fear of continuing persecution if he were to return to live in Punjab state. He has attracted the attention of the police in more than one way. He has been a suspect because of his father and his support for a Dalit boy accused of being a militant. He himself has been targeted as a militant supporter.\n\n[18] The principal claimant has been detained on a number of times and has been subjected to torture on some of these occasions. The associate claimant was also detained and was sexually assaulted. The police have continued to ask about the whereabouts of the claimant and detained the principal claimant\u2019 s brother until it was proved that the claimants were in Canada.\n\n[19] The documentary evidence in the national document package establishes that police misconduct, including failure to follow arrest procedures, torture, solicitation of bribery, and extortion, is rampant in India[2]. There is thus an objective basis for the claimant\u2019s fear of further persecution.\n\n[20] I conclude that the claimants have established a subjective well-founded fear of further persecution if they were to return to Punjab State.\n\nState protection\n\n[21] Since the agent of persecution is the Indian police, I find that state protection would not be available for the claimants.\n\nInternal Flight Alternative\n\n[22] The Federal Court, in Rasaratnam, established a two-prong test for assessing the viability of an internal flight alternative:\n(a) There is no serious possibility that the claimant would be persecuted or subject to a risk to life or of cruel or unusual punishment; and\n(b) it must not be unreasonable for the claimant to settle in the proposed place of refuge.[3]\n\n[23] The claimants fear that they would be discovered in any internal flight alternative location, including Delhi, the location considered at the hearing. This would happen because the principal claimant was told that he was entered into the police data base as a suspected militant. He was interviewed by officers not just from Punjab State but four other States as well and told that he was entered into the data base for all these States.\n\n[24] The evidence of the principal claimant that he was told that he is in the police data base is somewhat at odds with the fact that the detentions appear to have been illegal arrests as he was never charged with a crime or taken before a magistrate. Illegal arrests are not usually recorded in the CCTNS police data base. However, a Response to Information Request at tab 10.3 of the National Document Package indicates that \u201ctech-savvy officers\u201d now use the CCTNS police data based to record information on persons of interest\u201d. The same document indicates that in addition to First Incident Reports (FIR), the CCTNS database contains 70 million records of which only 25 million are FIRs regarding crimes, leaving 45 million records in the CCTNS that are not FIR\u2019s pertaining to crime.[4]\n\n[25] The principal claimant\u2019s evidence that he was interrogated by officers from several states is also unusual because Indian State police usually operate separately from each other. While the claimants have not produced any documentary evidence to show that the principal claimant was interrogated by police from different States and that his name was to be entered into the data bases of these States, it is not clear what documents the claimants could produce in this regard. It may be that the officers were lying to the claimant about this and that in fact they were not from different States. It could also be that they were lying when they said his name would be in the data bases. However, this is speculative.\n\n[26] I accept that the principal claimant was interviewed by officers who claimed they were from Punjab State and other States and that he was told that his name would be placed in their data bases.\n\n[27] I conclude that this means that there is a serious possibility that the principal claimant is in the police data base of more than one State. This heightens the possibility that police who have access to the data base system could identify the principal claimant as a person wanted by the police.\n\n[28] The claimants fear that they would be discovered through the tenant verification system which requires landlords to register information about tenants with the police. There is conflicting information about this system. Sorne information suggests that it is often not followed by landlords and rarely used by the police to locate anyone. Tab 10.13 quotes an Inspector-General of Police in the state of Haryana who indicates that there is no national data base of criminals or suspects and that state level systems operate as \u201cislands of technology\u201d. However, the same document indicates that there is a National Data Centre operated by the National Crime Record Bureau which provides a searchable national police data base. The report indicates that there are some \u201ctechnical issues\u201d that can make it difficult to search across States.\n\n[29] In Delhi, the tenant verification system is mandatory and landlords have been prosecuted for failing to register tenants.[5] The intent of the system is to maintain a data base of people living in an area and to allow the history of any tenant to be verified including any criminal involvement or \u201cabsconding form other states\u201d.[6]\n\n[30] While the system does not appear to be functioning optimally, it is apparent that the data bases have become more sophisticated in recent years, and it is reasonable to suppose that they will become more so in the coming years. Moreover, according to the evidence of the principal claimant, he has already been entered into the data bases of five States including Punjab.\n\n[31] The agents of persecution in this case have demonstrated an ongoing motivation to find the principal claimant. When he did not appear for the XXXX 2018 interview, his brother was detained. The claimants\u2019 evidence is that the police have subsequently continued to ask about where they are.\n\n[32] From a forward-looking perspective, I find that it is not possible to be satisfied that there is no serious possibility that the claimants would not be persecuted if they were to return to India to live in Delhi or anywhere else in India. There is a serious possibility that the principal claimant is in a police data base and that this could be established through the tenant verification or other systems that include access to the data bases.\n\n[33] I find that the claimants have established that there is not a viable internal flight alternative in India.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[34] For these reasons, I find that the claimants are Convention Refugee and entitled to protection under section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) and their claims are allowed on that basis.\n\n(signed) Brian Cook\n\nApril 4, 2022\n\n[1] Maldonado v.

Del Negro\nCountry: India\nRPD Number: TC1-15208\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2023-01023\nATIP Pages: N\/A\n\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n\n[1] These are the reasons for decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) in the claim for refugee protection of XXXX. He is claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (\u201cIRPA\u201d)[1]. The claimant alleges to be a citizen of India.\n\nDETERMINATION\n\n[2] The panel finds the claimant to be a Convention refugee, and that he faces a serious possibility of persecution should he return to India on account of imputed political opinion.\n\nALLEGATIONS\n\n[3] The specifics of the claim are set out in the narrative of the claimant\u2019s Basis of Claim Form[2]. To summarize, the claimant alleges that he is being targeted by police for false allegations of ties to Khalistani militants simply because he provided temporary shelter to a nephew who had escaped the country under suspicion of the sa.me accusations. He had been questioned, arrested, detained, and pressured several times, escalating into more violent interactions where he was beaten. He further alleges that since he fled the country officers have continued to ask for him on a regular basis to this day, and that he fears he will face a risk of harm at the hands of the police should he return to India.\n\nIDENTITY\n\n[4] The persona! identity of the claimant as a citizen of India has been established, on a balance of probabilities, by a copy of his Indian passport[3].\n\nNEXUS\n\n[5] The panel finds there is a nexus between the harm the claimant fears and a Convention ground, namely imputed political opinion for being involved with Khalistani militants alongside his nephew who was a terrorism suspect sought by police.\n\nCREDIBILITY\n\n[6] The panel finds the claimant to be a credible and trustworthy witness. His testimony was straightforward, sincere, and unembellished. There were no relevant inconsistencies, contradictions, or omissions that went to the heart of his claim. Therefore, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, his allegations to be true.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Nephew and the Police\n\n[7] The claimant indicated that his problems back home started when he received a surprise visit from his nephew XXXX on XXXX, 2018. XXXX was the son of a deceased uncle who came to the claimant\u2019 s family home from his village several kilometres away seeking temporary shelter due to the fact that he was being sought by the police. The claimant testified that both he and his wife said they did not want trouble with authorities and asked XXXX to leave, but his nephew was able to plead to stay at the small house adjacent to the family home for a day or two. Unfortunately, XXXX ended up with the claimant for 15 days despite repeated requests to leave before the claimant finally gave an ultimatum to his nephew to vacate.\n\n[8] When asked by the panel, the claimant said he did not know any of the details of why XXXX was being pursued by police. XXXX did not volunteer any more details, and he did not want to ask. He was also uncertain as to why XXXX chose him to request shelter, but suspected in hindsight that other relatives who may have known more of what problems XXXX had with the police declined to assist him so he went to see the claimant.\n\n[9] Not long after XXXX left his property on XXXX, 2018, the claimant said police came to his house on XXXX to start asking questions about his nephew. He testified that the officers asked about XXXX stay, what he was doing while staying there, where he went, and whether the claimant knew where his nephew was at the time. From these queries, he knew the officer had knowledge that XXXX stayed with him. Although he is unclear as to how police learned of this other than theorizing that someone in his village may have seen XXXX coming in and out of the house and reported it to authorities. The claimant also said it was the first time he learned of why police were looking for his nephew: It was because of suspected links to Khalistani militants. The police left after 30 minutes or so, but returned two days later on XXXX asking him about XXXX again. The claimant testified that he believes police came back so soon to because they may have suspected he was still giving shelter to his nephew.\n\n[10] The claimant said during the summer of 2018, the police came to his house two more times. But during these visits, the tone changed and officers started to accuse him of being involved with Khalistani militants through XXXX. He would be interrogated about militant activity, but denied all of the allegations. Officers would then leave his house without arresting him. However, this changed on XXXX, 2018 when he was taken into custody, beaten and interrogated about ties to militants, and released several hours later and only upon payment of a bribe. In addition, the claimant was given reporting obligation every XXXX days starting in XXXX 2018. Despite the beating, he was not injured to the point of needing medical attention, so he went home to recuperate.\n\n[11] In the meantime, XXXX was able to flee the country and go to Russia with a forged passport with the help of an agent in Rajasthan. The claimant was able to contact XXXX once or twice since his departure and told the nephew to inform police that he had fled India. The claimant and his family felt he should also escape for his safety, and found an agent in Punjab to assist with getting him to Canada. The visa was approved in XXXX 2018 as the claimant tried to gather funds to make payment. In an unfortunate stroke of luck, his house had a break in and enter in which the robbers found the cash he was saving for the agent and stole the money. Without payment, he said the agent would not return his passport or make any further arrangements to leave. So he had to continue saving up and fulfill his reporting conditions to the police.\n\n[12] The claimant presented himself at the station for the XXXX 2018 and XXXX 2019 report, and said officers just asked about XXXX whereabouts and nothing more before he was told he could go. However, for the XXXX 2019 report he said police once again accused him of militant links and were much more aggressive with him about the whereabouts of XXXX. Then on XXXX, 2019 a group officers arrested him from his home, took him to the station, interrogated and beat him, and accused him of Khalistani militant ties, as well as illegal possession of weapons and other serious offences. He testified that police also referenced a Malaysian woman named XXXX who was associated with XXXX and presumably to the claimant. In spite of police\u2019 s assault and pressure, he said he steadfastly denied all allegations. He was released the next day with a bribe payment and the additional condition of not leaving his village.\n\n[13] He sustained injuries and had to be hospitalized several days. At this point, family and friends rallied and collected sufficient fonds to pay the agent\u2019s fee. He was able to obtain his passport with the Canadian visa, and depart from India a few days later on XXXX, 2019.\n\n[14] The claimant provided the following documents as evidence:\nMedical Certificate from XXXX Hospital in XXXX for treatment on XXXX, 2018 for a week before being discharged on XXXX[4]; andAffidavit from the village XXXX speaking about how the claimant got into trouble with police for helping his nephew, that he was detained and accused of supporting a Khalistan referendum, and how police continue to look for him[5].The panel finds these documents to be credible and trustworthy and gives them full weight in support of the claimant\u2019 s allegations in his claim.\n\n[15] During the hearing, the panel was made aware that the claimant had provided four other documents as evidence in addition to the two referenced above. They are as follows: A medical certificate for treatment after his XXXX 2019 detention; an affidavit by his mother; an affidavit by the village XXXX; and a letter by a neighbour. He testified he had given them to his previous counsel, and was unaware that they were not disclosed for the hearing until he was asked about corroborating evidence. His current counsel indicated he did not know of these other documents until the claimant mentioned them in testimony. The claimant was asked if he had copies of these documents that could be disclosed after the hearing, and responded in the affirmative. Counsel stipulated that he would assist the claimant to obtain the copies and disclose them.\n\n[16] In light of the circumstances, the panel allowed time for counsel to send in post-hearing evidence on or before the end of day on May 6, 2022 to allow the claimant a fair chance to have these documents considered for the determination of his claim. However, the Board was not in receipt of these four documents by the time this decision was issued, nor was there a request for an extension of time or even a reason as to why they were not disclosed. The panel even instructed the Registry to contact counsel prior to the due date as a reminder, but no follow up or acknowledgement was received.\n\n[17] The four documents in this case would have substantiated aspects of the allegations that went to the core of the claimant\u2019s claim based on his brief description of their nature, and thus would likely have been relevant and had probative value. Where a claimant fails to produce evidence that could reasonably be available and was an important piece of information, the panel is entitled to draw a negative inference in credibility assessment. In this situation, these documents are not evidence that should or could have been procured; they are in the possession of the claimant per his own testimony, but, for whatever reason, have not been disclosed despite given an opportunity and counsel\u2019s undertaking at the hearing.\n\n[18] In considering whether to draw a negative inference, the panel is conscious of how the evidence at issue was likely overlooked inadvertently during a change of counsel at no fault of the claimant, as well as the claimant\u2019s own level of sophistication being a farmer from a rural village with a seventh-grade education and little knowledge of the English language or legal procedures. Furthermore, the fact that there was missing evidence emerged organically as the claimant gave testimony, and he was able to list all of the documents that he had supposedly provided to his previous counsel without hesitation that suggested it was not an attempt to sneak in new evidence that should have been obtained and disclosed beforehand. For these reasons, in spite of counsel\u2019s failure to make post-hearing disclosure as promised, the panel will not penalize the claimant and thus will not draw a negative credibility inference against him for the lack of corroborating evidence in this instance.\n\nProspective Risk\n\n[19] When asked what he fears should he return to India, the claimant said he does want to be subjected to an endless cycle of police harassment, detention, beating, and pressure to confess to the false militant link allegations against him.\n\n[20] The claimant has established, on a balance of probabilities, that he had a nephew who was sought by police and had asked him for temporary shelter; that despite initially refusing, he later agreed to offer shelter for a short time; that after his nephew left police started coming to his home questioning him about the nephew; that his interactions with police eventually escalated to the point he was repeatedly questioned, verbally abused, falsely alleged to have militant ties, and detained twice for interrogation and questioning; that he fled his country for safety and he now fears he would face risk of harm from the police should he return to India.\n\n[21] For the above reasons, the panel finds that the claimant has established subjective fear of persecution based on political opinion.\n\nOBJECTIVE BASIS\n\n[22] The National Documentation Package (\u201cNDP\u201d) for India indicates that the rule of law is massively undermined by political corruption; corruption continues to be prevalent at all levels, and in sectors such as the police, the judiciary, and the public services[6]. Public officials in India continue to enjoy effective immunity for serious human rights violations. Government officials and police enjoy protection from legal proceedings as the Criminal Code and other legislation require government permission to initiate prosecutions against them[7]. This has prevented proper accountability for human rights violations such as torture, enforced disappearances, and extrajudicial killings by the police[8]. Police-public relations is in an unsatisfactory state because people view the police as corrupt, inefficient, politically partisan, and unresponsive[9].\n\n[23] Corruption within the police force remains a problem. Torture, abuse, and rape by law enforcement and security officials have been reported. A bill intended to prevent torture remains pending[10]. New cases of torture in police custody and extrajudicial killings highlighted continued lack of accountability for police abuses and failure to enforce police reforms[11].\n\n[24] The law prohibits torture, but there were reports that police forces allegedly employed such practices[12]. According to human rights NGOs, police used torture, mistreatment, and arbitrary detention to obtain forced or false confessions[13]. In some cases police reportedly held suspects without registering their arrests and denied detainees sufficient food and water[14]. There were incidents in which authorities allegedly detained suspects beyond legal limits[15]. By law authorities must allow family member access to detainees, but this was not always observed[16]. The law prohibits arbitrary arrest or detention, but in some cases police reportedly continued to arrest citizens arbitrarily[17]. There were reports of police detaining individuals for custodial interrogation without identifying themselves or providing arrest warrants[18].\n\n[25] The law also does not permit authorities to admit coerced confessions into evidence, but NGOs and citizens alleged authorities used torture to coerce confessions[19]. Authorities allegedly also used torture as a means to extort money or as summary punishment[20]. There were reports of abuse in prisons at the hands of guards and inmates, as well as reports that police raped female and male detainees[21]. Victims of crime were sometimes subjected to intimidation, threats, and attacks, including by government officials[22].\n\n[26] Punjab police believes that militancy is returning to the state[23]. People suspected of supporting Khalistan are monitored, often included on police lists for heightened scrutiny, and often charged in terrorism-related cases, which can result in being detained for years before being released due to lack of evidence[24]. Sikhs who are suspected of being militant sympathizers are subject to monitoring and in some cases, detention and torture[25]. While Punjab has not seen a return to wide-scale violence that marked the years 1980-1995 in which the Sikh community as a whole faced hardships, segments of the Sikh population in India continue to face harassment, detention and torture due to their political or religious beliefs[26]. Punjab police conduct regular arrests of alleged Sikh \u201cterrorists,\u201d often based on false charges, and the arrests are used as a tool to harass or silence political opponents[27]. The police also continues to violate the human rights of Sikhs by arresting Sikh youths illegitimately by using the blanket term \u201cdangerous terrorists\u201d[28].\n\n[27] Based on the claimant\u2019 s evidence and the country conditions cited above, the panel finds that his subjective fear has an objective basis, and that he faces a serious possibility of persecution in India. Therefore, the panel finds that the claimant has a well-founded fear of persecution in the country.\n\nSTATE PROTECTION\n\n[28] There is a presumption that states are capable of protecting their own citizens. However, a claimant can rebut the presumption of state protection and demonstrate that they would not receive such protection by providing clear and convincing evidence of the unwillingness or inability of the state to protect them.\n\n[29] The panel finds that the police are the primary agents of persecution in this matter. The country conditions reviewed above confirm that police throughout India frequently engage in arbitrary, extended, and unlawful detention of suspects of terrorism such as the claimant, despite laws ostensibly prohibiting or checking such behaviour.\n\n[30] In terms of recourse and protection in cases of mistreatment by authorities, India\u2019s judiciary remained overburdened, and court backlogs led to lengthy delays or the denial of justice[29]. While in theory Indian citizens can approach the courts for relief including against illegal or inappropriate actions by the state and its agents, that recourse is not available to Sikhs or political activists opposing the ruling government in Punjab; government officials use procedural tactics in order to demonstrate that they are following the law, however the police or state government may influence the decision of judges resulting in an unfair trial or no trial at all[30]. If a Sikh community member, activist, or member of an opposition party reports mistreatment to the police, the police do not follow up on the complaints and police officers and or government officials are not suspended or prosecuted[31].\n\n[31] Based upon the claimant\u2019 s credible testimony and the objective evidence cited, the panel is satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that the presumption for the claimant has been successfully rebutted with clear and convincing evidence. The panel therefore finds that state protection in India is inadequate and would not be reasonably forthcoming for him.\n\nINTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE\n\n[32] The panel has considered whether a viable internal flight alternative (\u201cIFA\u201d) exists for the claimants in India. The agents of persecution are the police, agents of the state. The panel has identified Mumbai and Kolkata at the start of the hearing because they are large metropolitan cities that are far away from Punjab.\n\n[33] In assessing an IFA, the panel must apply a two-pronged test cited in Rasaratnam with respect to its safety and reasonableness[32]. One of the prongs must be satisfied to find that the claimant does not have an IFA. The burden of proof rests with a claimant to show that they do not have an IFA. The finding of an IFA must be based on a distinct evaluation of a region for that purpose, taking into account the claimant\u2019s identity. An IFA must be a realistic and attainable option. The claimant cannot be required to encounter great physical danger or to undergo undue hardship in traveling there or staying there.\n\n[34] With respect to motivation, the claimant testified that the police continue to ask about him two to three times a month since he left the country by approaching his wife, his neighbour XXXX, and the village Sarpanch. When he spoke with his daughter yesterday, she informed him that police had come to the family home earlier in the day once again asking if he had returned. He provided the affidavit of the Sarpanch corroborating that these individuals are still fielding queries about him. The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the police remain motivated to find him.\n\n[35] When asked how Punjab police would be able to find and apprehend him if he moved to another city like Mumbai far away from his home village, the claimant said he would likely be located once he uses the verification or criminal background check system that are mandated for purposes of job application or accommodation rental. This would alert Punjab police of his presence in the country, but also the local police in Mumbai that he is being sought on serious allegations of terrorism. He believes Punjab police would utilize resources to seek his return to his home state. It is possible that police in Mumbai would also take an interest in him and subject him to similar treatment back home.\n\n[36] On the evidence presented, including the objective documentation in the NDP, the panel finds that there is a serious possibility that the claimant would be persecuted in India under the first prong. Since the claimant has met the burden of satisfying the first prong, there is no need to assess the second prong. As such, the panel concludes there is no viable IFA for him in the country.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[37] Based on the totality of evidence, the panel finds that the claimant has established there is a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground because of political opinion pursuant to section 96 of IRPA.\n\n[38] Therefore, the panel accepts his claim.\n\n(signed) A.

        "unofficial_text":"2022 RLLR 107\n\nCitation: 2022 RLLR 107\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: September 27, 2022\nPanel: Alexandra Kotyk\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Christian Azzi\nCountry: Pakistan\nRPD Number: TC1-11216\nAssociated RPD Number(s): TC1-11229, TC1-11230\nATIP Number: A-2023-01023\nATIP Pages: N\/A\n\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n[1] These are the reasons for the decision in the claim of principal claimant XXXX, associate claimant XXXX, and the minor claimant XXXX, who claim to be citizens of Pakistan and are collectively claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (\u201cIRPA\u201c).[1]\n\n[2] As this claim involves allegations of gender-based violence, the panel considered and applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 4: Gender Considerations in Proceedings Before the Immigration and Refugee Board.\n\nDESIGNATED REPRESENTATIVE\n\n[3] At the time of this hearing the claimant XXXX was a minor. The principal claimant is his mother and so served as the designated representative and confirmed her role at the start of the hearing.\n\nALLEGATIONS\n\n[4] The claimants\u2019 narrative is set out in in their Basis of Claim (BOC) forms.[2] In summary, they fear their family due to the principal claimant\u2019s affair, secret divorce, and remarriage to her current husband. They allege that their family, who are part of the same extended family as the principal claimant was in an arranged marriage to her cousin and he is the father of the associate and minor claimants, holds significant power in Pakistan and will kill all three claimants in an attempt to regain their honour perceived to have been lost by the principal claimant\u2019s actions.\n\nDETERMINATION\n\n[5] For the reasons outlined below, the panel determines that the principal, associate, and minor claimants are Convention refugees as they have established a serious possibility of persecution in Pakistan.\n\n[6] The principal claimant fears persecution due to her membership in a particular social group as a woman who is perceived to have impacted the honour of her family and who has remarried against her family\u2019 s wishes.\n\n[7] The associate and minor claimants fear persecution due to their membership in a particular social group as family members of the principal claimant.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nIdentity\n\n[8] The principal, associate, and minor claimant\u2019s identities as nationals of Pakistan have been established, on a balance of probabilities, through certified true copies of their passports.[3] Their relationship to each other has been established, on a balance of probabilities, by their testimony and a copy of their Family Registration Certificate.[4]\n\nExclusion under 1F(b)\n\n[9] The principal claimant testified that at the time she married her current husband he was already married to another woman. She testified that under Pakistani law men may have up to four wives. However, in Canada marriage to more than one person, or marriage to a person who is already married is a crime. When the panel became aware of the possibility of exclusion during the first sitting, July 7, 2022, the hearing was stopped and the Minister was notified. At the date of the second sitting, and September 22, 2022, the Minister had not responded. The panel has therefore made this analysis based on the information provided by the claimant and following a review of sections 290(1) and 293(1) of the Canada Criminal Code. The panel finds that the principal claimant has not participated in polygamy as second 293(1) defines this as someone who:\n(a) practises or enters into or in any manner agrees or consents to practise or enter into any form of polygamy or any kind of conjugal union with more than one person at the same time, whether or not it is by law recognized as a binding form of marriage\n\n[10] As the principal claimant testified that she divorced her first husband before marrying her second husband the panel finds on s balance of probabilities that she was only married to one person and so does not meet the definition of polygamy.\n\n[11] The panel then assess if the claimant met the definition of bigamy, which says:\n\n(1) Every one commits bigamy who\na) in Canada,\n1. being married, goes through a form of marriage with another person,\nn. knowing that another person is married, goes through a form of marriage with that person, or\n[12] The panel finds that the principal claimant while she went through a form of marriage with a person she knew was married, this did not occur in Canada and so would not fall under this definition of bigamy.\n\n[13] The panel also considered whether section 282 and 283 of Canada\u2019s Criminal Code is applicable for parental kidnapping of the minor claimant. The minor claimant left Pakistan with his older brother, the associate claimant, after their mother and was over the age of 14. The panel therefore finds that these sections do not apply in this case.\n\n[14] The panel finds that the principal claimant is not excluded under 1F(b).\n\nCredibility\n\n[15] The principal claimant testified that she and her children, the associate and minor claimants, will be killed should they return to Pakistan as she had an affair while still married, and divorced her ex-husband and remarried to her current husband without the consent of her family. She testified that her family, who is also the family of her ex-husband as he is her cousin, has a lot of power in Pakistan due to their senior government positions. The principal claimant testified how she began an affair with a co-worker and that she filed for khula, which is a divorce initiated by a woman and done through the courts.[5]\n\n[16] When the panel asked the principal claimant how she was able to file for divorce without the knowledge of her ex-husband or family she testified she paid the lawyer extra to be confidential and used the mailing address of her current husband. She testified that she married her current husband in a religious ceremony but that the marriage was not registered with the state.\n\n[17] The principal and associate claimants both testified to being threatened at gunpoint by unknown men on XXXX, 2020 who said that the principal claimant was bringing shame to the family and should stop. They also testified to the belief that their family could only have had a suspicion of the principal claimant\u2019s affair at the time as if they had more proof they would not have been threatened, they would have been killed. The principal claimant testified that the fact that the claimants had not returned to Pakistan would be considered suspicious and she is certain they will now have learned of her affair and divorce but that she blocked all contact with her family members, so they have not been able to locate them in Canada.\n\n[18] The claimants provided documents which corroborate their allegations. This includes the court documents confirming the principal claimant\u2019s divorce and remarriage and police reports related to the threats on XXXX, 2020.[6] The claimants also provided documents in support of their family\u2019s influence, namely a medical report identifying the principal claimant\u2019s first husband\u2019 s employment information.[7] The panel gives full weight to these documents as there is no reason to doubt their genuineness and they support what the claimants allege.\n[19] The panel finds the claimants to be credible witnesses who testified in a spontaneous and straightforward manner and the panel did not note any relevant inconsistencies or omissions between their testimony and Basis of Claim narratives. The panel accepts the claimant\u2019s testimony and finds on a balance of probability that the principal claimant had an affair, initiated a divorce and remarriage in secret, and the claimants have been threatened because their family believed these actions had brought dishonour.\n\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution\n\n[20] The claimants\u2019 allegations of honour crimes for having an affair, seeking a divorce, and remarrying without their consent are consistent with the documentary evidence before the panel. Violence in Pakistan continues against women and girls, including killings by relatives committed \u201cin the name of so-called honour\u201d.[8] Item 5.1 in the National Documentation Package establishes that women in Pakistan are considered to be the carriers of honour for the entire family. Honour killings usually take place when a man claims that a woman has brought dishonour to the family. The rationale is that the woman needs to be killed to restore the honour. Honour killings are committed primarily against women who are thought to be engaging in premarital or extramarital relationships. Perpetrators of such crimes are most often husbands, brothers, or fathers of the victims.[9]\n\n[21] An incident in the name of \u201chonour\u201d was documented in which a man in Peshawar killed his two daughters because he thought they had boyfriends and felt \u201cashamed.\u201d[10] Documentary evidence indicates that the family members in Pakistan carry out honour killings against relatives \u201cperceived to have brought dishonour on the family by [\u2026 ] forming a romantic attachment not approved by the family.\u201d[11] Due to the cultural, religious and traditional practices, including so\u00ad called honour killings, Pakistan is ranked the sixth most dangerous country in the world for women.[12]\n\n[22] The panel therefore finds that the claimants have established, on a balance of probabilities, a subjective fear of persecution in Pakistan that is objectively well founded.\n\nState Protection\n\n[23] The objective country evidence confirms that \u201cthe police are ranked as one of the most corrupt institutions in Pakistan.\u201d[13] The objective country evidence confirms that the police are very unlikely to intervene in \u2018family problems\u2019 and are usually unwilling to investigate or register an FIR.[14] The police often treat honour killings as a private family matter and have been complicit with perpetrators of honour crimes to avoid filing cases or destroying evidence in the \u201cname of the honour of the family and [the] victim.\u201d[15]\n\n[24] The principal and associate claimants testified credibly as to their interactions with the police after threats at gunpoint and stated that the police refused to help without a male member of their family, who are the agent of persecution, accompanying them to the station. The principal claimant also credibly testified to the authority of her family within Pakistan and that the police would put their own jobs in jeopardy if they refused to help her extended family.\n\n[25] For these reasons, the panel concludes that the claimants have established that the Pakistani police would be unwilling or unable to provide them with adequate protection.\n\nInternal Flight Alternative\n\n[26] The panel finds that the claimants face a serious possibility of persecution throughout Pakistan.\n\n[27] The panel has considered the specific circumstances of the claimants based on their credible allegations of persecution by their powerful family. In order for the agents of persecution to not learn of their whereabouts, the claimants would have to continue to cut all contact with their family. The Federal Court has found that it may be unreasonable for a claimant to cut all contact with their family and friends in order to avoid being found in an IFA and that this amounts to a claimant being forced to hide.[16]\n\n[28] The panel finds that the principal claimant has established that the state would be influenced by her family and on a balance of probabilities would help them locate her and the other claimants should they return to Pakistan. Objective evidence confirms that the tenant registration system is strictly enforced throughout Pakistan and is accessible by police.[17] The principal claimant credibly testified that the police were aware of her family connections and would be influenced by this. Therefore, the panel concludes that the claimants have established that they face a serious possibility of persecution in the proposed IFAs.\n\n[29] For all these reasons, the panel finds that there is no viable IFA for the claimants anywhere in Pakistan.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[30] The panel finds that the principal, associate, and minor claimants face a serious possibility of persecution in Pakistan and are Convention refugees pursuant to subsection 96 of the IRPA.\n\n[31] Their claims are therefore accepted.\n\n(signed) AK\n\nSeptember 27. 2022\n\n[1] Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27, as amended, sections 96 and 97(1).\n\n[2] Exhibits 2.1, 2.2, 2.3\n\n[3] Exhibit 1\n\n[4] Ibid\n\n[5] Exhibit 3, National Documentation Package, Pakistan, 29 April 2022, item 1.6\n\n[6] Exhibit 4\n\n[7] Ibid\n\n[8] Exhibit 3, National Documentation Package, Pakistan, 29 April 2022, item 1.6\n\n[9] Exhibit 3, National Documentation Package, Pakistan, 29 April 2022\n\n[10] Ibid, item 1.6\n\n[11] Exhibit 3, National Documentation Package, Pakistan, 29 April 2022, items 1.13 and 5.1\n\n[12] Exhibit 3, National Documentation Package, Pakistan, 29 April 2022, item 5.21\n\n[13] Exhibit 3, National Documentation Package, Pakistan, 29 April 2022, item 10.1\n\n[14] Exhibit 3, National Documentation Package, Pakistan, 29 April 2022, item 5.5\n\n[15] Exhibit 3, National Documentation Package, Pakistan, 29 April 2022, item 5.1\n\n[16] Zamora Huerta v.

On XXXX, 2018, the claimant was attacked by her husband and his associates at her residence where they beat her, and she sustained injuries. The police were called, and they took away her ex-husband but then subsequently released him. Fearful for her life, the claimant departed from India and landed in Canada on XXXX 2018.\n\nDETERMINATION\n\n[3] The panel finds that the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the Act, for the reasons that follow.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nIdentity\n\n[4] The panel finds that the claimant\u2019 s identity as a national of India is established on a balance of probabilities by her testimony, and by the supporting documentation filed, including her Indian passport.[3]\n\nCredibility\n\n[5] The panel assumes without deciding that the allegations in this claim are true. Therefore, the determinative issue in this case will be the availability of an IFA in New Delhi, Bengaluru (Bengaluru (Bangalore)), or Mumbai.\n\nDeterminative Issue\n\n[6] The determinative issue in this claim is the availability of a viable internal flight alternative (IFA) in New Delhi, Bengaluru, and Mumbai.\n\nInternal Flight Alternative (IFA)\n\n[7] In order for a proposed IFA to be viable, the panel must be satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that (1) there is no serious possibility the claimant would be persecuted or subjected personally to a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or a danger of torture in the proposed IFA, and (2) conditions in the proposed IFA are such that it would not be unreasonable, in all of the circumstances, including those particular to the claimant, for her to seek refuge there.\n\n[8] The claimant argued that she will not be able to relocate safely within India due to lack of employment opportunities, difficulty in renting places, and due to safety issues for her as she does not have any social support in India.\n\nFirst Prong of the IFA Test\n\n[9] Based on the totality of the evidence, the panel finds that the claimant has not established with sufficient credible evidence that she would be persecuted throughout India by her ex husband. The claimant testified in her narrative that her ex-husband has political connections with the Bhartiya Janta party. When asked by the panel as to how her husband would be able to track her if she were to relocate to New Delhi, Mumbai, and Bengaluru, and what his motivation would be, the claimant responded that she lacks the ability to be able to support herself. Counsel for the claimant also questioned the claimant about her ex-husband\u2019s ability to track her and the claimant provided the same response about her inability to support herself.\n\n[10] Given that the claimant was unable to adequately answer the question as putto her by the panel, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that her ex-husband does not have the profile that she alleges that he has and therefore, does not have the ability to find the claimant throughout India. The claimant could continue to be a targeted by her ex-husband if she returns to her village in XXXX, Rajasthan. However, she did not provide any evidence about his political connections and how this would help him in finding her throughout India.\n\nSecond Prong of the IFA Test\n\n[11] The panel has also considered the second prong of the IFA test in light of the claimant\u2019s personal circumstances. The panel is mindful that the Federal Court of Appeal has set a very high threshold for the unreasonableness prong of the IFA test. Indeed, \u201cit requires nothing less than the existence of conditions which would jeopardize the life and safety of a claimant.\u201d The question to be answered on the second prong of the test is whether expecting the claimant to relocate to the proposed IFA location would be \u201cunduly harsh.\u201d\n\n[12] When asked if there were any other reasons besides her fear as to why she cannot relocate to New Delhi, Bengaluru, and Mumbai, the claimant repeated her concerns about her age and her inability to take care of herself.\n\n[13] The claimant testified during the hearing that she was able to come to Canada with the help of her sister in Calgary who purchased her ticket and that she provides her money and looks after her. When asked by the panel as to why her family that is in Canada could not continue to provide her with support in India, the claimant responded that all her relatives are here and that there is no one to take care of her.\n\n[14] The question the panel must answer in this regard is whether the claimant, who is 75 years old, with no male support, will be able to relocate within India. The factors to assess this possibility are her status as a single woman, her ability to renta place, find employment, and be able to live safely on her own without social support. The panel finds that it will be unduly harsh and unreasonable for the claimant to relocate anywhere within India.\n\n[15] Objective evidence shows that single women depend on someone\u2019 s goodwill to be provided for.\nIndiaSpend reports that single women have to \u201cdepend [on] somebody\u2019s goodwill\n\u2013 in-laws, parents, brothers and sisters-in-law\u201d in order to provide for them and their children. In an article in the Hindu, an Indian daily newspaper, Sreemoyee Piu Kundu, [a columnist on sexuality and gender] who interviewed 3,000 single urban women in India, states that single women encounter \u201cserious struggles with basic life issues such as getting a flat on rent or being taken seriously as a start-up entrepreneur or getting a business loan or even getting an abortion\u201d.[4] [footnotes omitted]\n\nOn the issue of access to housing, objective evidence states that:\nIndiaSpend indicates that \u201c[n]obody wants to rent to single women\u201d and that, according to Shikha Makan, an Indian filmmaker who directed a documentary, Bachelor Girls, on the difficulties that single women face when looking for housing in Mumbai, a woman is expected to live with her father or with her spouse. According to The News Minute, \u201ca digital news platform reporting and writing on issues in India,\u201d particularly on southern India, the same documentary, which tells the stories of \u201cmobile, urban and educated\u201d single women, describes how women may need to visit numerous apartments before securing one and that they may face additional and \u201coften invasive\u201d questioning during the rental process. Without providing further details, an article by Deutsche Presse-Agentur (DPA) notes that \u201c[r]ecent studies\u201d have shown that single women face difficulties in renting housing in Kolkata, Chennai and Mumbai. The Economic Times states that single women face prejudice when searching for a house and reports the example of a professional single woman in Jaipur who was told \u201cunofficially\u201d that her loan application \u201cwould be processed faster if it was taken in her brother\u2019s name\u201d.[5] [footnotes omitted]\n\n[16] The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), on the issue of securing access to formal financial services for women in India states that:\nIndia\u2019s Mission for Financial Inclusion or Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, initiated by Prime Minister Modi in 2014, has significantly boosted the percentage of women with a bank account, with the number of female account holders now higher than ever before. In practice, several banks continue to require either the husband\u2019 s or the father\u2019 s signature to approve loan applications for women, which continues to pose issues for women\u2019s access to financial services.[6] [footnotes omitted]\n\n[17] On the issue of participation of women in the labour force, OECD states that:\nDespite these legal provisions, the rate of female labour force participation remains very low in India, and women are more likely than men to be employed in the informal economy, for instance in agriculture, domestic and home-based work, where they are not covered by labour laws or social protection measures. India ranks among the bottom of countries when it cornes to having women in senior management roles. Reconciling work with the responsibilities of caring for family is perceived as the biggest challenge for working women in India, by both men and women alike, as women are often expected by default to assume the role of caretaker.[7] [footnotes omitted]\n\n[18] The UN Special Rapporteur, in her report on safety of women in India, stated that:\nSexual violence, including rape and sexual harassment, is widespread across the country and perpetrated in public and private spaces \u2026 Many interlocutors stated that there was a general sense of insecurity for women in public spaces, especially in urban settings. Women are easy targets of attacks, including sexual violence, whether while using public transportation or sanitation facilities or on the way to collect wood and water. Many victims of sexual violence carry a deep sense of shame, which is further exacerbated by the stigma and exclusion they experience, especially from family members and the community, and which may result in suicide.[8]\n\n[19] The objective evidence discussed above establishes that women, especially single women, depend on male patronage in order to access rental accommodation and even former financial services. Banks are unwilling to provide any loans to single women without a male family member as co-signee. The claimant in this case is a single woman with no education and no work history who previously resided in her home village in her parental home. Her family situation has rendered her without family or male social support to relocate within India. Therefore, the panel finds on a balance of probabilities, that conditions across India are such that it would be unreasonable, in all the circumstances, including those particular to the claimant, for her to return to her country and seek refuge there.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[20] Based on the analysis above, the panel find that the claimant is a Convention refugee under section 96 of IRPA. Therefore, the panel accepts her claim.\n\n(signed) Abbas Kwofie\n\nMay 30, 2022\n\n[1] The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, as amended, sections 96 and 97(1).\n\n[2] Exhibit 2, BOC form TC1-10972.\n\n[3] Exhibit 1.\n\n[4] Ibid.\n\n[5] Ibid.\n\n[6] Exhibit 3, National Documentation Package, India, 30 June 2021, item 5.6.\n\n[7] Ibid.\n\n[8] Ibid., Item 5.9.\n\n",

Hamilton\nCountry: India\nRPD Number: TC1-07495\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2023-01023\nATIP Pages: N\/A\n\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n[1] XXXX alleges to be a citizen of India, and is seeking refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).[1]\n\n[2] As this claim is based on sexual orientation the panel has taken into consideration at the hearing and in rendering its decision, the Chairperson \u2018s Guideline 9: Proceedings Before the IRE Involving Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression and Sex Characteristics[2].\n\nDETERMINATION\n\n[3] Having considered the totality of the evidence, the panel finds that the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to s. 96 of the IRPA.\n\nALLEGATIONS\n\n[4] The details of the claimant\u2019s allegations are set out in her Basis of Claim Form (BOC).[3] The claimant alleges persecution at the hands of her family, community, and Indian society at large due to her membership in a particular social group, namely lesbians in India. The claimant alleges that there is no state protection or internal flight alternative for her in home country. The specifics of her main allegations are as follows.\n\n[5] The claimant is a 24-year-old from XXXX Kerala, India. She was brought up in a religious Christian family and attended Catholics schools. The claimant alleged that during her adolescence realized that she was not attracted to boys sexually or emotionally, but to women. She recounted how she researched sexual orientation on the internet, read about it in magazines and watched lesbian videos, to better understand herself.\n\n[6] The claimant testified that she concealed her true identity because homosexuality is\nnot accepted by her family and Indian society in general. Furthermore, her faith, Christianity, considers it a sin.\n\n[7] The claimant said she had her first same sex experience in high school with a single, female teacher and that their relationship lasted for about 5 months, until the teacher left her school. The claimant later learned that the teacher was dismissed but did not know why.\n\n[8] The claimant alleged that on XXXX 2016, while making a presentation at school, one of her lesbian videos which was on her computer desktop was accidentally projected to the class. This caused a sensation. She was summoned to the principal\u2019 s office for questioning. When her computer was examined, the school authorities found affectionate selfies of the claimant and the teacher with whom she had had a relationship. The claimant\u2019 s parents were called in.\n\n[9] At home the claimant\u2019s parents and relatives demanded answers. The claimant denied being a lesbian. She alleged that her uncle said she had dishonoured the family. Her parents reached out to the parish priest for assistance. Sorne people even suggested that their daughter undergo exorcism or Malayayam witchcraft treatment. The claimant said she was ostracised by her community.\n\n[10] The first week of XXXX 2016, the claimant said the police came to the school to investigate a complaint filed some parents against the school for showing students pornography. The claimant testified that the police questioned her about the incident and \u2018her selfies\u2019 and that she denied being a lesbian and claimed the photos were taken in a fun way. Due to pressure from other parents, the claimant was told she could not return to school for classes but could sit for the final exams in XXXX 2016.\n\n[11] Due to all that had transpired, the claimant said she became isolated and depressed. She went to live with a friend in XXXX in XXXX 2016 and with the approval of her parents came to Canada on XXXX, 2017 to study.\n\n[12] While in Canada, the claimant said the police came to her parents\u2019 home and said that a teacher was arrested in XXXX for her homosexual relations with students, and that they were investigating students associated with her. They requested a statement from the claimant and told her parents that she was to come to the police station when she returned from Canada.\n\n[13] In XXXX 2018, the claimant testified that her parents tried to arrange a marriage for her with a young Indian man from Singapore. They said it was the only way of ridding the family of the social stigma they suffered due to her actions. The claimant did not meet with the young man when he came to Canada and confessed to her parents that she would not accept an arranged marriage because she was a lesbian. According to the claimant they reacted by cutting her off financially and emotionally.\n\n[14] The claimant\u2019s student visa expired XXXX, 2020. She applied for refugee protection in Canada on June 28, 2021.\n\nANALYSIS\n\n[15] In making its assessment, the panel has considered all the evidence, including the claimant\u2019s testimony and written evidence,[4] the objective country conditions documentation[5] and her Counsel\u2019s oral submissions.\n\n[16] The panel was also mindful of the many challenges faced by refugee claimants in establishing their claims, including the claimant\u2019s age and educational background, nervousness, the impact of trauma, and cultural and social factors and the unfamiliar virtual hearing environment, and the high-stakes nature of refugee proceedings.\n\nIdentity\n\n[17] The claimant\u2019s personal and national identities were established, on a balance of probabilities, by her testimony and Indian passport, a certified true copy of which were provided by the Minister.[6]\n\nNexus\n\n[18] The panel finds that there is a link between what the claimant\u2019s alleged fear and one of the grounds listed in s. 96 of the IRPA, namely membership in a particular social group, therefore, her claim is assessed under s. 96 of the IRPA.\n\nCredibility\n\n[19] The panel found the claimant to be a credible and trustworthy witness. She testified in a direct, spontaneous, coherent, and detailed manner. The claimant self identified as a lesbian. She spoke fluently and respond to questions about:\n\nwhen and how she realized she was attracted to the same sex and her thoughts and feelings about thishow and why, she concealed her true identityreactions from classmates, her family, the priest, and parishioners at her church a:fter the school incidenther interactions with the school administrations and policeher same sex partners and relationships and their pastimes, in India (teacher), and in Canada[20] The claimant provided numerous supporting documents (educational certificates from a Catholic high school, first communion photos, letter of support from a co-tenant attesting to her relationship with a woman XXXX from India, photographs of XXXX and her present girlfriend who also came to testify, membership letter from XXXX, support letters from a friend in India who attests to events as alleged).[7] The panel finds these documents to be relevant, reliable, and probative and gives them full weight.\n\n[21] The panel had some credibility concerns. The claimant did not mention her same sex relationships in Canada in her BOC. When asked to explain why this was missing, the claimant replied that the relationships developed after her BOC was signed. The panel asked why she did not amend her BOC accordingly and her Counsel replied as \u2018relationships tend to come and go\u2019, it was his practice to provide information about partners in Canada in the disclosures and pointed out to the specific Exhibit (6.2.) The panel does not accept this as a satisfactory explanation because same sex relationships go to the core of a SOGIESC claim, therefore the panel draws a negative inference against the claimant\u2019s overall credibility. However, the panel finds that this omission alone, is insufficient to undermine her claim.\n\n[22] The panel also notes that the claimant\u2019s delay in filing her refugee claim. When asked for explanation, she stated that it took her time to find out about the possibility of claimant and retaining legal counsel. The panel accepts this explanation considering the claimant\u2019 s young age and unfamiliarity with the legal system in Canada and the time required to find legal representation and therefore, finds that her delay in claiming does not detract from her subjective fear.\n\n[23] The panel finds that the claimant has established on a balance of probabilities her profile as a lesbian, as well as her subjective fear of persecution due to her sexual orientation if returned to India. Her subjective fear is supported by the objective documentary evidence as follows.\n\nObjective Basis\n\n[24] Same sex acts are legal in India. Same sex marriages and civil unions are not recognized.[8]\n\n[25] On September 6, 2018, same-sex consensual relations (consensual acts between adults conducted in private) were decriminalized in India. \u2013 Supreme Court declared s. 377 of the Penal Code to be unconstitutional.[9]\n\n[26] Since the decriminalization LGBT events have surged across India in major cities, but also smaller ones. Businesses have become more LGBTQ friendly.\n\n[27] In 2019 the Supreme Court dismissed a review plea which sought the recognition of certain rights for the LGBTQ community- same-sex marriages, adoption, surrogacy, invitro fertilization.[10]\n\n[28] Society in India for the most part still view homosexuality negatively. \u201cSorne people will accept LGBT friends but won\u2019t accept their relatives who come out.\u201d Activists stated that it is too early after the decriminalization of same-sex relations to determine societal acceptance; it will not immediately result in full equality for LGBTQ people in India. A representative from the NGO Naz India said that sexual and gender minorities still have \u201ca long way to go\u201d for their rights and for representation in India.[11]\n\n[29] \u201cILGA\u2019s 2019 report states that there is no protection for sexual minorities in India, either in the constitution, in terms of broad protection, in employment, against hate crimes or against incitement, and there is not ban on conversion therapies.\u201d \u201cThe transgender community is continually harassed, stigmatized and abused by the police, judges, their family and society.\u201d LGBTQ groups reported they faces widespread societal discrimination and violence (physical attacks, rape, and blackmail), particularly in rural areas.\u201d[12]\n\n[30] While discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity is prohibited in India (2014 Supreme Court ruling), the law is only enforced in the formal sector and not the informal one. The informal sector represents approximately 90% of the workforce.[13]\n\n[31] In summary, given the claimant\u2019s experiences and the objective country documentation on point, the panel finds that the claimant has established, on a balance of probabilities, a well-founded fear of persecution in India due to her sexual orientation. She would not be able to live freely and openly as a lesbian in her home country. Moreover, it would be unreasonable to expect the claimant to conceal her sexual identity or expression, to live free of persecution.\n\nState Protection\n\n[32] Absent a complete breakdown of the state apparatus, there is a presumption that a state is capable of protecting its citizens.\n\n[33] The objective sources in the NDP for India, report that despite the Supreme Court ruling (September 6, 2018), negative attitudes and behaviors of the police and state authorities continue against the LGBTQI community. Nuisance laws are relied on to arrest, manipulate, bribe, and threaten LGBTQI persons. Community members have suffered violence, abuse, and harassment at the hands of the police. Sorne police have committed crimes against LGBTQI persons and used the threat of arrest to coerce victims not to report certain incidents.[14]\n\n[34] \u201cHate-motivated violence against LGBTQI people is typically perpetrated by non-State actors\u2026 failure by State authorities to investigate and punish this kind of violence is a breach of States\u2019 obligation to protect everyone\u2019 s right to life, liberty and security of the person. Therefore, the police violate these basic rights when they refuse to register complaints or conduct investigations regarding complaints of violence and abuse against LGBTQI persons. This has a seriously detrimental impact on a LGBTQI person\u2019s access to justice and redress and trust in the government to protect them. The Supreme Court in a September 2018 judgement, requested that government officials and in particular police receive training (sensitization and awareness) regarding sexual minorities.[15]\n\n[35] Having considered the evidence of prevailing prejudice of Indian police officers against the LGBTQI community, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant has rebutted the presumption of state protection. There is clear and convincing evidence that the state is unable or unwilling to provide the claimant with adequate protection.\n\nInternal Flight Alternative\n\n[36] The panel has considered whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for the claimant. The evidence reviewed above confirms that the oppressive treatment of members of the LGBTQI community is nationwide. The panel finds that there is a serious possibility of persecution for the claimant throughout India and therefore no viable internal flight alternative exists for her.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[37] For the foregoing reasons the panel concludes that the claimant XXXX would face a serious possibility of persecution on the basis of her membership in a particular social group, namely lesbians in India, if returned to her country of origin. Accordingly, her refugee claim in Canada is accepted under Section 96 of the IRPA.\n\n(signed) Christine Medycky\n\nAugust 19, 2022\n\n[1] Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), SC 2001, c 27, as amended.\n\n[2] Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9: Proceedings Before the IRB Involving Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression and Sex Characteristics.

Obazee\nCountry: Nigeria\nRPD Number: TC1-06806\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2023-01023\nATIP Pages: N\/A\n\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n\n[1] XXXX (the \u201cclaimant\u201d), a citizen of Nigeria is claiming refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (the \u201cIRPA\u201c)[1].\n\nPROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n[2] This claim was previously decided through a Refugee Protection Decision (RPD) decision dated November 25, 2021 in which the Member found that the claimant was a Convention Refugee.\n\n[3] The Minister appealed this decision. The Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) granted the appeal in its July 28, 2022 decision and returned the matter to the RPD for redetermination. The RAD found errors in the RPD\u2019s credibility findings which formed the basis of the claimant\u2019s identity as a bisexual woman. The RAD directed the RPD to canvass its credibility concerns about the relationship between the claimant and the sponsor in her application for a study permit and apparent inconsistencies with her Islamic birth certificate.\n\nALLEGATIONS\n\n[4] The claimant\u2019s allegations are fully set out in her Basis of Claim form (BOC)[2]. In summary, she fears returning to Nigeria because she is bisexual and faces forced marriage in her country.\n\nDETERMINATION\n\n[5] Neither counsel referred to the Gender or SOGIESC Guidelines. However, as they are applicable to the issues in this claim and to the claimant, I have considered and applied the Chairperson\u2019s Gender Guidelines[3] and the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9 (SOGIESC)[4] in coming to my decision.\n\n[6] I find that the claimant has established a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground, namely her membership in the particular social group of bisexual women.\n\nANALYSIS\n\n[7] At the hearing, I identified the issues as credibility, state protection and internal flight alternative. I have focused my analysis on the claimant\u2019 s sexual orientation as this issue is dispositive of her claim.\n\nMinister\u2019s Intervention\n\n[8] The Minister intervened in person regarding issues of credibility and program integrity.[5] In summary, the Minister has credibility concerns about the claimant\u2019s religious identity as a Muslim because research it conducted did not establish that the claimant\u2019s paternal grandfather\nwas the XXXX as she declared in her narrative. Based on the identity of the claimant\u2019 s sponsor in her application for a study permit, the Minister calls into question the family lineage other paternal grandparents and their religious identities as Muslims because the sponsor identifies as a Christian. The Minister submits that these concerns impugn the claimant\u2019 s credibility regarding her SOGIESC because she declared that the Islamic practice of separating male and female children in school may have contributed to her SOGIESC identity.[6]\n\nIdentity\n\n[9] The claimant has established her persona! and national identity based on her testimony, passport and birth certificate.[7]\n\nCredibility\n\n[10] The claimant is a twenty-five-year-old female. She testified that she is Muslim. She speaks English and Yoruba. She has a university level of education. She worked as an XXXX in her country. In Canada, she has worked in a warehouse (general labour) and is currently employed as a XXXX.\n\n[11] In assessing her credibility, I am guided by jurisprudence from the Federal Court and by the Gender Guidelines. Section 7.1 of the Gender Guidelines requires Members to consider the impact of coercive control when evaluating credibility in cases involving gender considerations. Section 6.2 instructs Members to take an intersectional approach taking into account the historical and social context based on a claimant\u2019s identity factors and lived experience. In Manege, Justice Kane states that the Guidelines encourage the Board to consider an applicant\u2019s testimony \u201cin accordance with their circumstances and as persons coming from societies that operated in a different cultural milieu than Canada\u201d.[8] In another Federal Court decision, the Court found that the RPD should have considered whether cultural differences might offer an explanation why the female applicant decided to answer her door the night she was attacked.[9] In Olah, the Federal Court noted that the experiences of refugee claimants can be shaped by cultural norms or backgrounds that are not shared by the decision maker.[10] In Okpanachi, the Court held that the RAD failed to tum its mind to how the claimant\u2019 s experiences would have contributed to the omission and inconsistencies.[11] In Odia, Justice Gagn\u00e9 held that the principles enshrined in the Gender Guidelines must be applied in a meaningful way.[12]\n\nMinister \u2018s concerns\n\nMr. XXXX is not a blood relative\n\n[12] The claimant testified that XXXX (\u201cIO\u201d) is a family friend on her mother\u2019 s side. I referred to a letter dated XXXX, 2019[13] which formed part of her study permit application in which IO identifies the claimant as his niece. The claimant denied a familial blood relationship and said in Nigerian culture, it is common to refer to an older person as an uncle. She said IO sees himself as an uncle.\n\n[13] I also asked the claimant for her response regarding the fact the IO indicates that he is a Christian in his affidavit.[14] She said that to the best of her knowledge IO is a Christian.\n\n[14] I find that IO is nota familial relative to the claimant. I found her testimony to be credible. It was spontaneous and without embellishment. It is also consistent with her narrative regarding her mother\u2019s Christian identity prior to marriage and her friendship with IO who identifies as a Christian.\n\nClaimant \u2018s paternal grandfather is a XXXX\n\n[15] In her narrative, the claimant wrote that her paternal grandfather XXXX was the XXXX in Lagos. I informed her that the Minister indicated in its submissions that it could not locate her grandfather\u2019 s name as a XXXX for Lagos in the website for the Lagos Central Mosque and that the XXXX was a person with a different name. The claimant testified that her paternal grandfather\u2019s name is correct and that he is the XXXX of the XXXX in Lagos State. She said that there are many mosques in Lagos State and her grandfather is only the XXXX of the XXXX mosque.\n\n[16] I find that the claimant has credibly established that her grandfather is the XXXX of a mosque in Lagos. She submitted a photo of a Fidau prayer ceremony for XXXX, XXXX Mosque, XXXX, a photo of a framed picture of XXXX Central Mosque, XXXX, Lagos and a poster about the final burial ceremony of XXXX Mosque in XXXX Local Government, Lagos.[15] I did not see anything in these documents to doubt their genuineness nor was any evidence raised to dispute the authenticity of this documentary evidence and they, along with the claimant\u2019s testimony are sufficient to establish that her paternal grandfather was the XXXX of the XXXX mosque in Lagos. I also rely on the jurisprudence set out above and recognize that cultural differences can contribute to how the claimant expressed the identity of her paternal grandfather and his role as a XXXX of a mosque in Lagos in her narrative and so do not impugn her credibility.\n\nThe claimant \u2018s father died\n\n[17] The claimant testified that her father died in 2009. She submitted a medical certificate confirming his death which she said her mother obtained from the hospital where he died. When asked why she did not provide a death certificate from the government, she testified that in the Islamic culture, it is male dominated. Her mother was not accepted as she was a Christian and then converted to the faith after marriage. She said her mother is not accepted by her father\u2019s family and furthermore she is not the only wife. She said her mother was only able to obtain verification other father\u2019s death from the hospital.[16]\n\n[18] I find that the claimant\u2019s father died on XXXX, 2009. In assessing her explanation about her mother\u2019s inability to obtain the government issued death certificate, I have considered the Gender Guidelines and the patriarchal culture described by the claimant after her father <lied and in the absence of any male siblings. While I note a minor discrepancy in the date of death indicated in her narrative, I find that this does not impugn the credibility of the medical note as the claimant would have been XXXX years old at the time of her father\u2019s death and relies on dates given to her through her mother.\n\nThe claimant \u2018s Islamic birth certificate is genuine\n\n[19] The claimant submitted her Islamic birth certificate[17] to corroborate her Islamic religious identity. The RAD member noted some inconsistencies on the document regarding the names of the claimant\u2019 s parents. When confronted with these apparent inconsistencies, the claimant testified that the names handwritten in the left hand margin are all names given to her. She said the name XXXX is her given name in Yoruba. She said XXXX is her father\u2019s Muslim name and XXXX is her Mother\u2019 s Muslim name. The other names handwritten on the birth certificate were given to her. Her father\u2019s name on his celebration of life poster is XXXX in Sheriff which bears similarity to his name on the Islamic birth certificate. The claimant also submitted a primary school certificate which indicates that she attended XXXX and Primary School for XXXX years until XXXX 2006.[18] She also submitted a receipt from this school for payment in 2001.[19] This is materially consistent with her education listed on the Schedule A form.[20]\n\n[20] I accept the claimant\u2019 s explanation. In assessing her credibility through the religious and cultural lens of the society where she lived, her explanation is reasonable. The birth certificate is not in English and may be in both Arabie and Yoruba and therefore spelling differences would not be unreasonable when translated into the English language, which is based on the Latin script unlike Arabie or Yoruba. Her date of birth matches her other documents and I note a reference in the footer which states XXXX which is part of her grandfather\u2019s name. There is nothing on the face of the supporting documents which causes me to doubt their authenticity. Therefore based on claimant\u2019s Islamic birth certificate, attendance at a Muslim school and her testimony, I find that she is an adherent of Islam.\n\nConsequential issues with the claimant \u2018s Muslim identity are not borne out\n\n[21] The Minister\u2019s concerns regarding family relationships which stem from IO are not borne out based on the claimant\u2019s credible testimony about her relationship with IO. As I have found that there is no familial relationship, the chain of relationships including religious identity which emanate from IO do not impugn the claimant\u2019s relationship to her paternal grandfather or her identity as a Muslim.\n\nMisrepresentation in study permit detracts from credibility\n\n[22] The claimant testified that her father\u2019s family was responsible for her financial support after his death in 2009 and it was a very patriarchal system where females had no authority. She said her uncle XXXX was authorized to give her money for her education but she could not ask for documents or other things. She said as her father was dead and neither she nor her mother could obtain the documents required to apply for a study permit, her mother reached out to IO. She testified about being humiliated in high school because her fees were late and her name was put on a board of students with unpaid fees. She said she had to beg her uncle to pay the fees. The claimant testified that it is very difficult in the Islamic culture for women and since her father died and with the absence of male siblings, life was difficult for her and her mother. She said her mother was a local businesswoman who operated a small store as a means of survival.\n\n[23] While I empathize with the claimant\u2019s situation and the role that gender played in her circumstances, at the time when her study permit was submitted, she had not yet faced forced marriage. Her study permit was submitted on XXXX 2019.[21] She declared in her narrative that the issue of forced marriage was raised in XXXX 2019.[22] It is well established in jurisprudence that providing fraudulent travel documents where a claimant is at risk and trying to flee their home country does not impugn their credibility. However in these circumstances, the claimant was not yet facing forced marriage and was not at risk such as is contemplated in the jurisprudence. I draw a negative inference against her credibility. This impact to her credibility is mitigated because I have found the claimant to be credible regarding her SOGIESC profile which would have existed at the time she filed her study permit and same sex relationships are illegal in Nigeria.\n\nThe claimant was being coerced into marriage\n\n[24] The claimant testified that her paternal grandfather is very popular in the area and in Muslim states. She said at celebrations such as Ramadan, her grandfather meets with other imams and as such networks with them and the broader Muslim communities.\n\n[25] She testified that marriages are arranged in this culture and females are merely notified that you are being given to a particular family. The claimant said she does not have a choice and must comply. She explained that men are the head of the family and her mother has no say or control. She said if her father was alive, he could have opposed the marriage being arranged for her. The claimant said marriages are arranged when women reach a certain age in the Islamic way so that women do not fornicate or engage in other behaviour deemed inappropriate.\n\n[26] I find that the claimant is faced with forced marriage. She provided detailed and spontaneous testimony about arranged marriages which is consistent with the objective evidence.[23] As well she submitted a letter confirming her employment at the office of XXXX[24] which corroborates her narrative that she worked at this office and the prospective husband is the nephew of her former boss.\n\nDelay\n\n[27] The claimant came to Canada in XXXX 2019 and made her claim for protection in XXXX 2020, about ten months later. When asked to explain this apparent delay, she testified that she came to Canada based on a study permit and was financially cut off from her father\u2019s side of the family in XXXX 2020. She was unable to recall when her aunt told her about a refugee claim. She applied for an extension to her study permit in XXXX 2020 which was approved until XXXX 2022.[25]\n\n[28] I find that the claimant\u2019s subjective fear is not diminished by the apparent delay in filing her claim for protection. Her study permit was valid until XXXX 2020 and she applied for an extension prior to its expiry. Her plans to study were at risk in XXXX 2020 when she found out that her financial support was no longer available. As the claimant took steps to protect her legal status in Canada, I find that her actions are consistent with someone who fears return to their country.\n\nThe claimant is bisexual\n\n[29] I find that the claimant is a bisexual woman. Her testimony was spontaneous, detailed, forthright and without embellishment.\n\n[30] She testified that for her being bisexual means having feelings for males and females however she prefers females because she has been through a very difficult life. She said she attended a Muslim elementary school where males and females were segregated and she was always with girls which may explain her sexual orientation. The claimant testified that she did not understand her feelings at first but did so over time. She testified that non-heterosexual sexual orientation is taboo culturally and illegal. She said under Muslim teachings you cannot disclose such a sexual orientation based on the imam\u2019s preaching. The claimant testified that she kept her feelings a secret because you have to be certain you know who you disclose your SOGIESC to otherwise it may be reported and her parents would know. She said LGBT people are flogged in public and society believes they are possessed by bad spirits.\n\n[31] The claimant testified about meeting XXXX, her same sex partner in high school and she said they also attended university together. She said they were just friends at first but while attending university things changed when they attended a surprise birthday party. She said she felt hesitant at first because XXXX was dating males but one day they kissed each other in a spontaneous way and the relationship shifted. The claimant said they were attending university in XXXX however there were many Nigerian students and so they kept their relationship a secret.\nThe claimant provided XXXX birthday and described her personality and said she liked to cook. She said XXXX kept her going since 2009 when her father died and she was going through many difficulties. The claimant described her experiences as a bisexual woman in the United States during internships there since XXXX had also accompanied her to the U.S. although their internships were in different states. She said XXXX remained in the U.S. and their relationship eventually ended.\n\n[32] The claimant\u2019s testimony about disclosing her SOGIESC to her mother was most compelling. She said it was not easy to tell her mother and it took her mother time to understand. She said her mother\u2019 s initial reaction was that this was a sin and her mother worried about the views of society in Nigeria and feared for her safety and treatment.\n\n[33] The claimant described her participation at the 519 in Canada and said she attended programs which helped her to learn more about herself and said it was helpful to interact with others in the LGBT community where you could be heard without discrimination or judgment. She said she has not been in the right frame of mind currently to consider dating or a relationship but she met two people. She met one person at a party and another through the 519 group sessions. The claimant said she is currently just trying to cope with her mental health issues and the lack of family supports is very difficult for her.\n\n[34] To corroborate her SOGIESC profile, she submitted a letter from XXXX and the content is materially consistent with her narrative and testimony. She also submitted a letter from the 519 and photos of herself and XXXX.[26] An affidavit from her mother also corroborates the claimant\u2019 s testimony about her SOGIESC.[27] The claimant also submitted a medical report to corroborate her mental health issues which mentions depression and treatment from a counsellor.[28]\n\nCredibility conclusion\n\n[35] While there is a concern about the misrepresentation in the claimant\u2019s study permit, the remaining credible evidence set out above overcomes this credibility concern regarding the study permit. There is sufficient credible evidence to establish the claimant\u2019 s profile as a bisexual woman.\n\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution\n\n[36] The objective evidence is consistent with the claimant\u2019s account of fearing persecution as a bisexual woman in Nigeria.\n\n[37] A U.K. Home Office report states that Nigeria tends to perform poorly on gender inclusiveness indices. Women generally remained marginalized. Many customary practices did not recognize a woman\u2019s right to inherit her husband\u2019s property and many widows became destitute when their in-laws took virtually all the deceased husband\u2019s property.[29]\n\n[38] According to the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade report, despite constitutional protections, gender-based discrimination and violence remains a significant risk for women and girls. Nigeria remains a patriarchal society in many respects.[30] Several federal and state laws criminalize same-sex sexual acts and there are no laws explicitly protecting sexual minorities from targeted violence or discrimination. Maximum penalties are 14 years imprisonment. There are widely reported cases in recent years in which LGBTI individuals have been arrested based on their perceived sexual orientation or gender identity.[31] All socioeconomic groups in Nigeria hold negative views of homosexuality and LGBTI persons can face job loss, being compelled to leave their village or neighbourhood or being subjected to violence.[32]\n\n[39] A Netherlands source also notes that same-sex marriage is prohibited and Islamic criminal law criminalizes sex between individuals of the same sex. Members of the LGBTI community do not enjoy legal protection against discrimination despite some slight improvement in recent years.[33] Discrimination and gender-based violence against women are a common and widespread phenomenon in Nigeria, and the authorities again largely failed to protect women against these forms of violence during the reporting period.[34] Inheritance law is based on a system in which inheritances are reserved for male descendants. Both land ownership and customary law exclude women from property ownership and a widow\u2019 s land is usually seized by family members.[35]\n\n[40] The U.S. Department of State report says that significant human rights abuses included the existence or use of laws criminalizing consensual same-sex sexual conduct between adults and forced marriage.[36]\n\n[41] A response to information request about forced marriage says that consequences of refusing to marry include neglect and ostracism, physical violence and rape. Forced marriage is protected by legislation.[37]\n\nState Protection\n\n[42] A state, unless in a condition of complete breakdown, is presumed to be capable of protecting its citizens. To rebut the presumption of state protection, a claimant must provide clear and convincing evidence.\n\n[43] Given that the state is the agent of persecution, I find that it would be objectively unreasonable for the claimant to seek the protection of the state in her circumstances, and that adequate state protection would not be reasonably forthcoming\n\nInternal Flight Alternative\n\n[44] Given that the state is the agent of persecution with control over the entire country, I find that there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout Nigeria and therefore a viable IFA does not exist.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[45] Having considered all the evidence, I find that there is a serious possibility that the claimant would face persecution in Nigeria. I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee and I accept her claim.\n\n(signed) Avril Cardoso\nOctober 26, 2022\n\n[1] Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27, as amended, sections 96 and 97(1).\n\n[2] Exhibit 2.\n\n[3] Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 4: Gender Considerations in Proceedings before the Immigration and Refugee Board, Guidelines Issued by the Chairperson pursuant to section 159(1)(h) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, effective July 18, 2022.\n\n[4] Guideline 9 on Proceedings before the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada involving Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Expression and Sex Characteristics, issued by the Chairperson pursuant to paragraph 159(1)(h) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, effective as of May 1, 2017, revised December 17, 2021 (the \u201cSOGIESC Guideline\u201d or \u201cGuideline 9\u201d).\n\n[5] Exhibit 12.\n\n[6] Exhibit 12, pp. 8 and 9.\n\n[7] Exhibits 1 and 10.\n\n[8] Manege v.

Hamilton\nCountry: Sri Lanka\nRPD Number: TC1-05389\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2023-01023\nATIP Pages: N\/A\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n\n[1] The claimant, XXXX (the \u201cclaimant\u201d) claims to be a citizen of Sri Lanka and is claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).[1]\n\nALLEGATIONS\n\n[2] The details of the claimant\u2019 s allegations are set out in his Basis of Claim (\u201cBOC\u201d) form.[2]\n\n[3] The 27-year-old male Sinhalese claimant fears persecution by the government because of imputed support of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) arising from his activities in Canada. Specifically, he joined two cricket teams consisting of primarily players of Tamil origin and the Tiger flag is displayed at team events.\n\nDETERMINATION\n\n[4] I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee under section 96 based on imputed political opinion.\n\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n\n[5] The claimant has established his persona! and national identity based on his passport, national identity card and testimony.[3]\n\nCredibility\n\n[6] The claimant benefits from the rebuttable presumption of truth.\n\nBackground facts\n\n[7] The claimant came to Canada on XXXX, 2017 based on a study permit to attend XXXX College. He returned to Sri Lanka on XXXX,2018 to visit family and was detained by Sri Lanka authorities. He returned to Canada on XXXX 2018 and claimed protection on XXXX, 2020.\n\nThe claimant is Sinhalese\n\n[8] I find that the claimant is a Sinhalese Buddhist. His birth certificate[4] indicates that both his parents are Sinhalese and I accept his testimony that he is a Buddhist.\n\nThe claimant was detained in XXXX 2018\n\n[9] I find that the claimant was detained by the authorities in Sri Lanka on XXXX, 2018 and held until XXXX, 2018. Although his refugee claim forms indicate he was detained from XXXX to XXXX, 2018 he insisted it was XXXX and that he clearly remembers this date clearly. He said he confirmed this in his first interview. The claimant testified that he returned to Sri Lanka on XXXX 2018 and the next week, Criminal Investigation Division (CID) officers came to his home and searched his phone and his room. He said they informed him that they saw pictures of his activities with Tamil people and then took him to the 4th Floor CID office. He said he was put in an empty room containing a table and a chair and he was handcuffed. The claimant testified that he was questioned about his connections to the LTTE. He said he spoke with his father on the second day and was released with a warning that his activities in the diaspora would be under surveillance. The claimant testified that he obtained medical treatment at the XXXX hospital on XXXX, 2018. He described hearing loss likely stemming from a slap\/punch on his jaw and wrist injuries from being handcuffed. He said he was prescribed pain killers and rest.\n\n[10] The claimant\u2019s testimony was spontaneous and materially consistent with his narrative. It was corroborated by supporting documents, specifically, a medical report which describes treatment and injuries consistent with the claimant\u2019s testimony.[5]\n\nDelay claiming protection is not credibly explained\n\n[11] The claimant arrived in Canada on XXXX, 2018 and made his claim for protection on October 1, 2020. When asked to explain this apparent delay, he testified that he planned to study here until_XXXX, 2019. He said he did not complete the four-semester XXXX program because he was worried and his mental state was not conducive to studying. He said he was gathering information about regularizing his status in Canada and was vigilant about the situation in Sri Lanka. He also said he needed to work to pay for legal fees. He said once Gotabaya Rajapaksa came into office in November 2019, he decided to make a claim for protection. He said the pandemic delayed his efforts. When I pointed out that pandemic restrictions did not come into effect until March 2020, he said he was collecting information from friends about filing a claim for protection. He admitted that he did not have status in Canada from XXXX 2019 until October 2020. In response to counsel\u2019s questions, the claimant elaborated about his information gathering efforts and said he spoke with the community, friends and advisors. He said that he heard that only Tamil claims for protection were successful.\n\n[12] I find that the claimant\u2019s explanation for this delay is not credible. His testimony lacked detail and evolved as he was questioned. For example, regarding the timing of the pandemic which he blamed for some delay. The claimant\u2019s study visa was valid until XXXX, 2019 and he remained in Canada for over a year without status. He did not credibly explain why he did not take steps to secure his immigration status from XXXX 2019 until February\/March 2020 when the pandemic restrictions took effect. I find this failure to act detracts from his subjective fear.\n\nThe claimant faces a forward risk based on sur place activities in Canada\n\n[13] The claimant testified that he attended a protest in Mississauga near XXXX opposing Gotabaya Rajapaksa \u2013 Aragalaya protest. He said the protests occurred from August to September 2022 and the objective was to pressure Gotabaya Rajapaksa to resign. The claimant said the protests started in Sri Lanka and many countries around the world joined this movement in solidarity with Sri Lanka. He said he attended twice and said there was live media and social media coverage of the event. The claimant also testified about attending the Mullivaikal Remembrance event in May 2018 and again in 2019 to remember those who died in the civil war. He said this event was held at the XXXX. The claimant said he had many Tamil friends who passed away and he was invited to attend as he is closely associated with the Tamil community. When asked about his interest in Tamils, the claimant testified that he grew up in XXXX with Tamil people. He said many Tamils settled in XXXX from the North. He said he had Tamil and Muslim friends. The claimant said his mother was a XXXX and XXXX to many Tamil and Muslim children which fostered his connected with Tamil children.\n\n[14] The claimant also provided testimony about his activities with two cricket clubs in Canada which are primarily patronized by Tamil people. He said he has posted pictures of various tournaments and team events on social media and submitted some of his social media posts. He said that he has not posted after coming back to Canada in XXXX 2018 out of fear and because the authorities had discovered his social media posts when he was detained in\nXXXX 2018. He said that the Sri Lankan government viewed the display of the Tiger flag at the cricket events as an anti-government view and intention to rebuild the LTTE. The claimant said the flag has no meaning to him and he just enjoys playing cricket.\n\n[15] The claimant also testified that the authorities visited his mother on XXXX, 2022 and she was questioned about the claimant\u2019 s attendance at the Aragalaya protest in Canada. He said this event was widely televised on television and social media which was likely how his attendance was discovered.\n\n[16] I find that the claimant has credibly established his attendance at the Aragalaya protest in XXXX 2022. He has also established that his social media posts related to cricket tournament and associated events where the Tiger flag was prominently displayed would have drawn concern from the authorities who would have perceived this as an expression of anti\u00ad\ngovernment opinion and support for the LTTE. The claimant submitted a statement from his mother, letters from two cricket clubs he plays with and social media posts which include the Tiger flag in the background.[6]\n\nCredibility conclusion\n\n[17] Despite the credibility concerns regarding the claimant\u2019s delay in claiming protection, he has credibly established his detention in Sri Lanka and his sur place activities in Canada with the Tamil diaspora. I give more weight to the credible evidence as it goes to the core of his claim.\n\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution\n\n[18] The claimant\u2019s fear of deportation to Sri Lanka has an objective basis and is well- founded. He was detained upon return to Sri Lanka in XXXX 2018. The authorities were aware of his activities with the Tamil cricket teams including photos where the Tiger flag was displayed. His mother was questioned in XXXX 2022 after his attendance at a protest in Canada. Taken together, it is likely that the claimant would be of interest to the authorities upon return and a record of his past detention would likely come to light.\n\n[19] After Gotabaya Rajapaksa took power in November 2019, progress towards accountability and human rights deteriorated and a return to past decades of widespread human rights violations was feared.[7] It is reported that authorities monitor public gatherings including at memorialization events. Participants in public gatherings are often photographed. Intelligence agencies also monitor links to foreign groups including some in the Tamil diaspora.[8] The Sri Lankan government may perceive attendance ag meetings and demonstrations, holding flags or banners displaying the LTTE emblem or attendance at commemorative events and any presence on social media as anti-government which may trigger official harassment upon return.[9] According to this source, Sri Lankan security forces maintain effective control throughout Sri Lanka and individuals are unlikely able to relocate internally with anonymity.[10]\n\n[20] The U.S. Department of State report states that significant human rights issued included torture, arbitrary arrest and detention and politically motivated reprisals against individuals in other countries. Perpetrators operated with effective impunity.[11]\n\n[21] Amnesty International notes that the government continued its crackdown on dissent and reports excessive use of force. The Prevention of Terrorism Act continued to be used to target critics from minority communities through arbitrary arrests and prolonged detention without judicial oversight.[12]\n\n[22] Another research reports states that non-Tamils who express support for or raise Tamil issues are branded as Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) sympathizers.[13]\n\n[23] Another research reports states that the Sri Lankan government perceives political activities by members of the Tamil diaspora as a primary threat to territorial integrity and national security. This source states that the authorities conflate advocating for Tamil issues with LTTE resurgence and Tamil separatism. Sri Lanka\u2019s embassies are heavily invested in carrying out surveillance of Tamil communities in the diaspora including taking photographs at demonstrations.[14] According to this source, returnees who sought asylum are seen as traitors. There is also a stop list containing arrests and detentions and a watch list for surveillance which is accessible at the airport.[15]\n\nState Protection\n\n[24] There is a presumption of state protection unless a state is in a condition of complete breakdown. This presumption is rebutted with clear and convincing evidence.\n\n[25] Given that the state is the agent of persecution, I find that it would be objectively unreasonable for the claimant to seek the protection of the state in his circumstances, and adequate state protection would not be reasonably forthcoming.\n\nInternal Flight Alternative (IFA)\n\n[26] Given that the state is the agent of persecution with control over the entire country, I find that there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout Sri Lanka and therefore a viable IFA does not exist.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[27] Having considered all the evidence, I find that there is a serious possibility that the claimant would face persecution in Sri Lanka. I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee and I accept his claim.\n\n(signed) Avril Cardoso\n\nDecember 8, 2022\n[1] Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27, as amended.\n[2] Exhibit 2.\n[3] Exhibit 4 and 8.\n[4] Exhibit 7, p. 14.\n[5] Exhibit 8, p. 14.\n[6] Exhibit 7, pp. 49, 50, 51, 53 and Exhibit 8, pp. 1-2 pp. 10-14.\n[7] Exhibit 3, National Documentation Package (NDP) on Sri Lanka (May 31, 2022), Item 1.9 at para. 2.5.\n[8] Exhibit 3, National Documentation Package (NDP) on Sri Lanka (May 31, 2022), Item 1.9 at paras. 3.9 and 3.10.\n[9] Exhibit 3, National Documentation Package (NDP) on Sri Lanka (May 31, 2022), Item 1.9 at para. 3.54.\n[10] Exhibit 3, National Documentation Package (NDP) on Sri Lanka (May 31, 2022), Item 1.9 at para 5.14.\n[11] Exhibit 3, National Documentation Package (NDP) on Sri Lanka (May 31, 2022), Item 2.1 p. 2.\n[12] Exhibit 3, National Documentation Package (NDP) on Sri Lanka (May 31, 2022), Item 2.2 p. 1.\n[13] Exhibit 3, National Documentation Package (NDP) on Sri Lanka (May 31, 2022), Item 13.1, p. 20.\n[14] Exhibit 3, National Documentation Package (NDP) on Sri Lanka (May 31, 2022), Item 14.7 at pp. 2, 3\n[15] Exhibit 3, National Documentation Package (NDP) on Sri Lanka (May 31, 2022), Item 14.7 at p. 4.\n\n",

He is claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (\u201cIRPA\u201d)[i]. The claimant alleges to be a citizen of India.\n[2] The claimant was not represented by counsel at the hearing. At the first sitting, he requested, and was granted, time to find new representation after his previous counsel withdrew from the case a month prior to the hearing date. However, in resumption he indicated he was unable to retain new counsel due to financial issues, and that he was comfortable to proceed on his own. While a claimant has a right to counsel, it is not an absolute right, and a particular claimant may proceed by choice without representation if the panel is satisfied that there is otherwise no breach of natural justice. Nonetheless, the panel informed the claimant it would try to use plain language or provide an explanation for certain terms and reminded him he may speak up if he did not understand at any point.\nDETERMINATION\n[3] The panel finds the claimant to be a Convention refugee, and that he faces a serious possibility of persecution should he return to India, on account of membership in a particular social group.\nALLEGATIONS\n[4] The specifics of the claim are set out in the narrative of the claimant\u2019s Basis of Claim Form[ii]. To summarize, the claimant alleges that he fears persecution due to the sentence of honour killing imposed upon him by the elders of the Khap Panchayat (\u201cKhaps\u201d) in his village. He said this came about after his fianc\u00e9 died XXXX and her brothers blamed him for causing her\ndeath after the couple continued to see each other despite being restricted by rules that prohibit inter-clan (gotra) marriages between people considered to be related due to sharing the same family name. He indicated this was enforced among the members of his Jat caste by the Khaps in the surrounding villages of his area. He and his fianc\u00e9 refused to comply with this rule and continued their relationship, even through her diagnosis and treatment, until the day she passed. After her death, he testified that her brothers misrepresented facts to the elders and paid a bribe in order to obtain a death sentence on him as retribution. He further alleges that he faces a risk of honour killing among his Jat community as they would be obligated to report his whereabouts wherever they see him anywhere in the country.\nIDENTITY\n[5] The personal identity of the claimant as a citizen of India has been established, on a balance of probabilities, by a copy of his Indian passport[iii].\nNEXUS\n[6] The panel finds there is a nexus between the harm the claimant fears and a Convention ground, namely membership in a particular social group as a member of the Jat caste who faces a sentence of honour killing from the Khap Panchayat of his village.\nCREDIBILITY\n[7] The panel finds the claimant to be a credible and trustworthy witness. His testimony was straightforward, genuine, and unembellished. There were no relevant inconsistencies, contradictions, or omissions that went to the heart of his claim. Therefore, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, his allegations to be true.\nSame-Gotra Marriage Prohibition\n[8] The claimant testified that he met and fell in love with a woman named XXXX (\u201cXXXX\u201d) at his workplace back in 2007. He was a XXXX at a college, and she was a XXXX who often went to the library to work and take out books. The couple lived about 25 km apart in their respective villages, and their relationship slowly blossomed over time to the point when he\nproposed marriage to her on XXXX in 2008. Prior to this, they were discreet as it was uncommon for young people to date for love without parental involvement in arranged relationships.\n[9] When he finally decided to inform his family after his proposal, his father told him that XXXX mother has the family name XXXX which is shared by those on the maternal side of his family. Because of this, he and XXXX are considered to be from the same clan, or \u201cgotra\u201d, and are prohibited to marry by rules of the Khap Panchayat because they are considered to be brother and sister. When asked, the claimant explained that these ancient rules were created a long time ago to avoid possible incest among villagers who lived in close proximity to each other. In his village, his Khap is part of the Satrol Khap that encompasses multiple villages in a large area so the same-gotra marriage prohibition applies to every villager that falls under it jurisdiction. The same rules governing gotras are also prevalent among his Jat caste, which represents about 60% of people in his state of Haryana and comprise a large percentage of people in Northern India with a smaller but consistent number throughout the country. The Jats consists of about 30 to 40 million people in South Asia, spread across religions and languages.\n[10] Despite this, the claimant said he did not accept the ancient edict that stood in his way of marrying the woman he loved. He spoke to XXXX whom he said confirmed her maternal family name XXXX. XXXX had only told her mother about accepting the proposal in secret, and was informed of the gotra prohibition. Family members of both sides denied approval for the couple to be married. The claimant said they agreed to put off a wedding and continued to date discreetly. They would meet clandestinely in a shed among the farm fields near his village every couple of weeks. However, XXXX brothers soon learned of her secret meetings with him from villagers, and began to target him. On XXXX, 2008 he was dropping her off at a bus stop after work when a group of local young men beat him and told him to stay away from her. He ignored their threat and continued to see her. A year later in XXXX 2009, he testified that he was fired from his XXXX job due to the influence of the college chairman who was from XXXX village and was familiar with her family.\n[11] In late 2009, XXXX discovered a XXXX and went for medical examination at which she was diagnosed with XXXX She underwent a mastectomy and began chemotherapy treatments. Over the next several years, the claimant said it was a challenge due to his emotional turmoil over her illness and her health limits making it difficult for them to meet as she had to take frequent leaves from her employment. Her family was also keeping a more vigilant eye on her because of her medical condition, and her brothers became more protective, especially as her situation worsened and the XXXX. The family had used their political influence to have the claimant\u2019s job terminated in 2019, for which he filed a labour claim against his former employer on XXXX, 2019.\n[12] XXXX passed away on XXXX, 2019, which unleased her family\u2019s anger on the claimant. After her funeral, her brothers called a meeting at the Khap Panchayat on XXXX with his family. The claimant said his father was worried that he may not be safe, and advised him to be hiding instead of attending the meeting with the family. Afterwards, his father told him XXXX brothers lied to the XXXX and XXXX elders that he and XXXX were secretly married against the same-gotra prohibition. The Panchayat sentenced the claimant to death to restore XXXX family honour, and banned his entire family from the village for two years effective immediately. His family moved to a village named XXXX about 60 km away, and he hid at a friend\u2019s home until he was able to leave for Canada on XXXX, 2020.\n[13] The claimant provided the following documents as evidence:\nAffidavit dated February 11, 2022 by a family friend and neighbour XXXX describing the claimant\u2019 s relationship with XXXX, the couple belonging in the same gotra and Jat caste, the prohibition for the two to marry, the Panchayat\u2019 s death sentence to him, and for all members of\nthe Khap and caste to be on the lookout for the claimant so XXXX family can carry out the honour killing[iv];\n\u00b7 Photos of XXXX[v];\n\u00b7 Labour claim report dated XXXX, 2019 filed by the claimant against his former employer for misconduct during his employment[vi];\n\u00b7 Documents showing his prior employments and XXXX educational credentials per his testimony[vii].\nThe panel finds these documents to be credible and trustworthy and gives them full weight in support of the claimant\u2019 s allegations in his claim.\n[14] The panel asked why the claimant did not disclose more proof, especially probative\nevidence about XXXX, the gotra prohibition, and what had happened throughout the relationship as he had spoken to in testimony. The claimant said he wasn\u2019t aware what type of evidence he was required to provide. Due to his dispute with his previous counsel that left him without ongoing benefit of legal advice, the panel deems his explanation reasonable and accepts it. Moreover, in light of the claimant\u2019s overall credibility, the panel will not draw a negative inference from a lack of more corroborating evidence.\nProspective Fear\n[15] When asked what he fears should he return to India, the claimant said he is afraid of XXXX family because her brothers would go so far as to lie about him being secretly married to her in defiance of the gotra rules to obtain a death sentence from the Khap Panchayat. He believes the brothers have the intention to carry out the honour killing against him. He further testified that her family continues to ask about him, most recently three months ago to his paternal uncle who still resides in his village.\n[16] The claimant has established, on a balance of probabilities, that he has developed a relationship with a woman from a nearby village that belonged in the same gotra as his family; that as a result he was prevented from being married to her due to the prohibition imposed by his Khap Panchayat; that the couple continued to see each other romantically in spite ofthis rule; that the relationship angered her family and the claimant had been threatened and lost his jobs due to political influence by her brothers; that she later died XXXX and her brothers lied to the Panchayat elders that he secretly married her against the rule; that he was sentenced to death as a penalty with his family banished from the village for two years; and that he believes he would face the risk of honour killing should he return to India.\n[17] For the above reasons, the panel finds that the claimant has established subjective fear of persecution based on membership in a particular social group.\nOBJECTIVE BASIS\n[18] The National Documentation Package (\u201cNDP\u201d) for India indicates that a Khap Panchayat is an assembly of elders; it has no official government recognition or authority, but can exert significant social influence within the community it represents[viii]. Members of Khap Panchayats are all male, though they often make decisions affecting women[ix]. In some parts of the country, informal social systems like the male-only Khap Panchayats (or Khaps) pass decisions and judgements on marriage, based on traditions[x]. They are mainly found in Haryana and parts of Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Madhya Pradesh[xi]. Punishments in marriage cases include fines, social ostracism, public humiliation and expulsion from the village[xii]. Risk of violence that can result in death of one or both of the parties to the mixed marriage is higher in communities in which Khap Panchayats operate[xiii]. Despite the Supreme Court ruling against the practice, intrusions by Khaps to stop a legal marriage between consenting adults continue[xiv]. Analysts have claimed there is a lack of political will to act against Khap Panchayats given their influence over large numbers of voters[xv].\n[19] Khap panchayats \u2013 unelected, extrajudicial councils of 5 to 15 elderly men that have a lot of local authority in some villages \u2013 have been known to illegally sanction or order honour crimes against couples for inter-caste marriages, inter-religious marriages, and marriages of people within the same gotra (clan)[xvi]. The Law Commission of India advised that Khap Panchayats assume to themselves the power and authority to declare on and deal with \u201cobjectionable\u201d matrimonies, but that such authority is unlawful[xvii].\n[20] Unofficial village caste councils, called Khap Panchayats, in several north Indian states such as Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, and Rajasthan operate as moral police, wielding control over society, including women\u2019s behavior[xviii]. They are known to issue edicts condemning couples for marrying outside their caste or religion and condemn marriages within a kinship group (gotra), considered incestuous even though there is no biological connection[xix]. To enforce these decrees and break up such relationships, family members have threatened couples, filed false cases of abduction, and killed spouses to protect the family\u2019s \u201chonour\u201d[xx]. The practice persists even though the Supreme Court of India has declared such actions by Khap Panchayats to be \u201cwholly illegal\u201d in April 2011[xxi]. Local politicians and police are often sympathetic or turn a blind eye to the councils\u2019 edicts, implicitly supporting the violence[xxii].\n[21] In spite of court rulings and legal opinions, Khap Panchayats continue to exist, and even appear to have institutional support. An article dated January 10, 2020 submitted by the claimant from the Indian English newspaper Deccan Herald states: \u201cIn a state infamous for outlandish diktats by Khap panchayats, Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Friday publicly lend credence to \u2018Khap ideology\u2019 that vehemently opposes \u2018same gotra\u2019 marriages and nuptial knots solemnized within the same village\u201d[xxiii]. The chief minister\u2019s statement not only conflicts with the law, but he went further to indicate that Khaps in his state were being defamed and that people should not enter same-gotra marriages[xxiv]. Khattar added: \u201cKhaps have been talking about this. It\u2019s also been scientifically proven that same gotra marriage should not be solemnized. Haryana has certain traditions that live on, even as there is some contradiction with the constitution on this, which needs public education. Education is given to children in villages against this so that brother\u00adsister bhaichara (brotherhood) is maintained\u201d[xxv]. Under the law, there is no restriction to consenting adults to engage into any form of marriage, regardless of caste, creed, village bounds, or gotra[xxvi]. There were even cases in Punjab and Haryana High Court that intervened to help runaway couples who were restricted by prohibition on same gotra marriages from \u201cself-styled groups\u201d that have passed diktats declaring married couples who enter such a union as brother and sister[xxvii].\n[22] This type of rhetoric from state officials entrench the phenomenon that could lead to honour crimes, which may occur as a result of inter-caste marriages, interreligious marriages, marrying within the same \u201cgotra\u201d (clan, kinship group), inter-class marriages, or marriages against parents\u2019 wishes[xxviii]. Male family members, which could include a parent, brothers, cousin, and uncle, are typically the perpetrators, but they are often supported by members of the community, and are sometimes motivated because the victim went against the will of the community as well as the family[xxix]. Honour crimes occur in all sectors of society, all communities, all religions, and all castes in India; they reportedly occur in both urban and rural areas, although sources indicate that they are more frequent in rural areas[xxx]. Honour killings remain a problem, especially in Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, and Haryana[xxxi]. On August 21, 2017, the Supreme Court sought suggestions from NGO Shakti Vahini and Khap Panchayats on ways to prevent harassment and killings of young couples in the name of family honour[xxxii]. The most common justification for the killings cited by the accused or by their relatives was that the victim married against her family\u2019s wishes[xxxiii].\n[23] Based on the claimant\u2019s evidence and the country conditions cited above, the panel finds that his subjective fear has an objective basis, and that he faces a serious possibility of persecution in India. Therefore, the panel finds that the claimant has a well-founded fear of persecution in the country.\nSTATE PROTECTION\n[24] There is a presumption that states are capable of protecting their own citizens. However, a claimant can rebut the presumption of state protection and demonstrate that they would not receive such protection by providing clear and convincing evidence of the unwillingness or inability of the state to protect them.\n[25] According to the NDP for India, family members often perpetrate acts of honour-based violence against individuals with other relatives, friends or a certain body of persons like the caste or Khap or community-based Panchayats; in some cases, Khap Panchayats are the main perpetrators[xxxiv]. Caste Panchayat, Khap Panchayat, or Katta Kanchayat encourage honour killings or other atrocities in an institutionalized way on boys and girls of different castes and religion[xxxv]. Sources indicate that Khap Panchayats are found in the following states: Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana[xxxvi]. Honour killings are usually not even registered by the police as caste-based crimes[xxxvii]. Even when cases are reported, perpetrators get out of jail on bail within a few months[xxxviii].\n[26] Human Rights Watch found that in multiple cases in Haryana victims did not report a case or turned hostile during trial because of the pressure from the councils[xxxix]. Victims often find police are initially reluctant to file an FIR or have the survivors medically examined, and are soon forced to leave their village due to harassment and threats from the Khap Panchayat[xl]. US Country Reports 2018 indicates that the Supreme Court also ordered state-level governments to take remedial, preventive and punitive actions to stop honour killings and create special cells in all districts to report harassment and threats to inter-caste couples[xli]. Still, when couples are in need of help, they want to go to the police station, but they are fearful of doing so[xlii].\n[27] Based upon the claimant\u2019s credible testimony and the objective evidence cited above, the panel is satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that the presumption for him has been successfully rebutted with clear and convincing evidence. The panel therefore finds that state protection in India is inadequate and would not be reasonably forthcoming for him.\nINTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE\n[28] The panel has considered whether a viable internal flight alternative (\u201cIFA\u201d) exists for the claimant in India, and finds he does not have a reasonable IFA anywhere in India. He testified that as Indian, he cannot keep his caste identity a secret and that word of his death sentence by the Khap Panchayat would have spread among the Jat community. As such, the panel is satisfied by his argument.\n[29] In assessing an IFA, the panel must apply a two-pronged test cited in Rasaratnam with respect to its safety and reasonableness[xliii]. One of the prongs must be satisfied to find that the claimant does not have an IFA. The burden of proof rests with a claimant to show that they do not have an IFA. The finding of an IFA must be based on a distinct evaluation of a region for that purpose, taking into account the claimant\u2019 s identity. An IFA must be a realistic and attainable option. The claimant cannot be required to encounter great physical danger or to undergo undue hardship in traveling there or staying there.\n[30] In India, certain procedural hurdles under the law reportedly are difficult to meet for persons who wish to keep their marriage secret or who wish to elope because it requires public announcement ahead of the marriage allowing for public objections to be made[xliv]. All couples who marry in a civil ceremony are required to give 30 days of public notice in advance of their marriage for public comment, which includes their addresses, photographs, and religious affiliation[xlv]. Although the law permits inter-marriages, they are seen as a complete disjuncture with what Indian society believes is acceptable or morally right[xlvi]. A majority of marriages in India are still arranged by family[xlvii]. Sources report violence against intermixed couples, including honour killings being carried out by caste-based local councils called Khap Panchayats, mainly in the north of India, in rural areas[xlviii]. Honour killings remained a problem, especially in Haryana, Punjab, and Uttar Pradesh[xlix]. In 2018, the Supreme Court declared it illegal for Khap Panchayats to attempt to end marriages between consenting adults and called for punitive action against village councils that impose punishments, including murder, on prohibited couples[l].\n[31] Couples in \u201clove marriages\u201d from rural areas often attempt to move to a large city to seek anonymity[li]. Nevertheless, when a couple faces community pressure, they are ostracized and must relocate; they typically move to a larger city, where they often encounter difficulties finding work and housing due to a lack of personal networks in the area[lii]. In Indian cities and neighbourhoods, people actively seek to know each other\u2019s business in which couples spoke of being questioned about their marriage by neighbours or employers, and of families that would find them after moving because the parents had relatives or friends in the police force[liii]. Couples who relocate to a large city may change their names or hide their identity when trying to rent housing or encounter difficulty renting as an inter-caste couple[liv]. Factors impacting a mixed couple\u2019s ability to move to a larger city include the following: Financial capacity; degree to which the family has power and determination to locate the couple; educational background and employable skills; availability of a personal support network of friends or relatives; and whether they appear \u201cvisibly different\u201d[lv].\n[32] Indian law does not cover situations where discrimination on various grounds is practised in private sector organisations including clubs, societies, NGOs, educational institutions, hospitals, and Khap Panchayats (assemblies of male elders who assert considerable influence over village\/clan affairs)[lvi]. Indian law does not cover discriminatory attitudes based on marital status, caste-affiliation, sexual orientation, disability, religion or food preferences[lvii].\n[33] The claimant said wherever he may relocate in India, he will eventually be identified via his Jat caste as he cannot keep that hidden among Indian society. Even though the Jat community is most prominent in the northern states, there are about an average of 3% of Jat people, which number about 30 to 40 million in South Asia, throughout the country in other states. The death sentence imposed on him was from the Satrol Khap in his state of Haryana, but it is applicable across the Jat community nationwide. He may not be found out immediately, but eventually someone from his caste may learn of the sentence and by duty must inform the Panchayat elders from his village, which will in turn notify XXXX family. Her brothers are angry about her death and blame him for it for carrying on a relationship in secret for years. They will not stop at seeking him out to kill him to restore honour to their family.\n[34] On the evidence presented, including the objective documentation in the NDP, the panel finds that there is a serious possibility that the claimant would be persecuted or that he would be subjected, on a balance of probabilities, to a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or a danger of torture in India under the first prong. Since the claimant has met the burden of satisfying the first prong, there is no need to assess the second prong. As such, the panel concludes there is no viable IFA for him in the country.\nCONCLUSION\n[35] For the reasons above, the panel concludes that the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of IRPA.\n[36] Therefore, the panel accepts his claim.\n(signed) A.

The claims were heard jointly pursuant to Rule 55 of the Refugee Protection Division Rules.1\n\nALLEGATIONS\n\n[3] The allegations of these claims are found in the claimants\u2019 Basis of Claim forms.ii In short, the claimants allege a risk to their lives from members of the paramilitary group Los Rastrojos. They allege that they are being targeted by Los Rastrojos for the following reasons. The principal claimant\u2019s niece was sexually assaulted by N, a member of this group. N was imprisoned by state authorities for approximately XXXX. Following his release, N continued persecuting the principal claimant\u2019s niece and her mother, S. They fled Colombia together in XXXX 2019. When N was no longer able to locate the principal claimant\u2019 s niece and S, he began persecuting the claimants, together with the other members of Los Rastrojos.\n\n[4] The claimants approached state authorities for assistance. However, they did not receive protection, despite making multiple requests for the same.\n\n[5] The claimants fled Colombia to the United States in XXXX 2021. They entered Canada approximately 10 days later and made their claims.\n\nDETERMINATION\n\n[6] I determine that the claimants are Convention refugees, due to their membership in the particular social group of family members of women facing gender-related persecution.\n\n[7] In making this determination, I have considered all the evidence, including the oral testimony, documentary evidence entered as exhibits, and counsel\u2019 s submissions.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nIdentity\n\n[8] The claimants\u2019 personal identities as citizens of Colombia are established on a balance of probabilities by their Colombian passports.iii\n\nNexus\n\n[9] The claimants were targeted by members of Los Rastrojos because they are the family members of Sand her daughter. These members of Los Rastrojos have a personal vendetta against S and her daughter because one of their members, N, was imprisoned for committing sexual assault against S\u2019 s daughter.\n\n[10] Accordingly, the claimants have established a link to a Convention ground, due to their membership in the particular social group of family members of women facing gender-related persecution.\n\nCredibility\n\n[11] In assessing the credibility of the evidence presented by the claimants, I was cognizant of the Federal Court of Appeal in Maldonado wherein the Court stated, in part, that \u201cwhen a claimant swears to the truth of certain allegations, this creates a presumption that those allegations are true unless there be reason to doubt their truthfulness.\u201div\n\n[12] I find the claimants to be credible witnesses. They were straightforward, detailed, and spontaneous. Their testimony was in keeping with their Basis of Claim forms. There were no inconsistencies or contradictions that were not satisfactorily explained.\n\n[13] Furthermore, their personal documents corroborate their credible testimony, and I did not find reason to doubt the genuineness of these documents.\n\n[14] The claimants provided detailed testimony regarding the following events:\nThe claimants were living together in Cali. The principal claimant learned from S that her daughter had been sexually assaulted by N. He further learned that state authorities pressed charges against N. He was later imprisoned for XXXX. After he was released from prison, S and her daughter fled Colombia in XXXX 2019. Subsequently, the principal claimant received several phone calls from a person who stated that she is a member of Los Rastrojos and is looking for S. The principal claimant did not provide any information about S to this person. The principal claimant was approached by N in XXXX 2020 at a local park. N asked about S. However, the principal claimant refused to give him any information. This led to an altercation between them. N tried to overpower the principal claimant, but was unable to. The principal claimant later returned home. He called S and described the appearance of N to her, and S identified him to be N. S asked the principal claimant not to provide any information to N. One week later, the principal claimant was in his vehicle when he was approached by an individual on a motorcycle who yelled at him and said that if he doesn\u2019t disclose the whereabouts of S, then he will be killed. The principal claimant drove away and managed to lose the motorcyclist. Upon returning home, he told his partner what had happened. Fearing persecution, they decided to relocate to the home of the principal claimant\u2019 s sister who resides in the City of Palmira. They relocated the day after the incident with the motorcyclist. The principal claimant tried to make a report in-person to state authorities in XXXX 2021. However, he was directed to make his report online. He then made his report by email. Shortly thereafter, the principal claimant\u2019 s partner was pursued by a vehicle. However, she managed to escape. The principal claimant then received an email from state authorities which stated that his case had been archived, as the investigation had been completed, without any results. The principal claimant sent an urgent online request, asking that his case be reopened immediately. However, state authorities failed to response to his request. On XXXX 2021, the principal claimant received a phone call from J, a well\u00adknown member of Los Rastrojos. J told him that N has ordered that the principal claimant and his family be \u2018made into small pieces\u2019. J further said that they are aware that the principal claimant is hiding in Palmira with his family, and there is nowhere in Colombia that they will be able to hide from Los Rastrojos. The principal claimant made an emergency call to the police. The police officer he spoke to told him that he has \u201cmore important things to do\u201d. The principal claimant was told to contact the Prosecutor\u2019 s Office to ask that his case be re\u00ad opened. The claimants submitted an online request to re-open their case. The claimants decided to flee from Colombia because they were not receiving protection from state authorities. The claimants entered the US on XXXX 2021. Shortly thereafter, they entered Canada and made their claims. Subsequently, during XXXX 2021, the principal claimant\u2019 s sister, M, received several threatening phone calls, as well as a visit to her home from members of Los Rastrojos on XXXX, 2021. They ransacked her home, physically abused her, and demanded to know the whereabouts of the principal claimant. She told them that he has left Colombia. Following this incident, M relocated within Colombia.\n[15] The claimants provided extensive supporting documentation to support their claims. At Exhibit 5 are copies of emails and documents from the Prosecutor\u2019s Office that corroborate that the claimants sought state protection, however, their case was prematurely closed.\n\n[16] At Exhibit 5 are also detailed letters of support from friends and family members of the claimants. In addition, the claimants have provided an online article published by the Prosecutor\u2019s Office, regarding the imprisonment of J for drug-related activities.\n\n[17] Upon review, I did not find reason to doubt the authenticity of these documents. In addition, I find that these documents corroborate the claimants\u2019 allegations.\n\n[18] Considering their credible testimony and supporting documentation, I accept the claimants\u2019 allegations as per their oral testimony and Basis of Claim forms, on a balance of probabilities.\n\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution\n\n[19] I find that the claimants have a well-founded fear of persecution in Colombia. I find that their subjective fear of persecution is established by their credible testimony. I also find that there is an objective basis for their fear, based on the objective country conditions evidence, namely the National Documentation Package for Colombia, located at Exhibit 3.\n\n[20] According to Item 7.24, sources describe Los Rastrojos as a drug trafficking organisation. Military defeats and the capture of its leadership led Los Rastrojos to split into factions. Leaders of Los Rastrojos created several agencies dedicated to contract killing, drug trafficking, threats, extortion, and debt collection, often subcontracting to local gangs. According to interviews conducted with state authorities, Los Rastrojos \u201chave demonstrated an unmatched capacity to adapt, expand and contract, which makes it easier for them to resurface in other parts of the country\u201d. Further, Los Rastrojos operates through strategic alliances, which include the National Liberation Army (ELN), the former Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), and other paramilitary organizations. Los Rastrojos has presence in 27 municipalities in 7 departments in Colombia.\n\n[21] In addition, the claimants have provided at Exhibit 5 an online article published in March 2019 by the Prosecutor\u2019s Office, regarding the imprisonment of J, a member of Los Rastrojos, for drug-related activities.\n\n[22] Considering the above, I find that the claimants have a well-founded fear of persecution in Colombia.\n\nState Protection\n\n[23] There is a presumption that states are capable of protecting their citizens. It is the claimants\u2019 burden to rebut the presumption of state protection.\n\n[24] In this case, I find that the objective country conditions evidence at Exhibit 3, considered together with the claimants\u2019 personal evidence, supports that operationally adequate state protection would not be available to the claimants, in their particular circumstances, if they were to seek it in Colombia.\n\n[25] Item 1.7 indicates that while the state has made considerable efforts to enhance protection for victims of non-state armed actors, including NAGs and left-wing guerrilla groups, nonetheless, in areas where there is a strong presence of NAGs and\/or guerrilla groups or areas affected by active conflict, the ability of the state to provide protection is highly limited, due to a lack of presence and capacity, as well as sometimes issues of corruption and complicity by local and regional authorities.\n\n[26] Furthermore, access by some victims of NAGs to national protection schemes is reportedly difficult. For example, it has been suggested that local and regional authorities may dismiss threats and abuses by NAGs as a phenomenon of common crime, underestimating the operational capacities of NAGs and the effect of their activities.\n\n[27] Item 7.21 states that if a person receives death threats from an armed group, that person may receive protection from authorities if they currently hold a position of leadership or power, or if they are a public servant in the judicial system, but not otherwise.\n\n[28] In this case, the claimants approached state authorities for assistance, more than once. However, their case was prematurely closed, and they ultimately did not receive any assistance from state authorities.\n\n[29] At Exhibit 5 are copies of emails and documents from the Prosecutor\u2019s Office that corroborate that the claimants sought state protection, however, their case was prematurely closed.\n\n[30] Considering the country conditions evidence, as well as the personal evidence of the claimants, I find that the claimants have rebutted the presumption of state protection.\n\n[31] Accordingly, I find that, on a balance of probabilities, adequate state protection would not be available to the claimants if they were to seek it in Colombia.\n\nInternal Flight Alternative\n\n[32] To determine whether a viable internal flight alternative exists, I must consider a two \u2013 pronged test. I find that the first prong of the test is not satisfied in this case, as the claimants would face a serious possibility of persecution throughout Colombia. As the first prong of the test is not satisfied, I need not consider the second prong. Accordingly, I find that there is no internal flight alternative available to the claimants, anywhere in Colombia.\n\n[33] In terms of motivation, I note that the agents of persecution continued to pursue the claimants even after they had departed from Colombia. They located the principal claimant\u2019s sister M. On XXXX, 2021, they ransacked her home, physically abused her, and demanded to know the whereabouts of the principal claimant. She told them that he has left Colombia.\n\n[34] Considering these events, I find that the agents of persecution continue to have a personal vendetta against Sand her daughter. As such, they continue to possess the motivation to pursue her family members, in order to locate her.\n\n[35] In terms of means, I note that the agents of persecution were able to determine that the principal claimant is the brother of S. They successfully located him and his family in Cali. They also located him and his family after they relocated to Palmira. The agents of persecution also located the principal claimant\u2019s sister M.\n\n[36] Item 1.7 states that some NAGs possess the operational capacity to carry out attacks in all parts of Colombia, regardless of territorial control. The presence of illegal checkpoints throughout the country increases the possibility that individuals attempting to relocate may be identified and targeted at such checkpoints by armed groups. Also, some armed group networks possess the reach and ability to trace and target individuals, both in rural areas and in urban centres, including in cities such as Bogota, Cali, and Medellin.\n\n[37] Item 7.21 states that some paramilitary and guerrilla structures have extended vertical organizations and large networks across the country. Item 7.24 states that leaders of Los Rastrojos have created several agencies, that often subcontract to local gangs. According to interviews with state authorities, Los Rastrojos \u201chave demonstrated an unmatched capacity to adapt, expand and contract, which makes it easier for them to resurface in other parts of the country\u201d. Furthermore, Los Rastrojos operates through strategic alliances, which include the National Liberation Army (ELN), the former Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), and other paramilitary organizations.\n\n[38] Considering the objective evidence, as well as the personal evidence of the claimants, I find that the agents of persecution possess the means to locate the claimants throughout Colombia, on a balance of probabilities.\n\n[39] Therefore, the claimants face a serious possibility of persecution throughout Colombia, on a balance of probabilities.\n\n[40] As the test for an internal flight alternative fails on the first prong, I find that there is no viable internal flight alternative that exists for the claimants, anywhere in Colombia.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[41] Based on the totality of the evidence, I find that the claimants are Convention refugees, due to their membership in the particular social group of family members of women facing gender-related persecution.\n\n[42] I therefore accept their claims.\n\n(signed) Sanaa Mahmood\n\nDecember 15, 2022\n\n",

The claimant alleges that he is a retired XXXX in Colombia and had been honorably discharged in February 2019. He alleges that the criminal group, Autodefensas Gaitanistas de Colombia\u201d (AGC), which is popularly known as the Golf Clan, had targeted him for serious harm in Colombia as a result of his profile and work as a XXXX within the XXXX. The claimant alleged that the following had taken place in Colombia prior to him fleeing:\nOn XXXX, 2018, his wife\u2019s XXXX was intercepted by two unknown men. On XXXX, 2018, he and his kids were intercepted on the road by two unknown men in Bogota. On XXXX, 2019, he was intercepted by two unknown men, he ran, and they shot at him. On XXXX, 2020, approximately 20 armed paramilitary men came to look for him at his cousin\u2019s farm in XXXX. DETERMINATION\n\n[3] In rendering this decision, the Panel considered the totality of the evidence, including the claimant\u2019s testimony heard on April 26, 2022, and all evidence received at the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (IRB), along with the post-hearing documents, found at Exhibit 5.5 received at the IRB on May 4, 2022.\n[4] The Panel finds that the claimant is a person in need of protection pursuant to subsection\n97(1). The reasons are as follow.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nIdentity\n\n[5] The Panel finds that the claimant has established his personal and national identity on a balance of probabilities. In coming to this finding, the Panel reviewed and considered his testimony as well as his Colombian passport and national identification card proffered into evidence at Exhibit 1.\n\nThe Risk Alleged is Personal\n\n[6] The claimant was not targeting by reason of his race, nationality, membership in a particular social group, and political opinion. The claimant was a XXXX. As such, his claim will be assessed under subsection 97(1).\n\n[7] The Panel finds that the claimant faced escalating threats from the AGC. Given that the claimant was tracked and targeted in multiple locations for two years, the Panel determined that this alleged risk to the claimant is personal.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s Risk is Not Generally Faced by others, Subparagraphs 97(1)(b)(ii) of the IRPA\n\n[8] According to the National Documentation Package (NDP) for Colombia, found at Exhibit 3, at Tab 1.2, the source indicates that the Autodefensas Gaitanistas de Colombia (AGC) is Colombia\u2019 s most powerful paramilitary group with a national presence. The source indicates that the AGC are among the illegal armed groups that carry out violent attacks against civilians and security forces, and they are active throughout Colombia.\n\n[9] According to the NDP at Tab 1.8, the source indicates that current and former public servants responsible for activities related to human rights are among those whose lives are at risk a \u201cdirect\u201d consequence of their \u201cactivities or political, public, social or humanitarian roles.\u201d Moreover, those qualifying for extraordinary risk must meet the following criteria:\nBe specific and personal. Be concrete and based on particular and demonstrated actions or events and not on abstract assumptions. Be present, and not remote or possible. Be significant, that is, that threatens to violate protected legal rights. Be serious, of plausible materialization due to the circumstances of the case. Be clear and discernible. Be exceptional to the extent that it should not be borne by the wider population. Be disproportionate, compared to the benefits the person can have from the situation for which the risk is generated. [10] At Tab 4.10, the NDP indicates that the AGC is principally interested in the drug trade, arms trafficking, and illegal gold mining. Given his former work as a XXXX and role as a XXXX within the XXXX, which directly opposes the goals of the AGC, the Panel determined that the claimant qualifies as someone who would be at extortionary risk given his line of work.\n[11] Given the objective evidence as set out above, the Panel finds that the claimant has established a prospective risk in Colombia.\n\nSubparagraphs 97(1)(b)(iii) and (iv) of the IRPA\n\n[12] The claimant\u2019s risk to life is not connected to lawful sanctions or caused by the state\u2019s inability to provide medical care. This satisfies subparagraphs 97(1)(b)(iii) and (iv) of the IRPA.\n\nCredibility\n\nThe Claimant is a XXXX\n\n[13] The claimant testified in a straightforward manner and made no attempts to mislead the Board.\n\n[14] In assessing the claimant\u2019 s credibility, the Panel considered a number of supporting documents. At Exhibit 5.5, the claimant tendered his XXXX card and training certificates. After reviewing these documents, the Panel finds no reason to cast any doubt on its veracity. As such the Panel places weight on these documents to support the claimants\u2019 identity as a XXXX in Colombia. On a balance of probabilities, the Panel determined that that claimant is a XXXX as alleged.\n\nThe Claimant was Threatened by the AGC\n\n[15] The claimant testified that he was targeted for serious harm as a result of his work. At Exhibit 5.2 and 5.5, he submits the following to support the credibility of his claim:\nphoto evidence of his wife\u2019s XXXX being intercepted by his agent of persecution. letters from family and friend affirming the events in 2018, 2019 and 2020 corroborates the dates and details of these events. his wife\u2019s BOC narrative dated August 10, 2018, corroborates the events of attack in 2018 to the claimant. [16] After reviewing these documents, the Panel finds no reasons to doubt their authenticity. As such, the Panel places full weight on them to support the allegations the claimant was threatened with serious harm from 2018 to 2020 prior to fleeing Colombia by members of the AGC. Additionally, the claimant\u2019s testimony was internally consistent, consistent with his BOC and the other evidence on file. As such, the Panel accepts the claimant\u2019s full allegations.\n\n[17] The Panel also considered the claimant\u2019s delay in leaving Colombia. According to his passport, the claimant has a valid USA visa from 2018 to 2020. When the issue of delay was put to the claimant, he explained that it was his hope to stay in Colombia despite his family fleeing for safety and while he lived in hiding at times. The Panel does not accept the claimant\u2019s explanation given that it is reasonable to expect him to not stay in a country where he is being pursued while having the means to leave. However, the Panel finds that this delay in leaving, was not sufficient, when considering the totality of the evidence, to overturn the credibility of allegations that have been established.\n\n[18] Given that there are no credibility concerns with respect to his core allegations, coupled with the documentary evidence set out above, the Panel thus determined that the claimant has established his future risk in Colombia.\n\nState Protection\n\n[19] The claimant testified that he did not go to the police for help because he did not trust anyone. The claimant had an obligation to approach the state for protection if protection might be reasonably forthcoming, given that those who are public servants in the judicial system are afforded protection.i The claimant\u2019s failure to do so in certain circumstances could be reason for a claim to fail on state protection grounds. Ultimately, the claimant did not take reasonable steps to seek the protection in Colombia in timely manner, however, the Panel finds that, on a balance of probabilities, adequate state protection would not have been forthcoming for the claimant given the objective evidence as set out below.\n\n[20] The Panel finds that the claimant\u2019s allegation of police corruption and collusion is supported by the objective evidence. At Tab 4.10, the NDP states that across the department, the AGC acts similarly to traditional Colombian paramilitary groups by combining counter\u00ad insurgency operations, illicit economic activities, and alleged collusion with state forces. The source further indicates that military and police corruption and collusion with certain armed actors impede progress toward lasting improvements in security, and require stronger judicial oversight if operations are to prove successful over more than the short term.\n\n[21] The NDP also sets out that although the government has made considerable efforts to enhance protection for victims of non-State armed actors including the AGC, it\u2019s noted that in areas where there\u2019s a strong presence of new armed groups or guerilla groups, the ability of the government to provide protection is highly limited due to a lack of presence and capacity.ii More generally, inadequate official investigation has reportedly made it difficult to address threats, attacks, and killings. The NDP indicates that investigation, charges, and criminal conviction are often extremely prolonged, wrought with delay and inadequacy.iii The most common protection measure includes regular police check-ins which are hampered by police absence and inconsistency.iv\n\n[22] The Panel finds that the claimant\u2019s work in XXXX which was directly involved in XXXX of organized criminal group, has put him at risk. He testified that he is aware that the police and military have not been able to protect other XXXX from members of organized criminal groups, including the AGC, and knows his colleagues were targeted and killed by gang members. He fears that that he will be killed if he returns to Colombia.\n\n[23] The Panel also consider those in similar situation to the claimant, that being his wife and children who fled as a result of the same agent persecution. The Panel notes that the claimants\u2019 wife and children were granted refugee protection in Canada according to the claimant\u2019 s evidence found at Exhibit 5.5.\n\n[24] While states are presumed to be capable of protecting its citizens, this presumption is rebuttable with clear and convincing evidence to the contrary.\n\n[25] Having considered the totality of the evidence above, the Panel finds that the claimant has rebutted this presumption, on a balance of probabilities. The Panel finds that Colombia is unable to provide adequate state protection for the claimant.\n\nInternal flight alternative\n\n[26] The claimant must show that, on a balance of probabilities, he would face a risk to life or of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment should he return to Colombia.\n\n[27] Second, the Panel must be satisfied that the conditions in the suggested IFA location is objectively reasonable in all the circumstances, including those particular to the claimant, for him to relocate and reside there.\n\n[28] Once the possibility of an IFA is raised, the burden shifts to the claimant to show, on a balance of probabilities, that there is a risk in the IFA location. The Panel finds that the claimant has met this burden.\n\n[29] At the hearing, the Panel named Tunja and Florencia as potential IFA locations.\n\n[30] Given that the claimant has established his escalating threat by the AGC over the span of 2 years from 2018 to 2020, and across the country in multiple locations, the Panel determined that the claimant has shown that the AGC had maintained an ongoing and active interested in locating and harming him.\n\n[31] The NDP clearly sets out that criminal groups have the ability to track and locate their victims, if they want to, including the AGC. As indicated in the objective evidence below, Tab\n7.37 from August 13, 2021, states:\n\nSources indicated that criminal groups are \u201cdefinitely\u201d able to track targeted individuals (Professor 12 July 2021; Senior Analyst 8 July 2021). The Senior Analyst further stated that the \u201cmain method\u201d used by criminal groups is \u201cword of mouth\u201d through country-wide networks or \u201curban collaborators\u201d (Senior Analyst 8 July 2021). According to the Professor, criminal groups \u201cmostly\u201d track their victims through informants, contacts in intelligence agencies and the army, and networks with other criminal groups \u201cacross the country\u201d (Professor 12 July 2021).\n[32] While it can be stated that the criminal groups do not take the time and resources to locate and harm every victim, the Panel finds that on a balance of probabilities, the claimants\u2019 agent of harm has shown a sustained interest in him over time. Given their ability to locate the claimant throughout Colombia, the Panel determined that there are no other parts of the country where he would not face a risk to life or of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment throughout Colombia. Given that the IFA test fails on the first prong, there is no need to assess the second prong of the test.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[33] For the reasons above, the Panel finds that the claimant is a person in need of protection pursuant to section 97(1) of the IRPA. Accordingly, his claim is accepted.\n\n(signed) H. DAM\n\nSeptember 13, 2022\n\n",

Boyd\nCountry: India\nRPD Number: TC0-04272\nAssociated RPD Number(s): TC0-04285, TC0-04302, TC0-04303\nATIP Number: A-2023-01023\nATIP Pages: N\/A\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n[1] The claims of XXXX (the Principal Claimant \u2013 PC), her husband, XXXX (the Associate Claimant \u2013 AC), and the claims of XXXX and XXXX (\u2018the minor Claimants\u201d), are joined.\n\n[2] They claim to be citizens of India. They claim refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n\n[3] The PC was appointed as the Designated Representative (DR) for the minor Claimants.\n\n[4] Both adult Claimants testified at the hearing.\n\n[5] Counsel submitted post-hearing documents and written representations under Exhibits 10 and 11 respectively.\n\n[6] The panel also considered the Chairperson Guidelines 4: Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution (Guideline 4) as it relates to the PC.\n\nALLEGATIONS\n\n[7] The PC\u2019s allegations can be found in her Basis of Claim form (BOC), Exhibit 2.1, an addendum under Exhibit 5 and in testimony. The associate and minor Claimants rely on her narrative.\n\n[8] In summary, the PC returned to India on XXXX 2019, to visit family. She stayed at her in-law\u2019s home.\n\n[9] The AC advised her that a friend of a friend (V) was looking for a place to stay in Chennai, for him and his wife.\n\n[10] V came over alone to look at the place.\n\n[11] He was subsequently arrested by the local state police. V allegedly informed the police that he had been living at the PC\u2019s in law\u2019s place since 2017.\n\n[12] State police came and advised the PC that V was a very dangerous Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE \u2013 a Sri Lankan militant group) agent.\n\n[13] The police took the PC to the police station. She was put in a barred cell, alone and left overnight.\n\n[14] The following morning, she was interrogated about her travel history, her life in the United States and connection to V.\n\n[15] She was refused access to a lawyer and to her mother-in-law.\n\n[16] She was kept there for several days; at one point she was sexually molested by three police officers. The assault was recorded.\n\n[17] She was subsequently questioned by officers of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). She was eventually released and told to not leave the country while at the same time keeping her passport.\n\n[18] With the assistance of a local politician, she was able to get her passport back. Prior to the release of her passport, she was questioned once again by the CBI officer. Her mother-in-law was similarly questioned.\n\n[19] In consultation with the AC, the PC travelled with the minor Claimants to Canada using their previously issued Canadian visas. The AC joined the family in Canada.\n\n[20] They made a claim for refugee protection and continue to ask for Canada\u2019s protection.\n\nDETERMINATION\n\n[21] The panel finds the Claimants have established that they face a serious possibility of persecution in India on the basis of the adult Claimants\u2019 perceived political opinion as supporters of the LTTE. Similarly, the minor Claimants face a serious possibility of persecution as members of the adult Claimants\u2019 family. The panel therefore finds the Claimants are Convention refugees pursuant to sections 96 of IRPA and accept their claims.\n\nIDENTITY\n\n[22] The Claimants\u2019 personal and national identities as citizens of India had been established on a balance of probabilities through copies of their Indian passports under Exhibit 1.\n\n[23] Additional identity documents were submitted under Exhibit 7.\n\nCREDIBILITY\n\n[24] The panel finds on a balance of probabilities that the adult Claimants are credible regarding key elements of their claim. They testified in a straightforward manner regarding central elements of their claim. There were no inconsistencies or contradictions between their testimonies and their other evidence. The panel accepts on a balance of probabilities that the PC suffered harm at the hands of the Indian authorities.\n\n[25] In India, the PC was questioned about the AC including what connections they both had with the LTTE and V.\n\n[26] The AC, who was not present in India at the time the PC suffered harm at the hands of the Indian authorities fear that because he was involved in terms of arranging for accommodations for V that he too would be implicated as someone involved in supporting LTTE affiliated individuals. Similarly, the PC was questioned about him specifically as well.\n\n[27] The adult Claimants fear that the minor children would also be targeted if they had left their children back in India.\n\n[28] Counsel in her submissions note that security forces in India do not take particular care to protect children of suspects. This is evidenced by the fact that when the police came to the PC\u2019s mother-in-law\u2019s home on two occasions, the children were present there.\n\n[29] Both adult Claimants fear family retaliation including to the minor children if they are wanted by the Indian authorities.\n\n[30] The panel finds on a balance of probabilities that the Claimants have a subjective fear of persecution if they are returned to India.\n\nObjective evidence\n\n[31] The panel finds that the Claimants\u2019 subjective fear is also supported by the objective evidence.\n\n[32] Asper Exhibit 3, Item 2.1, the law criminalizes rape against women in most cases. Despite these protections, rape is one of the fastest growing crimes in India. However, observers believe the number of rapes remain vastly underreported.\n\n[33] It goes on to state that incidents of rape continue to be a persistent problem which includes rape by government officials.\n\n[34] Sexual harassment is also a serious problem in India.\n\n[35] Exhibit 3, Item 5.9 similarly states that gender-based violence against women is said to be widespread and compounded by patriarchal attitudes and gender stereotypes.\n\n[36] Moreover, several sources describe the police as ineffective in protecting people who fear becoming victims of honour and that sources indicate that the police are reluctant to register the complaints or carry out investigations.\n\n[37] In goes on to state that:\n\nFew police stations have specialized women\u2019s mechanisms to address the concerns of women, including violence cases, and to provide the assistance and protection that is required during the investigation phase. Impunity for abuses committed by police officers and the need for civilian oversight was highlighted.\n[38] In terms of the interest of authorities in combating links to terrorism, counsel\u2019 s disclosure under Exhibit 8 demonstrates the continued interest of authorities as it relates to the LTTE specially in Tamil Nadu. An example was an article talking about the discovery of a human trafficking ring where authorities arrested an LTTE sympathiser and were looking into a possible LTTE angle given the link to the suspect.\n\n[39] Another article talks about alleged links of two residents from Chennai to members of the LTTE. The same article indicates that the National Investigation Agency got details about the links to the LTTE when questioning the suspects.\n\n[40] Moreover, another article suggests that the interception of a Sri Lankan boat with drugs and rifles may suggest an LTTE revival.\n\n[41] This coupled with the discovery of a human trafficking route may add credence to the fear of some kind of an operational presence in an effort to revive the movement and possibly conduct future attacks.\n\nSTATE PROTECTION\n\n[42] In terms of state protection in this case, the agents of persecution are the Indian authorities. The panel thus finds that the presumption of state protection is rebutted. The objective documentary evidence indicates that while the government has taken some steps to combat corruption in the security forces, the police, military, and other officials have committed abuses against citizens, and a general culture of impunity exists. This is under Exhibit 3, items 2.1, and item 2.2.\n\n[43] In addition to that objective evidence, the panel notes the reports that public officials are not regularly held accountable for human rights violations, and that despite receiving direction from the Supreme Court, states have not implemented reforms meant to reign in police abuses.i There are credible reports of corruption across all levels of government.ii As such, the panel finds adequate state protection would not be available for the Claimants.\n\n[44] Documentary evidence regarding police co-operation among local, state, and national police is mixed. The national documentation package has several documents regarding police interaction and sharing of information. So, for example, Exhibit 3, item 10.2, states that police departments in India use communication methods such as fax, phone, e-mail, and database, and they may be used in varying degrees by various departments. However, there is little inter-police communication except for cases of major crimes like smuggling, terrorism, and high-profile organized crime.\n\n[45] Yet, the same document also suggests that police stations across India are unconnected islands in the case of crime and criminal tracking. There is no system of effective data storage, sharing, and accessing of data. There is no single system by which police units can talk to another directly.\n\n[46] However, the panel finds that in this case, the adult Claimants are suspected of being involved with V, who was an LTTE member and thus indirectly in support of terrorism.\n\n[47] Similarly, the Central Bureau of Investigation had taken lead of this investigation together with the Tamil Nadu police. The CBI being a national law enforcement agency.\n\n[48] The panel agrees with counsel\u2019s submissions in the sense that as per Exhibit 3, Item 10.3, given the involvement of the CBI relating to a case involving a possible link to LTTE terrorism, it in effect closes the door for any IFA for the Claimants as the CBI has country wide reach.\n\n[49] Thus, the panel finds that on a balance of probabilities, in the particular situation of the adult Claimants, the police departments may collaborate with each other, given the above.\n\n[50] Accordingly, the panel is of the opinion that there is a serious possibility that the police in India may also go after their family including the minor Claimants to get to them.\n\n[51] As noted above, since the agent of persecution is the state, the panel finds that there is no viable internal flight alternative for the Claimants.\n\n[52] The panel thus finds that it would not be safe for the Claimants to relocate anywhere else in the country.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[53] The panel therefore determines the adult Claimants are Convention refugees due to their imputed political opinion, and the minor claimants are Convention refugees as members of their family, as noted above.\n\n[54] The panel therefore accepts their claims.\n\n(signed) Allan Casimiro\n\nJanuary 28, 2022\n\n",

In short, the claimant alleges fear of the Indian government, including Congress party and the police, due to his pro-Khalistan views and support of the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) (Mann) party.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nIdentity\n\n[4] The claimant\u2019s identity as a citizen of India is established on balance of probabilities based on his testimony and documentation provided, including copy of a copy of his passport, and copies of his driver\u2019s license and Aadhar cardiv.\n\n[5] I acknowledge that when the claimant arrived in Canada, he did not have his passport. The claimant alleges that his passport was taken by the agent who facilitated his travel and that he did not have the passport when boarding the plane to Canada. He does not know how he boarded the plane but states that the agent arranged all parts of his travel. Upon considering all of the evidence, including the claimant\u2019s testimony and copies of identification documents provided by the claimant, I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities as to the claimant\u2019s identity.\n\n[6] It is noted that the claimant\u2019s father was born in Pakistan. After reviewing Pakistan citizenship rulesv, I have concluded that the claimant does not have any automatic right of citizenship in Pakistan as required under the Williams testvi, therefore the only country of reference in this claim is India.\n\nThe Claim is not Excluded under Article 1E of the Refugee Convention\n\n[7] The claimant testified that he worked in UAE and Saudi Arabia for approximately four years. I have assessed whether the claimant is excluded under Article 1E of the Refugee Convention and considered whether the claimant has status in a country where he resided that is substantially similar to that of the country\u2019s nationals.vii I find that the claimant\u2019s residency status in Saudi Arabia and UAE was temporary and tied to his former employment, and he has no legal right of return. I find that the claimant does not have status in Saudi Arabia and UAE that is substantially similar to the nationals of these countries. Therefore, the Article 1E exclusion does not apply to this claim.\n\nNexus\n\n[8] I find there to be a nexus between the harm the claimant fears and the Convention due to his political opinion as a support of SAD and political views in favour of a separate state of Khalistan. Accordingly, this claim has been assessed under s. 96 of IRPA.\n\nCredibility\n\n[9] The claimant testified at the hearing on the major elements of his claim, as presented in his narrative. His testimony with respect to the core allegations was relatively straightforward and devoid of inconsistencies or contradictions.\n\n[10] The claimant testified that he fears harm from the Congress party and the police in India on the basis of his support for SAD (Mann) party and pro-Khalistan political views. He began actively supporting the SAD (Mann) party in 2017. He also converted to the Sikh religion around the same time. At the hearing, the claimant credibly testified about his conversion and the reasons for joining the party. I also note that the claimant\u2019s wife was born into a Sikh family, and the claimant\u2019 s son has been raised Sikh from birth.\n\n[11] While in India, the claimant campaigned and canvassed votes, participated in meetings and rallies, propagated pro-Khalistan views, and otherwise discouraged others in the community from supporting other parties. The claimant has continued his support of SAD from Canada by attending events in Montreal where he resides.\n\n[12] The claimant alleges being targeted by individuals associated with the Congress party due to his political views and activities. He alleges being attacked by unknown individuals associated with the Congress party twice, in XXXX and XXXX of 2019. The claimant alleges that the agents of persecution are still inquiring about his whereabouts from his family members and neighbours.\n\n[13] The claimant further submits that sometime after his departure, the police began attending his family home and have alleged that they suspect him to have ties with pro-Khalistan militants. The claimant believes that the police had been co-opted into imposing false allegations against him by the Congress party members, who at the time were still in power in Punjab.\n\n[14] Apart from oral testimony, the claimant has presented corroborating evidence to support his claims, namely a copy of his party membership card, an affidavit from his mother and a letter from the SAD party, both of which provide generally consistent information to the allegations advanced by the claimant. A medical note was also provided, which outlined the medical treatments received by the claimant following the alleged attacksviii. I accord weight to these documents in supporting the claimant\u2019s allegations.\n\nSummary of findings\n\n[15] Taking into account the totality of the evidence, I find that the claimant has established, on a balance of probabilities, that he is a supporter of the SAD party, that he holds political views that support secession of Khalistan, and that he engages in social and political events and activities demonstrating this support. I accept that he would continue to openly express these views if he were to return to India.\n\n[16] I accept, on a balance of probabilities, that due to his political opinion and activities, he suffered attacks by individuals associated with the Congress party, who in turn may have co\u00ad opted the local police into targeting him by falsely accusing him to be involved with militants.\n\n[17] I find that the claimant has established his subjective fear of persecution on a balance of probabilities.\n\nThe claimant \u2018s journey to Canada not sufficient to outweigh credibility\n\n[18] I acknowledge that the claimant arrived in Canada nine months after leaving India and appeared to have a convoluted account of his travels when questioned by CBSA. The claimant submits that his passport was taken by the agent who arranged all parts of his travel journey throughout the nine months. At the hearing, the claimant was questioned extensively in regards to his travel journey and surrounding circumstances. I have considered all of the evidence, including the claimant\u2019s testimony. While the reasons behind the unusual travel route are not known, I accept on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant engaged the services of the agent to flee India, and that his travel journey was directed by the agent.\n\n[19] Furthermore, the claimant testified to having spent over six months in Mexico, on his way to Canada. He testified that the goal was to reach Canada, and that he did not know why the agent chose to have him stay in Mexico for those months. He testified to being kept in the dark as to the travel arrangements and status of his travel documents, including a Canadian visa.\n\n[20] I have some concerns about the claimant\u2019s testimony about the months he spent in Mexico, which was vague and lacked clarity. The fact that the claimant was less than clear about his time in Mexico does raise some concerns about the overall credibility of his testimony. However, when this is weighed against the credible evidence going to the core aspects of his claim, I find it insufficient to rebut the presumption of truthfulness with respect to his core allegations and subjective fear.\n\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution\n\n[21] In order to be considered a Convention Refugee, the claimant must demonstrate that he has a well-founded fear of persecution, which includes both a subjective fear and an objective basis for that fear. Based on his evidence and the country condition documents, I find that the claimant has a well-founded fear of persecution for the following reasons.\n\n[22] As previously stated, the claimant alleged that the police were co-opted into targeting him by Congress party members, as the Congress party was in power at the time of the events. It should be noted that as per RPD disclosed Times of India news articleix, the Congress party is no longer in power, and the AAP won the elections in March 2022. At the hearing, the claimant was asked why he believed he would still be at risk given the change in power. He testified that despite the change in the ruling party in Punjab, police still oppose SAD, so they would continue to target him due to his ongoing support of SAD. There is no objective evidence before me to support the claimant\u2019s proposition, either from the claimant and his counsel, or from the India National Documentation Package (NDP). Therefore, I am notable to give weight to the claimant\u2019s speculation in this regard. However, I find that the claimant still faces a serious risk of persecution based on his political views, for the following reasons.\n\n[23] The claimant fears that, if he returns, he will face persecution at the hands of the Indian government due to his political views and activities.\n\n[24] The reports in the National Documentation Package (NDP) for India note that politically, India is becoming significantly less tolerant of any expression of political dissent or criticism. A Human Rights Watch report notes that the government has been increasingly harassing, arresting, and prosecuting critics in recent years, and that authorities are bringing politically motivated cases against critics and opponentsx. Furthermore, a report on the situation of Sikhs notes that suspected Khalistan supporters are subjected to increased detention and can, in many cases, face severe persecution throughout India. The report states: \u201cWhile \u2018simple support of Khalistan is technically legal in India\u2019, in practice suspected Khalistan supporters are \u2018harassed by police and intelligence agencies. And, in many cases, falsely implicated in criminal cases, which take years to resolve\u2019.\u201dxi\n\n[25] Another Response to Information Request reports that individuals who support or advocate for Khalistan are monitored, \u201coften included on police lists for heightened scrutiny,\u201d and charged in terrorism-related cases, which can result in being detained for years before being released due to lack of evidencexii. There are further reports in the NDP that Indian authorities may place Sikh political figures or activists in \u201cpreventative\u201d custody or detention in order to suppress perceived conflict or disturbances, such as during times leading up to major events or ralliesxiii.\n\n[26] Furthermore, there are numerous reports in the NDP of Sikh and pro-Khalistan activists being implicated in false cases or arrested on trumped up charges. The United States Department of State Report indicates that police in India arbitrarily arrest persons sometimes without registering their arrests. A person may be detained for up to a year without charge or trial if the police consider the persona \u201csecurity risk\u201d.xiv\n\n[27] I find that the above cited objective evidence establishes that SAD members and those who are considered to support an independent Khalistan face serious human rights abuses that amount to persecution at the hands of the Indian government. The claimant has been attacked by political opponents and individuals working for the Congress party. Accordingly, I find that there is an objective basis to the claimant\u2019s allegations and accept, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant has a well-founded fear of persecution in India.\n\nState Protection\n\n[28] Except in situations where the state is in complete breakdown, states are presumed capable of protecting their citizens. In this case, the agents of persecution are a political party (Congress) and police. The claimant attempted to seek assistance from the police following the second attack in 2019, and the police did not assist him.\n\n[29] Given the identity and profile of the agents of persecution, I find that state protection would not be reasonably forthcoming. Accordingly, I find that the presumption of state protection has been rebutted.\n\nInternal Flight Alternative\n\n[30] Internal flight alternative (IFA) has been considered and was raised with the claimant at the hearing. Mumbai and Bengaluru were proposed to the claimant as possible IFA locations.\n\n[31] Once the issue of an IFA has been raised, the onus is on the claimant to show that he or she does not have an IFA. To find a viable IFA, I must be satisfied that there is no serious possibility of the claimant being persecuted or, on the balance of probabilities, being subjected personally to a danger of torture or a risk to life or cruel and unusual punishment in the proposed IFA. Furthermore, the conditions in that part of the country must be such that it would be reasonable in all the circumstances, including those particular to the claimant, to seek refuge there.\n\n[32] On the evidence before me, I find that there is a serious possibility of persecution for the claimant throughout India for the following reasons.\n\nIFA \u2013 first prong\n\n[33] The first question is whether the claimant would be safe in proposed IFAs. When asked whether he could live safely in either of the IFA locations, the claimant said that because of the nature of his political beliefs, he could not be safe anywhere in India.\n\n[34] The claimant has testified that he would continue to support AD should he return to India.\n\n[35] The documentary evidence demonstrates that the risk of persecution comes from the authorities themselves and is consistent throughout India. Sikhs who publicly express support for Khalistan are not safe throughout India.\n\n[36] The RIR on the situation of Sikhs who support Khalistan outside of the state of Punjab confirms that vocal advocates for Khalistan outside of the state of Punjab are subject to attention by authorities, may face severe persecution, as well as harassment by police and false implications in criminal cases that take years to resolve. It also describes various arrests of Khalistan sympathizers in various states other than Punjabxv. Accordingly, I find that if the claimant was to relocate to the IFA, he would not be able to express his support for Khalistan in a peaceful, democratic manner, without facing a serious risk of persecution.\n\n[37] Given the claimant\u2019s political views and support of SAD, I find that he would face a serious possibility of persecution throughout India. While the claimant may not be targeted immediately upon relocation, if the claimant were to remain a public supporter of SAD as he had indicated, he would face more than a mere possibility of persecution at the hands of the authorities and other political opponents on an ongoing basis.\n\n[38] Therefore, I find that the claimant faces a serious risk of persecution throughout India and that no viable IFA exists for him due to his political beliefs.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[39] Having considered all of the evidence before me, I find that the claimant has established that he would face a serious possibility of persecution in India on a Convention ground. Accordingly, I find the claimant to be a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of IRPA and accept his claim.\n\n(signed) Lusine Unanyan\n\nMay 24, 2022\n\n",

Kim\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Gerald Nsamba\nCountry: Uganda\nRPD Number: TC0-05612\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2023-01023\nATIP Pages: N\/A\n\nDECISION\n\n[1] MEMBER: This is a decision for the claimant, XXXX XXXX, file number is TC0-05612.\n\n[2] I have considered your testimony and the other evidence in the case, and I\u2019m ready to render my decision orally. You are claiming to be a citizen of Uganda and are claiming refugee protection pursuant to Sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n\n[3] For making this decision and in formulating questions for the hearing, I considered Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9, sorry Guideline 4 in regard to the proceeding before the Immigration Refugee Board involving Women Refugee Claimants.\n\n[4] I find that you are a Convention refugee for the following reasons. You alleged the following: That you are a citizen of Uganda and that if you were to return, you will face persecution because you are a member of a particular social group as the survivor of domestic violence at the hands of your husband who will be referred to here as XXXX as you requested. You alleged that you suffered violence from him since you had gotten married and that you had tried to run away from him in 2017 but was tracked by him who came with his brother and threatened you with guns. You also alleged that your friend who was taking care of your child was also threatened shortly after you left the country. You alleged that XXXX worked for the military since he graduated from high school and that he was sent to different countries as a military personnel. You also allege that XXXXsiblings are also police officers themselves and that his family threatened you after you filed a report to the police in 2011. You allege that there is no state protection for you or an Internal Flight Alternative.\n\n[5] I find on a balance of probability that your personal identity as a citizen of Uganda have been established by your oral testimony and the copy of your passport which can be found at Exhibit 1.\n\n[6] I find that there is a link between what you fear and one of the five Convention grounds which is your membership in a particular social group as a woman fearing domestic violence. Therefore, I assessed your claim under Section 96.\n\n[7] In terms of your general credibility, I have found you to be a credible witness and I therefore believe what you have alleged in your oral testimony and in your Basis of Claim form.\n\n[8] There was a credible concern that arose at the hearing when you stated that you filed a police report in 2018 which was omitted from your narrative. You stated that because of your depression and being overwhelmed, you forgot to include this. I do not find this explanation to be reasonable as you had an opportunity to correct your narrative before the hearing and had done so for another issue. Which was submitted on February 16, 2022. I draw negative credibility inference on this; however, I find that this does not impact your overall credibility on its own because of your otherwise credible testimony regrading other matters to the claim.\n\n[9] Your testimony was straightforward and was largely in keeping with your Basis of Claim form and there were no significant inconsistency or omission that went to the heart of the claim. Your oral testimony today included details regarding the incidence of violence you suffered at the hands of XXXXand the claims and threats you received from him. You described your attempts to run away from him in 2017 which was failed as he found you at a place where you didn\u2019t have any friends or family. You stated that you had to relocate your child to a foster place because your friend who had been taking care of him expressed fear that she will be harmed by XXXX. You also described your attempts at reporting him to the police and other organizations which was not successful. You testified that after reporting him to the police in 2011, his sister called you and warned you to keep family issues within the family. You also stated that you reported him to the XXXX XXXX XXXX which was unsuccessful as well. You further testified that you experienced an incident in 2018 which left you hospitalized.\n\n[10] You also provided documents in support of your claim which can be found at Exhibit 5 and 7; these include affidavits from the friend who helped you leave the country and took care of your child and who experienced threats from XXXX. You also submitted affidavits from another friend of yours and your aunt who had witnessed the violence from him experienced by you. Your testimony and the supporting documentation all establish on a balance of probabilities that you are a survivor of domestic violence.\n\n[11] The Country Condition documents in the National Documentation Package for Uganda which can be found at Exhibit 3 are consistent with your allegation that there is a serious possibility that you will face persecution in Uganda.\n\n[12] Tab 2.1 of NDP states that, although the law criminalizes rape of women, it does not address spousal rape. Rape also remains a common problem throughout the country and the government did not effectively enforce the law. Local media and local civil society organizations reported that victims often believe they were powerless to report their abuses in part to avoid stigmatization. It further stated that gender based violence was common and became increasingly prevalent after the government enforced lockdown because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n[13] Item 5.5 Country Gender Assessment by UNDP notes on page 5 that, the country suffers from a persistently high level of sexual and gender based violence. It further notes, that attitudes, beliefs, and practices that serve to exclude women are still deeply entrenched throughout Uganda. It further states that, domestic violence is wide-spread and widely accepted in the country. Having considered this objective evidence together with your consistent and credible testimony, I find on a balance of probabilities that you have a well-founded fear of persecution in Uganda. I find that adequate state protection would not be available to you if you were to seek it in the country.\n\n[14] The report by US Department of State states that, government did not effectively enforce the law to address rape that became a common problem throughout the country. Authorities often were unable to investigate and hold perpetrators accountable in cases of rape often involving kidnapping and killings of women. Local media further reported that perpetrators of rape included persons in authority.\n\n[15] You have also testified to your attempt to seek state protection which were unsuccessful. Therefore I find on a balance of probabilities that you have rebutted the presumption of state protection because adequate state protection will not be available to you as the state will be unable and unwilling to protect you in Uganda.\n\n[16] I considered whether there is a viable Internal Flight Alternative for you in Uganda. You have testified to your attempt at relocating which resulted in XXXXlocating you and making threats. You have also testified that he is part of the military and that his siblings are police officers who had used their positions to threaten you. Based on the evidence, I find that you do not have a viable Internal Flight Alternative on a balance of probabilities.\n\n[17] In conclusion, after assessing all of the evidence, I find that you have established that there is a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground because of your membership in a particular social group as a woman who is a domestic violence survivor. I therefore find that you are a Convention refugee and I accept your claim.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

You are claiming to be citizens of Sri Lanka and are claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. The principal claimant was designated as a designated representative for his two (2) minor children and he confirmed during the hearing that he understood his responsibilities as a designated representative. I have considered your testimony and the other evidence in the case and I am ready to render my decision orally.\n\nDETERMINATION\n\n[2] I find you are all Convention refugees. I find the principal claimant to be a Convention refugee on the grounds of his imputed political opinion, and the associate claimants through their membership in a particular social group of family, given their relation to the principal claimant, for the following reasons.\n\nALLEGATIONS\n\n[3] You allege the following. You are citizens of Sri Lanka and allege a fear of persecution in Sri Lanka at the hands of the police and XXXX XXXX , XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, a powerful and highly connected businessman, due to the principal claimant\u2019s work in the XXXX industry. The principal claimant alleges to have supported the Janatha, J-A-N-A-T-H-A, Vimukthi, V-I-M-U-K-T-H-I H-V, Peramuna, P-E-R-A-M-U-N-A party, JVP, in the 2018 local election and organized committees and petitions against powerful XXXX giants. Through his work as an executive member of the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, in Sri Lanka. As a result, the principal claimant alleges to have received a number of threatening calls and visits and was nearly kidnapped on XXXX XXXX, 2018. The principal claimant further alleges that there was a kidnapping attempt on his children on XXXX XXXX, 2019, while they were leaving school. The principal claimant was arrested on XXXX XXXX, 2019 and accused of supporting Muslim extremists. You all allege if returned to Sri Lanka, you will be arrested or possibly killed at the hands of authorities and corrupt businessmen. You allege that there is no state protection for you or internal flight alternative available.\n\nIdentity\n\n[4] Your personal identities as citizens of Sri Lanka have been established by your testimony and the supporting documents filed in the exhibits, namely the certified true copies of your Sri Lanka passports and birth certificates for all claimants, as well as copies of the resident identity cards for the three (3) adult claimants. These can all be found in Exhibit 1. I therefore find on a balance of probabilities that identity and country of reference have been established.\n\nNexus\n\n[5] I find there is a link between what you fear and a Convention ground, namely imputed political opinion, due to the principal claimant\u2019s work with the JVP and UPMA where he and his colleagues called out the XXXX mafia in Sri Lanka and wrote petitions to their local MPs. The principal claimant also alleged to deal with local Muslim farmers and was arrested as a result of his perceived connection to the Muslim extremists. I find all four (4) associate claimants have a link to the Convention through their familiar relationship to the principal claimant, and therefore their links are through their membership in a particular social group. I therefore assessed your claims under section 96.\n\nCredibility\n\n[6] In terms of your credibility, I found you both to be credible witnesses. I note the principal claimant provided the majority of the testimony in this hearing. Sir, I found that your testimony was straightforward, detailed, forthcoming, you did not embellish your testimony. I also found there were no major omissions or inconsistencies in your testimony. Ma\u2019am, I also found that your testimony was straightforward, detailed, and consistent with the allegations before me. I note that the allegations in this claim are extensive and involve a number of incidents, people, and places. Sir, I found you to have testified in great detail in a consistent manner surrounding the issues you experienced. I note that I questioned you in a manner that changed between timelines, and I did not question you in the order that they occurred. I found that you still provide consistent details and I find this adds to your credibility. I note that you told me about the XXXX industry, including the XXXX mafia and how it is led by XXXX XXXX, who has connections to powerful politicians. You told me about the work you did in helping to establish a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX who wrote petitions to government officials and filed complaints against the XXXX mafia. You told me about your political work in support of the JVP, including why you chose to support them and the type of work you did for them.\n\n[7] In regard to your incidents of harm, including the attempt to kidnapping on XXXX XXXX, 2018, the attempted kidnapping of your son, and your arrest on XXXX XXXX, 2019. I found that you that you both provided consistent details and I find that you have established these incidents on a balance of probabilities. You provided a number of documents that support your claim, such as proof of your ownership of the XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, documents from the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, including the group\u2019s petition and minutes from meetings in the election where you were named as an XXXX XXXX, insurance claim forms from the XXXX 2017 and XXXX 2018 incidents, medical reports corroborating the XXXX XXXX, 2018, XXXX XXXX, 2018, and XXXX XXXX, 2019 injuries you sustained, police extracts pertaining to the threat you received in XXXX 2018, and a report pertaining to the attempted kidnapping of your children in XXXX 2019. I also note that you provided a letter from your children\u2019s school supporting their absence from school and the attempted kidnapping, as well as a number of affidavits from family, friends, neighbors, and colleagues who were present or aware of the issues you and your family went through in Sri Lanka. I note no issues on the surface of these documents and I find them to further support your credibility.\n\n[8] In regard to your travel to New Zealand, I note that you traveled after a threat that you received. When asked about this, you told me that you thought things would get better, and you were motivated to return and continue to operate your father\u2019s business. With respect to your travel to Singapore in XXXX 2019, you again told me that you thought things would be better for you upon return, and at that time, you were in hiding and they would not be able to find you. I do not fully accept these explanations, given the severity of an attempted kidnapping, which occurred prior to your travel in Singapore. However, for the purposes of your travel to New Zealand, I am willing to accept this explanation. At this point in time, you had only received verbal threats and a minor attack. With respect to the Singapore travel, given your testimony about the power of XXXX XXXX, I do have concern about your travel and return to Sri Lanka. However, I do note that one (1) of the more serious incidents, which occurred to you in XXXX 2019, was when you were arrested and accused of supporting Muslim extremists. I note this occurred after your return to Sri Lanka following your travel to Singapore. Given this, the credible testimony, and documentation provided in the forward-looking nature of refugee law, I do not find your travels to New Zealand and Singapore sufficient to undermine your overall credibility and your subjective fear. I therefore find your subjective fear is established and I believe what you have alleged on a balance of probabilities.\n\nObjective Basis\n\n[9] I also find there is an objective basis for what you fear in Sri Lanka. According to Items 4.2, 1.8, 1.9, and 1.10 of the National Documentation Package, NDP, for Sri Lanka, four (4) political parties have dominated the political landscape. These include the United National Party, UNP, the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, SLFP, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna, JVP also known as the People\u2019s Liberation Front, and the Illankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi, ITAK. Since 1947, political power has largely been held by the UNP and the SLFP. Further sources note that elections have been historically volatile periods in Sri Lanka, and local politics in Sri Lanka is intimately linked to national politics and local politicians are mostly members of the national political parties.\n\n[10] According to the US DOS report at Item 2.1, there are reports where the government or its agents committed arbitrary or unlawful killings in 2020, that there is widespread corruption prevalent throughout Sri Lanka, and that police and officials often engage in corrupt practices with impunity. There are often politically-motivated killings, and government officials use COVID-19 health guidelines to prevent opposition political rallies, while pro-government rallies proceeded with no issues. According to Item 1.8, police in Sri Lanka continue to routinely torture and ill treat individuals taken into custody in order to extract confessions, but also for personal vendettas or to extort funds. Item 2.3 echoes this and states that the police and security forces are known to engage in abusive practices. This includes extrajudicial executions, forced disappearances, custodial rape, and torture. I note the preponderance of references in the NDP regarding political turmoil and corruption in Sri Lanka. In considering the principal claimant\u2019s credible testimony surrounding his work with the JVP and the UPMA and his work against XXXX XXXX and the XXXX mafia, I find the principal claimant\u2019s allegations that he was targeted by highly corrupt businessman with connections to high level and corrupt government officials to have an objective basis.\n\n[11] In regard to your forward-looking risk, I note you have testified and provided supporting documentation regarding the continued search for you, including how your employee was approached in XXXX 2021, and your former neighbor at your XXXX XXXX was also approached in 2022. I therefore find that you have a well-founded fear of persecution.\n\nState Protection\n\n[12] In regard to possibility of obtaining state protection, I note that the agents of persecution in this case are the state, and corrupt businessmen who have connections to state authorities. I also note that on a number of occasions, you sought protection from the police, however nothing was done to adequately assist you. Accordingly, I find there is no state protection available to you on a balance of probabilities.\n\nInternal Flight Alternative\n\n[13] I have also considered whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for you. According to Item 1.9 of the NDP, Sri Lankan authorities maintain effective control throughout the country, and individuals are unlikely to relocate internally with anonymity. Given your fear of the state and people connected to the state, I find there is no viable internal flight alternative available to you in Sri Lanka.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[14] Based on the totality of the evidence, I find you all to be Convention refugees. Therefore, your claims are accepted. This concludes today\u2019s proceeding.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

I am reading the decisions into the record on February 28, 2022, after a hearing held on February 22, 2022. Following are the reasons. I heard the testimony in this claim and I\u2019m reading my decision into Teams without the parties present. The transcript may be edited before being sent out. The principal claimant, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX claims to be a citizen of Sudan and claims refugee protection pursuant to Sections 96 and 97.1 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, in short, the IRPA. The minor claimant, who is the principal claimant\u2019s daughter, namely XXXX XXXX XXXX, claims to be a citizen of the United States and claims refugee protection pursuant to Sections 96 and 97.1 of the IRPA.\n\n[2] The principal claimant was the designated representative for the minor claimant and because the minor claimant was only two years old at the time of the hearing, no testimony was taken from her. In hearing and deciding these claims, I took into account the Chairperson\u2019s Guidelines on gender related persecution, as well as the Guidelines on child refugee claimants.\n\n[3] I find that the principal claimant is a Convention refugee because she established that she faces a serious possibility of persecution in Sudan on a Convention ground. I find that the minor claimant has not established that she would face a serious possibility of persecution, or a risk to life, cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or torture should she return to the USA.\n\n[4] With respect to both claimants, I find that the national and personal identities of them both were established through testimony and the certified true copies of the principal claimant\u2019s Sudanese passport, and the minor claimant\u2019s US passport as well as the birth registration for the principal claimant and a birth certificate for the minor claimant in Exhibit 5. I will address the principal claimant\u2019s claim first.\n\n[5] After hearing the principal claimant\u2019s testimony, I find she faces a serious possibility of persecution in Sudan because of her anti-governmental political opinion and as a woman, and I make my decision based on Section 96 of the IRPA as there is a nexus to Convention grounds, namely political opinion, and gender. In her Basis of Claim form signed July 10, 2020, the principal claimant alleges fearing persecution in Sudan because of her involvement since 2018 and anti-governmental political activities in person both in Sudan and then more recently since she has been in Canada.\n\n[6] She expressed her opposition to Sudanese authorities and members of the security apparatus, many of whom remain in power. She protested beside and among friends and family at public demonstrations. In addition, she and a friend volunteered to assist doctors at a health clinic at the protest site, which was confirmed by a support letter from her friend in Exhibit 5. I accept the testimony of the principal claimant as well as the letter from the principal claimant\u2019s friend for two reasons.\n\n[7] First, the principal claimant was able to tell me about her volunteer work at the clinic with sufficient detail that I find her testimony credible, and two, the principal claimant\u2019s friend\u2019s letter was consistent with the principal claimant\u2019s credible testimony. The principal claimant told me about being on site when security forces responded with force and she testified without hesitation and in detail about what happened that day including her detention. She also testified with respect to why it was important to her to be involved in and at the protest and she spoke with conviction about her wish for a better future for her country.\n\n[8] In addition to being detained in XXXX 2019, the principal claimant further testified with respect to the fact that when she returned from the UAE where she got a US visa to attend her cousin\u2019s wedding, she was taken aside by security and asked questions about her US visa and why she had it. In addition she was told by the security that they knew she was at the protest and they warned her not to testify against them and told her she would be monitored, which was clear terrified her.\n\n[9] She told me in detail how she left Sudan within a couple of days of that event, as well as how she got through airport security without question by a friend of her husband\u2019s who worked at the airport bribing someone to assist her. Despite the difficult events she experienced in Sudan, I further find that the principal claimant continued her political involvement in Canada by participating in demonstrations in Canada, photos of which she showed me on her phone at the hearing and which were subsequently made Exhibit 11.\n\n[10] I found her testimony about her involvement in political activity convincing when she told me that her family was not at all political, though they objected to the Sudanese government and they had told her not to become involved because it would get her into trouble. I asked her why she protested despite that advice and she convincingly testified that the government went to far and her country deserved better. I also asked the principal claimant about the fact that she left Sudan in XXXX 2019 but did not come to Canada and make a claim until March 2020.\n\n[11] She explained she initially arrived in the United States with no intention of staying as she testified that even though she was terrified in Sudan, the political situation changes frequently and she hoped things might improve. She also testified that another reason she did not intend to stay in the US was that she is separated from her husband who remains there however, she testified that when she was in the US in XXXX 2019, her husband called to tell her that things were worse and that the rapid security forces came to look for you, which was when she realized she had to stay.\n\n[12] The principal claimant also explained why she did not make a claim in the US but instead came to Canada citing the Trump anti-Muslim policies as well as a ban on Sudanese immigration in the US at the time. She further explained that she was delayed in coming to Canada by the birth of the minor claimant in XXXX 2019. She provided in Exhibit 5 medical documentation to support that, as well as that she had asked the doctor if she could travel during her third trimester so she could be in Canada when her daughter was born, and her doctor advised against this. I draw no negative credibility inference from the failure to claim in the United States.\n\n[13] I find that the principal claimant was a very credible witness and I believe what she alleged in support of her claim. She testified openly and without hesitation. There were no material inconsistencies in her testimony or contradictions between it and the other evidence before me. Overall her testimony and the personal documentary evidence before me are consistent in content and chronology.\n\n[14] The principal claimant also disclosed many documents to support her claim in Exhibit 5, including support letters to corroborate the events about which she testified. I find that she has established her subjective fear. In making this finding I have considered the fact that her husband remains in Sudan and has never met his daughter. The fact that the principal claimant left when pregnant and then stayed away from her husband is consistent with the actions of a person who fears persecution if she returns. It was clear from her testimony that it has not been easy for her to be separated from her husband.\n\n[15] People who seek refugee protection also have to establish that they have a well-founded fear of persecution on a Convention ground, which means not only does a person have to establish their subjective fear, but there also has to be an objective reason for their fear. According to the information we have about the country, which in this case also includes additional country documentation disclosed by the principal claimant\u2019s lawyer in Exhibits 4, 6, and 10.\n\n[16] There is substantial objective country documentation to support the principal claimant\u2019s subjective fear, including in Exhibit 3, namely the National Documentation Package for Sudan, July 30, 2021 version, as well as the additional documentation I just referred to in Exhibits 4, 6, and 10.\n\n[17] I find that the principal claimant has established a nexus to the Convention ground of political opinion because the persecution she fears is in part based on her active involvement in opposing the government, militia, and security apparatus of Sudan that remains despite the change or transition in 2019. Second, I find that she has established a nexus to a Convention ground because the persecution she fears is also in part a reflection of her membership in a particular social group of women and girls facing violence in Sudan. The persecution she faces includes being threatened with sexual assault, which is a threat not faced by men who voice their political opinion.\n\n[18] While the political situation and the use of lethal force against civilians improved in 2019 with the transitional government installed in that year, there were still significant human rights abuses, particularly a lack of investigation of, and accountability for violence against women as set out in item 2.1 of Exhibit 3.\n\n[19] Of particular note is the objective documentation in Exhibit 10 that includes reports that despite the improvements that marked President Bashir\u2019s overthrow in 2019, it is reported that protests on the third anniversary of that were marked by gender-based violence including rape and gang rape. This was also preceded by killings of protestors and also sexual violence against women protestors perpetrated by the country\u2019s security forces and other armed groups in the wake of a military coup in October 2021, also as reported in Exhibit 10. I therefore find there is an objective basis for the principal claimant\u2019s subjective fear and that her fear of persecution is well-founded.\n\n[20] Because the forces are involved in the persecution, I find that they are unwilling or unable to protect the principal claimant from the risks she faces if she returns to Sudan. As above, I note the reports of ongoing sexual violence that women in Sudan continue to face after the transition and then the military coup. I find the principal claimant has presented sufficient, clear, and convincing evidence that rebuts the presumption that state authorities in Sudan can or will protect her if she returns.\n\n[21] I have also considered whether a viable Internal Flight Alternative exists for the principal claimant. On the evidence before me having taken into account he situation in Sudan and the fact that the authorities have looked for the principal claimant, I find that she has established that she faces a serious possibility of persecution throughout the territory, and therefore no viable Internal Flight Alternative exists for her.\n\n[22] For all these reasons I find the principal claimant faces a serious possibility of persecution in Sudan on a Convention ground. I therefore find her to be a Convention refugee and I accept her claim.\n\n[23] With respect to the minor claimant, I have considered whether she would face a serious possibility of persecution or risk to life, cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or torture should she return to the USA.\n\n[24] When the principal claimant was asked what she feared for the minor claimant, she testified that if the minor claimant was sent back to the United States the principal claimant would not be able to be with her and she could not grow up without parents. She testified that she thought it would be very traumatic for the minor claimant to be sent to the US without the principal claimant as they had never been separated for a day.\n\n[25] She testified she wants the minor claimant to be raised with loving parents and in her own religion. Information contained in the minor claimant\u2019s Basis of Claim form and narrative of the principal claimant completed by the principal claimant and designated representative of the minor claimant does not include allegations about any risk of persecution or risk to life, cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or torture should the minor claimant return to the USA.\n\n[26] Counsel for the claimant submitted that the minor claimant faces a risk of being detained while being processed in the child welfare system in the USA and could disappear in the system. She further submits that given the minor claimant\u2019s age, she would not be able to stay in touch with her parents and would not be able to locate them when she is older. Finally, she submits that I must consider the fact that she is black.\n\n[27] The National Documentation Package for the United States provides information regarding the country conditions in the US. Amnesty International published a report focusing on unaccompanied children seeking asylum in the US and includes the fact that there has been forcible separation of children from family members, which in some cases amounted to ill treatment and torture to the use of tent cities to detain children for seeking asylum in the US. The report addresses the thousands of children who travel alone to the United States to flee violence and persecution in their home countries. However, I do not give this document full weight because it refers to children entering the US to seek asylum and those who are awaiting for determination of their immigration status whereas the minor claimant is a citizen of the US and therefore has access to rights, liberties, and protection which may not be available to children entering the US as asylum seekers.\n\n[28] In addition, this report focuses on one particular emergency care shelter in Homestead, Florida which was operated by the United States Department of Health and Human Services, HHS, and does not provide substantial information about the treatment of children who are USA citizens entering the US in general. In addition, a response to this Amnesty International report from Caliburn International Corporation describes Homestead as a temporary facility that was reopened by HHS in response to the arrival of thousands of unaccompanied children on the southern border of the US. The response states that unaccompanied children receive excellent care at the Homestead emergency shelter which includes educational services, healthcare, emotional, and mental health supports and more.\n\n[29] There is also a 2019 report published by the United States Congressional Research Service including information about unaccompanied alien children in the United States NDP but it is centered on unaccompanied alien children apprehended at the southwest border between US ports of entry while attempting to enter the US without authorization and who among other things lack lawful immigration status. The minor claimant on the other hand has lawful status in the US and I therefore put little weight on this document in terms of its\u2019 value in establishing a serious possibility that the minor claimant faces a risk of persecution, harm, or torture in the US.\n\n[30] I reviewed the information found in the United States NDP related to the risk of persecution that may effect an unaccompanied child who is entering the US, but there is insufficient evidence before me to support a finding that a child who is a US citizen faces a risk of persecution upon entry to the US. The minor claimant did not provide any additional evidence regarding any risk of persecution or harm that the minor claimant faces in the US.\n\n[31] I have also taken guidance from the UNHCR Handbook on determining refugee status and Canadian jurisprudence, which indicates that discrimination can amount to persecution cumulatively when the following conditions are met.\n\n[32] First, there must be a number of discriminatory acts which take place in a general atmosphere of insecurity in the country of origin. The discriminatory acts must be of such a nature that they are substantially prejudicial to the person concerned including serious restrictions on the right to earn a livelihood or to access normally available educational facilities. Where the cumulative nature of discrimination results in an insecure future for the person concerned, this constitutes persecution.\n\n[33] In making the assessment, I must also consider the claimant\u2019s personal circumstances and vulnerabilities and in this regard I refer to the case of Liang versus Canada, as well as to the UNHCR Handbook. In this case, the claimants have not established that the minor claimant will be placed in a child welfare system should she return to the USA, nor establish that any services provided to the minor claimant by a child welfare organization in the US would result in a serious possibility of persecution.\n\n[34] I find that the minor claimant has not demonstrated that she faces persecution or would be personally subjected to a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or a danger of torture upon return to the US. I find that the minor claimant has not established a well-founded fear of persecution and there is insufficient evidence before me including objective country condition documents which could link this claim to a forward-facing risk of persecution under Section 96 of the IRPA or to a risk of harm under the IRPA Section 97 in the US. Therefore, the minor claimant\u2019s claim is rejected under Sections 96 and 97 of the Act.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

        "unofficial_text":"2022 RLLR 94\n\nCitation: 2022 RLLR 94\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: August 18, 2022\nPanel: Nour El-Sabah Farhat\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Edward Bansah\nCountry: Ghana\nRPD Number: TC0-11238\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2023-01023\nATIP Pages: N\/A\n\nDECISION\n\n[1] MEMBER: XXXX XXXX, the claimant, is a citizen of Ghana claiming refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n\n[2] The details of the claimant\u2019s allegations are fully set out in the claimant\u2019s Basis of Claim form narrative. In short, the claimant alleges that she fears persecution by her abusive husband if she returns to Ghana. Having considered the totality of the evidence, the Panel finds that the claimant has satisfied the burden of establishing a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground based on her membership in a particular social group as a woman. In fact, the Convention refugee ground of membership in a particular social group set out in section 96 of the IRPA and the Refugee Convention includes individuals fearing gender-based persecution. In deciding this claim, I have taken into consideration the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 4, gender consideration in proceedings before the Immigration and Refugee Board. In particular, the Panels considers that culture can impact how individuals interpret personal topics such as experiences of trauma, which can affect how they describe their experiences. The Panel also notes that in cases of gender-based violence, individuals may face difficulty in their hearing for several reasons, including shame, stigma, secrecy, and the cycle of power and control that can often contribute to such violence.\n\n[3] With respect to the issue of identity, the claimant\u2019s personal and national identity has been established, on a balance of probabilities, through a passport issued by the Republic of Ghana, copy of which was provided to the Board.\n\n[4] Now on credibility. In assessing the credibility of the evidence presented by the claimant in support of her refugee claim, The Panel is guided by the principles established in the Federal Code of Appeals, Decision of Maldonado, when a claimant affirms to tell the truth, this creates a presumption of truthfulness unless there is evidence the contrary. In this case, the claimant has been candid and straightforward in her testimony. She has provided spontaneous and consistent details in support of her allegations and her refugee claim. There have been no contradictions or omissions that would go to the core of the claim. The Panel finds the claimant to be a credible witness and therefore believes what she has alleged in support of her claim. The claimant answered the questions of the Panel without hesitation and exaggeration and provided details when required. Further, the claimant\u2019s testimony was consistent with her Basis of Claim form and the interview notes at the point of entry.\n\n[5] The claimant testified that got she got married to XXXX XXXX (ph) in XXXX 2017. The couple was living in the city of XXXX. Shortly after, XXXX XXXX began getting physically, psychologically, and sexually abusive towards the claimant. The allegations of the claimant in regards to the abuse that she went through are corroborated by the psychotraumatology report that was submitted in support of the application of the claimant, and affidavits by her cousin, XXXX XXXX (ph), and her friends XXXX XXXX (ph). The claimant testified that XXXX XXXX would insult her and beat her with a belt to a point where she would have a swollen face and bruises all over her body. He would also threaten her on several occasions with a knife for small arguments. The claimant testified that when she asked XXXX XXXX for a divorce, he threatened to kill her if she brings the topic of divorce again. The Panel finds that, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant was abused by her husband. When the claimant would talk or denounce the actions of XXXX to her family, her family would tell her to not report the incidents to the police because it would bring disgrace and shame to the family. The claimant testified that only her cousin, XXXX XXXX, told her that the abuse was unacceptable, and she should escape her husband. On XXXX XXXX, 2019, XXXX XXXX beat the claimant so violently that she wanted to report the incident to the police at XXXX, but her family prevented her from doing so because they did not want her husband to go to jail as her husband is perceived as an honourable man in the community. After this event, the claimant decided to run away from her husband to protect herself. She ran away on the XXXX 2019 by taking a taxi to stay with her friend, XXXX XXXX, who lived in Accra. After the claimant ran away from XXXX, XXXX XXXX was able to find her in Accra in a matter of a week with the help of his men. In fact, the claimant testified that her husband became a wealthy over the last few years because he has a very successful business. He also created a lot of connections throughout the country because of his business and has men working for him that were able to locate the claimant. The Panel finds that, on a balance of probabilities, the claimant\u2019s husband has connections throughout the country and was able to locate the claimant in Accra. After finding her in Accra, XXXX XXXX took his wife back home and told her that if she ran away again, he would kill her. After this, the sexual and physical abuse continued until the claimant left Ghana in XXXX 2020.\n\n[6] Further, XXXX XXXX has been \u2014 the claimant\u2019s husband, has been to the claimant\u2019s parents\u2019 residence numerous times since she left Ghana to ask about his wife\u2019s \u2014 the claimant\u2019s whereabouts. He has been threatening the claimant\u2019s family and threatened that he will kill the claimant if he saw her again as she was his wife, and he had all rights over her. According to the claimant\u2019s Basis of Claim form narrative and testimony, XXXX even physically attacked her mother that was admitted to the hospital because of the sustained injuries, particularly to her hand. The family reported the incident to the Ghanaian police who arrested XXXX XXXX. XXXX was released shortly after. The claimant indicated that XXXX has the financial means to pay bribes to the authorities to be released, and that might be the reason of his release by the police. According to the Panel, this speaks to the claimant\u2019s credibility in that she did not try to speculate. These allegations are corroborated by the affidavit of the cousin of the claimant and by a medical report by Dr. XXXX (ph) confirming an assault on the claimant\u2019s mother. The Panel finds that, on a balance of probabilities, that the mother of the claimant was attacked by XXXX and that he was arrested for this attack.\n\n[7] During the hearing, when asked by the Panel if it was possible to call her mother in Ghana to confirm the incident, the claimant spontaneously accepted and called her mother. However, the mother of the claimant was not picking up the phone, as shown on the screen by the claimant. According to the Panel, the willingness and the spontaneity of the claimant to call her mom during the hearing talks to the credibility of the claimant and her allegations.\n\n[8] The Panel finds that the claimant\u2019s experiences of gender-based violence amount to persecution. The Panel considered the seriousness of the harm, the cumulative act of the agent of prosecution, and the fact that the harm is repetitive and persistent. The Panel therefore finds that the claimant has a subjective fear of persecution if she returns to Ghana, on a balance of probabilities.\n\n[9] Now on the well-founded fear of persecution. According to the country documentary evidence, gender-based violence is alarmingly high in Ghana, and violence against women remains widespread throughout the country. As such, domestic violence is a serious and pervasive issue in Ghana. Some reports find that victims of domestic violence in Ghana generally do not report abuse because of the shame and the stigma associated to it. Support is not always forthcoming when victims approach relatives or even the police. The objective documentary evidence indicates that domestic violence is viewed as a private family matter in Ghana, and as a result, it is difficult for victims to report abuse and seek help. There is a stigma and shame associated with domestic violence in Ghana. Additionally, women\u2019s access to justice in Ghana is embedded by gender norms, societal beliefs, and physical and cultural barriers who stigmatize women and prevent them from reporting incidents of domestic violence. The Panel finds that the claimant\u2019s fear of persecution if she returns to Ghana is objectively well-founded.\n\n[10] Now on state protection, according to the objective documentary evidence, inadequate capacity and awareness of law enforcement institution to enforce laws regarding violence against women remains an obstacle to addressing violence against women in Ghana. Survivor encounters with the state authority leave them often feeling revictimized. Additionally, corruption, in particular, was said to affect access to justice when perpetrators pay bribes or use their networks of influence to avoid persecution by the courts. Consequently, the Panel finds that the presumption of state protection has been rebutted. In fact, the mother of the claimant went to the police to report assault and did not receive the help that she required from the authorities. It would be objectively unreasonable for the claimant to seek the protection of the state in these circumstances, and that adequate state protection would not be reasonably forthcoming.\n\n[11] Regarding internal flight alternative, in order to determine whether an IFA exists, the Panel must assess whether there is any location in Ghana in which the claimant would not face a serious possibility of persecution and whether it will be reasonable to expect her to move there. The safety of an IFA is dependent on the claimant\u2019s personal profile. The Panel finds that the claimant does not have a viable IFA for the reasons explained below. With respect to motivation to pursue the claimant, given the history of the abuse, the long term nature of the violence, the fact that the claimant is viewed to have brought shame to her husband, and the ongoing threats to the claimant and her family, I find that the claimant\u2019s husband would be motivated to track her down and harm her. I note that the claimant\u2019s husband did pursue and locate the claimant in Accra, and I find that this also speaks to motivation. The Panel also finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant\u2019s husband would have the means to locate the claimant throughout Ghana. This is demonstrated by the fact that the claimant\u2019s husband was able to locate her after a week of searching in Accra, a city which is approximately XXXX kilometers away from their hometown and home to 4.2 million people The fact that the claimant\u2019s husband is a wealthy man with a lot of connections also speaks to his means to locate the claimant throughout Ghana. The Panel therefore finds that the agent of harm, the claimant\u2019s husband, has the motivation and means to locate the claimant. Therefore, there will be a serious possibility of persecution throughout Ghana for the claimant and there is no viable internal flight alternative available to her.\n\n[12] For the foregoing reasons, the Panel finds that the claimant is a convention refugee under section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. Accordingly, the claim is accepted.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

Sorry. It took me longer than what I expected. So during the break I was able to go over my notes and I have reached a decision and I will give you a decision and the reasons for the decision. And I think you will be able to (inaudible).\n[2] So as I said, I have considered your testimony and the other evidence before me and I will give you my decision orally and the reasons for my decision. This will be my decision in the refugee protection claim of XXXX XXXX. You allege that you are a citizen of Uganda and you are seeking protection under section 96 and paragraph 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. So in rendering my decision, I have considered the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline for gender consideration in proceedings before the Immigration and Refugee Board and I have also considered and applied the Guideline 9, proceedings before the IRB involving sexual orientation, gender identity and expression and sex characteristics.\n[3] I find that you are a Convention refugee as the evidence before me establishes that you would face a serious possibility of persection in Uganda due to your membership in a particular social group as a lesbian woman in Uganda.\n[4] So I will tell you how I assessed the evidence before me and I will start with the allegations you made. The details of your allegations can be found in Exhibit 2. They are in the narrative you have included in your Basis of Claim form. So you allege that you are a citizen of Uganda and you allege that you fear persecution based on your sexual orientation. You identify as a lesbian woman. You allege that you have been mistreated, that you have been forced to marry a man much older than you who already had two (2) wives. You allege that you have been sexually assaulted by a police officer when you were arrested and detained for same sex activities. You allege that the community in general \u2014 you fear the community in general, the Uganda authorities, the police and some members of your family. You allege that you have have been separated from your girlfriend and you still do not know where she is. You indicated that your aunt, who helped you escape, continues to get threats. You allege that if you return to Uganda, you will be jailed and there will be no hope for you to be who you are and live as a woman who is attracted by women. I have examined your claim under section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, as I find that the risk you described is linked to at least one (1) of the grounds prescribed in section 96, specifically, membership in a particular social group as a lesbian woman in Uganda.\n[5] I verified your identity and I find that your identity as a national of Uganda is established by the documents you have provided. You have provided a valid passport from Uganda and I have a certified copy of that document in Exhibit 1. And you have provided school documents from Uganda.\n[6] So as I had told you at the beginning of the hearing, when you testified I verified the credibility and verified the declarations you have made in your forms. So as I already mentioned, I was guided by the Chairperson\u2019s Guidelines 4 and 9. And in assessing your claim I was mindful of of your sexual orientation and the fact that you are a woman facing some challenges in Uganda and you alleged to have gone through forced marriage. In assessing your allegations I was also mindful of the presumption that helps to approach the assessment of refugee claims. So when a claimant swears to the truth of certain allegations, it creates a presumption that those allegations are true unless there is a reason to doubt their truthfulness. And I found in your case that you testified in a straightforward manner except at the beginning of the hearing you were not answering the questions but as we progressed you started answering the questions that were asked and not telling whatever you wanted to say. And I have found that there were no relevant inconsistencies in your testimony or contradictions between what you testified to and the other evidence before me. No serious discrepancies were left unexplained. Everything was, in my opinion, explained satisfactory.\n[7] So you explained what you meant when you said that you were married to a man. You explained that you were taken there but did not stay. You found a way to escape. This clarified some passages of your narrative. It explained how you were sure when you got pregnant that it was not his child. And I find that your testimony and the other evidence before me establishes the allegations you have made that you have been harassed, targeted for exclusion from your community, you and your aunt. You had to move out of your usual place. And your allegation that you have been forced to marry a man chosen by your father and the allegation that you have been arrested and sexually assaulted is \u2014 those allegations I find your testimony and the evidence is established on a balance of probabilities. And I have found your testimony corroborated by the documents you have provided. And those documents are in Exhibit 6 and 7. I have reviewed these documents and I have no serious concerns about their authenticity. And you have provided testimonies from friends and family members, including your aunt. You have high school friends, members of the community who shared what they know about your sexual orientation and how you have been treated in the community and by authorities. Your aunt, XXXX (ph), who supported you, gave you a place to stay and encouraged you to complain when you were assaulted and helped you to escape and come to Canada has provided testimony. I think I received two (2) letters of support. You provided a copy of one (1) of the threatening notes sent to your aunt\u2019s place, XXXX, threatening to harm you and her, Exhibit 7. You provided documents from the local authorities. These documents show that you were not wanted in your community. They wanted you to move out. And I note that there is testimony from one (1) of the local administrator who tried to protect you but says that he could not because the people in the community did not approve of your behaviour, the same sex relationship and the activities you were involved in. That is in Exhibit 7. It is among the personal documents you have provided. And you provided letters of support from LGBTQ organization in Canada in pictures showing you participating in activities in Toronto in Exhibit 7. And you have provided medical professional and social workers\u2019 testimonies and reports. These professionals have assisted you in settling in Canada and they have been providing healthcare to you. So when all of these documents are considered together with your testimony, I find that you have established your sexual orientation as a lesbian on a balance of probabilities. And as such, I find that you have been a credible witness and I accept that you have \u2014 what you have alleged in your Basis of Claim I accept it as true on a balance of probabilities. And I find that you have established a subjective fair to return to Uganda being a lesbian woman whose sexual orientation has been exposed as you explained today.\n[8] So in continuing assessing your claim under section 96, I had to verify whether your subjective fear is well-founded. The other sufficient objective evidence establishing you would face more than a mere possibility of being persecuted based on your sexual orientation if you return to Uganda. I have verified whether the treatment you would be subject to would amount to persecution and I have reviewed the objective evidence. And I find that you would be subjected to a treatment that raises to the level of persecution. In fact, the objective evidence indicates that same sex activities are criminalized in Uganda. Homosexuality is a crime in Uganda. Section 145 and 146 of the Ugandan Penal Code provides seven (7) year imprisonment sentence. Consensual same sex activities in public or in private are criminalized. And in Item 2.1 the US Department of State report that consensual same sex sexual conduct is criminalized in Uganda and this report confirms that LGBTQ person face discrimination and illegal restrictions, harassment, violence, intimidation and authorities perpetrate \u2014 during the period covered, authorities had perpetrated and they tolerated violence against LGBTQ individuals in Uganda. We have many documents in section 6 of the National Documentation Package for Uganda. I will cite some. Item 6.2 indicates that there is rampant social homophobia in Uganda. And we have Item 6.3 which is a document \u2014 a 2021 document and it says that the government is hostile to LGBTQ activities and these behaviours aggravate violence against LGBTQ members. And these documents says that violence against LGBTQ is well-documented and we find many examples in that document, 6.3, that Uganda\u2019s laws and policies do not specifically protect LGBTQ persons against violations within the criminal justice system and LGBTQ persons in police detention suffer violations linked to their sexual orientation. LGBTQ persons in prison, they face discrimination and abuse of their dignity. And then we find information that several cases of people subjected forced anal examination (inaudible) engagement in prescribed consensual same sex acts have been documented. This is for gay individuals. Item 6.4 we find indication that there have been human rights violations against LGBTQ persons and including acts by police and other state agencies. LGBTQ persons who have been arrested or detained reported being subjected to ill treatment, including humiliation, physical and sexual assault.\n[9] And in your case, you have testified and we have information that you have been assaulted during detention. And I have another document that talks about the situation, document 6.5. Some of the information we found in this document is that there were a few instances of protection of the rights of LGBTQ persons by the police. In your case, we \u2014 I note also that when (inaudible) Counsel indicated that he tried, not everybody is against LGBTQ, obviously, in Uganda. But in the same document, we see that they say that the police \u2014 the Ugandan police force committed the most violations against the LGBTQ persons. They were responsible for 89 out of the total 398 violations that were recorded. And they say that the most violated rights were the right to equality and the freedom from discrimination. There are more information \u2014 more details in the National Documentation Package in section 6. So I find that the objective evidence before me indicates that sexual minorities are at risk of persecution at the hands of the society in Uganda but also at the hands of the authorities in Uganda, especially as same sex relationships and activities are criminalized. From that objective evidence we learned that victims do not have access to justice and they suffer human rights violations at the community and at the hands of authorities. So I find that you would face a serious possibility of persecution in Uganda if you return. And I find that your fear to return to Uganda having been exposed as a lesbian is well-founded.\n[10] So before I concluded, I also had to verify whether you would get adequate state protection and whether you would have a viable internal flight alternative in Uganda. And I find that the protection will not be reasonably forthcoming for you. You have tried, before your aunt helped you bring to justice \u2014 try to bring justice that police officer who assaulted you. And you testified the case did not go far. I find that as state agents are among agents of persecution and sexual \u2014 same sex activities are criminalized, it would not be reasonable to expect you to approach authorities for protection. And approaching them when same sex activities are criminalized would put you at more risk. You would be at risk to be persecuted. You may be sent to jail where you would face mistreatment. I find that you have rebutted the presumption that states are capable and willing to protect their citizens. I think that there is no adequate protection for you in Uganda as a lesbian woman.\n[11] I assessed whether there is a viable flight \u2014 internal flight alternative for you in Uganda. And I find that there is none as I find that there is a serious possibility of persecution for you throughout Uganda. The laws regarding homosexuality apply uniformly throughout Uganda so there is no place in Uganda where you can live and be safe from the authorities and society homophobia. I find that you face a serious possibility of persecution everywhere in Uganda. And also I note that Guideline 9 reminds us that a person should not have to hide their sexual orientation to be safe. So I find you have no viable internal flight alternative in Uganda.\n[12] And in conclusion, I find that you are a Convention refugee and I accept your claim.\n[13] CLAIMANT: Thank you so much, Madam Member.\n[14] MEMBER: You are welcome.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

He was suffering from depression and nightmares as a result of the drowning death of one of his friends.\n\n[4] His friend, JH, talked to him about his religion and how having faith would help him with his problems. This made an impression on the claimant and as a result he started to attend services with other believers. He also assisted in distributing flyers in the park at night to introduce others to the faith.\n\n[5] In discussion with his family, the claimant fled China with the help of a smuggler so he can practise his religion freely. However, the claimant was forced to pay off a substantial amount of debt to the smuggler and ended up working at XXXX XXXX for close to three (3) years before he was able to pay it off and leave the XXXX.\n\n[6] In Canada, the claimant practises his faith freely.\n\n[7] The Panel has considered all of the evidence, and finds that the claimant-\n\n(audio 1 ends)\n\n(audio 2 starts)\n[8] His oral and written evidence that there is a serious possibility that he would suffer persecution in China due to his faith and membership in the Church of Almighty God.\n\n[9] The claimant provided copies of his Chinese passport, Hukou, and resident identification card, under Exhibit 5. On a balance of probabilities, he was able to establish his personal and national identity as a citizen of China.\n\n[10] The Panel finds that the claimant\u2019s testimony in general is credible, was consistent with all of the documents provided in support of his claim.\n\n[11] He testified about the religious materials that are important to his faith. He talked about the meaning and importance of prayer. He testified about how he was introduced to the Church of Almighty God and his own involvement in China. He testified about what takes place during services back in China, and he explained how he continues to practise his faith here in Canada.\n\n[12] He testified about his close to three (3) years stay at a XXXX where he worked to try and pay off the debt, he owed the smuggler. He testified that although he was not kept against his will, he had an obligation to pay off the debt, if not the smugglers would go after his parents in China.\n\n[13] As a result, he was not able to fully practise his religion until after he paid off the debt and left the XXXX in XXXX of 2020. At which point he was able to find and join a group of Almighty God believers.\n\n[14] The claimant talked about the three (3) eras. The testimony is consistent with the tenets of the Church of Almighty God which are described in our documentary evidence, Exhibit 3, Item 12.30.\n\n[15] Their group leader also provided a letter under Exhibit 5. The same Exhibit also contain photos, showing the claimant\u2019s church activities in Canada. The Panel asked him to explain what was taking place in these photos.\n\n[16] The Panel accepts the evidence provided, and finds on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant is a genuine believer of the Church of Almighty God. His evidence was both internally consistent and consistent with the other evidence provided in support of his claim.\n\n[17] The claimant is not presently being pursued by the authorities; however, counsel\u2019s disclosure under Exhibit 7 and Exhibit 8, details persecution members of the Church of Almighty God and other house Christians experience at the hands of Chinese authorities.\n\n[18] The Panel finds that, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant is a genuine believer, and that he will continue to practise his faith in China, as a result he will be subjected to arrest and persecution at the hands of authorities, if he is to return to China.\n\n[19] He also testified that this group in China had to suspend all services in October of 2021 due to ongoing crackdown of similar groups in their area.\n\n[20] Exhibit 3, Item 12.30 states that the Church of Almighty God is banned in China and that church members are persecuted in China. It provides examples of believers who had suffered various forms of torture and indoctrination.\n\n[21] Illegal religions have been targets of systematic and severe crackdowns, and there have been a vicious crackdown on religion by authorities in recent years, which makes the situation more dangerous.\n\n[22] Exhibit 3, Item 12.1 also indicates that Church of Almighty God members have been arrested and subjected to physical abuse, including beatings and sleep deprivation.\n\n[23] [The Panel finds that the claimant established that he has a well-founded fear of persecution at the hands of the Chinese authorities, based on both personal and objective evidence. The Panel finds that the claimant would not be able to practise his religion freely in China as a member of the Church of Almighty God.\n\n[24] In summary, the Panel finds that on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant\u2019s fear of persecution is well-founded.\n\n[25] The Panel finds that given that it is the State who is the agent of persecution that state protection would not be available to him.\n\n[26] In terms of an internal flight alternative, given that the claimant is a genuine and ongoing believer of the Church of Almighty God, even if he relocates to other parts of the country the risk remains the same as it is the State authorities that he fears, and the State has labelled the Church of Almighty God as an evil cult.\n\n[27] The Panel is satisfied that there will be a serious possibility of persecution for the claimant throughout the country, thus the possibility or viability of an internal flight alternative fails on the first prong of the test.\n\n[28] In conclusion, after assessing all of the evidence the Panel finds if the claimant is returned to China, that he would face a serious possibility of persecution on the basis of his religion under section 96 of IRPA.\n\n[29] Therefore, the Panel finds that he is a Convention refugee, and this claim is accepted.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

I have considered your testimony and the other evidence in the case and as I said I am ready to render my decision orally. I have also considered and applied Guideline 9 relating to gender expression and sexual orientation. You claim to be a citizen of Nigeria and are claiming refugee protection pursuant to Sections 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. As I have already stated I find that you are a Convention refugee and for these following reasons.\n\n[2] Your allegations can be found in your Basis of Claim form found in Exhibit 2. You allege the following. You are a citizen of Nigeria and fear persecution at the hands of Nigerian authorities, family members, community, and society due to your sexual orientation as a bisexual woman. You further allege that there is no state protection for you or an Internal Flight Alternative anywhere in Nigeria.\n\n[3] In regards to your identity, your personal identity as a citizen of Nigeria has been established by your testimony and the supporting documents filed in Exhibit 1, and this is specifically your valid Nigerian passport. I find therefore that on a balance of probabilities that identity and country of reference have been established.\n\n[4] I do also find that there is a link between what you fear and one of the five Convention grounds because of your membership in a particular social group as a bisexual woman.\n\n[5] Next I will turn to the issue of credibility. I find you to be a credible witness and believe what you have alleged in support of your claim. When a claimant affirms to tell the truth, this creates a presumption of truthfulness unless there is evidence to the contrary. You have been consistent with your narrative as submitted in your Basis of Claim, and credible in your allegations and evidence. You provided corroborative evidence in the form of letters from your neighbour, sister, as well as photographs of you and your former spouse. I find that this corroborative evidence submitted was credible and trustworthy and I assign it full weight in support of your allegations.\n\n[6] I did have concerns with the letter submitted from XXXX XXXX as the date it was written is not consistent with the date you have registered, but as your testimony was credible, I do find that you are a member of XXXX XXXX and have accepted your explanation that it was a typo. You were also able to provide spontaneous details during your testimony. There have been no relevant contradictions or omissions that would go to the core of your claim or would rebut the presumption of truth. I find that on a balance of probabilities, based on your testimony, that you are a bisexual woman for the following reasons.\n\n[7] In your testimony your description of your same sex relationship flowed naturally and unprompted and was generally consistent with the evidence and your narrative. You were able to explain in detail about your past relationships and other specific details pertaining to them. You were able to provide significant details about your same sex relationships in Nigeria including how you disclosed your attraction to one another, the qualities you liked about your former partners, as well as details about the types of activities you and your partners enjoyed.\n\n[8] You allege that you discovered your sexual orientation when you were in secondary school. This was in 1992. As you began to experience a feeling when you were around your female friends that made you happy. You testified that you started your first same sex relationship with XXXX while you were in secondary school in 1992. XXXXwas a classmate for some time but it was not until 1992 that the both of you were in a same sex relationship. Your relationship with XXXX began when the both of you were playing a game of truth and dare and you jokingly said that you were attracted to her and upon notifying XXXXof this, she was happy and one-week later XXXXasked you to kiss her. You testified about your attraction to her and the things that you enjoyed about her. Additionally, you testified that when she went away for school in 1994, the both of you broke up. You also testified that you tried to keep in contact with her by visiting her family\u2019s home but they moved and you lost contact with them.\n\n[9] You have testified at length about your relationship with your long-time partner, XXXX, which began in 2010 and ended in 2015 when she decided to get married. You testified that you met her while you were both working at the same school and you were able to provide detailed testimony about the work that she did. You were able to tell me about a memorable time when the both of you were working together on the school graduation in 2014. When asked why that was memorable, you testified that it was because you were organizing it together and that was a moment in which the both of you worked well as a team.\n\n[10] You were able to testify about the celebrations that you shared together. You testified that you both celebrated Christmas together by cooking food and eating together. Additionally, you testified that you celebrated each other\u2019s birthdays by buying each other gifts and you notified me of the gifts that were purchased for each other. The testimony provided was detailed and spontaneous.\n\n[11] You also testified about another same sex relationship that you had while you were in Nigeria and this was with XXXX. This was your most recent same sex relationship in Nigeria as you first met XXXX in XXXX of 2018. When asked about how the two of you met, you were able to testify that she came into your store to make purchases and while she was there she would ask you questions with the intention of getting to know you. You were able to testify about the types of products she purchased from your store, along with the frequency of her visits which was three to four times per week.\n\n[12] The relationship evolved as the both of you spent more time with each other and as the both of you had husbands that were not around, it gave you more time to get to know each other. You testified that your relationship became more serious in XXXX 2019 when XXXX came to your house and upon drinking wine you revealed your sexual orientation and became intimate. When asked about why you felt comfortable revealing this information to XXXX, you testified that she was trustworthy and you came to this understanding as she was not a judgemental person and was understanding.\n\n[13] When asked about what activities the both of you did together, you indicated that you both enjoyed shopping and watching sexually explicit films together. I note that you submitted pictures of yourself and XXXX together in a variety of different settings, such as a store and in your room, which I do find support your allegations. When asked about the photos, you were able to provide consistent and detailed testimony. You were also able to provide consistent testimony about how your sexuality was exposed.\n\n[14] You testified that XXXX\u2019s husband discovered that she was spending a lot of time with you. Upon asking her about this XXXX revealed to her husband what was occurring between the two of you and she accused you of forcing this relationship onto her. XXXX\u2019s husband since finding out this information has come to your house with the intent of inflicting harm. I find that on a balance of probabilities you were in these relationships as alleged.\n\n[15] Additionally, you were able to provide me with information about your efforts to get into a relationship in Canada which have not been successful due to the pandemic as it has been difficult to make new connections. You were able to testify about your membership to the XXXX XXXX which I find to be credible. I therefore find on a balance of probabilities that you have established your sexual orientation as a bisexual woman and I have found your fear of authorities and your family to be credible. I do find that you have established your subjective fear.\n\n[16] I further find on a balance of probabilities that you have an objective basis for your fear because the documented conditions for Nigeria as per the evidence in Exhibit 3, the NDP for Nigeria. Item 2.1 reads, a 2014 law effectively renders illegal all forms of activity supporting or promoting lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or intersex LGBTI rights.\n\n[17] According to the law, anyone convicted of entering into a same sex marriage or civil union may be sentenced to up to 14 years imprisonment. This law also criminalizes the public show of same sex amorous affection. A 2016 Human Rights Watch report asserted police and members of the public used the law to legitimize human rights abuses against LGBTI persons such as torture, sexual violence, arbitrary detention, extortion, and violations of due process rights.\n\n[18] Item 6.1 reads, homophobic violence is occurring without fear of consequences. It goes on to say law enforcement agents consider the vigilantes attacks as an intervention to ease their work to enforce peace in the community, therefore the victims are the ones who get arrested on the basis of homosexuality and face more stigma, discrimination, unlawful arrest, and detention, extortion, and rape. I find that on a balance of probabilities that your subjective fear has an objective basis. Therefore I find that you have a well-founded fear of persecution due to your sexual orientation.\n\n[19] As same sex sexual activity is criminalized in Nigeria and since homophobic violence continues with impunity, I find that there is clear and convincing evidence that state protection would not be available to you. Furthermore, as same sex activity is criminalized in Nigeria, I find that there is no where in Nigeria where you would not face a serious possibility of persecution based on your membership in a particular social group as a bisexual woman. As the test for an Internal Flight Alternative fails on the first prong, I find that there is no viable Internal Flight Alternative for yourself.\n\n[20] Based on the totality of the evidence, I find you have a serious possibility of persecution in Nigeria due to your membership in a particular social group as a bisexual woman and therefore to be a Convention refugee. Your claim is therefore accepted.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

However, you indicate that you first travelled to Canada to study and work in the hopes of becoming permanent residents.\n\n[9] When the pandemic changed the world situation, you feared that your plans would be disrupted and, therefore, sought legal advice.\n\n[10] Learning that it would be appropriate to seek refugee protection in your particular circumstances, you filed your claims.\n\n[11] This explanation seems reasonable in your alleged circumstances and, therefore, does not raise significant concerns with respect to subjective fear or credibility.\n\n[12] I find you to be credible witnesses and, therefore, believe what you alleged in support of your claims. There were no relevant inconsistencies in your testimony or contradictions between your testimony and the other evidence before me.\n\n[13] You testified about your varied family backgrounds, the impact of travel and access to the internet in broadening your perspective, and your reasons for the rejection of Islam and the adoption of atheism.\n\n[14] In particular, the following evidence establishes your allegations as set out above: Letters of support from your sisters substantiating your respective upbringing and your decision to move away from Islam.\n\n[15] Principal claimant\u2019s XXXX XXXX XXXX and related photographs. Family photographs illustrating the respective religious environments within your families.\n\n[16] School photographs picturing the principal claimant wearing the mandatory hijab in contrast to private photos without. Medical records related to the principal claimant\u2019s father. And media articles substantiating that Zumba is banned and detailing related arrests.\n\n[17] After reviewing the documents, I have no reason to doubt their authenticity.\n\n[18] Given that there are no serious credibility issues with respect to your allegations, coupled with the documentary evidence set out below, I find that you have established a prospective risk of arrest, detention or other serious harm in Iran.\n\n[19] The risk is corroborated by the following documents: 12.1 indicates that the law prohibits Muslims from changing or renouncing their religious beliefs. Conversion from Islam is considered apostasy, a crime punishable by death.\n\n[20] 2.4 indicates that freedom of religion and belief was systematically violated in law and practice.\n\n[21] The authorities continued to impose on people of all faiths and the atheists codes of public conduct rooted in a strict interpretation of Shia Islam. Further noting that the right to change or renounce religious beliefs continued to be violated.\n\n[22] Those who professed atheism remained at risk of arbitrary detention, torture and the death penalty for apostasy.\n\n[23] At 2.6, renouncing the Islamic faith without adhering another faith or questioning Shia Islam is considered apostasy and can be punished as such. It is noted that in Shia Islam, apostasy committed by a Muslim-born person is punishable by death.\n\n[24] 12.14 indicates that atheists are at risk of persecution, including arrest, imprisonment and possible execution. Atheism is not recognised In Iran. Any Muslim who abandons his faith may face the death penalty for apostasy.\n\n[25] A child born to a Muslim father is considered a Muslim by the Iranian government and ex-Muslim atheists are guilty of apostasy.\n\n[26] The objective evidence clearly establishes the treatment of religious converts or those who renounce their faith by Iranian officials breaches the individual\u2019s right to choose his or her religion and it is an excessive penalty amounting to persecution for the exercise of one\u2019s beliefs.\n\n[27] I have examined your claims under Section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act as I conclude that the risk you describe constitutes persecution based on at least one of the grounds prescribed in Section 96, specifically religion and political opinion.\n\n[28] I find that there is clear and convincing evidence before me that the State is unwilling to provide you with adequate protection. The agent of persecution in this case is the State.\n\n[29] I have also examined whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for you. Based on the evidence on file, I find that you would face a serious possibility of persecution throughout Iran.\n\n[30] Again, the agent of persecution is the State and the objective evidence indicates that the State maintains strict and effective control over its entire territory.\n\n[31] In light of the proceeding, I conclude that you are refugees pursuant to Section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, and accordingly, I accept your claims.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

This is the reason for the decision of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, a citizen of Venezuela claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, IRPA. The Minister elected not to intervene in this matter on the issue of article 1E exclusion. The allegations in full are contained in the Basis of Claim forms, the BOC found in Exhibit 2.1, and the amendment at 2.2. You are a citizen of Venezuela, born in Venezuela, and a permanent resident of Ecuador, and a person whose sexual orientation and gender identity has caused you to be harmed, targeted, and discriminated against. You cannot return to Venezuela or Ecuador as you risk being harmed for said orientation. You cannot access state protection anywhere in either country. I find that you are a Convention refugee. You have a well-founded fear of persecution in Venezuela and in Ecuador by reason of membership of a particular social group, of someone with a diverse sexual orientation and gender expression. The sexual orientation and gender identity and expression sex characteristics guidelines were in use at the hearing and in the rendering of this decision.\n\n[2] On the matter of identity, you established you are a citizen of Venezuela by reason of your testimony and copies of your Venezuelan passport. These are found in Exhibit 1. On the matter of credibility, you testified to the matters of your claims spontaneously, answering all questions without hesitation. You communicated the trauma, discrimination, and pressures to conform and hide your identity in Ecuador and Venezuela, and how you feel free to live in Canada as yourself. You have described how you meet men in Toronto, the various online platforms available, and how Grindr makes you uncomfortable with the forwardness of its users and overt nudity. You have credibly established your profile as a person with a diverse sexual orientation and gender expression. You feel you can dress and wear your hair as you like, you can sing in higher registers, and are pursuing a career while taking dance lessons in Toronto. You have spoken credibly about the repression of your identity, that you experienced violent oppression at home and in school, and how from a young age, you feared retribution for your failure to conform in regards to your gender expression, and that you feel that you have lost parts of your childhood trying to meet the expectations of society.\n\n[3] You have provided numerous personal documents to corroborate your claim. Photos of you and a young man in Ecuador, letters in support of your claim from family members and friends with firsthand accounts, and records regarding your access in counseling in Canada. These corroborate your allegations, are relevant, and given full weight to support your claim. I have found you to be a credible witness, and therefore, I believe what you have alleged in supported of your claim.\n\n[4] Now, on the matter of the article 1E analysis, section E of article 1 of the Convention provides that the Convention shall not apply to a person who is recognized by the competent authorities in the country in which she has taken residence as having the rights and obligations which are attached to the possession of the nationality of that country. Thus, the first issue in this analysis is whether you have rights and obligations which are attached to the possession of nationality in Ecuador, one (1) of your countries of reference. I find that you do have these rights. Ecuador\u2019s organic law on human mobility indicates that the rights and obligations of permanent residents in Ecuador are essentially similar to those of its own nationals, including rights of free mobility, education, employment, social security, and access to justice and due process. Once it is established that you have obtained permanent residency in a second country, here, in Ecuador, a case has been made out that you were made a permanent resident in this second country, unless you can rebut the presumption and demonstrate on a balance of probabilities that you have lost the status. I find that on a balance of probabilities, you have not established that you have lost your permanent residency status in Ecuador. There may be an Ecuadorian legal provision that states that one will lose their permanent status, but you have not demonstrated on a balance of probabilities that this law is enforced or has been enforced against you. So, I find you are a permanent resident of Ecuador. The question becomes whether you are at risk of harm in Ecuador. In line with the Federal Court jurisprudence, which suggests that the risk of article 1E countries should be examined, along with the Federal Court decision in Zhang, I will assess the risk of harm that you have alleged against Ecuador before deciding whether you are excluded by article 1E. I find that you have established a well-founded fear of harm in Ecuador without the means to obtain state protection. A well-founded fear of harm has both objective and subjective elements. I find that you have established both types of fear of harm in Ecuador. You establish you lived in two (2) areas of Ecuador, you were threatened by the cult your family belonged to, bullied by teachers and students, and had your integrity violated by an older man. In each location you were outed as gay, abused online, threatened, violently assaulted, subjected to conversion therapy, and taken advantage of by those in positions of power. You were unable to receive state protection as a black gay Venezuelan man. You grew depressed and anxious that you would be irreparably harmed in Ecuador. You soon fled to Canada. You credibly expressed your fear that if you went back, you would be returned to conversion therapy, and that you fear for your life. You have established a well-founded fear of harm in Ecuador.\n\n[5] As read in Item 6.1 and 6.2 of the National Documentation Package for Ecuador, Ecuador stands out amongst the Latin American countries as a strong proponent of policies in favour of lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, and intersex rights, LGBTI rights. The constitution establishes a wide range of legal protections for those with divergent sexual orientation. Issues surrounding gender identity are prominently debated in national politics. Rights extend beyond the constitution, including important hate crime legislation and state participation in key international and regional human rights agreements. Again, at Item 6.2, while in Ecuador, domestic law establishes the rights of equality and non-discrimination, their effective enforcement has not materialized in practice. There is a deeply rooted structural homophobia in Ecuador, permeating all levels of society, as you have experienced. In Ecuador, cases of mistreatment of LGBTI populations remain a constant. In the study of living conditions and social inclusion of LGBTI population in Ecuador, the statistical results indicate that 70.9% of the population of LGBTI people claim to have experienced discrimination because of their sexual orientation or gender identity, primarily in familial settings. Of the population surveyed. 27.3% reported having experienced violence by law enforcement officials, of which 94% said they were the victims of shouting insults, threats, and ridicule. 45.8% had been arrested arbitrarily by the state authorities. Reporting these abuses to public officials and police officers puts LGBTI people in the delicate situation of making their sexual orientation or gender identity completely visible, which is not what they want. Rather, exposure is something that they want to avoid due to the hatred of those with divergent sexual orientations and gender identities. This makes the abuses and violations of the rights of the LGBTI population go mostly unpunished.\n\n[6] In Item 6.3 of the NDP, the extent of hate crimes committed against LGBTI persons, as well as the daily abuse and rejection of this population, is extreme in Ecuador. This includes the shocking reality about Ecuadorian torture centres for LGBTI, where the goal is to cure those with divergent sexual orientation and gender identities. The existence of these torture centers in Ecuador demonstrates the degree of homophobia in Ecuadorian society. There are as many as 200 to 300 of these conversion centers in Ecuador. They often operate clandestinely within drug and alcohol rehabilitation centers. Those who have escaped from these centers report physical, sexual, and psychological abuse, including rape, other forms of assault, including electric shock treatment, and being exposed to frequent prayers about spiritual correction. This highlights that Ecuadorian society as a whole treads on the rights of adults to be simply who they are as sexual divergent persons with gender identities that are varying. I find that your experiences of harm in Ecuador as a young gay man, along with the objective conditions, demonstrates that you have a well-founded fear of harm in Ecuador.\n\n[7] On the matter of state protection and internal flight alternative, while Ecuador\u2019s constitutions, laws, and regulations are stellar in terms of protections for sexually and gender-diverse individuals, in practice, state enforcement authorities who arrest LGBTI persons fail to protect them. As well, the people of Ecuador tend to be homophobic. This demonstrates that in fact, there is inadequate state protection in Ecuador. The SOGIESC guidelines specifically addresses these issues. The guideline says that the criminalization of same sex relations or the introduction of a new law, programs, or other government actions designed to improve the situation of individuals with diverse SOGIESC, that is the acronym for the guideline, in a country, need to be carefully assessed to determine whether state protection is adequate at the operational level. In these cases, decision makers need to examine the degree of actual implementation, the effectiveness, and the durability of these legislative or other improvements in light of how state actors and general society continue to treat individuals with diverse SOGIESC. After considering the objective documentary evidence, I find on a balance of probabilities that adequate state protection would not be available to you in Ecuador. Although Ecuador has a legal framework providing LGBTI individuals, in practice, protection, there is a lack of meaningful implementation, and discrimination persists, which hinders individuals from exercising their rights. The objective documentary evidence refers to legal advancements, but again, a lack of enforcement and gaps between legal protections and the lived realities of LGBTI individuals. It refers to individuals experiencing discrimination and violence by law enforcement officials. The issues raised in the guidelines describe Ecuador. Ecuador has many laws providing protections to the SOGIESC communities. Nonetheless, as shown as in the documents, particularly the conditions documents provided by your representatives in evidence, it is extremely dangerous to be found out to be a SOGIESC person in Ecuador. The evidence that that discrimination, physical violence, harassment, and police brutality are evident against the SOGIESC community in all parts of Ecuador. So, as such, I find that you have rebutted the presumption of the state protection in Ecuador.\n\n[8] There is nowhere that you could live in Ecuador with adequate state protection as a gay man. You have lived in a small town and a large city. The experience of homophobia and lack of state protection existed in both locations and does throughout the country. I thus find that considering the above, there is no internal flight alternative available to you. So, I find you are not excluded from the protection pursuant to article 1E of the United Nations Convention regarding the status of refugees.\n\n[9] Going to turn now to Venezuela. I find that you have demonstrated you have a well-founded fear of harm as a gay man in Venezuela. There are no legal protections for SOGIESC persons in Venezuela. They are not protected by anti-discrimination laws. They cannot marry or adopt children. You were not out as a gay man in Venezuela on account of your tender age when you left. However, the analysis is forward-looking. You were asked what you fear. You communicated that you fear risk of harm or death, as you cannot change the things that are intrinsic to you, and it is unfair that you would be targeted for harm and discriminated against on the basis of your innate characteristics. I find on a balance of probabilities, in light of your experiences in Ecuador and your status as a SOGIESC person, you have a subjective fear of harm.\n\n[10] According to the NDP for Venezuela Tab 6.1, 3.1, and 3.2, the objective evidence indicates that Venezuelan society is vehemently homophobic. Violent incidents regularly occur against members of the SOGIESC community throughout the country. Venezuelan homophobia extends to all parts of society, including in employment, education, housing, and social settings. It is essentially everywhere. The evidence also indicates that 75% to 80% of SOGIESC persons experienced discrimination due to social, cultural, and religious practices in their homes. SOGIESC persons must hide their relationships and their identities as people, or they will face discrimination, harassment, ridicule, and violence. For these reasons, I find you have a well-founded fear of harm in Venezuela with clear and convincing evidence. I also find that the state is unable or unwilling to protect you. Most SOGIESC persons in Venezuela do not report discrimination or acts of violence to the police, as there is a general lack of confidence in the rule of law Venezuela. More particularly, the police do not protect SOGIESC persons in Venezuela. The police, in fact, have been known to attack and detain SOGIESC persons at times. This is found in NDP Item 6.2. There is no place in Venezuela where SOGIESC persons are not physically attacked and ostracized for being SOGIESC persons. They cannot live openly and work or obtain housing. I therefore find that there is no internal flight alternative available for you.\n\n[11] So, in conclusion, based on the foregoing analysis, I conclude that you are a Convention refugee, and therefore, I accept your claim.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

Mary Akhbari\nCountry: Iraq\nRPD Number: TC1-09409\nAssociated RPD Number(s): TC1-09462, TC1-09463\nATIP Number: A-2023-01023\nATIP Pages: N\/A\nDECISION\n\n[1] MEMBER: This is the decision of the Refugee Protection Division in the claims of; XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX, citizens of Iraq. The Board designated XXXX as a representee for the children included this claim. You are claiming refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n\nDetermination\n\n[2] In coming to my decision, I\u2019ve considered and applied the Chairperson\u2019s Gender Guidelines. I find that you are Convention refugees for the reasons which follow.\n\nAllegations\n\n[3] To briefly summarize your allegations, you allege you were in an abusive marriage since 2014 and experienced persistent domestic violence which continued when you came to Canada with your ex. You decided to claim refugee protection to avoid persecution.\nIdentity\n[4] I find that you\u2019ve established your identities as citizens of Iraq through your testimony, your passports, birth certificates and national ID which can be found in Exhibits 1 and 7.\nNexus\n[5] I find that there\u2019s a link between what you fear and the Convention grounds of particular social group of women experiencing domestic abuse and particular social group of family. Your claims are, therefore, assessed under section 96.\nCredibility\n[6] I found you to be a credible witness and I, therefore, believe what you\u2019ve alleged in support of your claim. I\u2019ve accepted the very detailed narrative you provided and extensive corroborating documents. In taking a trauma informed approach to your hearing, it was not necessary to question you about the aspects of your claim where I could make findings based on the extensive and detailed documentary evidence from credible sources.\n[7] I find that you\u2019re a survivor of domestic abuse. You testified about your marriage and said that your parents had agreed to the marriage and while you were asked for your opinion, you just agreed as your parents approved of it. You describe your current marital status as single and state your divorce has not been finalized. When asked about supports during the years of abuse you describe, you said that you opened up to your mother, but society in Iraq does not value women\u2019s decisions and choices, so you effectively had no choice.\n[8] Your testimony that laws in Iraq are made by men and for men is very compelling. You state your mother held those views and you were encouraged to stay in the marriage for the sake of the children. You testified that divorced women face many difficulties in Iraq and that children are taken away from the mother by the male family members. You testified that it is useless to go the police or the authorities as this is considered a family dispute and you reiterated that the laws are made by men and for men. You said you could not even seek medical treatment for serious injuries sustained such as with a salad knife because your ex was guarding every movement.\n[9] Your national ID and children\u2019s birth certificates corroborate your marriage to your ex and which can be found in Exhibit 7. You testified that your daughters nor you would be safe returning to Iraq as your ex asserts that you betrayed him and you would face honour killing by his family. You said that you and your daughters would be looked down upon in society and no aid from the authorities would be forthcoming as this is considered a family dispute. I, therefore, find that your subjective fear is established by a credible testimony and supporting documents.\nObjective Basis\n[10] I find that the country evidence supports your subjective fears as being objectively well-founded on a balance of probabilities. According to the Bertelsmann Stiftung Report in 1.12, despite the changes in the country\u2019s top political offices, corruption and the lack of institutional capacity remain endemic undermining governmental performance in protecting socio-economic and political outcomes and civil liberties and the rights of citizens. A Danish immigration source in 5.5 reports an increase in the prevalence of domestic violence and honour conflicts in the Kurdistan region of Iraq. Honour crimes underreported due to the fear of stigma and violence from society and the family. There are very few known cases where the victim of an honour conflict has escaped. Divorced women face stigmatization and difficulties in Kurdish societies. A divorced woman cannot live outside the cities.\n[11] The UK Home Office Report in 5.8 mentions that as in most patriarchal societies gender roles have been clearly defined with women having a lower status in the family. Women are expected to be prudent, show respect and obedience to men to the level of subservience. Stepping out of long-held norms and honour codes are perceived as shameful, devaluing women and their families. This made lead to honour-based killings. Honour crimes take place in all areas of Iraq and cut across ethnic and religious lines.\nState Protection\n[12] I\u2019ve considered whether there\u2019s state protection would be available to you if you return to your country and have concluded that it is not, for the following reasons. The US Department of State Report in 2.1 reports lack of investigation and accountability for gender-based violence. Domestic violence is not specifically prohibited under the law and thus, remains a pervasive problem. However, the Kurdistan Regional Government or KRG criminalized domestic violence and maintained a special police force to investigate cases of gender-based violence. NGO\u2019s reported these steps were not effective at combating gender-based violence.\n[13] A Danish source in 5.5 reports that women who seek protection from the police meet mixed reactions. In some cases she is returned to the family or informed that this is a private family issue. According to a UK Home Office Report in 5.8, there\u2019s an inability of the law and the justice system to deter crimes against women and the continuing salience of honour as a justification for violence. This source states that police make limited efforts to prevent or respond to societal violence, they were unwilling to meaningfully investigate killings of women and girls in the name of honour. There\u2019s clear and convincing evidence before me that this state is unable or unwilling to protect you.\nInternal Flight Alternative or IFA\n[14] I\u2019ve also considered whether a viable IFA exists for you given the widespread and prevalent attitudes towards domestic violence along with the lack of adequate state protection. It is clear that there\u2019s no viable IFA based on your profile and particular circumstances as a divorced women. Freedom of movement for women is generally not respected by law or custom, women cannot obtain civil status documentation without the consent of a male relative. This is in 1.14.\n[15] According to the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade Reporting in 1.19, violence and a lack of security and stability largely constrain Iraqi women to traditional family roles. Limiting their access to employment and education, under the law the father is the guardian of the children in divorce cases with some discretion for custody until the child reaches age 10. Gender-based violence is common in Iraq and domestic violence remains a pervasive problem throughout Iraqi society, exacerbated by a lack of applicable legislation.\n[16] There are few or no publicly provided women\u2019s shelters, information services or support hotlines and little or no sensitivity training for police. A European Union Agency for Asylum Report in Exhibit 16, writes that living alone as a woman is not generally accepted in Iraq because it is considered inappropriate behaviour. Thus, women living alone will encounter negative attitudes from society and are at a higher risk of violence. Another source mentions that the stigma of divorce was so strong that wives families forced them to stay with violent husbands.\nCONCLUSION\n[17] Based on the totality of the evidence, I find you to be Convention refugees and I accept your claims.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

I have considered your testimony and the other evidence in the case, and I am ready to render my decision orally. These are the reasons for the decision in the claim of XXXX XXXX, who claims to be a citizen of Iran and is claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n\n[2] Your allegations are fully set out in the Basis of Claim. In summary, you fear persecution at the hands of the state due to your conversion to Christianity. For the following reasons, I find that you are a refugee pursuant to section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n\n[3] I find that your identity a national of Iran is established by submission of your passport. I find you to be a credible witness and therefore, believe what you have alleged in support of your claim. There are no relevant consistencies in your testimony or contradictions between your testimony and the other evidence before me. You testified in a genuine manner about your belief in Christianity, demonstrating knowledge of the faith. You also spoke of the feeling of peace you have attained through your faith. In particular, the following evidence establishes your allegations as set out above, a letter from the XXXX of the XXXX XXXX XXXX, substantiating that you are a member of the congregation and your regular attendance and also confirming your baptism, photographs of your baptism, photographs of your attendance at church events, photographs of your attendance at churches while visiting Sweden and Russia in 2012 and 2017, social media posts and videos substantiating your membership in a Christian fellowship group, text messages and a letter from your sister substantiating that you were sought by police after you fled, and documents substantiating issues related to hijab violations. After reviewing the documents, I have no reason to doubt their authenticity.\n\n[4] Given that there are no serious credibility issues with respect to your allegations, coupled with the documentary evidence set out below, I find that you have established a prospective risk of arrest, detention, or other serious harm in Iran. The risk is corroborated by the following documents.\n\n[5] The objective evidence indicates that conversion from Islam into another religion in Iran constitutes apostacy, which carries a death sentence. At Tab 1.9 the reports indicate targeting and harsh treatment of religious minorities, including Christian converts from Islam. At 12.1 the evidence indicates that these groups continue to face arbitrary arrest, harassment, and detention, and are often accused of national security crimes such as acting against the national security or propaganda against the state. Under Iranian law, individuals including Christians of Muslim backgrounds can be prosecuted for the crime of apostasy. The law prohibits Muslim citizens from changing or renouncing their religious beliefs. As recently as 2018, the government executed individuals for enmity against God. Christians who were arrested were subjected to severe physical and psychological mistreatment by authorities, which at times included beatings and solitary confinement. The objective evidence clearly establishes that the treatment of religious converts by Iranian officials breaches the individual\u2019s right to choose his or her religion and is an excessive penalty amounting to persecution for the exercise upon religious beliefs.\n\n[6] I have examined your claim under section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, as I conclude that the risk you describe constitutes persecution based on at least one (1) of the grounds prescribed in section 96, specifically religion.\n\n[7] I find that there is clear and convincing evidence that the state is unwilling to provide you with adequate protection. The agent of persecution in this case is the state.\n\n[8] I have examined whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for you. Based on the evidence on file, I find that you face a serious possibility of persecution throughout Iran. Again, the agent of persecution is the state, and the objective evidence indicates that conditions are similar throughout the country.\n\n[9] In light of the proceeding, I conclude that you are a refugee pursuant to section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. And accordingly, I accept your claim.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

You testified in a natural and straightforward manner and there were no relevant inconsistencies in your testimony or contradictions between your testimony and the other evidence before me.\n[8] You described firstly your introduction to Christianity attending a close friend\u2019s wedding and how you observed differences in how men and women were viewed and treated in contrast to the Muslim weddings that you had attended. You explained that you felt like women were more viewed as property during the Islam weddings and at the Christian wedding you attended, the women and men were viewed more equally. After this, you became interested in Christianity and when you went through a particularly difficult period after losing your job, your friend invited you to her churches which you began attending although as you explained, irregularly, and this was around 2005. Over time as Iranian authorities made it increasingly difficult for you to attend in churches, a friend from the XXXX XXXX that you had been attending began hosting a house church which you attended as well.\n[9] In XXXX of 2020 at a house church meeting, police officers raided this and arrested you. You explained how you were held for three days at XXXX XXXX and released after signing an undertaking. After this, you additionally allege that you have received summons for the Revolutionary Court and you left Iran on your Canadian visa, visitor visa, and shortly after arriving in Canada initiated your claim.\n[10] Further, you gave detailed testimony regarding your baptism, the baptism classes, and the ceremony itself since you\u2019ve been in Canada alongside testimony of recent church services that you\u2019ve attended at your church, as well as the themes and meanings of these topics in your own life, and also told of a meaningful biblical story and what it has meant for you as well.\n[11] To corroborate the allegations, you have provided documentary evidence in Exhibit 5 and 7. After reviewing your personal discourse, I have no reasons to doubt the authenticity of the documents, and I do give significant weight to the following documents in particular in establishing your allegations.\n[12] First is the letter of support from the church that you currently attend in Vancouver. This details the timeline of your attendance as well as your attendance at baptism classes and online services, a copy of your baptism certificate and photographs of yourself at your baptism during the ceremony, photographs of yourself visiting churches in Italy while on vacation as well, detailed letters of support from your husband and your sister. The letter from your husband states that he observed a positive impact of your learning and practice of Christianity in your life and also details your arrest and imprisonment in XXXX 2020 and attests to the summons that you received in 2020 and 2021. The letter from your sister also corroborates the problems that you\u2019ve had throughout life with the Islamic rules and restrictions and your sister\u2019s knowledge of your practicing Christian faith and attending house church meetings in Iran. And finally, you\u2019ve also given a copy of the summons which was issued at the end of XXXX 2020 and this indicates the investigation for crimes for denying Islam.\n[13] I therefore find that you are a genuine convert to Christianity from Islam and that you have regularly practiced your faith in both Iran and in Canada and that authorities did arrest you and have issued a summons to you in relation to this in Iran. I find that you have established your subjective fear.\nOBJECTIVE BASIS\n[14] Given that there are no serious credibility issues with respect to the allegations coupled with the documentary evidence, I do find that you have established a forward facing and well-founded fear of persecution in Iran. This risk is corroborated by the National Documentation Package, the NDP for Iran in Exhibit 3 and country documents provided as well in Exhibit 6.\n[15] Overall, the NDP and in particular item 2.1 indicates that Iran has an ongoing extremely poor human rights record. 2.1 states that Iran is an authoritarian theocratic republic with a Shia Islamic political system. Item 12.1 further shows that the Iranian state places egregious restrictions on the freedom of religion. It states that the penal code prohibits Muslim citizens from changing or renouncing their religious beliefs. Converts to Christianity from Islam are excluded from permission to worship and to form religious societies within the limits of the law. It also notes that religious crimes are also prosecuted as crimes against national security and against the state and punishment for religious crimes can include death sentences.\n[16] Item 12.2 further indicates that Iran has increased persecution of Christian converts in particular and has drastically escalated its arrest of Christians while religious freedom continues to deteriorate across the country. Religious reformers and dissenters also face prolonged detention and human rights abuses while in detention as well as, as stated, possible execution.\n\n[17] Country documents as well in Exhibit 6 further illustrate the ongoing surveillance practices of the state on known Christian converts and members of house churches. There is also evidence in item 12.15 that the Iranian state monitors its diaspora abroad including Christian converts and that state authorities regularly harass and also may target and use family members in Iran in order to pressure converts to return to face prosecution.\n\n[18] I therefore find your subjective fear has an objective basis.\n\nNATURE OF THE HARM\n\n[19] I have examined your claim under Section 96 of IRPA as I conclude the risk you describe constitutes persecution based on one of the grounds in the refugee convention, specifically your religion. I find that as a convert to Christianity from Islam, you are at risk of harassment, arrest, detention, physical harm, and an inability to practice your faith in Iran.\n\nSTATE PROTECTION\n\n[20] I find it would be objectively unreasonable for you to seek the protection of the state in light of your circumstances as the agents of persecution is the state itself.\n\nINTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE\n\n[21] I have also examined whether a viable Internal Flight Alternative exists for you. Based on the evidence on file, I find that you face a serious possibility of persecution throughout Iran. Iranian authorities maintain control of all parts of the country and there is no part of Iran where you would be free to practice your faith or that the laws would allow you to do so. I therefore find there is no Internal Flight Alternative available to you.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[22] In light of the preceding, I conclude that you are a refugee pursuant to Section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act and accordingly I accept your claim today.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

You are claiming to be citizens of Sri Lanka and are claiming refugee protection pursuant to Sections 96 and 97.1 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. In coming to my decision I have considered and applied the Chairperson\u2019s Gender Guidelines.\nDETERMINATION\n[2] I find that you are Convention refugees on the grounds of race and the particular social groups of women and family for the following reasons.\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] You allege the following. Your husband was Tamil and you faced harassment and threats because you are Sinhalese and the interracial marriage was not accepted. You feared for your safety and came to Canada where you claimed protection. You allege if you return you face persecution. You allege that there is no state protection for you or an Internal Flight Alternative.\nIDENTITY\n[4] I find that your personal identities as citizens of Sri Lanka have been established on a balance of probabilities by your testimony and your passports contained in Exhibit 1.\nNEXUS\n[5] I find that there is a link between what you fear and the Convention grounds of race and particular social groups of gender and family, and your claims are therefore assessed under Section 96.\nCREDIBILITY\n[6] In terms of your general credibility, I found you to be credible witnesses and I therefore believe what you have alleged in your oral testimony and in your Basis of Claim forms. XXXX, your testimony was spontaneous, detailed, forthright, and materially consistent with your narrative. You elaborated with additional details requested without apparent hesitation. It was quite evident that the issues I asked you to recall were emotionally painful.\n[7] XXXX and XXXX, your testimony was also spontaneous and forthright. I find that your husband and father was Tamil based on your testimony and your marriage certificate which indicates he is an Indian Tamil. I find that you are Sinhalese as indicated on your birth certificate which states that both your parents are Sinhalese. This is in Exhibit 8.\n[8] I find that your husband passed away on XXXX XXXX, 2019, as confirmed by the death certificate you submitted. I accept that your husband was assaulted on multiple occasions. You testified that he left Sri Lanka in XXXX 2011 to work in South Korea to escape persecution. You testified about being cautious when you visited Sri Lanka due to the intolerance from society because of your interracial marriage. You said you were not accepted in either Tamil or Sinhalese dominant areas.\n[9] I find that you and your family were assaulted in XXXX 2018 because of marriage to a Tamil man. I find that you were raped on XXXX XXXX, 2018, by a police officer likely related to your marriage to a Tamil man. You testified that the officer in charge came to your home that day because your husband had filed a police complaint about the XXXX 2018 assault. XXXX testified about an assault in XXXX 2018 and explained that the reason was because his father is Tamil. I therefore find that your subjective fear is established by your credible testimony and supporting documents.\nOBJECTIVE BASIS\n[10] Your fear of being deported to Sri Lanka in the present circumstances is a fear that is well-founded in the objective documents. The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade report, DFAT, in 1.9 notes that violence against women is prevalent in Sri w and occurs throughout the country.\n[11] Anecdotal evidence suggested victims of sexual violence are reluctant to report the matter to the police due to social stigma and out of fear they would be ostracized by their families and have difficulty marrying if the matter became widely known. Also under reporting is based on inadequate legislation, limited access to justice, fear of reprisals, and low conviction rates. Female headed households are vulnerable to poverty, gender-based violence, and sexual exploitation, and faced obstacles to accessing services and employment opportunities. The social stigma of widowhood also reportedly impedes access to government and non-government services.\n[12] The US Department of State report in 2.1 says that significant human rights abuses included lack of investigation of violence against women. Police harass civilians with impunity. The government took some steps to prosecute the perpetrators. Police and judiciary responses to rape incidents and cases were inadequate and associated services were scarce nationwide. Amnesty International writes about continued impunity plus sexual and gender-based violence despite repeated assurances by consecutive governments to tackle the issue. This is in 2.2.\n[13] A Response to Information Request says that under the Gotabaya presidency, a conservative attack on the rule of law and independence of the police and judiciary has been seen. Civilian government functions have been militarized at an accelerating pace and some appointees have been accused of committing serious human rights violations. This is in 4.22.\n[14] A Response to Information Request in 13.1 states that just being Tamil does not attract persecution, although other sources state Tamils face discrimination along with other minorities. Other sources describe Tamils as second-class citizens and the most underprivileged ethnic group in Sri Lanka. A Freedom House report indicates that Tamils face systemic discrimination including in government, employment, university, education, and access to justice. Mistreatment by police and security is also reported.\n[15] Counsel also submitted country condition evidence which demonstrates Tamil Sinhalese marriages are contentious based on the long-standing hostility faced by Tamils. Another articles writes that women are still treated as second class citizens as there is a high rate of gender-based violence even though motherhood has a revered place in the family, the statistics demonstrate that for Sri Lankan women, home is not a safe place. Many do not see violence against women as a problem. This is in Exhibit 8.\nSTATE PROTECTION\n[16] There is a presumption of state protection in the absence of complete breakdown. The presumption may be rebutted with clear and convincing evidence. Based on your personal circumstances as well as the objective country documentation, I find that you rebutted the presumption of state protection and adequate state protection is not available to you.\n[17] Objective evidence demonstrates inadequate protection of women and continued impunity for gender-based violence. There remains evidence of mistreatment including human rights abuses against Tamils. Moreover, your husband sought protection from the police and adequate protection was not forthcoming to him. I am mindful of the risk you faced trying to seek police protection because of the evidence demonstrating police impunity for gender-based violence, and your personal experience with sexual assault perpetrated by a senior police officer.\nINTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE OR IFA\n[18] I\u2019ve also considered whether a viable IFA exists for you. There is a two-part test to determine if there is an IFA. It must be safe and it must be reasonable. It is safe if there is no serious possibility of persecution or risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual punishment or torture in the IFA. It is reasonable if conditions in the IFA are not unduly harsh and do not jeopardize your life or safety.\n[19] There is a very high threshold that must be met to show whether an IFA is unreasonable. I proposed Colombo as a potential IFA location. I find that the IFA tests fails on the second prong. Accordingly it\u2019s not necessary to consider the first prong as the test is conjunctive. A Response to Information Request notes that it is very rare for single women to live alone in Sri Lanka. Both Tamil and non-Tamil women living alone in Colombo are perceived as being promiscuous or of low moral value.\n[20] Further, there are gender norms and cultural beliefs that stigmatize women from living alone in Sri Lanka including Colombo. In addition, sexual harassment of women in Sri Lanka is widespread and a single woman living alone would be vulnerable. Without a network of family and friends, widows and single women are seen as targets. Housing is often procured through informal or (inaudible-8:03) networks and landlords do not like to rent to single men or women regardless of ethnicity. Therefore I find that it would be objectively unreasonable for you to relocate to Colombo.\n[21] XXXX, you testified you would not be safe as a woman alone which is further amplified as you are now a widow. You fear the same issues you faced when you lived in Sri Lanka without your husband based on a patriarchal cultural.\n[22] XXXX, you testified that you would not be safe without your father\u2019s protection and because of the lack of acceptance based on your mixed ethnicity. You said you would be unable to protection your mother and sister.\n[23] XXXX, you similarly testified that you fear returning to Sri Lanka based on your gender and the experience of similarly situated persons including your mother. I find that there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout Sri Lanka and therefore no Internal Flight Alternative is available to you.\nCONCLUSION\n[24] Based on the totality of the evidence, I find you to be Convention refugees and I accept your claims.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

the letter from the provincial coach here at the HDP, at Exhibit 4,which confirms that you were a member and participated in HDP campaigning efforts; The letter from your mother at Exhibit 4, which speaks about your injuries at the hands of the police; your detentions and the arrest of other family members for their political activities; the letter from your brother, at Exhibit 4, which confirms your stay in XXXX (ph), your involvement with the HDP, and the fear of your family had for you as the police were monitoring your home; the letter from YSB (ph) at Exhibit 4, which confirms the circumstances of your first arrest in XXXX 2019, and your involvement with the party; the RPD decision of your uncle, at Exhibit 4, which confirms your family has been persecuted in the past for their political activities; The Turkish court decision of your grandfather, at Exhibit 4, which again confirms your family\u2019s long history of being involved at the HDP, and the police response to that involvement.\n[25] I have no reason to doubt the veracity of these documents and, therefore, assign them full weight.\n[26] I, therefore, find that your subjective fear is well established, and you have established the following allegations:\n[27] That you were a member of the HDP, that on two (2) occasions you were detained by police for your involvement with the party.\n[28] That you supported the party through distributing brochures, campaigning, attending events, and celebrations, as well as speaking and rallying members of your community to vote for the party.\n[29] That other members of your family, including your uncle and grandfather have been targeted by the police for their political involvement.\n[30] That the police know of your family\u2019s support of the HDP and have target you in part because of that.\n[31] That the police have escalated their violence, and threats against you for your HDP work.\n[32] That the police appeared to be monitoring your family home after your second arrest.\nObjective Basis\n[33] I\u2019ve assessed your testimony and the National Documentation Package, which indicates that since 2015, the Turkish authorities have increased their operations targeting HDP members and supporters. Specifically, as in Item 13.1, that they accuse the HDP of being a proxy for the PKK.\n[34] That there\u2019s evidence at Items 4.5, of the NDP, which indicates substantial allegations of mistreatment of HDP members by security forces during detention, including the use of torture and threats.\n[35] As per item 2.1, it is well documented that the Turkish government engages in a campaign of suppression against its political opponents, and in addition to persecution by Turkish authorities, HDP members and supporters have suffered from mob violence at the hand of Turkish nationalists. And that the State does not pursue individuals for attacking HDP members and supporters.\n[36] I mention specifically that your identity as a Kurdish person puts you at risk, as it is well documented that authorities in Turkey detain and prosecute even peaceful Kurdish activities, as though those activities are linked to the PKK, and this is indicated at Item 4.5, of the NDP.\n[37] Therefore, the objective basis for your claim is established, and you credibly established your well-founded fear of persecution.\nState Protection\n[38] As the agent of persecution is the Government of Turkey, and its police forces, I find that state protection is not available to you. It would be unreasonable for you to seek protection from those who actively participate in your persecution.\n[39] The presumption of state protection is therefore rebutted.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[40] I find as the agent of persecution is the Government of Turkey, that there is no safe place for you to return to in Turkey, as the State, and police forces have the means, motive, and ability to find you wherever you would go.\n[41] The test for internal flight alternative therefore fails on the first prong, and the Panel finds that there is no possibility of an internal flight alternative.\nCONCLUSION\n[42] Based on the totality of evidence, including your testimony, I find that you are a Convention refugee, pursuant to section 96 on the grounds of your political opinion.\n[43] And your claim is therefore, accepted.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

        "unofficial_text":"2022 RLLR 83\n\nCitation: 2022 RLLR 83\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: January 20, 2022\nPanel: Devin Macdonald\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Tony Manglaviti\nCountry: India\nRPD Number: TC1-12746\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2023-01023\nATIP Pages: N\/A\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: XXXX XXXX, the claimant, alleges to be a citizen of India and claims protection pursuant to s. 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[2] The details of the claimant\u2019s allegations are set out in his Basis of Claim narrative, found at Exhibit 2, as well as the updated narrative, which is found at Exhibit 6. In short, the claimant alleges that he fears persecution by authorities in India because of his political participation in the Shiromani Akali Dal party, his opposition to a member of the legislative assembly, and because of his support for an independent Khalistan. He alleged that authorities perceive him to be supportive of Khalistani militants. The claimant alleges that he was politically active in India and always supported an independent Khalistan. He alleges that he previously supported the Congress Party starting in 2007 because he felt the Shiromani Akali Dal, the Dal Party, did not keep their promises when they were elected, and the claimants alleges he had conflicts within the Congress Party with a member of a legislative assembly for his constituency for similar regions, which is the MLA was not keeping campaign promises. The claimant indicated that he was briefly detained by police on three occasions and intimidated. However, those detention did not result in a subjective fear, which made India.\n[3] The claimant alleges that he visited Canada in XXXX 2008 to attend a family birthday party and then extended his visit with the intention of obtaining a work permit on his brother-in-law\u2019s advice. The claimant alleges that while in Canada, he attended a gurdwara, where he discussed issues with other attendees, including the Sikh Referendum 2020 and the Shiromani Akali Dal (Mann) party. The claimant alleges that he had subsequent conversations with his brother, which resulted in his brother shifting support from Congress to Shiromani Akali Dal (Mann) party. The claimant alleges that authorities detained his brother and accused the claimant of supporting Khalistani militarism from Canada. The claimant alleges that his wife suffered abuse from Indian authorities, the details of which will not be repeated here, and that she is now required to report to the police once a month. He alleges that he has lost contact with his brother since XXXX 2021, when his brother was attempting to relocate within India with the aid of a smuggler.\n[4] The Panel finds the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to s. 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. The claimant has established his personal and national identity on a balance of probabilities. The Minister provided a copy of the claimant\u2019s passport issued by the Republic of India and seized by Canadian immigration authorities. The claimant\u2019s testimony regarding his personal details was consistent with the details in the identity documents provided.\n[5] The claimant\u2019s fears stem from his political participation and his support for a political goal. As such, the Panel finds the claimant\u2019s alleged fear has a nexus to the Convention ground, political opinion.\n[6] The Panel finds that, on a balance of probabilities, the claimant is a credible witness. The Panel notes throughout the hearing, there were questions that had to be repeated to the claimant multiple times before he answered them directly, and the Panel finds that the claimant not directly answering questions until they were repeated multiple times was more a result of confusion than it was an attempt to mislead the Panel. The claimant\u2019s testimony was materially consistent with this Basis of Claim form. There were some inconsistencies, which the claimant did correct at his first opportunity when he was testifying. Again, the Panel does accept the claimant\u2019s explanation with these inconsistencies as that he misspoke or made a mistake, rather than that he was intending to mislead the Panel.\n[7] The claimant did describe his political involvement and his support for the Congress Party in a fluid and consistent manner. He provided details about why he supported the Panel (sic) at first and why he became unsatisfied with the party. He also described his political involvement with the Shiromani Akali Dal (Mann) party and his support for an independent Khalistan in a rational and fluid manner. He had knowledge of the Mann Party, including its origins and its policy positions. The Panel finds that the claimant\u2019s testimony in this regard weighs in favour of finding him to be a credible witness and a genuine supporter of an independent Khalistan.\n[8] The claim provided corroborating documents in the form of affidavits from family members, his mother and his sister. He provided also affidavits from a friend and village XXXX. The claimant\u2019s testimony was consistent with those documents and those documents were consistent with the allegations, and the Panel has no valid reason to doubt their authenticity. Now, the Panel notes that the locations that the affidavits were reportedly notarized in is consistent with the allegations. Specifically, the affidavit from his sister is notarized in XXXX, and the claimant had alleged that his sister traveled from Canada to XXXX in XXXX district in order to provide support to the claimant\u2019s wife. As such, the Panel gives the documents weight and establishing the claimant\u2019s allegations.\n[9] Based on the totality of the documents in the claimant\u2019s testimony, the Panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant is an advocate it for an independent Khalistan, and as a result, he is a person of interest to authorities in India. As such, he has established a subjective fear of return to India.\n[10] The country documentation on India is in line with the claimant\u2019s allegations and establishes an objective basis for the claimant\u2019s subjective here. Item 12.8, found in Exhibit 3, which is the National Documentation Package for India, states that simple support of Khalistan is not illegal in India, but in practice, suspected Khalistan supporters are harassed by police and intelligence agencies, and in many cases, falsely implicated in criminal cases, which can take years to resolve. The same document provides examples of individual similarly situated to the claimant. For instance, three Sikh youths were sentenced to life imprisonment for possessing pro-Khalistan literature. Item 4.10 of Exhibit 3 indicates that while Shiromani Akali Dal (Mann), referred to Amritsar in that document, is considered to be a regional party in Punjab. It\u2019s also active outside of Punjab, and individuals who advocate for Khalistan are monitored and they\u2019re often included on police lists for heightened security and often charged in terrorism-related cases, which can result in being detained for years before being released due to a lack of evidence. Active members of that party have been taken into custody or preventative detention prior to major events or rallies and held through various lengths of time ranging from one to seven days. Another Response to Information Request reports that Shiromani Akali Dal (Mann) members have been charged with dozens of sedation (sic) cases for publicly calling for a Sikh independent state. Additionally in line with the claimant\u2019s allegations, the United Kingdom Home Office Report states that Sikh supporters of Khalistan are viewed as enemies by Hindu nationalists, who are supported (sic) to subject Sikhs to harassment and pressure them to reject religious practices and beliefs. So, the evidence cited above provides an objective basis for the claimant\u2019s fear of return in India as a Sikh man with a track record of support for Khalistan and a Shiromani Akali Dal (Mann), and as well as someone with accusations of participation and Khalistani militancy from Indian authorities. As such, the Panel finds that the claim is well-founded.\n[11] In any claim for protection, the responsibility to provide international protection only becomes engaged when national state protection is unavailable. So, absent a situation demonstrating a complete breakdown of the government apparatus, the state is presumed capable for protecting its citizens. In the present case, the Panel finds that adequate state protection is unavailable to the claimant in India from persecution from Indian authorities, including members of the police force in India. The Panel finds that it is unreasonable to expect the claimant to approach the state for protection. The state would be unwilling or unable to provide adequate protection to the claimant because it is the state itself that the claimant fears. As such, the Panel finds that the claimant has rebutted the presumption of state protection in his circumstances.\n[12] A claimant must establish that they face persecution or harm throughout their country of nationality. In the present case, the Panel finds that an internal flight alternative does not exist for the claimant in India. The Panel\u2019s conclusion is based on the credible evidence of the claimant establishing that he is a supporter of Khalistan and the country documentation in the National Documentation Package at Item 12.8, which states that supporters and perceived supporters us of Khalistan may be subject to persecution by Indian authorities throughout India. So, based on the foregoing analysis, the Panel has determined that the claimant has established that he faces a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground if he returns to India.\n[13] The Panel therefore concludes that claimant is a Convention refugee under s. 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. The claim is accepted. That concludes the reasons.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

In brief summary, you allege persecution in Barbados for your sexual orientation as a self-identified gay male, and that you face additional risk due to the same-sex marriage that you had in Canada, which became known to the community in Barbados.\nDECISION\n[3] I find that you are a refugee pursuant to section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, as there exists a serious possibility of persecution should you return to Barbados, on account of your membership in a particular social group, that is as a person that identifies as gay.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[4] I find that your identity as a national of Barbados is established by the documents provided. I\u2019m relying primarily on the certified copy of your passports in Exhibits 1 and 4, but this is also corroborated by personal documents in Exhibit 5, including your birth certificate.\nSubjective Fear\n[5] I do note that you first left Barbados in XXXX of 2018 for a brief visit to Canada, where you rekindled your relationship with your ex-partner. You returned to Barbados after this and then came back to Canada in XXXX of 2019. You did not seek Canada\u2019s protection until XXXX of 2021. I note that you explained consistently that after returning to Canada in 2019, at that point you married your same-sex partner in Canada and you have given documents that confirm this in Exhibit 5. You stated that you had initiated a sponsorship application and were waiting for this processing and the next steps when the relationship ended in approximately XXXX of 2020. At this time, your now ex-husband told you that he was withdrawing the application, and at that point, you began to look for ways to seek protection and to remain in Canada. I note that this is also indicated in the WhatsApp correspondence given in Exhibit 5 with your ex-husband as well. This explanation is reasonable in your circumstances, and therefore does not raise significant concerns with respect to your subjective fear or your overall credibility.\nCredibility\n[6] I did find you to be a highly credible witness and therefore believe what you have alleged in support of your claim. You testified in a candid and straightforward manner, and there were no relevant inconsistencies in your testimony or contradictions between your testimony and the other evidence before me. In particular, you spoke naturally about your understanding of your sexual orientation and how that developed, about gender norms in Barbados as well, which your behaviour and manners were not seen to be in line with. You discussed community views and a negative atmosphere for sexual minorities, which you personally experienced, and also spoke of the more general living conditions. You provided significant details about two (2) of your same sex relationships that took place in Barbados and in Canada, including the one (1) of your marriage and the details of that dissolution of that marriage after. You have also provided documents to corroborate the allegations, and after reviewing those, I have no reasons to doubt their authenticity.\n[7] I do give weight to the following documents in establishing the allegations. Firstly, the marriage certificate confirms the same-sex marriage that took place in Canada. You have also provided the court documents that confirm the charges against your partner, which includes assault as you had described, and the release documents as well. Letters of support from close friends and ex-colleagues in the Barbados. These confirm details of the discrimination and of the violent treatment that you faced in Barbados. It also attests to the author\u2019s knowledge of your same-sex relationships, and also the community knowledge of your sexual orientation and of your marriage in Barbados.\n[8] You have given a letter from your ex-partner in the Barbados, which also confirms the details of that relationship, and later from a friend in Canada that introduced you to XXXX XXXX after your marriage ended and assisted you in that way. You have also given photographs of yourself and your same-sex partners, including at your marriage ceremony, celebrations and with partners in Barbados. These photos all appear to be natural and comfortable. And excerpts from text message or WhatsApp correspondence over a number of years with your ex-husband. These do not appear contrived, and they also confirm details such as him asking you to leave the residence, and withdrawal of the sponsorship in XXXX of 2020. I therefore find on a balance of probabilities that you are a gay man, that you have been in same-sex relationships in both Barbados and Canada, and that you were married to your now ex-husband in Canada. I also find that your sexual orientation and that this marriage has become known to the broader community in Barbados. I find your subjective fear is established.\nObjective Basis\n[9] Given that there are no serious credibility issues with respect to your allegations, coupled with the documentary evidence, I do find that you have established a prospective risk and well-founded fear of persecution in Barbados. This risk is corroborated by the National Documentation Package for Barbados in Exhibit 3. The objective evidence in the NDP in Item 2.1 states that the criminalization of consensual same-sex activity between men is a significant human rights issue that faces Barbados. The penalty for this can include up to life imprisonment. Although it is noted that this is rarely enforced, it contributes to a homophobic atmosphere in the country. Item 6.1 explains that surveys have shown that approximately half of all Barbadians support the enforcement of these current laws banning same-sex activity. Although Barbados has recently passed anti-discrimination acts in 2020 that prohibit employment discrimination based on sex and sexual orientation, Barbados does not have any other laws that specifically prohibit discrimination against LGBTQI+ persons outside of the area of employment.\n[10] Further, civil society groups report that the LGBTQI+ community still faces ongoing discrimination in areas including employment, housing, access to education, and healthcare. 6.1 also reports that the stigma and discrimination commonly manifests in the form of property damage, ostracism, and verbal abuse from strangers, friends, family and broader society, and LGBTQI+ persons also face immense pressure in the Barbados to simply conform to gender norms in order to appease society. It is also noted that those not fitting the traditional gender norms in Barbados are tremendously at risk of physical and sexual violence. The societal discrimination and police disapproval have also made LGBTQI+ persons more vulnerable to threats, crime, and destruction of property. I therefore find the objective basis for this claim is established.\nNature of the Harm\n[11] I have examined your claim under section 96 of IRPA, as I conclude the risk you described constitutes persecution based on one of the grounds in section 96. Again, your membership in a particular social group as a gay man. I find you are at risk of harassment, discrimination, physical harm, and possible arrest and prosecution for your sexual orientation, and an inability to live openly as a sexual minority.\nState Protection\n[12] I find there is clear and convincing evidence before me that the state is unable or unwilling to provide you with adequate protection. As outlined above, consensual same-sex sexual acts are illegal and carry heavy sentencing. There are also limited legal protections for those who face discrimination as a result of their sexual orientation. As you discussed in testimony, there was an incident where you were physically assaulted, and when police became involved, they shifted their focus onto your sexual orientation rather than the crime itself. This is also confirmed in the documentary evidence in Item 6.1. It reports that most members of the LGBTQ community in Barbados do not report matters to the police out of fear of further negative repercussions and ridicule.\n[13] Country reports in the UN Human Rights Councils also recorded that police in Barbados have been denounced as discriminatory in their treatment of LGBTQI+ victims, and that individuals attempting to make reports often face condemnation by police officers, and justice is very rarely served for members of the LGBTQ community. Often, charges that are made are dropped after years waiting or due to missing reports and incomplete investigations. I therefore find that the objective evidence on the persecution of and lack of state protection available to LGBTQI+ identified individuals in Barbados rebuts the presumption of state protection.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[14] I have also examined whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for you. Based on the evidence on file, I find that you face a serious possibility of persecution throughout Barbados. As the legal framework and the anti-LGBTQI+ atmosphere is consistent throughout the country, and coupled with Barbados\u2019 small geographic size and population, I find there are no parts of the country where you would not face a serious possibility of persecution. Therefore, there is no internal flight alternative available to you.\nCONCLUSION\n[15] In light of the preceding, I conclude that you are a refugee pursuant to section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. Accordingly, I accept your claim today.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

You are claiming to be a citizen of India and are seeking refugee protection pursuant to Sections 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. I have considered your testimony and evidence in this case and I\u2019m ready to render my decision orally. I find that you are a Convention refugee.\n[2] The specific allegations of your claim can be found in your Basis of Claim form in Exhibit 1. In summary, you allege that you fear persecution by the local police because they are falsely accusing you of aiding militants after passengers from your taxi evaded capture at a checkpoint. You believe the police are targeting you simply because you are Muslim.\n[3] You further allege that you have received anonymous calls threatening you to not to cooperate with police at the risk of harm. You report that people back home have said police have asked about you and would still be interested in you and believe that you will not be safe should you return to India.\n[4] Your personal identity as a citizen of India has been established by a copy of your Indian passport in Exhibit 1.\n[5] I find that there is a link between what you fear and a Convention ground, namely your imputed political opinion for false allegations of militancy links and your religion for being Muslim.\n[6] In terms of your general credibility, I find you to be a credible witness and therefore I believe what you have alleged in your oral testimony and in your Basis of Claim forms. Your testimony was straightforward, sincere, and unembellished. I did not find any significant or relevant discrepancies or omissions that would go to the core of the claim.\n[7] You have established on a balance of probabilities that you are a genuine follower of the Muslim faith, that you were transporting three passengers in your taxi to Mumbai Airport and were stopped at a police check point, that two of the passengers ran and evaded police capture upon being questioned about their travel plans. That the police arrested, beat, and falsely accused you of being linked to those passengers and militants, that police had invoked your Muslim faith as grounds of suspecting and disbelieving you, that after your release you received anonymous threatening calls warning you not to cooperate with police, that when you reported such calls the police further allege you were involved with the Islamist militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba. That police back home have asked your family of your whereabouts and are still interested in apprehending you and that you will face risk of harm at the hands of police on false charges should you return to India.\n[8] You provided documents that support your claim in Exhibit 5. Letter dated XXXX XXXX, 2021, from The XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX confirming your membership. Medical certificate and prescription from XXXX XXXX of your hospitalization from XXXX XXXX to XXXX, 2017, after your release from police detention, and an affidavit dated XXXX XXXX, 2021, by the (inaudible) describing your experience with the police and the difficulties of being Muslim in Gujarat. I find your corroborating evidence in support of your claim to be credible and trustworthy, as such I give these documents full weight in support of your allegations.\n[9] I have also asked why you did not provide evidence from your family such as an affidavit from your wife and parents since you testified that they had knowledge of your experiences and helped to make the decision for you to flee the country. You explained that you were afraid to get your family in trouble with the police if you asked them to send evidence. I find your explanation to be reasonable and I accept it. For the above reasons I find that you have established your subjective fear and that there is a link between what you fear and a Convention ground, specifically imputed political opinion, and religion.\n[10] The National Documentation Package for India shows that while India is a multi-party democracy, the government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Hindu nationalist BJP party has presided over discriminatory policies and increased violence effecting the Muslim population.\n[11] Colonial-era and other laws are increasingly invoked to penalize perceived criticism of the government by ordinary citizens. Activists, Muslims, and members of other marginalized communities are routinely charged with sedition for criticizing the government and it\u2019s policies. Religious minorities are especially vulnerable to the threat of communal violence. Muslims while less than 15 percent of the population have typically made up the majority of the victims. Government officials can be indifferent or complicit in acts of targeting religious minorities.\n[12] In 2019, Forbes Magazine claimed that discrimination of religious minorities in India is far reaching and deeply enshrined in law. The article cited anti-conversion and anti-cow slaughter laws being used to discrimination against religious minorities or to justify extrajudicial killings, violence, and forced conversions of non-Hindus to Hinduism.\n[13] Hindu nationalist groups increased feelings of freedom under the present government has led to an increase in violence and intimidation vis-\u00e0-vis the Muslim minority and to the establishment of a majoritarian Hindu discourse. Hindu nationalist groups have increased their influence while the government has done little to avoid the spread of vigilante violence. As episodes of mob violence and lynching of Muslims has intensified, the government\u2019s reaction has been half hearted, societal violence based on religion and cast on religiously associated groups continue to be a serious concern.\n[14] As such, I find that your subjective fear has an objective basis and that you have a well-founded fear of persecution.\n[15] States are presumed to be capable of protecting its\u2019 citizens. To rebut this presumption there must be clear and convincing evidence that state protection is inadequate. A study of the perceptions and experiences of policing in India of Muslim citizens present a picture characterized by discrimination, various degrees of harassment, as well as coercive containments of Muslim neighbours and activities.\n[16] Muslim citizens in the study conveyed a pervasive sense of actively practiced discrimination, victimization, and coercive targeting by the police based on their distinct identity as Muslims. They feel they are both individually and in groups under constant suspicion of supporting anti-national activities, surveilled, and subject to higher levels of intrusive policing. Some of the key findings include police target and victimized Muslims based on their identity revealing a distinct bias.\n[17] Police perceived Muslim concentrated neighbourhoods are subversive and criminalized holding the community constantly suspect. Muslim areas are surrounded by police stations to keep tabs on the community but also as markers of an unofficial boundary between Muslims and other areas. There is ample documentation establishing police bias against Muslims.\n[18] Numerous judicial commissions and civil society reports demonstrate targeted discrimination against Muslims by police in the context of communal violence and the last two decades of process as punishment in terror prosecution. In another study about half of the police personnel reported that Muslims are likely to be naturally prone towards committing violence. Having considered your religious profile, the police as agents of persecution, your experience in detention on false allegations, the response of the police to reported threats, and the country conditions documentation, I find that you have on a balance of probabilities rebutted the presumption with clear and convincing evidence. I therefore find that state protection in India is inadequate and would not be reasonably forthcoming to you.\n[19] I\u2019ve also considered whether a viable Internal Flight Alternative exists for you and find that there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout India. The rise in Hindu nationalism in India has fostered a climate of hate and discrimination against Muslims and other minority communities leading to an increase in violent attacks against them in many parts of the country.\n[20] The state of violence against Muslims was happening in part because there is a ruling political party and a set of militant Hindu groups like the RSS, Bajrang Dal, and Vishwa Hindu Parishad, who are operating in society to defend conservative Hindu norms. The federal government and state governments are turning a blind eye to these acts of violence or enabling them that directly undermines the rule of law.\n[21] You have been accused of links to militants by Gujarat Police and our now alleged to be aiding Lashkar-e-Taiba. This will increase the likelihood of being targeted by police wherever you may relocate in the country. As such I find on a balance of probabilities that you will not be safe anywhere in India. For this reason I find there is no viable Internal Flight Alternative.\n[22] Based on the totality of the evidence, I find that you are a Convention refugee as you face a serious possibility of persecution in your country, and therefore I accept your claim.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

You are claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nDETERMINATION\n[3] In coming to my decision, I have considered and applied the Chairperson\u2019s SOGIESC Guidelines. I find that you are a Convention refugee for the reasons which follow.\nALLEGATIONS\n[4] To briefly summarize your allegations, you allege you came to Canada in XXXX 2019 and spent time with your cousin, who is a lesbian, and connected with the LGBT community in Canada. You are being forced to marry FZ against your will. After returning into Uganda, you came to Canada again in XXXX 2020 to gain a reprieve from your family\u2019s opposition to your involvement with the LGBT community in Canada. After hearing that your family has reported yourupportt for the LGBT community to the police in Uganda, you decided to claim protection.\nIdentity\n[5] I find that you have established your identity as a citizen of Uganda through your testimony and your passport, birth certificate, and education documents contained in Exhibits 1 and 5.\nNexus\n[6] I find that there is a link between what you fear and the Convention ground of particular social group of bisexual women, and your claim is therefore assessed under section 96.\nCredibility\n[7] I have found you to be a credible witness and I therefore believe what you alleged in support of your claim. Your overall testimony was spontaneous, detailed, forthright, and materially consistent with your narrative. You elaborated with additional details without apparent hesitation and without embellishment. You have established the death of your parents based on your narrative and supporting documents, specifically their death certificates contained in Exhibit 5. I find that you are being forced to marry FZ by your uncle, EN, one (1) of your guardians. You testified that your uncle, EN, is specifically forcing you into a marriage, as he and your family believe you are a lesbian and feel that this is shameful to your family and its name.\n[8] You submitted evidence of his identity as well as that of your uncle, who I accept is a prominent and high-ranking member of the military. These are contained in Exhibit 5.\n[9] I find that you are bisexual. I asked you to explain why you did not disclose your sexual orientation in your original narrative, and you said you felt scared and uncomfortable even to disclose to your Counsel. You testified that since you were orphaned, you were raised in a very strict environment and always silenced. You spoke about escaping from your paternal guardians to some of your mom\u2019s relatives to find solace and support at least for a week or two (2). You testified that you attended boarding school as a child and felt drawn to cute girls and would do anything to befriend them. You said you could not express or discuss your feelings due to the anti-gay culture in Uganda. You testified that when you came to Canada to visit with your lesbian cousin, you learned more about gay relationships and how normal they were. You said that your cousin had no support in Uganda and could not even return for her mother\u2019s funeral, and you wanted to be her social support, so she would know that you got her. You said you wanted to educate coworkers and others in Uganda about LGBT people and help to normalize fears about this community and persuade others that they were normal. You testified \u2014 your testimony about stories you heard from gay people from Uganda was most compelling. You said you always had a pull towards the gay community, and until you spent time in Canada, you did not feel confident in talking about your feelings. You testified about meeting someone at a house party last year and described your same-sex relationship. You said you are currently dating.\n[10] You have submitted extensive documents corroborating your participation in various LGBT events in Canada, which are contained in Exhibits 5 and 7. In assessing your credibility, including the recent update to your narrative in which you declared that you are bisexual, and guided by the SOGIESC guideline, section 3.1 states that an individual\u2019s self awareness and self-acceptance of their SOGIESC may present as a gradual or non-linear process. Section 3.3 says that many SOGIESC individuals conceal their sexual orientation in their home country out of mistrust, fear, and experiences of stigmatization, and section 6 cautions Members not to rely on stereotypes or incorrect assumptions in adjudicating cases by, for example, expecting that SOGIESC individuals would be comfortable disclosing this aspect of their identity to others in their lives, including legal Counsel. I therefore find that your subjective fear is established by your credible testimony and supporting documents.\nObjective Basis\n[11] I find that the country condition evidence supports your subjective fear as being objectively well-founded on a balance of probabilities. The US Department of State report in 2.1 writes that significant human rights issues included lack of investigation of and accountability for gender-based violence, including forced marriage, and crimes involving violence or threats of violence targeting lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer or intersex persons, which effectively went unpunished due to impunity. LGBTQI+ persons face discrimination, legal restrictions, harassment, violence and intimidation. This source reports that the government severity restricted freedom of expression or peaceful assembly rights for those speaking out in support of LGBTIQI+ (sic) persons. The UK \u2013 sorry, a UK Home Office report at 6.4 writes that Uganda is predominantly a Christian country where same-sex relationships are against the teachings of the church and homophobic views are widespread. Negative political rhetoric, particularly during election periods, has fueled homophobic sentiment, while societal acceptance of LGBTI persons is low. There is some evidence that attitudes are softening. A Response to Information Request at 5.6 writes about the existence of forced marriages. There are no laws about forced marriages. This source mentions police protection being available to women and girls. However, discrimination against women continued to be widespread, especially in rural areas. Many customary laws discriminate against women in marriage (inaudible) divorce and inheritance. Your Counsel has also submitted country condition evidence, which is consistent with the Board\u2019s National Documentation Package, and can be found at Exhibit 6 and 8.\nState Protection\n[12] I have considered whether state protection would be available to you if you returned to your country, and I have concluded that it is not for the following reasons. As the state is the agent of persecution, it is clear that state protection would not be reasonably forthcoming. Same-sex sexual acts and same-sex marriages are illegal for both men and women. Since 2014, there has been a repeated pattern of attempts by parliamentarians to tighten the laws affecting LGBTI people, including calls to introduce a death penalty for same-sex sexual acts. This is in 6.4. Human Rights Watch at 6.13 reports that two (2) mass arrests on (inaudible) grounds based on presumed sexual orientation or gender identity were conducted and the detainees were subjected to abuse. LGBT activists have also been arrested because of their work in the LGBT community. I find it would be objectively unreasonable for you to seek the potential of the state in your particular circumstances, where your family believes you may be a member of the LGBT community and support them.\nInternal Flight Alternative or IFA\n[13] I have also considered whether viable IFA exists for you, as the state is the agent of persecution and as it has effective control of all its territory, and in the absence of adequate state protection and warrants for discrimination against women and the LGBT community, it is clear that there is no viable IFA.\nCONCLUSION\n[14] Based on the totality of the evidence, I find you to be a Convention refugee, and I accept your claim.\n[15] This concludes the oral decision.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

So, we are just back from a break, and I am going to read the decision for TC1-18439.\n[2] I have considered your testimony and the other evidence in the case, and I am ready to render my decision orally.\n[3] These are the reasons for the decision in the claim of XXXX XXXX XXXX who claims to be a citizen of Iran and is claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. In rendering my decision, I have considered and applied the Immigration and Refugee Board\u2018s Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9, proceedings before the IRB involving sexual orientation and gender identity and expression.\n[4] Your allegations are fully set out in your Basis of Claim. In summary, you fear persecution at the hands of the state and society due to your sexual orientation.\n[5] For the following reasons, I find that you are a refugee pursuant to section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[6] I find that your identity as a national of Iran is established by submission of your passport and other identity documents.\n[7] I note that you delayed approximately eight (8) months before claiming refugee protection in Canada. However, you indicate that you had intended to study and work in Canada as a means to apply for permanent status through the immigration process. When you learned from your parents that you were being monitored and sought by the state after you left Iran, you filed a claim for refugee protection. This explanation seems reasonable in your alleged circumstances and therefore does not raise significant concerns with respect to subjective fear or credibility.\n[8] I find you to be a credible witness and therefore believe what you alleged in support of your claim. There were no relevant inconsistencies in your testimony or contradictions between your testimony and the other evidence before me. You testified in a straightforward manner regarding your sexual orientation and your experiences in Iran as a result. You also spoke of your new relationship in Canada and your feeling of safety in Canada.\n[9] In particular, the following evidence establishes your allegations as set out above. Letters of support from your parents substantiating the core allegations of the claim, social media posts substantiating your opinion as it relates to the \u2014 to sexual orientation, photos and text messages substantiating your new relationship, letter of support from your best friend substantiating your allegations, and documents substantiating your 519 membership and volunteer work. After reviewing the documents, I have no reason to doubt their authenticity.\n[10] Given that there are no serious credibility issues with respect to your allegations, coupled with the documentary evidence set out below, I find that you, excuse me, have established a prospective risk of arbitrary arrest, detention, or other serious harm in Iran.\n[11] The risk is corroborated by the following documents. 2.1 and 6.6 both indicate that the law criminalizes consensual same-sex sexual activity which is punishable by death and flogging. 6.6 rather further indicates that Iran security forces rely on discriminatory laws to harass, arrest, and detain those they suspect of being lesbian, gay, and bisexual. LGBTI persons face a variety of abuse by government authorities, including beatings, verbal assaults, rape, sexual assault, and torture. In general, Iranian society does not accept LGBTI persons. Many find themselves subject to familial violence, societal discrimination, abuse, harassment and in some cases, physical attacks. Lesbians, in particular, were vulnerable to honour killings and abandonment by their families. There are no criminal justice mechanisms to prosecute those accused of hate crimes against members of the LGBTI community. In general, LGBTI persons who openly express their sexual orientation or gender identity or expression are likely to face discrimination, ill treatment, and prosecution from state actors as well as discrimination and ill treatment from societal actors.\n[12] Sorry. 6.1 notes that in present day, Iran, lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender individuals suffer from human rights violations and are denied the basic freedom of being who they are. Now, the government relying on an official religious stance refuses to tolerate any nonconforming sexual conduct or gender expression.\n[13] 6.2 notes that in Islam generally, homosexuality is among the worst possible sins you can imagine.\n[14] 6.3 indicates that no progress has been made towards the recognition of LGBTQ people\u2019s rights under Iranian law. And there is no evidence that positive legal developments are on the horizon.\n[15] 6.4 notes that in addition to the restrictions on their rights as women, lesbians in Iran face further restrictions due to the criminalization of same-sex conduct along with widespread societal intolerance. This double discrimination contributes significantly to the abuses that they face.\n[16] The objective evidence clearly establishes that the treatment of the LGBTI community by Iranian officials and society amounts to persecution.\n[17] I have examined your claim under section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act as I conclude that the risk you describe constitutes persecution based on at least one (1) of the grounds prescribed in section 96, specifically your membership in a particular social group, that being lesbian women.\n[18] I find that there is clear and convincing evidence before me that the state is unwilling to provide you with adequate protection. The agent of persecution in this case is the state.\n[19] And the objective evidence indicates at 6.4 that the combination of homophobic laws and anti-LGBTQI attitudes by many law enforcement agents have made it extremely difficult if not impossible for Iranian lesbians who have been subjected to discrimination and abuse to seek justice.\n[20] I have also examined whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for you. Based on the evidence on file, I find that you face a serious possibility of persecution throughout Iran. Again, the agent of persecution is the state. And the documents indicate that conditions are similar throughout the country.\n[21] In light of the preceding, I conclude that you are a refugee pursuant to section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. And accordingly, I accept your claim.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

I have also taken into consideration the Chairperson Guidelines 4, Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution. I have taken into account the submissions of the Minister, who intervened in this hearing, in writing, on the issue of credibility. And the documentary evidence provided in support the Ministerial submissions.\n[6] I am ready to give you my decision orally.\n[7] I\u2019m accepting your claims for refugee protection.\n[8] I find that the principal claimant is a Convention refugee, on the grounds of his imputed political opinion. The associate claimants are also Convention refugees, on the basis of membership in a particular social group, the family, as the wife and the child of the principal claimant. And the associate claimant XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is also a member of a particular social group, based on her gender, a woman who is a survivor and who fears gender-based violence.\n[9] In summary, you allege that you fear the police authorities in India because they believe that the principal claimant, Mr. XXXX XXXX, is connected to Sikh militants and is involved in anti-government activities.\n[10] You allege, Mr. XXXX XXXX that you\u2019re from a village in the XXXX district, in Ludhiana, in the Punjab in India. You\u2019re a farmer by occupation, and you\u2019re of the Sikh religion.\n[11] You claim that your problems in India are related to your familial connection with your cousin XXXX XXXX, a XXXX in Sikh temples, who was arrested in 2015 and 2016, because he had taken part in protests against the government in the Punjab.\n[12] You allege that his father, your uncle, was tortured by police and he passed away. A ceremony for your uncle was held at your home on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2017, and your cousin XXXX XXXX who was in hiding, came to see his mother. The next morning you allege police came to your home, raided your house, and arrested you. And you allege that you were interrogated and tortured while in police custody. And you were released four (4) days later when a bribe was paid, on condition that you report every month and provide information about your cousin.\n[13] You needed, and you obtained, medical treatment for your injuries while in police custody. After your release, you went to live with relatives in XXXX, because you were scared. While you were living there in hiding, the police kept visiting your house, and one (1) night, on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2017, they arrested your wife, the associate claimant, detained her overnight and assaulted her physically and sexually.\n[14] She revealed your whereabouts to the police, and they raided the house of your relative, but you had gone to live with an agent in preparation to leave the country. Your wife, the associate claimant, joined you and you left together with your daughter in XXXX 2017.\n[15] You allege that while you were in hiding, the police were harassing your mother and she had to move and live different places with relatives. You claim that the police are still looking for you, and people in the community have informed you that they come to your house every couple of months to check. Most recently, in XXXX this year. And that for this reason, there is still a risk for you and your family in India.\n[16] When it comes to identity, I find that your personal identities, and that you are citizens of India has been established, on a balance of probabilities, by your oral testimonies and the certified true copies of your passports, which are on file.\n[17] In terms of credibility.\n[18] I found you to be credible witnesses.\n[19] You answered all my questions and there was no evasiveness in your testimonies. You were able to explain very clearly, Mr. XXXX, the reasons why the police targeted your cousin, what information they wanted from you, the mistreatment you suffered while in custody, and the steps you took to seek security, first in hiding with your uncle, then staying with an agent until you were able to travel to Canada. Your testimonies today were spontaneous, unrehearsed, and emotional when you recalled the mistreatment on the part of the police.\n[20] In assessing your credibility, I address several issues in the hearing today. Firstly, there was some delay in claiming asylum after you arrived in Canada. You arrived on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2017, but you did not submit your applications for asylum until XXXX 2018.\n[21] I also asked you to explain why you applied for a US visa whilst in Canada, and before asking for protection in Canada. This is a relevant issue when it comes to your subjective fear of returning to India. As somebody fearing persecution would reasonably not take the risk not being allowed back in Canada and being potentially deported in the country of persecution, as the Minister pointed out in his submissions.\n[22] In your testimony you clarified that the two (2) issues were connected. You wanted to go to the US because your sister lives there, and you were thinking of applying for asylum in the US. It was only after your visa for the US was refused that you decided to apply in Canada. You also testified that the agent had assured you that you were safe in Canada for six (6) months, as he told you this was the time period in which you were allowed to stay as a visitor.\n[23] You testified that you were conscious of the possibility of not obtaining asylum in the US. But you were not aware of the consequences of not being able to come back to Canada or being deported from the US.\n[24] While I understand that having family in the US can be a reason to go there instead, overall, I agree with the Minister that a logical behaviour of somebody fearing persecution in their country would be to apply for asylum in the first secure place, in your case, Canada. I do not think that your preference to be in the US should have been predominant in your considerations, as you testified.\n[25] So, while I cannot conclude that the explanation you gave is reasonable, I take into account that it is well established in the jurisprudence that factors like delay, in your case, trying to go to another country, as well, instead of immediately applying for asylum, are relevant when assessing your subjective fear.\n[26] However, such factors cannot be in themselves decisive and sufficient to deny a claim. And in the totality of the evidence in your case, they cannot outweigh the evidence that I have before me, and your testimony that I found credible, about your experiences of persecution in India.\n[27] For these reasons, I find that your delaying claiming asylum and the application for a US visa are not determinative. And they are not fatal to the outcome of your claim.\n[28] Finally, I asked you questions about your residency status in Kenya, because you indicated in your Basis of Claim forms that the associate claimant studied there, and that she lived there until 2009. And the principal claimant also indicated having lived in Kenya for about a year and a half, in 2008\/2009.\n[29] You explained, Mrs.XXXX XXXX, that you were independent of your father, who was there on a working visa. He provided a copy of a temporary residence card for Kenya, and its length was for one (1) year. You testified that this permit had to be renewed regularly, which was done by your father. There is nothing in the available documentary evidence to suggest that either of you had a permanent residence or equivalent status in Kenya.\n[30] Therefore, I do not have concerns for possible exclusion under Article 1E of the Convention, and I find that the sole country of reference for you is India.\n[31] Other than those concerns that I just discussed, that I found were explained or not determinative, there were no significant omissions and inconsistencies that would undermine the credibility of your core allegations.\n[32] You submitted, in support of your allegations, documentary evidence, including medical reports for both the principal claimant and associate claimant. They were consistent with the alleged injuries sustained while in detention for the principal claimant. And they also corroborate the associate claimant\u2019s allegations of the assault. These documents carry all the attributes being issued by the medical facility, and I find no evident reason to doubt their authenticity.\n[33] You also submitted sworn statements notarized, signed, and dated from the former head of the village, from neighbours, from your relative who sheltered you, Mr. XXXX, and from your mother. They corroborate your allegations and are consistent with the alleged facts.\n[34] Therefore, taking into consideration all this evidence and your testimonies, I find, on a balance of probabilities, that you have established your core allegations, and that you are afraid to return to India at this moment.\n[35] In order to find that you\u2019re Convention refugees, your subjective fear must be well founded, that is, it must have an objective basis. And for this, I rely on the National Documentation Package for India, the NDP, that\u2019s at Exhibit 3.\n[36] The documentary evidence indicates that the law in India prohibits torture, but the police nevertheless employ such practices. This is at Item 2.2 of the NDP.\n[37] At Item 2.1, the US Department of State report, confirms that police use mistreatment to obtain false confessions. There\u2019s also an indication that people will publicly express their views critical of the government and police, face risk of discrimination by the State, which may include arrest, harassment, and prosecution.\n[38] Item 10.1 state that police in India commonly, illegally detain, physically or sexually assault, or torture suspects, in order to punish them or to gather information, to extort, or coerce confessions from them. It notes that family members who attempt to assist their relatives may be threatened or mistreated, as in the present case.\n[39] The same report contains numerous accounts of police failing to follow formal arrest procedures and of registering false records against suspects after detaining them illegally, in order to substantiate false cases against a suspect. Also, false charges are reportedly brought regularly against alleged Sikh militants, and are used by the State to silence political opponents.\n[40] There are examples mentioned din the NDP of everyday people who are suspected of associating with Sikh militants being arrested, under ostensible and unverifiable evidence, and this information can be found in Item 4.9. Some of the accused are sentenced to prolonged sentences, including life in prison. And that\u2019s in Item 4.4.\n[41] Therefore, I find that the objective evidence supports the principal claimant\u2019s allegations of being arrested and tortured because of being perceived as associated with Sikh militants, and opponents of the government.\n[42] When it comes to the associate claimant\u2019s alleged fear of gender-based persecution, I find that it is also supported by the objective evidence. Sexual violence by police and other state officials experienced by women in India is well documented in the NDP.\n[43] At Item 5.9, sexual violence is widespread across the country and perpetrated in public and private spaces. There is a general sense of insecurity for women in public spaces in India. Item 2.1 states that rape, including gang rape, and by government official, is a persistent problem in India. And Item 5.9 talks about reports of women being assaulted by police, while in police custody.\n[44] Item 5.4 of the NDP states that women who experience sexual violence are stigmatized, and it is considered a woman\u2019s shame. So, there are many social barriers to talk about that. Item 5.9 says that sexual offences are underreported due to social stigma that\u2019s deeply entrenched in patriarchal attitudes of the police, and the justice system blames, often, the victims for these incidents.\n[45] And for these reasons, on the basis of the information found in the NDP, I find that the objective evidence has established that your fear of persecution in India is well founded and has an objective basis for both of you, for all of you.\n[46] In terms of state protection, I find that you have rebutted the presumption of state protection with clear and convicting evidence.\n[47] In reviewing the country conditions of state protection in India, the objective evidence shows that corruption within the police force in India within the police force is a serious problem. For example, at Items 10.1 and 9.9.\n[48] Furthermore, given that the police from your home area of residence is the agent of persecution in the present case, I find that one (1) cannot reasonably expect you to receive adequate state protection from them.\n[49] I have also considered whether there is viable internal flight alternative for you anywhere in India.\n[50] I find that you have established, on a balance of probabilities, that you were arrested and detained, and your information was taken down. And you are considered to be associated with Sikh militants. All of this indicates that the police authorities would be able and motivated to find you in a different jurisdiction in India, if they wanted to do so.\n[51] You have, furthermore, established, on a balance of probability, that the police has, in the past, used your family members, harassing them and torturing them, in order to reveal your whereabouts. This is how they found your address when you were in hiding, Mr. XXXX, from your wife, when she was detained and tortured. And they have also been approaching your mother regularly, and recently for the same purpose, to get information of your whereabouts.\n[52] The Canadian courts have established that it is unreasonable to expect refugee claimants to cut ties with family members in order to avoid being found by the agent of persecution in a given IFA location.\n[53] And when it comes to gender-based violence, the available information in the NDP does not indicate that the situation is any different in any part of India. And I do not find it reasonable to ask the associate claimant to relocate within India, and to be subjected to psychological hardship by fear of experiencing the same kind of violence again.\n[54] For these reasons, I find that there\u2019s no viable internal flight alternative in India for you.\n[55] In conclusion, when I look at the totality of the evidence, your testimony, the documents in the NDP, the documentary evidence you provided, I find that all three (3) face a serious possibility of persecution in India.\n[56] Therefore, you meet the definition of Convention refugee under section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, and I accept your claims for refugee protection.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

But I\u2019m just now going to deliver my oral reasons, that I must do more thoroughly.\n[2] So these are the reasons in the claim for refugee protection, made by XXXX XXXX XXXX, TC1-18822.\n[3] Your allegations are fully set out in your Basis of Claim.\n[4] In summary, you fear persecution on a number of interconnected grounds. Your brother, XXXX, was a passenger on Ukrainian Flight PS752, which was shot down by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard on January 8th, 2020.\n[5] In the aftermath of your brother\u2019s death, you began to experience persecution by the Iranian regime, and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, the IRCG (sic), when you posted messages on Instagram, in which you opposed the government\u2019s claim that the airline had been shot down in error. You indicated this was not true, this was a lie. After making such posts, you received a threat that if you continued to make such posts, you would be harmed.\n[6] A member of the IRGC connected with your brother-in-law to force you stop, and if you disagreed with the regime and the IRGC, if you continued with this disagreement you could be harmed further, was the threat that you were told.\n[7] You also disagreed with the regime and the IRGC, that the victims of this airline tragedy would be buried as martyrs. You argued that they are victims, and not martyrs. And because of this, you were also harassed.\n[8] After posting about the truth of what happened on Flight PS752 on your Instagram, your account was hacked, and then it was blocked and taken down.\n[9] You described all the security restrictions that were put on you and your family prior to, and at, your brother\u2019s funeral. You were not permitted to see your brother\u2019s body. The Iranian regime did the autopsy, they put your brother\u2019s body in a coffin, and you and your family had to travel to Tehran under high security.\n[10] You explained that the reason for doing this was so that you wouldn\u2019t have any opportunity to see, or speak to, the other family members of the victims. And despite your protests, your brother was buried in the section which the Iranian regime deemed would be the area where martyrs are buried. And you were not allowed to attend at the grave for the funeral.\n[11] You learned about the Association of Victims\u2019 Families of Flight PS752 through Instagram, while you were in Iran, and you connected with them. You also contacted a lawyer at XXXX XXXX, who had reached out to you after you posted your messages on Instagram.\n[12] Members of the Association of Victims\u2019 Families of Flight PS752 encouraged you to apply for your visa and come to Canada, and you described the process for doing that.\n[13] You described how it was still very difficult for you and your family after your brother was killed, and the treatment that you experienced, that you decided to wait a little while in Iran before you could come to Canada. But feeling better and feeling stronger, and also fearing the harm that you could experience if you continued with your activities in seeking justice for your brother and the other victims, you fled Iran and came to Canada on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2021. And at that point you filed a claim for refugee protection.\n[14] You\u2019d explained how difficult your brother\u2019s death was for your whole family, and how difficult it has been for you since you\u2019ve come to Canada. You continued to pursue the justice for your brother and the victims of this flight, horrendous experience of what the victims\u2019 families have been through. And as well, to seek justice for what has occurred to the victims.\n[15] You participated in a class action that is still ongoing, and you\u2019ve retained XXXX XXXX, who have filed a separate claim against the Iranian regime and the IRGC.\n[16] You showed me the correspondence you\u2019ve had with members of XXXX XXXX, related to your retaining them to pursue the action against them. You showed me a power of attorney, on behalf of your brother, that was signed by you and the other members of your family as well.\n[17] You\u2019ve been a member of the Association of Families Victims of Flight PS752 (sic), and through this association, as a member, you\u2019ve been critical of the Iranian government on social media, on several platforms.\n[18[ You\u2019ve attended protests at downtown locations, and you showed me a few photos of your attendance. You indicated that because of COVID, you weren\u2019t able to have so many organized events, but you did show me a photo of you in the streets, and the city square, that you said was in XXXX of 2021. Photos show you holding a placard of your brother. And you also described that in the photo is another placard of a young man, who you said was your brother\u2019s friend, who was also a victim on that flight.\n[19] You said that you\u2019ve been in contact with this young man\u2019s mother, who explained how that family has been threatened and harassed in Iran, and are currently living under house arrest.\n[20] You showed me as well, your correspondence with an officer you said was XXXX (ph), at the RCMP. And you told me of the interview you had in Canada, with the RCMP, who are investigating the intimidation and the threats and the treatment of the families of the victims of Flight PS752. And that later this month, you will be having a meeting with the RCMP who will update you on the status of that investigation.\n[21] You testified that in your understanding, that if you were to return to Iran now, you would be detained upon entry into that country, and you would likely be detained and be gravely harmed if you were detained, because of your continued actions to seek justice for your brother and the other victims.\n[22] So I\u2019ve found that you are a refugee, pursuant to Section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act\u00b8 as there exists a serious possibility of persecution should you return to Iran, due to your political opinion, based on your public criticism of the government\u2019s action, and also as a member of a particular social group, namely, family members of victims of Flight PS752.\n[23] I found that you established your identity and your citizenship in Iran by your evidence today, as well as the submission of your Iranian passport, which is in the file.\n[24] I found you to be a very credible witness today. I know it was difficult for you to answer these questions, but you were very straightforward and thorough, and did your best as to answer all of my questions in a very sincere and straightforward manner.\n[25] I believe what you alleged in support of your claim. There were no inconsistencies in your testimony, or contradictions between your testimony and the other evidence, and what you had outlined in your Basis of Claim form.\n[26] You provided me, as I indicated, with documentary evidence in the photographs, the emails, and I had no reason to doubt the authenticity of all of those documents. So after reviewing all this evidence, I have found that you have established that you have a subjective fear of returning to Iran.\n[27] As well, based on your testimony, the objective evidence that I have, in the National Documentation Package for Iran, which I discussed at the beginning of the hearing, it has definitely outlined the objective evidence that supports what you allege.\n[28] In particular, Tab 2.1, reports indicate that government severely restricts freedom of speech, and uses law to intimidate, or prosecute, persons who directly criticize the government or raise human rights issues. Those who speak out or criticize the government, are accused of instigating crimes against the State, national security, or insulting Islam. Individuals are not permitted to criticize the country\u2019s system of government, Supreme Leader, or official religion.\n[29] Reports cite significant human rights issues, including numerous reports of unlawful or arbitrary killings, forced disappearance and torture by government agents, as well as systemic use of arbitrary detention and imprisonment, severe restrictions of religious freedom. These are among the many abuses being perpetrated by officials as a matter of government policy.\n[30] The report further notes that the government collected personally identifiable information in connection with citizens\u2019 peaceful expression of political, religious, or ideological opinions or beliefs, and harassed persons who criticize the government, or raise sensitive social problems. Bloggers, social media users, and online journalists continue to be arrested, and this seems to be in line with what you have experienced as well.\n[31] Section 4.4, specifically in relation to Flight PS752, sources report that Iranian security forces used live ammunition on protesters in Tehran, on the 12th of January, 2020, and direct threats were made by state security and intelligence agent against students participating in peaceful sit-ins, hospitalized protesters who had been injured by security forces and against the families of the victims. This certainly aligns with the evidence that you gave me today about your, and your family\u2019s experiences.\n[32] The May 2020 Human Rights Watch article reports that since April 2020, courts in Iran have sentenced at least 13 people to prison terms, apparently solely for peacefully protesting the downing of Ukrainian Airline Flight PS752.\n[33] A retired professor indicated that the government has threatened individuals who have publicly criticized PS752 incident. An associate professor reporting that two (2) individuals who attended the ceremony for the victims of Flight PS752 were arrested and sentenced, with one (1) person being sentenced to five (5) years, and the other to two (2) years, in detention.\n[34] The same sources stated that mistreatment by the authorities of anti-government activists included those returning from abroad.\n[35] Further, the authorities have threatened family members of individuals who spoke out about Flight PS752, and the incident and circumstances of the downing of that flight.\n[36] Given your involvement in seeking justice for the victims, your brother, and the other victims of Flight PS752, paired with the objective evidence I\u2019ve just discussed, I find that you\u2019ve established a serious possibility of persecution in Iran.\n[37] I\u2019ve examined your claim under Section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, and as I conclude, the risk you describe constitutes persecution based on at least one (1) of the grounds prescribed in Section 96, specifically, political opinion based on your public criticisms of the government\u2019s actions, and also as a member of a particular social group, being a family member of a victim of Flight PS752.\n[38] I find that there\u2019s clear and convincing evidence that the State is unwilling to provide you with adequate protection, given that the State itself is the agent of protection (sic).\n[39] I also had to examine whether there\u2019s a viable internal flight alternative that exists for you; would there be a safe place for you to live in Iran; and would it be reasonable and practical for you to live there.\n[40] But based on the evidence on file, I find that you would face this serious possibility of persecution throughout Iran, regardless of where you relocated should you return. The objective evidence indicates the conditions are similar throughout the country.\n[41] The government maintains effective control throughout the country, and again the agent of persecution is, in fact, the State.\n[42] So for all these reasons, I\u2019ve concluded that you are a refugee, pursuant to Section 96, and I\u2019m accepting your claim.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

In summary, the claimant fears persecution at the hands of the (inaudible) Kenyan society, police, and state authorities due to his sexual orientation as a gay male. In assessing the claim, the Panel focused on the credibility of the claimant\u2019s allegations and of the risk of persecution or harm he might face upon his return to Kenya because of his sexual orientation.\nIdentity\n[4] The claimant\u2019s personal and national identity has been established through his testimony and through documentation filed, namely a certified copy of his Kenyan passport.\nNexus\n[5] The Panel finds that there is a nexus between the harm the claimant fears and his sexual orientation. This claim will, therefore, be assessed pursuant to section 96. The test under section 96 is whether there is a serious possibility of persecution should the claimant be returned to Kenya, and the Panel finds that the claimant has satisfied this burden.\nCredibility\n[6] Maldonado stands for the assertion that when a claimant affirms to tell the truth, this creates a presumption of truthfulness, unless there is evidence to the contrary. The Panel found the claimant\u2019s testimony to be highly consistent and credible in his evidence. He provided spontaneous detail in support of his allegations, and was straightforward in his testimony, which was provided in English without the assistance of an interpreter. There were no relevant contradictions or omissions that would go to the core of the claim. The Panel finds the claimant to be a credible witness and, therefore, believes what he has alleged in support of his claim.\n[7] During the hearing, the claimant described his longstanding realization of his sexual orientation in a spontaneous way and has provided details of the public discovery of his sexual orientation, the abuse he experienced at the hands of the police and society, and the subsequent decision made to find a safer country where he could experience a normal life given his sexual orientation. He testified candidly about what it was like to live in a homophobic society and the pressures that caused him to be fearful of a return to Kenya. The claimant further testified about the longstanding same-sex relationship he has been involved in with XXXX XXXX (ph) XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, in Kenya. He has provided realistic and credible details as to the ongoing nature of his relationship and his awareness of the difference between LGBT experiences in Canada versus abroad. He was candid in his testimony and the Panel finds that he did not attempt to embellish his testimony to further his claim.\n[8] In addition, the claimant has provided credible evidence about the violent persecution he suffered as a result of his sexual orientation while in Kenya. The Panel is satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that the claimant is of a minority sexual orientation, namely a gay male and has suffered persecution while in Kenya as a result. Based on the credible testimony and the supporting documentation, I find, on the balance of probabilities, that the claimant is a member of the LGBTQI community in Canada as alleged. On the whole, the evidence was internally consistent and inherently plausible and consistent with the documentary evidence on country conditions in Kenya. Furthermore, the allegations are corroborated by personal documents and the Panel finds no reasons to doubt the evidence put before it. Based on the documents on file and the testimony of the claimant, I find the evidence is credible and that the allegations in this case are as alleged. The Panel, therefore, finds the claimant does have a subjective fear of persecution in Kenya as a gay male.\nObjective Evidence\n[9] The Panel notes the documentary evidence found in the National Documentation Package clearly illustrates the ongoing persecution of gay people in Kenya. In particular, Items 2.1 and 6.1 referenced the state\u2019s use of mistreatment against those belonging to the LGBTQI community. The NDP also indicates that the state authorities continue to engage in arrests under section 1.62(a)(c) of the Kenyan Penal Code, which prohibits individuals from engaging in same-sex relations and activities, and this law is effective throughout the country. The Panel, therefore, finds that the claimant\u2019s fear has an objective basis and that it is well-founded.\nState Protection\n[10] The Panel finds that state protection would not be available to the claimant if he were to seek in Kenya, where agents of the state, themselves, are sources of persecution, the presumption of state protection may be rebutted without exhausting all avenues of recourse in the country. In this case, the primary agent of persecution is the state. Considering the objective country documentation, as well as the claimant\u2019s personal experiences, the Panel finds that he has rebutted the presumption of state protection and that adequate state protection would not be available to him in Kenya.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[11] Panel has also considered whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for the claimant. Based on the objective evidence in Item 2.1 of the National Documentation Package, the Panel finds, on the balance of probabilities, it would not be reasonable for him to relocate in Kenya as a gay male, as persecution of those belonging to the LBGTQI community is widespread.\nCONCLUSION\n[12] Based on the totality of the evidence before the Panel, the Panel concludes that the claimant faces a serious possibility of persecution based on his belonging to a particular social group of gay males in Kenya. And therefore, the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of IRPA and the Refugee Protection Division accepts his claim.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

He is seeking refugee protection in Canada pursuant to Sections 96 and 97 (1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. I have considered your testimony and the other evidence in the case and I am ready to render a decision in this matter orally. The written decision will be sent to you shortly and may be amended for spelling and grammar purposes.\n[3] Having considered all the evidence brought forward in this matter, I find that you are a person in need of protection pursuant to Section 97 (1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act and my reasons are as follows:\n[4] I think he understood that?\n[5] INTERPRETER: Yes and I gave him the thumbs up as well and right now he is emotional.\n[6] MEMBER: Alright, yes.\n[7] INTERPRETER: Thank you.\n[8] MEMBER: So your allegations, Sir, are fully set out in your Basis of Claim Form filed at Exhibit 2. In summary, you allege that you are a Jordanian citizen of Palestinian origin fearing tribal law sanction revenge killing because you had unlawful and unauthorised sexual relations with your employer\u2019s daughter XXXX (ph), your employer belongs to a large powerful tribe in Jordan, the A-L-B-T-A-Y-N-E-H tribe.\n[9] You indicated that you met the daughter XXXX (ph) at your work place. She was your boss\u2019 daughter, she was also studying XXXX XXXX which you had studied and the father asked you to give her a tour of the workplace and you began a personal relationship and fell in love and you had a secret relationship you indicated because as an individual of Palestinian origin and not belonging to any tribe you and your girlfriend believed that her father would not be receptive to your relationship given your various statures in Jordan.\n[10] You indicated that after spending some time together on a trip to the Dead Sea you and XXXX wound up together having premarital relations which is heavily forbidden within the Jordanian culture.\n[11] About a month after this in XXXX 2021 XXXX (ph) took a pregnancy test and advised you that you, that she was pregnant. You allege that the agent of harm, the father and the tribe attacked your family home causing property damage and that later a bloodshed declaration or decree was issued against you.\n[12] Your personal and national identity as a citizen of Jordan has been established on a balance of probabilities by your credible testimony and a copy of your Jordanian passport filed in Exhibit 1 of the consolidated list of documents.\n[13] You have also provided University transcripts, copies of your various Degrees and that is sufficient.\n[14] With regard to nexus, you face a revenge killing threat from your agents of harm in Jordan because of your unauthorised sexual relationship with Mr. XXXX XXXX XXXX daughter.\n[15] Threats of harm or death driven by family in tribal vendetta or revenge is not one of the five Convention grounds set under 96, under Section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act therefore I have assessed your claim under Section 97 (1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[16] Credibility was a key issue in this claim, the Court rules in Maldonado v\/s Canada is that sworn testimony of a claimant is presumed to be true unless there is a valid reason to doubt its truthfulness.\n[17] I have found you to be a credible witness. You testified in a straightforward and spontaneous manner, therefore I believe what you have alleged in your Basis of Claim Form and testified to in the hearing orally. You provided numerous details indicating your background, how you met XXXX (ph) how the two of your commenced a relationship, how you fell in love, how you were afraid to seek her hand in marriage for fear of your Palestinian background.\n[18] You also indicated that after the father learned of your unauthorised pre-marital sexual relationship, he threatened you physically and a bloodshed declaration was issued against you which has been filed as part of your disclosure.\n[19] You further testified that even though you asked for XXXX hand in marriage you were rebuffed by the father.\n[20] You indicated that after you reached Canada the XXXX which is spelled XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX sorry that the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX passed the decree on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2021, where they decided to have your bloodshed that is to kill you due to the fact that you had a unauthorised relationship with their daughter and brought shame to the family.\n[21] You clarified that your family members are safe because they are not personally targeted, that the agents of harm are determined to kill you in accordance with Jordanian tribal custom and as previously stated, the core aspect of your allegatiwon and oral testimony were also corroborated by your personal documentation which has been entered into evidence.\n[22] You provided both an affidavit from your father detailing the problems and the issues you would have, you also provided an affidavit from your aunt who you went to live in hiding prior to your departure from Jordan.\n[23] You also provided a copy of the tribal decision which is found at\u2026\n[24] INTERPRETER: Any help Mr. Member?\n[25] MEMBER: No it\u2019s fine the tribal decision which is found at Exhibit 6 and again that confirms the situation and the reasons behind this bloodshed declaration.\n[26] On a balance of probabilities, I find because of your unauthorised relationship with XXXX (ph) and the threats of death at the hands of your agents of harm that you have continued to receive threats of death at the hands of your agents of harm who have vowed to kill you in revenge in accordance with Jordanian tribal law and custom.\n[27] Based upon the evidence provided, I find that on a balance of probabilities that you have established through your credible testimony and compelling documents the existence of a personalised forward looking risk which would not generally be faced by other persons in Jordan.\n[28] On a balance of probabilities, I find you to be a credible witness and accept your oral evidence concerning the fear that you face in Jordan. I find that you have established your obligations and they are consistent with the country condition documents.\n[29] Your allegations are generally consistent with the available objective evidence about conditions in Jordan. The current national documentation package from Jordan of this year, specifically Item 5.10 at Page 1 makes it clear that Jordan is a very tribal based society with very strong tribal connections and traditions and that the law in Jordan, both civil and criminal is not separate but intertwined with these tribal traditions.\n[30] The NDP also confirmed that family violence and revenge is widespread in Jordan. It records that the notions of tribe and tribal law remains strong in Jordan, this is contained in NDP Item 5.10, Jordanian tribal law permits murder as revenge under various legal systems.\n[31] In addition to the objective evidence found within the NDP Item 9.1 at Page 4 further indicates that revenge including by means of murder is part of tribal practices in Jordan.\n[32] It is further clarified that although revenge is criminalised in Jordan because it does not constitute a right by virtue of which the avenger is granted any legal protection or special treatment. The criminalisation does not negate the fact that such crimes continue to be committed in Jordan, the same item of the NDP 5.10 at Page 7 states that tribal affiliations are inexorably tied with identity from many Jordanians from the national to the village level and that tribal identity and loyalty play a strong role in governance and dispute resolution whenever blood and honour crimes occur.\n[33] Item 9.1 of the NDP at Page 1 indicates that tribal consideration or dispute resolution has come to form part of the Jordanian culture and custom despite the fact that it no longer constitutes part of the Jordanian legal system.\n[34] You did indicate that your father tried to reach out to the tribe to see if resolution could be made but he was rebuffed.\n[35] NDP Item 1.4 indicates that the central notation of tribal honour or S-H-A-R-A-F remains important to all aspects of life in Jordan and the importance of tribal honour manifests itself and each man feeling responsible for maintaining a tribe reputation for being resolute in rectifying each and every infraction of his rights.\n[36] From the tribal perspective, if a group does not do this, they may be known as weak and then become, and then they can be known as easy prey in the desert. This is contained under NDP Item 1.4 at Page 23.\n[37] NDP Item 5.10 at Page 9 further indicates that the reputation size and associated power of the tribe, its importance as one tribe\u2019s influence, as one tribe influences what quality of justice one received.\n[38] It says that revenge is a norm in Jordan whether the offense is intentional or accidental.\n[39] You have explained to me that you are Jordanian of a Palestinian origin and that you belong to no known tribe and that your family is not influential and very small.\n[40] I conclude that the claimant has established that the risk posed to him in Jordan from the family and the tribe, specifically the B-A-T-A-Y-N-E-H tribe is supported by this objective evidence. Counsel also filed a lengthy article about the power of the Batayneh tribe in XXXX but also in other areas of Jordan and that they are quite involved within the Jordanian government and wield considerable influence.\n[41] Therefore the Panel finds that the objective evidence supports the claimant\u2019s allegations that he faces a risk to his life or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment from his agent of harm in Jordan.\n[42] In terms of State protection, all States are presumed to be capable of protecting their citizens except where the State is in a state of complete breakdown.\n[43] To rebut the presumption of State protection, the claimant has to prove clear and convincing evidence of the State\u2019s inability or unwillingness to put, to protect its citizens.\n[44] However, in certain circumstances it will be objectively unreasonable to expect claimants to do so.\n[45] Furthermore, protection available to claimants may not be adequate given their particular circumstances.\n[46] In this case, you testified that you did not report to the police the threats made against you because the authorities do not interfere in tribal related issues.\n[47] You further credibly explained that you could not rely on the police protection and that your loss of confidence in the police is further based on the fact that in Jordan, the State does not interfere in tribal related conflict and the police would do little to protect you.\n[48] Under Item 2.1 of the NDP, the US Department of State Country reports on human rights practices for 2020, it did indicate that although the law provides criminal penalties for officials inaction and corruption, the government does not implement the law effectively.\n[49] In fact, the NDP specifically states the tribal law permits the family or the tribe to whose honour has been violated to take revenge from the offender and the State does not interfere.\n[50] My review of the objective evidence states that the Jordanian police will stay out of tribal and family related issues.\n[51] The NDP Item 5.10 makes it clear that Jordan is a very tribal based society with strong tribal traditions and law in Jordan civil and criminal is not separate but intertwined with these tribal traditions.\n[52] It says that the authorities often believe family related disputes to the extended family and to the tribe to work out informally.\n[53] As such, I find on a balance of probabilities that the State will not be willing or that they will be unable to provide adequate protection to you if you return to Jordan.\n[54] Consequently, I am satisfied in this case that the presumption of State protection is rebutted on a balance of probabilities, State protection will not be available to you should you seek it again in Jordan.\n[55] With regard to internal flight alternative, I considered whether this would exist for you in Jordan. I must assess whether there is any location in Jordan in which you could, in which you would not face a serious possibility of risk to life or whether it would be reasonable for you to move there.\n[56] You testified that Jordan is a small country and since your fear is tribal and family with regard to revenge, killing issue, it will not be possible for you to seek safety internally because those seeking to harm you can locate you anywhere through their nationally spread tribal network and that the presence of the B-A-T-A-Y-N-E-H members in government institutions will assess them.\n[57] I do not find that you would have a viable internal flight alternative in any city of Jordan. I find that if you return to Jordan at some point, the agents of harm would learn where you are simply through family or travel connections.\n[58] From the totality of the evidence before me, I find that Jordan is not such a large populated country that you would be able to disappear into a crowd while still leaving a relatively normal life if you were to return there.\n[59] Therefore based on the evidence I find that it is unlikely you would be safe from your agents of harm in any proposed IFA.\n[60] Given the past actions of the agents of persecution the prevalence of tribal law and customs in Jordan I find that your agents of harm are motivated to find you anywhere in Jordan.\n[61] I find that you would face a serious risk to your life or risk of torture or unusual punishment or treatment if you were to relocate because your credible evidence supports that your agents of harm have the means and motivation to find you. I will not proceed to the second prong of reasonableness.\n[62] Accordingly, I find there is no viable internal flight alternative available to you in Jordan.\n[63] In conclusion, based on the evidence before me I find that you would face a serious possibility of risk to your life, a risk of torture and unusual treatment anywhere in Jordan without adequate State protection or viable internal flight alternative.\n[64] Therefore I find you to be a person in need of protection pursuant to Section 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act and I accept your claim.\n[65] INTERPRETER: Thank you Mr. Member. Thank you very much. I will be summarising everything you said and definitely when I receive also the decision I will go through it with the claimant so we are good and I think he understood some of the points already because he somehow understands part of English, not fully but at least partially he understands so thank you very much.\n[66] MEMBER: Yes. So I am going to just stop the recording and just I have a couple of words for the claimant.\n[67] INTERPRETER: I would translate.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

I have considered your testimony and the other evidence presented in this case, and I am ready to render my decision orally. The principal claimant, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX \u2014 her husband, the associated claimant, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. And their children, the minor claimants, XXXX XXXXandXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (sic) \u2014 are claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. The claimants all claim to be citizens of Venezuela. The principal claimant and minor claimants additionally claim to be citizens of Colombia. The principal claimant was appointed the designated representative for the minor claimants in this proceeding. And these claims were all heard jointly, pursuant to rule 55 of the RPD rules.\n[2] I find that the principal and associated claimant are Convention refugees, as they have established a serious possibility of persecution in Venezuela, based upon their political opinion. Specifically, due to their political support of opposition groups in Venezuela, a criminal gang affiliated with the ruling party, namely the Tren de Aragua have been targeting them. Given that the principal claimant has established that the reach of the Tren de Aragua group extends to Colombia. And that the Tren de Aragua group were previously able to target the claimants in Colombia. The Panel finds that she has further established that she faces a serious possibility of persecution in Colombia. The Panel further finds that the minor claimants have established that they would face a serious possibility of persecution in Colombia and Venezuela, based on their membership in a particular social group as family members of persons, who are being targeted by a criminal gang due to their political activism. The details of your claim are in your Basis of Claim form. And in your Basis of Claim form amendments. In short, you allege persecution from the Tren de Aragua group, in the form of attacks, kidnappings, and threats to you and your family \u2014 because you campaigned against Venezuela\u2019s ruling government.\n[3] In terms of identity, the claimants have established their personal identities as nationals of Venezuela, on a balance of probabilities based on their Venezuelan passports found at Exhibit 1. The principal claimant and minor claimants have additionally established their identities as nationals of Colombia, on a balance of probabilities, based on their Colombian passports found at Exhibit 1. The associated claimant\u2019s permanent residency in Colombia and exclusion under Article 1E \u2014 I have considered the associated claimant\u2019s permanent residence in Colombia, and whether he is excluded. The claimant\u2019s documents and testimony demonstrate that the associated claimant became a permanent resident of Colombia in XXXX of 2017. His permanent resident status expired after he entered Canada on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2021 and XXXX of 2022. Section E of Article 1 of the Refugee Convention \u2014 Article 1E states the following. \u201cThis Convention shall not apply to person who is recognized by the competent authorities of the country in which he has taken up residence as having the rights and obligations which are attached to the possession of nationality of that country.\u201d In Zeng, the Federal Court of Appeal established the following criteria to determine whether Article 1E applies. Considering all the relevant factors to the date of the hearing \u2014 does the claimant have status substantially similar to that of it\u2019s nationals in the third country? If the answer is \u2014 yes, the claimant is excluded. If the answer is \u2014 no, the next question is whether the claimant previously had such status and lost it, or had such access to status and failed to acquire it. If the answer is \u2014 no, the claimant is not excluded under Article 1E. If the answer is \u2014 yes, the RPD must consider and balance the various factors. These include but are not limited to, the reason for the loss of status \u2014 voluntary or involuntary, whether the claimant could return to the third country, the risk the claimant would face in the home country, Canada\u2019s international obligations, and any other relevant facts.\n[4] The National Documentary Package for Colombia at Item 3.7 indicates that, individuals who have permanent residency in Colombia are allowed to exercise any legal activity within the country. The claimants further testified that the associated claimant was able to freely live, work, and return to Colombia while he had permanent resident status there. The claimants testified that the \u2014 that permanent residents lose their status in Colombia after five (5) years. And that they cannot apply to renew their status, if they are out of that country. In the present case, the associated claimant indicated in his narrative and testified that he left Colombia on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2021. On a balance of probabilities, the Panel finds that the associated claimant\u2019s status expired in XXXX of 2022. And that he has lost his status. Nevertheless, the claimant can be excluded under Article 1E, even if he lost his status, after weighing the various factors in Zeng. I have considered the reasons for his loss of status and whether they are voluntary or involuntary. The claimant testified that he and his family left Colombia, because they were facing threats from the Tren de Aragua, the same group that targeted his family and kidnapped his wife in Venezuela. Given the risk analysis that is given in further detail below, the Panel finds that the associated claimant was forced to leave Colombia as he realized that he and his family cannot be safe in such an environment. In terms of his possibility of returning to Colombia, the claimant has been outside of Colombia for approximately a year. The National Documentary evidence is unclear regarding the expiry of permanent residency and possible return to Colombia. Questioned, the associated claimant testified that he could not return since his permanent status has expired in XXXX of 2022. And he would need to be in Colombia in order to renew his permanent resident status. The Panel funds on a balance of probabilities that the associated claimant left Colombia for legitimate reasons, and is unable to return to Colombia as a consequence. The claimant is not excluded from refugee protection pursuant to section E or Article 1 of the Refugee Convention.\n[5] With regard to credibility, I find you both to be very credible witnesses. And I believe what you have alleged in support of your claim. The principal claimant and associate claimant testified in a straightforward, natural, and unhesitating manner \u2014 and responded directly to all of the questions, I and Counsel asked about the central aspects of their claim. There were no inconsistencies between your testimony and the documents before me. Given that I have found you to be credible witnesses, I believe what you have alleged in support of your claim, including the following. The adult claimants were first targeted in Venezuela in 2014, when they joined in protest against the ruling government. As a result, they were identified as enemies of the regime, and started receiving a series of threatening phone calls. They moved from Miranda to Caracas in XXXX of 2015. In XXXX 2015, after the move, they were left a threatening note on their vehicle. They submitted a police report in regards to this incident, but they found that effective assistance was not forthcoming. They decided to move to Colombia, where they believe that they would be safe from their persecutors in the XXXX of 2015. The claimants lived safely in Colombia for a number of years. And decided that it would be safe for them to return to Venezuela, in order to renew their passports in XXXX of 2021, if they stayed there temporarily and cast a low profile. In XXXX XXXX XXXX 2021, while in Venezuela, the principal claimant was kidnapped by the Tren de Aragua, who demanded that a ransom be paid. She was rescued three (3) days later on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2021. And the claimants returned to Colombia, where they believed that they would be safe. On XXXX XXXX XXXX 2021 \u2014 in XXXX of 2021, the claimants started receiving a series of threatening phone calls and messages from the Tren de Aragua group when they were in Colombia. These messages identified what the \u2014\n[6] UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: Sorry to interject, Madam Chair, we cannot hear you. Nothing.\n[7] MEMBER: Hi. Can you hear me now?\n[8] UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: Correct. Yes.\n[9] MEMBER: So, have you not heard me this entire time?\n[10] UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: No, we heard you until \u2014 I would say, maybe 30 seconds ago.\n[11] MEMBER: Did you hear me talk about the documentary evidence?\n[12] UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: Yes.\n[13] MEMBER: Okay. So, I will just start there again. I note the extensive personal documentary evidence in Exhibit 7 and 9 \u2014 you presented. Which corroborate the central aspects of your claim. Specifically, you have provided copies of several reports that you made to authorities in Venezuela and in Colombia, that you testified, that assistance from the agencies that you contacted was not forthcoming. You submitted a medical report for the principal claimant, that was obtained after the kidnapping in Venezuela. You submitted letters of support from friends and family members in Colombia and in Venezuela, confirming the central aspects of your claim. You also provided copies of the threatening text messages that you received while you were in Colombia. The vast amount of disclosure in this case corroborate your testimony that you have been repeatedly and systematically targeted and threatened by the Tren de Aragua group in Colombia and in Venezuela. And that you would not be safe, if you were to return there. With regard to reavailment, I note that the principal claimant testified that the claimants returned to Venezuela after they fled to Colombia due to the threats to their lives. She testified that after the claimants moved to Colombia in the XXXX of 2015, they returned to Venezuela in XXXX of 2021 to renew the minor claimant and associated claimant\u2019s passports. The principal claimant was kidnapped during that trip, and they have no returned to Venezuela to date. The Panel finds that the claimants\u2019 return to Venezuela despite their history of being targeted there is inconsistent with fear of persecution at the hands of the Tren de Aragua gang. The Panel therefore draws a negative inference, but ultimately finds that the concerns of reavailment and lack of suggestive fear are outweighed by the other credible evidence in this case.\n[14] I considered whether there is a nexus to a Convention ground. In order to the find the claimants to be Convention refugees, I must find that the fear that the claimants face is based on one (1) of the five (5) Convention grounds. In this case, the principal claimant and associated claimant based their fear on their support for and propagation of anti-government opinions, including the Leopoldo Lopez opposition party in Venezuela. I find the principal and associated claimant have demonstrated that there is a nexus to a Convention ground, that is political opinion. I also find that the minor claimants would face persecution in Venezuela and Colombia based on their familial relationship to the adult claimants for being targeted because of their political activities.\n[15] I have examined your risk in Venezuela. The documentary evidence contained at Exhibit 6, as well as those provided by Counsel at Exhibit 7 and 10 confirm the objective risk that you face in Venezuela. In summary, according to the NDP at Item 2.4, Venezuela\u2019s democratic institutions have deteriorated since 1999. However, political conditions in the country have grown sharply worse in recent years due to harsher crackdowns on opposition, as well as the ruling party relying on widely condemned elections to control all government branches. The authorities have closed off virtually all channels for political dissent. Political opposition to Maduro is simply not allowed in Venezuela. Anyone who is an opponent, perceived to be an opponent, are perceived to support opponents or critics of the government \u2014 faces a serious risk of egregious abuse. Including arbitrary detention, torture, and physical violence by the hands of the government \u2014 including paramilitary groups called Colectivos. As well as extra judicial killings and deaths. And this is at Items 2.1 and 2.3. Which indicate that this risk extends to family members or perceived opponents. Item 4.6 also states that the armed Colectivos are groups who are politically loyal to the government, and active political enforcers. Evidence suggests that they have access to radio communications, and that they liaison with security forces. While the government has tried to keep it\u2019s links with the Colectivos, a secret \u2014 there is a large (inaudible) body of evidence, that they are not just spontaneous groups that emerged to support the government. For example, it appears that they receive benefits such as motorcycles and clothing from the government. And one source stated that they clear act in concert with security forces. Items 1.6, 1.7, 7.7, and 7.6 note that criminal organizations are involved in robberies, kidnapping, fraud, extorting, contract killing, illegal trafficking. Sources use different terms for these organizations \u2014 one of which is the Megaband (sic), of which the Tren de Aragua is considered to be. It is regarded as the largest Megaband in Venezuela, and it has branches in at least seven (7) states. It has also gone international, and to expand it\u2019s frequently established alliances with criminal actors in other states. Item 1.6, that the El Tren de Aragua is a transnational criminal band based in (inaudible) which with a presence in Colombia, Brazil, and Peru. It engages in the trafficking of women for sexual exploitation from Venezuela into Colombia, by offering false job opportunities, and controls irregular border crossings with the Colombian municipality at Villa del Rosario. In reviewing the country evidence, I find the claimants\u2019 fear of persecution in Venezuela to be objectively well-founded.\n[16] I have considered the issues of state protection, and whether there is an internal flight alternative or IFA in Venezuela. States are presumed to be capable of protecting their citizens, except in situations where the country is in a state of complete breakdown. To rebut the presumption of state protection, a claimant must provide clear and convincing evidence of the state\u2019s inability to protect it\u2019s citizens. Item 2.1 of the NDP for Venezuela states that, there is pervasive correction and impunity among all the Maduro regime, along security forces in Venezuela and in other national and state regime offices, including at the highest levels. Item 4.5, specifically, cites sources who state that, there is no rule of law in Venezuela. There is no recourse, apart from at an international level. And the government has made clear that international courts have no jurisdiction in Venezuela. I find that any protection from the Tren de Aragua would be informal, and that protection is unlikely to be forthcoming in any event, given the corruption I just cited, and evidence about the integration of the illegal groups with the government itself. And that \u2014 and also that you provided evidence of numerous attempts that you made to seek help from authorities in Venezuela, which was not forthcoming.\n[17] I am also required to consider whether there an internal flight alternative for you in Venezuela. In making that determination, I have considered all of the evidence before me, including the fact that the Tren de Aragua recognized you even after your previous seven (7) year absence from Venezuela, where they kidnapped the principal claimant. I also considered the objective evidence in the National Documentation Package at Item 4.16. It stated that the Colectivos reportedly control vast territories across Venezuela, financing (inaudible) by extortion, black market, food, and parts of the drug trade \u2014 as the government turns a blind eye in exchange for loyalty. I have also considered the reports of increasing links between the government and organized criminal groups \u2014 such as through the drug trade. And I find that those links suggest the kind of access to networks, that would be necessary to facilitate such trade and to attract people. Item 3.2 states that \u2014 in fact, the Venezuelan government is very much capable of tracking it\u2019s citizens through the Homeland Card, which it uses to track individual\u2019s voting records, and political memberships, family information, employment, and income, medical history, use of social programs \u2014 like subsidized food, and other personal behavioral data. All of which is stored in the Fatherland database. The evidence also suggests that individuals are being left now with no choice, but to obtain a Homeland Card. Since without one (1), it has become impossible to obtain subsidized food and gas. And there are reports of individuals being forced to obtain the card \u2014 implies that the card is used as a mechanism of social control. So, considering all of the above, I find that you have established that the agent of persecution has both the means and motivation to continue targeting you throughout Venezuela. Accordingly, I find on a balance of probabilities that there is no internal flight alternative available to you in Venezuela.\n[18] Given that the principal and minor claimants are citizens of Colombia, I have also assessed their risk in Colombia. The documentary evidence contained at Exhibit 3 and 6, as well as those provided by Counsel at Exhibit 7 and 10 \u2014 confirm the objective risk you face in Colombia. At Item 1.6 of the NDP for Venezuela, it states that the El Tren de Aragua made inroads into Colombia with the support of the Clan del Golfo. Although, it cooperates with Los Rastrojos for the commission of crimes. Item 4.4 of the Colombian NDP, Exhibit 3, states that \u2014 \u201cAlthough the ELN has faced some competition from Sindicatos, it has cooperated with Venezuelan Colectivos for the paramilitary groups that support Maduro\u2019s regime. The ELN and members of Colectivos have engaged in militant operations together, such as their attack on a demonstration posting self-declared president Juan Guaido in January of 2019.\u201d I additionally found the documents provided by Counsel at Exhibit 7 and 10 to be very probative in evidencing the reach of the Tren de Aragua group into and throughout Colombia. At Exhibit 7, the InSight Crime Report dated October 21st, 2021 states that Venezuelan security forces have warned of the Tren de Araguas presence in the Tachira state, which shares a border with Colombia. InSight Crime field investigations in this region have confirmed that the Tren de Aragua members are not permanently based in Tachira. They travel through the state to reach Colombia. At Exhibit 10, a report dated July 2022 from (inaudible) indicates that the Tren de Aragua operates in Colombia, and that their activities there \u2014 include kidnappings, homicides, human trafficking, exploitation, sexual exploitation, drug trafficking, and illegal mining. Other sources within that Exhibit confirm that the Tren de Aragua has a presence in Colombia \u2014 in places including Medellin and Bogota. In reviewing the country evidence, I find that the claimants\u2019 fear of persecution in Colombia to be objectively well-founded.\n[19] In terms of state protection and an IFA in Colombia, I find that adequate state protection would not be available to you, were you to seek it in Colombia. As per Exhibit 3 at Item 1.6, the objective documentation sets out that, although the government has made considerable efforts to enhance protection for victims. The ability of the government to provide protection is highly limited, due to the lack of presidents and capacity. As well as sometimes issues of corruption and complicity by local and regional authorities. Despite the government\u2019s strategy to combat (inaudible) and the arresting conventions that have occurred, the violations committed by these groups have not been significantly reduced. And their structure to seek control over illegal activities remains intact. This information together with the claimants\u2019 own experiences of trying to report to the Colombian police, while failing to receive effective assistance \u2014 following the Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s decision in Ward, is clear and convincing evidence sufficient to rebut the presumption that they will not be able to access adequate state protection if they returned to Colombia.\n[20] I have also considered whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for the claimants anywhere in Colombia. And I find that none exists. The objective country evidence cited above demonstrates that the Tren de Araguas have ties to the Gulf Clan, which has a presence throughout the country. The national reach of the Gulf Clan is documented in the NDP at Item 7.15. Which indicates that other persons in Colombia have been tracked down by the Gulf Clan, after fleeing to various parts of the country. I also note that the claimants have demonstrated with credible evidence that their prosecutors were previously able to find them in Colombia, after they left Venezuela. For all of these reasons, I find that the claimants have no viable internal flight alternative in Colombia.\n[21] So, for all of these reasons, I accept that you are refugees under section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. And so that is my decision, and you will be getting a copy in the mail. So, you can have that translated.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

You also fear not to be able to practise your religion freely in Iran.\n[5] As I mentioned, I have no issue with your personal identity. I have that your identities as citizens of Iran was established based on your testimony and supporting documents. You have provided birth certificates, ID cards, and Iranian passports including Canadian visas.\n[6] Now with regards to credibility.\n[7] Based on the low refugee threshold, on the balance of probabilities, I find that you have converted to Christianity, whatever the reason you have, you did that.\n[8] You testified that you found peace in your new religion. And you grew up not being able to choose a religion, and now you feel free to choose the religion of Christianity, which is more tolerant than the Islamic religion. And you found your path. And you converted here in Canada, and you are still learning about your new faith, and you are afraid to return to Iran and not be able to practise and know more about your new religion.\n[9] I made my determination in a forward-looking determination. XXXX, you have no subjective fear because you only started to practise your religion here in Canada. You also mentioned that the authorities may know about your conversion, and you also participated in some demonstrations against the government of Iran.\n[10] However, as I told you at the beginning, I\u2019m going to concentrate on your religion and just to the fact that you would feel constricted and not be able to practise your religion freely is against human right and the freedom to practise your own religion in total freedom. And because of that, if you do that you may be persecuted by the government of Iran.\n[11] And that\u2019s enough to satisfy me, on the balance of probabilities, that you have a well-founded fear of persecution.\n[12] This fear is objectively well founded by the objective evidence that we have on file.\n[13] It shows that Muslim born in Iran who convert to any other religion can be considered as apostates, which is a criminal offence in Iran. And that the government of Iran would not recognize you as a Christian under the law, even if Christianity and Judaism and Zoroastrianism, are recognized religions in Iran.\n[14] So, there is a risk that you may be charged with apostasy or based on the evidence, Christian converts can also be charged as being against the government because they are considered as a threat to the government, and they can be charged as acting against national security or propagating what they call Zionist Christianity.\n[15] I have also looked at state protection and the internal flight alternative. And because the State may be the agent of persecution if you are found out to have converted, you have rebutted the presumption of state protection.\n[16] And with regard to internal flight alternative, based on the evidence, I find that there is nowhere in Iran where you can go and practise your religion freely without the fear of being arrested and detained by the Iranian authorities.\n[17] Therefore, I find there is no viable internal flight alternative available for you in Iran.\n[18] To conclude, and based on the totality of the evidence, I find that you are Convention refugee, and accordingly I accept your claim.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

Rose\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Seyfi Sun\nCountry: China\nRPD Number: TC1-19558\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2022-01960\nATIP Pages: N\/A\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: All right, so this is the decision for XXXX XXXX, the principal claimant file number is TC1-19558. I\u2019ve had the opportunity today to hear your testimony and consider the other evidence in this case and so I am ready to render my decision orally.\n[2] Now you are claiming to be a citizen of China and claiming refugee protection pursuant to Sections 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act and today I do find that you are a Convention refugee for the following reasons.\n[3] In terms of the full allegations, now those are set out in your Basis of Claim form but to briefly summarize, you allege a fear of persecution in China as a result of your religion. So since coming to Canada you have become a Christian and you fear persecution and you would be unable to practice your religion if you went back to China.\n[4] Now your personal identity as a citizen of China has been established both by the testimony and the supporting documents and that includes a copy of your passport which is found in Exhibit 1. So I do find on a balance of probabilities that identity and country of reference have been established.\n[5] Now considering all of the evidence I had in taking into account your particular circumstances I did find that you were a credible witness and I accept your testimony. Significantly there were no inconsistencies, omissions or contradictions between your testimony and the other evidence that I have before me including your Basis of Claim form.\n[6] You testified today about how you became involved with the Living Stone Church here in Canada, so you only came to Christianity after you had arrived in Canada and after the birth of your son. What I found particularly compelling however was your spontaneous and detailed responses to questions that I asked about your religious beliefs, for example you were able to expand upon the miracles that you studied in the Bible and also you spoke about how your religion has impacted you, how it has affected your life and why you would not be able to practice your faith freely in China.\n[7] Now I do note that there was a significant delay in making the claim, so you were without status in Canada for quite a number of years but when I take into account your particular circumstances as well as your explanation I do not find that that is determinative in this case.\n[8] So as I mentioned it was only after coming to Canada that you became Christian, so that was one factor but furthermore that you were very young, you come to Canada to study as you were in a strange country all of a sudden cut off from your family and with a newborn child to care for, so I do accept your explanation about essentially being overwhelmed and not wanting to deal with that decision and then you spoke candidly about you know what led to the decision to actually make the claim last year. So you spoke about wanting you know your son to have more opportunities so I do find that you\u2019ve provided a reasonable explanation for the delay in making this claim.\n[9] Now in addition to your testimony which I said I had no reason to doubt, you\u2019ve also provided a number of relevant and prohibitive documents and those do include a letter from your mother and from your friend here in Canada corroborating aspects of your Basis of Claim form as was the letter from the Living Stone Assembly Church and the baptism certificate and photographs from the baptism ceremony. So I do find that all these documents are relevant and serve to corroborate the core allegation that you have become Christian.\n[10] So I do find on a balance of probabilities that you are a genuine believer in Christianity and you have established a subjective fear of return to China. I do find that there is a link between what you fear and one (1) of the five (5) Convention grounds, in your case that is your religion.\n[11] In looking at the country condition documents for China the documentation in the National Documentation Package makes it very clear that religious persecution of Christians in China is not getting better, in fact it\u2019s getting much worse and the Communist Party of China is tightening things up and making it yet even more restrictive so that people don\u2019t have the right to exercise religious freedoms. For example in Item 2.9 of the NDP it notes that religious groups in China register with the government, those registration requirements are very restrictive, it serves to limit the growth of religious groups and the right to freedom of religion, assembly and association. Items 12.3 and 12.8 note that while there has been a variation in enforcement of religious restrictions across different provinces, the NDP reports that there has been a significant shift in China\u2019s approach to religion which has led to an increase in religious persecution throughout China.\n[12] Item 12.8 of the NDP indicates that according to the CFR in reaction to what is described as a surge in Christianity in China, adherents of the Christian religion have faced ongoing persecution in recent years. While house and underground churches traditionally face the brunt of persecution, under the president\u2019s leadership state sanctioned churches have also been targeted. The increase in religious regulations and control has led to oversight of online discussions, installation of surveillance cameras in churches, collection of data on house churches and their members, increased interrogations and fines of religious practitioners, demolition of churches and religious symbols, restrictions on the establishment and operation of religious schools and on the printing of Bibles.\n[13] Item 12.26 of the NDP notes that under new regulations religious personnel appointed at state sanctioned churches are required to make public pledges of loyalty to the communist ideology and party leaders and in some areas the president\u2019s portrait is placed in the church, requirement is for congregations in the state sanctioned churches to sing the national anthem before worship, so that\u2019s consistent with what you\u2019ve learned about the state sanctioned Christianity in China.\n[14] So overall the objective evidence is consistent with what your testimony and what you have alleged. So it was clear from your testimony that your religion is important to you and as you would continue to practice and would not be attending a state sanctioned church if you return to China that would put you at risk given the tightening of the government controls over religious practices.\n[15] So I do find that the country condition evidence regarding the treatment of Christians lead me to find that your fear has an objective basis and is well-founded.\n[16] Looking at the issue of state protection and Internal Flight Alternative, as the state in this case is essentially the agent of persecution I do not find that state protection would be available for you and furthermore there would be nowhere else in China that you could safely reside so there would be no Internal Flight Alternative available for you.\n[17] So based on all of this evidence I do find you to be a Convention refugee and your claim is therefore accepted.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

You are seeking refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[3] I have found that your evidence demonstrates that you are a Convention refugee on the basis of your religion as a Kurdish follower of the Yaresan religion, which is also known as the Ahl-e Haqq religion.\n[4] The allegations you provided in detail in your Basis of Claim form and the amendments, which are at Exhibits 2 and 6.\n[5] To summarize, you allege fear of persecution from the Iranian government, members of the Iranian society, as a follower of the Yaresan religion.\n[6] I have found that you\u2019ve established your identity, your personal identity and identity as a citizen of Iran, through your testimony and the copies of your passports, which can be found at Exhibit 1.\n[7] You also have provided other identity documents.\n[8] I found that you were a very credible witness. I therefore believe all that you alleged in support of your claim. I found that you have testified in a very straightforward manner. There were no material inconsistencies in your testimony, or contradictions between your testimony and the other evidence before me, or the allegations made in your Basis of Claim form.\n[9] You provided spontaneous and detailed testimony regarding your religious adherence and the Yaresan faith. You were knowledgeable about the ceremonies and observances of the religion. You were able to describe them fully to me. You were also able to explain that you have continued with the practice of your Yaresan faith, and explained your beliefs and why these beliefs remain very important to you.\n[10] You explained how you connect to others who practise the Yaresan faith, through Instagram or Telegram, through friends that you\u2019ve met in Canada, and that you also connect with your family in Iran when they are practising what you called Nazr, which you described as very important part of your religious practice.\n[11] You submitted letters from your father and sister, explaining the family\u2019s adherence to your Yaresan faith, and how they\u2019ve had to keep that religious faith secret. You also submitted photos to explain or showing your father, your mother, and your sisters in your home. You describe the photos that we could see on the wall as being the leader of the Yaresan religion, and one (1) of the students of that leader. You explained the significance of the items that were on the table in the same room, between both your parents and your sisters.\n[12] You also had some photographs showing the places of religious practice that you and your family attend, you had attended, in your small city of XXXX. And also, you showed members of your family and community in a Nazr practice.\n[13] In addition, you had a letter from the XXXX Department of the Iranian government, that you explained was given to employers when there were new laws that all employers, even those who would be considered to be private employers, had to investigate employees\u2019 backgrounds and, in particular, to investigate their religion. You explained how, your employer at a private school, had to do this background check on you, and that they had to, as you described, pull some strings to allow you to continue to work, even though you did not practise the Islamic religion.\n[14] You have provided letters from members of the Yari community here in Canada, who said that you met someone in Vancouver with whom you have been practising your Yaresan religion.\n[15] You also submitted some social media pages belonging to you, showing that you follow various Yaresan groups, and that you connect through these channels when there are live Yaresan events. And you also have some items showing that you\u2019ve posted on your own social media pages, and all of these would indicate that you are affiliated with the Yaresan religion and community.\n[16] I accept, on a balance of probabilities, that you are practitioner of the Yaresan Ahl-e Haqq faith.\n[17] You testified about your experiences as a follower of the Yaresan religion while you were in living in Iran. And how the persecution and discrimination that you experienced while living there. I find that the country condition documents that I have in the National Documentation Package for Iran corroborate your allegations and establish that there is an objective basis to your claim.\n[18] I find that this National Documentation Package and the objective evidence confirms your testimony that you cannot openly practise your faith in Iran without facing serious possibility of persecution.\n[19] Persons who follow the Yaresan faith must practise secretly, otherwise they are denied access to education, jobs, housing, and other basic rights in Iran. You testified about your experience as a teacher and how it took longer for you to secure employment because of the background check the founder of the school had to do on you. And that this person had to pull some strings in order to allow you to work in that school. You also explained how, because of your religion and the fact that your religion would be discovered, you could never get a government job.\n[20] According to the information that I have in the National Documentation Package for Iran, there are reports of people who are openly practising their Yaresan faith, and are activists in that community, who have been arrested and detained.\n[21] According to the Danish Immigration Service report on Yaris, which is at the National Documentation Package Item 12.16, it notes that the Iranian government has sought and actively repressed the spread of the Yaresan religion, claiming that the teachers and active practitioners are acting against the national security, and guilty of corruption on Earth.\n[22] The US Department of State\u2019s International Religious Freedom report for 2019 indicates that according to NGO reports, Yaresan followers continue to be subjected to frequent arrest, detentions, harassment, and surveillance.\n[23] In correspondence with the Research Directorate, a representative from the Human Rights Activist News Agency stated there have been multiple reports of arrest and prison terms given to Yaresan practitioners. It\u2019s stated at Item 12.16 of the NDP, that generally, the level of persecution of Yaresan followers depends on their level of activity, and how open and visible their activity is. International reports state that Yaresan followers have been arrested at different times and places, on charges including insulting the sacred, corruption of the Earth, blasphemy, obtaining illicit wealth, and interference in medical affairs. And have received sentences ranging from two (2) to five (5) years imprisonment.\n[24] One (1) report, in Item 12.1 of the NDP, indicates that Yaresan practitioners have been executed. The US International Religious Freedom Report for 2019 indicates that authorities arrested a Yaresan practitioner and sentenced them to five (5) years in prison for acting against national security. Sources report that another practitioner was sentenced to 13 years in prison, and received 74 lashes.\n[25] The BBC\u2019s monitoring March 2022 monthly human rights report on Iran indicates that the Yaresan practitioners were sentenced for charges including propaganda against the establishment and acting against national security for the administration of the so-called illegal Yaresan channel.\n[26] So, this corroborates all of your allegations, that you and your family\u2019s adherence has had to be secret. You never disclosed your religion to anybody, presented yourself as a Shi\u2019a Muslim to protect yourself in Iran. You were able to obtain an education and a profession, but only because you made efforts to conceal your religion. A letter from a long-time friend indicates that they were not aware of your religion, until recently when you told them after coming here to Canada.\n[27] The US Commission for International Religious Freedoms at Item 12.2 of the NDP states that members of the Yaresan community face discrimination in education, employment, and running for political office throughout the country.\n[28] The NDP also confirms that Yaresani men, recognized by their particular moustaches, continue to face employment discrimination and Shi\u2019a preachers continue to encourage social discrimination against the Yaresanis.\n[29] So having taken into account the objective evidence, together with your consistent and credible testimony, which is supported by your documents that you have provided, I find that your fear of persecution in Iran is well founded.\n[30] Given the evidence before me, both personal and objective, I find you face a serious possibility of persecution in Iran if you were to return for these reasons that I have all set out.\n[31] As one (1) of the potential agents of persecution is the State, I find that it would not be reasonable for you to seek state protection in Iran should you experience this persecution.\n[32] As the laws and conditions that are described in the National Documentation Package are applicable throughout the entire country, I find that you would face a serious possibility of persecution every part of Iran. And therefore, there would be no viable internal flight alternative available to you.\n[33] So, for all these reasons, I find that you are a Convention refugee, and I accept your claim.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

The claimants allege a fear of persecution at the hands of the Iranian government because of the conversion of the claimants from Islam to Christianity.\nDECISION\n[4] The panel finds that the principal and associate claimants have established that they face a serious possibility of persecution because of their conversion from Islam to Christianity if they return to Iran, that\u2019s all four adult claimants. The claimants are therefore Convention refugees pursuant to Section 96 of IRPA. The minor claimant is also a Convention refugee as part of a family of members who have been found to be Convention refugees.\nIDENTITY\n[5] On a balance of probabilities, the claimants established they are citizens of Iran based on the copies of the claimants\u2019 passports in Exhibit 1.\nCREDIBILITY\n[6] Based on the documents in the file including the principal claimant\u2019s Basis of Claim narrative and the narrative of her sister and the testimony today, the panel has noted no serious credibility issues.\n[7] On a balance of probabilities, the panel finds the following allegations to be true. The adult claimants do not support the strict rules and regulations imposed by the Islamic theocratic regime. The principal claimant and her sister grew up in an open-minded family who objected to the government enforced religion and especially the oppression of women. Two of their sisters left Iran and one settled in Canada and the other in the United States. The principal claimant began to explore Christianity with an Armenian Christian co-worker and was fired from her job after management found some notes about Christianity at her desk. She then started a XXXX XXXX and had to navigate around the Basij to ensure adequate compliance with Islamic norms imposed by the state. The principal claimant and her husband visited Canada in 2018 and 2019 and were able to attend church regularly and learn about Christianity in greater depth. The principal claimant was held for questioning about her trip to Canada and her religious beliefs by the Talat (ph) at the airport when she returned in 2020. Both claimants were under surveillance.\n[8] On XXXX XXXX XXXX 2021, the claimants received a summons to appear in court on XXXX XXXX. At that point, they decided the only option was to flee Iran and they returned to Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2021 and submitted their claims for refugee protection. In the meantime, the principal claimant\u2019s sister and her husband also explored Christianity and were strong opponents of the Iranian theocracy. They had regular run-ins with authorities for non-compliance with Islamic norms imposed by the state. The claimants joined the principal claimant\u2019s family in Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2021.\n[9] All of the adult claimants have concluded they prefer the peace, humanity, and inclusiveness of Christianity to the harsh doctrine and rules and regulations of the Islam imposed by the Iranian theocracy. Since arriving in Canada, they have all attended the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and are active members of the congregation. They were all baptized on XXXX XXXX, 2022.\n[10] The claimants fear returning to Iran because of the serious penalties imposed on converts by the Iranian theocracy. They have already been targeted by Iranian authorities. The panel finds that the evidence with respect to the claimants\u2019 conversion to Christianity was internally consistent and plausible. There are no contradictions or omissions that go to the core of the claim.\n[11] The allegations were supported by personal documents that the panel finds credible in Exhibits 5, 6, and 7. Exhibits 5 and 7 include the letters from the senior pastor of the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX confirming the claimants\u2019 commitment to Christianity and active membership in the church since XXXX 2021. Exhibit 6 includes the four baptism certificates. The panel accepts the evidence as establishing on a balance of probabilities the claimant\u2019s subjective fear of persecution because of their conversion to Christianity.\n[12] So, turning now briefly to the objective basis. The panel has reviewed the April 29th, 2002 National Documentation Package for Iran which is Exhibit 3. It contains a substantial amount of objective documentary evidence on religious persecution in Iran.\n[13] Item 2.1 is the U.S. Department of State 2021 Human Rights Report indicates the Government of Iran imposes severe restrictions on the freedom of religion. Iranian law prohibits citizens from converting from Islam to another religion. Christians who converted from Islam experienced disproportionate levels of arrest, detention, and high levels of harassment and surveillance and many converts practice their religion in secret. Severe violations such as prolonged detention, torture, and executions targeting some Christian converts continue.\n[14] There is also a useful overview in item 12.15 which is the UK Home Office Country Policy Report on both Iranian Christians and Christian converts which is in early 2020 and also other, many other documents going into more detail about the crime of apostacy and the provisions of Sharia law and the application, and so forth.\n[15] Then there is item 12.2 which is the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom 2021 Annual Report on Iran in which the USCRIF recommends that the U.S. Government continue to redesignate Iran as a country of particular concern for engaging in systematic ongoing and egregious violations of religious freedom as defined in the International Religious Freedom Act.\n[16] Item 12.2 also notes this year that Iran has escalated its persecution of Christians in 2020, particularly converts from Islam and it provides some details to support that statement.\n[17] So the panel finds that the claimant\u2019s subjective fear of returning to Iran because of their conversion to Christianity is well founded based on the totality of the objective documentary evidence before the panel.\nSTATE PROTECTION\n18] As the agent of persecution is the Government of Iran, the panel finds that it would be objectively unreasonable for the claimants to seek the protection of the Iranian government. Therefore the panel finds the claimants have rebutted the presumption of state protection with clear and convincing evidence.\nINTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE\n[19] The panel finds that the objective evidence establishes that authorities operate similarly throughout Iran and the claimants face a serious possibility of persecution throughout Iran because of their religion and therefore no viable Internal Flight Alternative is available.\nCONCLUSION\n[20] The panel finds that the principal and associate claimants or persons have established that they face a serious possibility of persecution because of their conversion from Islam to Christianity if they return to Iran. The claimants are therefore Convention refugees pursuant to Section 96 of the IRPA and the minor claimant is also a Convention refugee as part of a family of members who have been found to be Convention refugees. Their claims are accepted.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

Mary Akhbari\nCountry: Bahamas\nRPD Number: TC2-00480\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2022-01960\nATIP Pages: N\/A\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: All right. So we are just back from a break, and I am going to read the decision for TC2-00480. I have considered your testimony and the other evidence in the case, and I am ready to render my decision orally. These are the reasons for the decision in the claim of XXXX XXXX XXXX, who claims to be a citizen of Bahamas and is claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. In rendering my reasons, I have considered the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9, proceedings before the IRB involving sexual orientation and gender identity and expression.\n[2] Your allegations are fully set out in the Basis of Claim. In summary, you fear persecution at the hands of society due to your sexual orientation and your XXXX status. For the following reasons, I find that you are a refugee pursuant to section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. I find that your identity as a national of Bahamas is established by submission of your passport and other identity documents. I further find that your identity as a gay man is established by your credible testimony given here today. I find you to be a credible witness and therefore believe what you alleged in support of your claim. There were no relevant inconsistencies in your testimony or contradictions between your testimony and the other evidence before me.\n[3] You testified in a straightforward, genuine and spontaneous manner about your sexual orientation and the issues that you faced throughout your life in the Bahamas. You also spoke of living your best life in Canada and the process of healing from past trauma. In particular, the following evidence establishes your allegations as set out above: multiple letters of support from family, friends and former partners substantiating your sexual orientation, your past relationships and the issues that you faced in Bahamas; a letter of support from your current partner; photographs of you in both in Bahamas and Canada with friends and former and current partner; your Grindr profile; medical documents substantiating your XXXX diagnosis; and documents substantiating your involvement with XXXX in Toronto.\n[4] After reviewing the documents, I have no reason to doubt their authenticity. Given that there are no serious credibility issues with respect to your allegations, coupled with the documentary evidence set out below, I find that you have established a prospective risk of harassment and discrimination amounting to persecution and the risk of physical violence in Bahamas. The risk is corroborated by the following documents: 6.1 indicates that the Bahamas shares the same strong anti-gay attitudes as the rest of the British Caribbean, and that homophobia is permeated through cultural attitudes and expressed in religion, music, and other expressions. Sources indicate that sexual minorities face stigmatization, noting that the Prime Minister of the Bahamas conceded that significant stigma against homosexuality persists in the Bahamas.\n[5] Consistent with your experience, the report notes that it is culturally acceptable to exert physical violence against those who betray gender norms, and LGBTQ people live in fear that if they are open about their sexual orientation, they will be subject to ostracism, exclusion, ridicule, and possibly violence. 2.1 indicates that LGBTI individuals face social stigma and discrimination, and did not believe that they were adequately protected by law enforcement authorities. At 6.1, several sources note that the constitution does not provide protection against discrimination based on sexual orientation.\n[6] LGBT people in the Bahamas report experiencing discrimination in employment, education, and housing, and that there is no legal framework to protect LGBT people from that discrimination. LGBT persons are in many instances subjected to psychological, spiritual, and physical violence at the hands of their parents, guardians, teachers and peers. The documents further indicate that LGBT people in the Bahamas have been subject to violence including killings. There have been a number of killings of, and physical attacks against, LGBT people since 2009. Based upon the foregoing, I find that you have a well-founded fear of persecution in Bahamas.\n[7] I have examined your claim under section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, as I conclude that the risk you describe constitutes persecution based on at least one (1) of the grounds prescribed in section 96 \u2014 specifically, your membership in a particular social group, namely gay men. I find that there is clear and convincing evidence before me that the state is unable \u2014 or unwilling, rather \u2014 to provide you with adequate protection.\n[8] The objective evidence indicates that Bahamian authorities have not developed policies and programs to counteract homophobia, and while the Bahamas may appear progressive in comparison to some other Caribbean countries, in practice there are significant reports of unequal access to recourse to the law for sexual minorities. It is also reported that LGBT people experience difficulties if they turn to the police for protection, noting that the police smirk, ridicule, and insult LGBT people if they are open about their sexual orientation. I have also examined whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for you. Based on the evidence on file, I find that you face a serious possibility of persecution throughout Bahamas. The Bahamas is geographically small, and the documents indicate that homophobic attitudes permeate the country. In light of the preceding, I conclude that you are a refugee pursuant to section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, and accordingly, I accept your claim. And we are concluded.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

Hamilton\nCountry: Sri Lanka\nRPD Number: TC2-01790\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2022-01960\nATIP Pages: N\/A\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: This is the decision in the claim of XXXX XXXX XXXX, a citizen Sri Lanka who seeks refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. This decision is being rendered from the bench. I find XXXX XXXX XXXX, to be a Convention refugee because he faces a serious possibility of persecution due to his imputed political opinion.\n[2] According to your Basis of Claim form, you are a Tamil who lived in the north region of Sri Lanka and you fear persecution at the hands of the Sri Lankan authorities because you chose not to act as an informant for them on the LTTE. You stated that you fled Sri Lanka on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2019, and arrived in Canada on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2019. You fear that if you were to return to Sri Lanka, you would face persecution by Sri Lankan authorities and you would not be able to live safely in Sri Lanka.\n[3] The Panel notes that the Board invited the Minister to intervene on the basis of integrity issues as stipulated by rule 27 on May 2nd, 2022. The Board highlighted that the claimant did not present any identity documents at the port of entry and that he stated that he lost his passport in the jungle and that he could not remember his flight details and transit dates. The Panel notes that the Minister has not intervene on this refugee claim. The claimant adduced into evidence an uncertified photocopy of the first page of his passport and an uncertified copy of his birth certificate. The claimant testified that he used his genuine passport to exit Sri Lanka but did not have it with him when he arrived in Canada because while he was traveling through the jungle in Panama the smuggler took his passport. He further testified to have taken a photocopy of his passport, including his name and photograph, prior to exiting Sri Lanka. The Panel notes that the claimant credibly testified on the names of his father and mother and their respective birth dates as they are stipulated on his birth certificate. The claimant also submitted his original driver\u2019s licence and a copy of his national ID card. The identified information on these documents matches the information on the passport and birth certificate. The personal and national identity of the claimant as a national of Sri Lanka has been established on a balance of probabilities by an uncertified copy of his passport, an uncertified copy of his birth certificate, his driver\u2019s licence, and national ID card, which are found at Exhibit 5.\n[4] I find there is a nexus to the Convention ground, namely political opinion. Accordingly, the claim is being assessed under section 96. I note there were no material inconsistencies, omissions or contradictions between your testimony and other evidence in this claim. I find that you provided credible and spontaneous testimony and were able to clearly explain why the Sri Lankan authorities are interested in you. I find that your first interaction with the Sri Lankan authorities occurred in XXXX 2016. You testified that you worked as a XXXX and would XXXX XXXX to different villages and sites. You testified that the army stopped you in XXXX as you were working and inquired why you had XXXX XXXX to this area and if you are knew of the rift between Tamil and Sinhalese in this area.\n[5] I find that your second interaction with the Sri Lankan authorities occurred on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018. You testified that you attended a demonstration regarding the release of Tamil youths that were detained by the army after the war. You testified that you attended this demonstration to accompany your friend\u2019s mother and that this friend had disappeared during the war. I note the support letter provided by your friend\u2019s mother that you adduced into evidence corroborates your testimony regarding the demonstration on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018, and that the army visited your home on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018.\n[6] I find that your third interaction with Sri Lankan authorities occurred in XXXX 2019. You testified that authorities came to your home and told you that you had to help them by getting the names of those who are involved with reviving the LTTE. You testified that the authorities knew you would be taking people for a memorial event on XXXX XXXX, 2019, as you had taken people in the past. You testified that they wanted you to get information when you got to the memorial service. You provide examples of these types of \u2014 you provided examples of the types of information they wanted, such as which individuals were speaking on the microphone and if any Tamils were attending from foreign countries. You further shared that they wanted you to get the addresses of these people. You testified that two (2) army officers return to your home in XXXX 2019 to confirm if you are ready to carry out this plan. You testified that they threatened you and said that they would arrest you under the Terrorism Act if you did not help them. I found your testimony credible and that you provided (inaudible) details in your testimony. I find on a balance of probabilities that since you did not carry out these tasks dictated by the army officials, the state authorities would consider you a political dissident and a supporter of the LTTE. The Panel notes that the claimant also testified credibly on how his father and uncle have been persecuted by Sri Lankan authorities in the past for their perceived affiliation to the LTTE.\n[7] I note the corroborating documents you provided: a witness statement from your father, a support letter from your friend\u2019s mother, and a letter from the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka regarding a complaint made by your friend\u2019s mother about her son\u2019s abduction in 2008. As there is no reason to doubt their authenticity, I assign full weight to these documents in support of the claimant\u2019s testimony. Based on your credible testimony and supporting documentary evidence, I find that if you were to return to Sri Lanka, you would be persecuted by Sri Lankan authorities for your imputed political opinion of being a supporter of the LTTE. I find that you have established a subjective fear of return to Sri Lanka as you face persecution by Sri Lankan authorities.\n[8] I find, based on the objective documentary evidence, that your subjective fear is subjectively well-founded. In its 2021 Freedom in the World report for Sri Lanka, Freedom House has stated police and security forces have engaged in extrajudicial executions, force disappearances, custodial rape, and torture, all of which disproportionately affect Tamils. Ethnic and religious minorities are vulnerable to violence and mistreatment by security forces and Sinhalese Buddhist extremists. Item 13.1 indicates that Tamils, particularly in the north and east, reported that security forces regularly monitored and harassed community members, especially activists, journalists, and former or suspected former LTTE members. Item 13.1 also indicates that people connected to politically sensitive war related issues, such as missing persons, land release, and memorial events, are more like \u2014 are most likely to be monitored. According to the Asylum Research Centre, the northern region of Sri Lanka is on lockdown, militarized, and under the tightest and most insidious system of surveillance which reaches down to the village level. The slightest sign of activity leads to disproportionate responses with scant regard for human rights and civil liberties. The objective evidence supports the claimant\u2019s subjective fear of persecution. I find that the claimant has made out a well-founded fear of persecution based on his imputed political opinion.\n[9] Concerning state protection, I note it is the state authorities who have outlawed the LTTE and that those who are perceived as supporters of the movement are persecuted by the state. Therefore, I find it objectively unreasonable for you to seek protection of the state, and I find that there is clear and convincing evidence that there is no state protection available to you. And similarly, there is not a reasonable internal flight alternative for you within Sri Lanka as the state is the agent persecution and support of the LTTE is banned throughout the country.\n[10] Therefore, based on the foregoing analysis and considering all the evidence that I have before me, I find that XXXX XXXX XXXX, faces a serious possibility of persecution due to his imputed political opinion in Sri Lanka and is therefore a Convention refugee. I accept your claim.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

I have considered your testimony and the other evidence in the case, and I am ready to render my decision orally. These are the reasons for the decision in the claim of XXXX XXXX XXXX who claims to be a citizen of Turkey and is claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. Your allegations are fully set out in the Basis of Claim. In summary, you fear persecution at the hands of the state due to your Kurdish ethnicity and political opinion as an HDP supporter. For the following reasons, I find that you are a refugee pursuant to section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. I find that your identity as a national of Turkey is established by submission of your passport. I find you to be a credible witness and therefore believed what you alleged in support of your claim. There were no relevant inconsistencies in your testimony or contradictions between your testimony and the other evidence before me, which were not satisfactorily explained.\n[2] You testified in a straightforward manner regarding your political opinion, how that opinion was formed, and the issues that you faced in Turkey due to your ethnicity and political involvement. You also spoke of being on the state\u2019s radar and therefore your fear of further harm. In addition to your testimony, the following evidence further establishes your allegations as set out above. A letter from the Toronto Kurdish Community Centre substantiating your Kurdish ethnicity, a letter of support from your father substantiating the core allegations of the claim, letters of support from friends substantiating your political activity and the issues you faced as a result, social media posts spanning from 2012 substantiating your antigovernment political opinion, a news article related to the arrest and imprisonment of your 79 year old grandmother for her participation in political protest substantiating your family\u2019s history of political opposition, and a letter from your relatives in Canada substantiating your political opinion and positive RPD decisions related to the above-noted family members.\n[3] After reviewing the documents, I have no reason to doubt their authenticity. Given that there are no serious credibility issues with respect to your allegations coupled with the documentary evidence set out below, I find that you have established a prospective risk of arbitrary arrest, detention, or other serious harm. The risk is corroborated by the following documents the objective evidence indicates that the Kurdish minority in Turkey faces ongoing discrimination both from state authorities and from society in general. Turkish authorities have taken harsh measures to suppress the Kurdish identity, and Kurds have regularly been victims of hate speech and discrimination, as well as threats and physical violence.\n[4] 11.4 indicates that freedom of expression is excessively restricted, particularly for political opponents, who are increasingly targeted and were victims of arbitrary arrest, prosecution, smear campaigns, stigmatisation, and defamation. That report further indicates that HDP activists are seen by authorities as a threat and can be arrested for simply handing out leaflets, posting on social media, attending marches, meetings, or rallies, or entering or exiting an HDP building. Those who are arrested are reportedly often denied due process and are tried using questionable evidentiary standards. 1.6 indicates that being ethnically Kurdish and outspoken politically could cause the authorities to suspect an HDP supporter of supporting the PKK. 2.1 indicates that the police commonly take brutal measures to contain pro-Kurdish protests. 13.1 indicates that, under the guise of emergency decrees and antiterrorism laws, the Turkish government (57:32 inaudible) and those critical of the government to various human rights violations. 2.5 indicates that many of the legislative provisions adopted following a coup attempt in July of 2016 have been aimed at banning political and social opposition. Pro-Kurdish political activists continue to be targeted through the misuse of terrorism charges. 13.1 indicates, in essence, that for Kurds to live peacefully and without experiencing persecution requires Kurdistan individuals not to engage in pro-Kurdish political activities and not to speak the Kurdish language. In other words, to fully assimilate themselves into Turkish society. The objective evidence supports a finding that you have a well-founded fear of persecution in Turkey.\n[5] I have examined your claim under section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. As I conclude that the risk you described constitutes persecution based on at least one (1) of the grounds prescribed in section 96, specifically race and political opinion, I find that there is clear and convincing evidence before me that the state is unwilling to provide you with adequate protection. The agent of persecution in this case is the state. I have also examined whether a viable Internal Flight Alternative exists for you. Based on the evidence on file, I find that you face a serious possibility of persecution throughout Turkey. Again, the agent of persecution is the state, and the objective evidence indicates that the state exercises effective control of its entire your territory. In light of the proceeding, I conclude that you are a refugee pursuant to section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, and accordingly, I accept your claim.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

Their claims were heard jointly pursuant to Rule 55 of the Refugee Protection Division Rules.\n[3] At the hearing, XXXX XXXX XXXX acted as the designated representative for XXXX XXXX, who was a minor at the time of the claim and the time of the hearing.\n[4] The allegations of the claim can be found in the claimants\u2019 Basis of Claim forms and in the testimony of the two (2) adult claimants. The claimants allege that they fear persecution on the basis of political opinion at the hands of state authorities in India. The claimants allege that should they return to India, they would be subject to harassment, detention, false accusations and mistreatment by the police because the claimants are viewed as militant extremists for their support for Sikh Independence.\n[5] All three (3) claimants have established a serious possibility of persecution on the Convention Ground of political opinion should they return to India pursuant to Section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. And therefore, all three (3) claimants are Convention refugees.\n[6] At the outset of the hearing, I identified credibility as the primary matter for the hearing to focus on for the claimants. Credibility was an issue in so far as it related to the question of whether the claimants genuinely feared persecution in India.\n[7] With respect to identity, on file at Exhibit 1 is a certified copy of the claimants\u2019 passports from India. Through these documents and their testimony, the claimants have established their personal identities and their citizenship of India.\n[8] With respect to credibility, claimants testifying under oath or affirmation are presumed to be telling the truth unless there are valid reasons to reject the testimony. In this case, I find no such valid reason which would lead me to dismiss the presumption of truthfulness. Both adult claimants were forthright and spontaneous in their testimony. Both were able to describe in considerable detail the history of harassment faced by the claimants prior to their decision to leave India. Where the claimants were not certain of an answer, the claimants did not attempt to embellish or exaggerate.\n[9] The claimants submitted a number of documents tending to corroborate their allegations, including medical records showing the claimants were treated for injuries consistent with the claimants\u2019 descriptions of mistreatment at the hands of the police. Other documents included confirmation of XXXX XXXX support of the S-A-D-A political party as well as affidavits from people who were aware of the claimants\u2019 history in India. The claimants testified that they are supporters of the S-A-D-A party, a party devoted to the establishment of an independent Sikh homeland.\n[10] XXXX XXXX testified that after the state election in XXXX 2017, during which the SADA candidate lost, the claimants\u2019 home was vandalized. XXXX XXXX testified that he organized a rally later that year during which he gave speeches about Sikh history as well as denouncing the police and government for not doing enough about the drug problem in the region. The claimants testified that after this, the police began to demand that XXXX XXXX report to the local police station, where he was questioned, verbally and physically abused, accused of supporting militant Sikh separatists and accused of being involved in criminality. XXXX XXXX testified that the first time he was detained by police, he was only released the next day after the payment of a XXXX XXXX XXXX-rupee bribe.\n[11] Both in their testimony and in their Basis of Claim forms, the claimants described a number of other incidents over the next eight (8) months where XXXX XXXX was called to the police station or arrested and held for questioning. During these detentions, XXXX did testify that he was verbally and physically abused and accused of being a militant or a criminal.\n[12] A notable incident occurred in XXXX 2017 when the claimants attempted to visit relatives in Jammu and Kashmir. The claimants testified that they were stopped at a checkpoint, detained for a day and mistreated. One (1) of the claimants was sexually assaulted, and electric shocks were applied to the other claimant.\n[13] As noted, I have seen nothing on file or in the claimant\u2019s testimony that would lead me to reject the presumption that the claimants are telling the truth. I find on a balance of probabilities that the claimants did support the S-A-D-A political party, that they became targets of police and that they have been subject to harassment, detention, and mistreatment since then.\n[14] I find on a balance of probabilities that the police continue to search for the claimants and that the claimants do have a fear of persecution at the hands of the police in India.\n[15] Having found the claimants to have a fear of persecution, I turn to the question of whether this fear has an objective basis.\n[16] Country condition reports in both Exhibit 3, the National Documentation Package for India, as well as those provided by the claimant in Exhibit 4, establish that the government of India is becoming increasingly concerned with Sikh separatists. Those who advocate for the Sikh homeland may be subject to official scrutiny or be labelled as anti-nationals. There are credible reports in country condition documentation that Sikh activists have been subject to arrest and mistreatment.\n[17] I find that the claimants have established on a balance of probabilities that they would face persecution should they return to India. The claimants, therefore, have established that they face a serious possibility of persecution.\n[18] With respect to the internal flight alternative, as the state is the agent of persecution and has control over all of India\u2019s territory, I find that the claimants do not have a reasonable internal flight alternative within India where they could escape persecution.\n[19 For similar reasons, I find that the claimants could not reasonably expect state protection. The claimants testified that they did seek assistance from the district commissioner and their member of the legislative assembly but that the harassment continued until they left India. I find that the claimants have established that the state is unable or unwilling to protect them against persecution.\n[20] Based on the evidence before me and the testimony of the claimants, I conclude that all three (3) claimants have established a serious possibility of persecution on the Convention Ground of political opinion if they were to return to India.\n[21] All three (3) claimants are, therefore, Convention refugees pursuant to Section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. And all three (3) claims for protection are accepted.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

Ivanvi\nCountry: Maldives\nRPD Number: TC2-03546\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2022-01960\nATIP Pages: N\/A\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: This is a decision of the Refugee Protection Division in the claim of XXXX XXXX XXXX, file number TC2-03546 as a citizen of Maldives who is claiming refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, the IRPA. The Panel considered and applied the Chairperson\u2019s guideline 9, proceedings before the IRB involved sexual orientation and gender identity and expression.\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] The allegations are fully set out in the claimant\u2019s Basis of Claim form located in Exhibit 2. In summary, the claimant alleges that she fears the Maldivian authorities, ex-religious extremist groups, society and ger family for turning away from the Islamic faith and choosing apostasy. And also because of her sexual orientation as a bisexual woman.\nDETERMINATION\n[3] The Panel finds that the claimant faces a serious possibility of persecution in Maldives on the basis of her apostasy and sexual orientation as a bisexual woman. The Panel therefore finds that the claimant is a Conventional refugee pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA and accepts her refugee claim. The Panel\u2019s reasons are stated below.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[4] The claimant\u2019s identity as a citizen of Maldives was established based on a balance of probabilities by her testimony and the copy of her Maldives-issued passport located in Exhibit 1.\nCredibility\n[5] The Panel finds that the claimant is a credible witness and the Panel therefore accepts her testimony and the statements that the claimant has made in her Basis of Claim form. The claimant\u2019s testimony was straightforward, spontaneous and very detailed and it was entirely consistent with her Basis of Claim form. The claimant credibly described that journey to apostasy. The feeling of helplessness she felt when she was being forced to practice Islam. How she (inaudible) her religious views about the religion to avoid persecution. How she did not wear hijab when she studied in Sri Lanka and how she was forced to wear long sleeves and hijab by her mother and sisters in Maldives. The claimant testified that she had to pretend to recite prayers, wear hijab and pretend to still believe in Islam most of the time when she was in Maldives. The claimant testified about getting physically assaulted by her mother, if she missed the prayer or was unable to recite the Quran. She testified that her mother told her that if she turned away from Islam, her mother would dismember the claimant\u2019s four (4) limbs and leave her to fester with maggots. And she would leave her alive for as long as possible so she could feel as much pain as possible and this made the claimant feel very bad. The claimant testified that her mother is a Muslim with extremist views, who could not tolerate sexual minorities.\n[6] The claimant described the event that made her to start doubting Islam. The Panel finds on a balance of probabilities that the claimant has established that she was a Muslim and she is now an apostate. The claimant credibly described her sexual orientation. She states that she does not see gender but intelligence is what she is attracted to. The claimant testified that she discovered her sexual orientation at the age of 13 years and she told her best friend that she was in love with her. Her best friend\u2019s reaction made hide her sexuality and not act on it. She did not feel free and safe to explore her sexuality and felt she would have been targeted in Maldives and Sri Lanka if she exposed her sexual orientation. The Panel finds that the claimant has established her profile as a bisexual woman on a balance of probabilities.\nFailure to Claim in Sri Lanka\n[7] The claimant lived in Sri Lanka for four (4) years and testified that she did not wear hijab while in Sri Lanka. She testified that on three (3) occasions, family friends and acquaintances of her parents had seen her and on one (1) occasion, two (2) women saw her at the grocery store and took a recording of her and likely sent the video of her not wearing a hijab to her mother because her mother suddenly started calling her multiple times. The claimant testified that her parents have the resources to find her in Sri Lanka as it is only one (1) hour away by flight. The claimant also testified that there are some extremists in Sri Lanka who do not support the LGBTQ members and so she could not live freely as a bisexual woman in Sri Lanka. And that he she had heard of Maldivian religious extremist going to Sri Lanka to harm or kill Maldivians who denied Islam. The Panel does not draw an adverse finding in regard to the claimant\u2019s failure to claim in Sri Lanka.\n[8] In support of the claimant\u2019s case, she provided multiple documents corroborating her allegations. These documents are located in Exhibit 6 and 7, including, but not limited to a support letter from ex-Muslims of North America, corroborating the claimant\u2019s allegations of being an ex-Muslim and the threat by the state and vigilante violence and the persecution of apostates suffered in Islamic nations. A screenshot of messages from the claimant\u2019s sister where the sister told the claimant that ex-Muslims who do not come back to Islam get stoned to death. This was interpreted by the claimant herself because she was unable to find an interpreter. She also provided evidence of her efforts to get an interpreter in the disclosure. Some social media screenshots of hate speech against (inaudible), which corroborates the claimant\u2019s allegations of the treatment of apostates and (inaudible). The Panel finds the documents provided to be highly probative because the Panel has no reason to doubt their authenticity. Cumulatively, the documents corroborate the claimant\u2019s allegations on a balance of probabilities. The Panel, hereby, assigns them full weight in corroborating the claimant\u2019s allegations of persecution. Conclusively, an overall assessment of the evidence before the Panel shows that the claimant is a credible witness and that the claimant has established that she is an apostate and a bisexual woman. The claim has established her subjective fear of persecution as a bisexual apostate woman in the Maldives on a balance of probabilities.\nObjective Evidence\n[9] The claimant\u2019s subjective fear has been established and the claimant has credibly established that she is a bisexual apostate woman who fears persecution in the Maldives based on her apostasy and sexual orientation The Panel notes the intersectionality between the claimant\u2019s gender, religious views and sexual orientation. Objective evidence supports the claimant\u2019s allegations. The United States Department of State, US DOS, reports, that the constitution in Maldives designates Islam as the state religion. It requires citizens to be Muslim and requires public office holders, including the President, to be followers of Sunni Islam. The constitution provides for limitations on rights and freedoms to protect and maintain the tenet of Islam. The law states both the government and the people must protect religious unity. Propagation of (inaudible) religion \u2014 of any religion other than Islam is a criminal offence. The law criminalizes criticism of Islam and speech in any manner likely to cause religious segregation. The same report states that non- governmental organization continue to report the persistent, online and in-person, threats against individuals perceived to be insufficiently Muslim. Effectively foreclosed the possibility of meaningful discussion of religious issues in Maldives. The US DOS reports instances of individuals, deemed secularists or apostates, receiving death threats and being cyberbullied.\n[10] In August, the MJA, Maldives Journalist Association, published a survey. Responses to the survey also reported an increase in anonymous social media accounts believed to be linked to government officials or groups characterized as religiously extremists that harass journalists. It is reported that government continue to fail to take action against online death threats and attacks, against those perceived to be critical of Islam. The Us DOS reports that, \u201cThe Maldives law prohibits the conversion of a Muslim to another religion. By law a violation may result in the loss of the convert\u2019s citizenship.\u201d Although a judge may impose a harsher punishment by Sharia jurisprudence, the report states that although the law in Maldives does not stipulate such punishment, Sharia jurisprudence is often understood by the public and religious scholars to provide for the death penalty in cases of conversion from Muslim, that is, apostasy. But the government has made no such statement. According to Amnesty International in their report on Maldives 2021\/2022. The report states that the space for freedom of expression and dissent shrunk, the impunity enjoyed by Islamist groups had a chilling effect on civil society and opposition voices. In May, a bill was proposed in Parliament criminalizing hate speech. Media reports claimed that the bill targeted conservative Muslim groups and that the MP who propose it had received threats from these groups. The Human Rights Watch stated in the world report 2022 on Maldives that authorities have also done little to address threats posed by extremist Islamist groups that have targeted people perceived as apostates. On May 6, 2021, Parliament Speaker and former President, Mohamed Nasheed, was accused of being an apostate by his opponents and was targeted in a bomb attack.\n[11] The Human Rights Watch report states that the Maldivian Penal code criminalizes adults consensual same-sex sexual conduct. Punishment can include imprisonment of up to eight (8) years and hundred lashes and applies equally to men and women. Same-sex marriage is out-lawed and punishable by up to a year in prison. Extremist groups in the Maldives use social media to harass and threaten those who promote the right of LGBT people. The US DOS states that the code, however, grants judges the discretion to impose Sharia penalties for such offences including apostasy and homosexual acts, if proven beyond all doubt. The Penal code require that all appeal processes be exhausted prior to the administration of Sharia punishment specific to these offences, including stoning, amputation and similar punishments.\n[12] The claimant provided objective evidence on country conditions that supports the claimant\u2019s allegations. These country conditions are located in Exhibit 7. The Panel finds that the objective evidence shows that the Maldivian law criminalizes both apostasy and same-sex relations. And those who partake in either or both face persecution. The Panel finds that claimant has established on a balance of probabilities that she has a well-founded fear of persecution in Maldives because of her apostasy and her sexual orientation.\nState Protection\n[13] The Panel finds that it would be unreasonable for the claimant to approach the state for protection, given that the state authorities are part of the agents of persecution, and objective evidence has shown you little effort by the authorities to stop the death threats uttered against those who are part of the sexual minority or apostates. The law criminalizes and punishes apostasy and bisexuality. The claimant has established that she is a bisexual apostate. Therefore, the Panel finds on a balance of probabilities that there is clear and convincing evidence to rebut the presumption of state protection in this case and that adequate state protection is not available to the claimant.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[14] Claimant both established that they face persecution or harm throughout their country of nationality. In the present case, the Panel finds that an IFA does not exist for the claimant in Maldives. The objective evidence shows that apostasy and bisexuality are both criminalized throughout the Maldives. And thus, the Panel finds that the claimant has established that there is no viable internal flight alternative for her in the Maldives. The Panel finds that the claimant has established that she faces a serious possibility of persecution throughout the Maldives based on her apostasy and sexual orientation and that there is therefore no viable internal flight alternative for her.\nCONCLUSION\n[15] Having considered all the evidence, the Panel finds that the claimant has established a serious possibility of persecution due to her apostasy and sexual orientation. And the Panel finds that the claimant is a Convention refugee as set out in section 96 of the IRPA. Her claim is therefore accepted.\n[16] Congratulations I wish you the very best.\n[17] CLAIMANT: Thank you so much, Ma\u2019am. Thank you so much, Peter.\n[18] COUNSEL: Congratulations. We will talk soon.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

Saleem Akhtar\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): (In abstentia Michael F. Loebach) Omolola Fasina\nCountry: Colombia\nRPD Number: TC2-03607\nAssociated RPD Number(s): TC2-03615, TC2-03619, TC2-03621\nATIP Number: A-2022-01960\nATIP Pages: N\/A\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: This is the decision for XXXX XXXX, who is the principal claimant in this matter; and for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX, who are associate claimants.\n[2] All of you allege to be citizens of Colombia and are seeking refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[3] The allegations of your claim are found in your Basis of Claim forms.\n[4] In short, madam, you as a principal claimant allege fear of persecution at the hands of members of a criminal group called, Dagoberto Ramos Mobile Column, who are the FARC dissidents.\n[5] You further allege that it is an account of your imputed political opinion, due to your profile as a social activist, that the FARC dissidents group turned against you.\n[6] As per your narrative, your social activities included trying to assist more vulnerable groups in the community, such as boys and girls, including adolescence, and women requiring special education, behavioural and medical needs. It also included members of the LGBTQ community.\n[7] Such activities gave you prominence as a social activist and a human rights defender in the community against gender violence, domestic violence and abuse against children. Particularly against their recruitment by guerrilla criminal groups, including FARC dissidents groups.\n[8] You further allege that you did this work primarily in the communities of XXXX area.\n[9] You were helping marginalized communities with the guerrilla armed groups, such as the Dagoberto Ramos Mobile Column of the FARC dissidents, who are working against the interest of the vulnerable population.\n[10] And you did not stop working for the interest of the marginalized groups of XXXX, despite warning from the guerrilla armed group. This made them turn against you, and they threatened to harm your family as well.\n[11] Having assessed the evidence in its totality, including your sworn oral testimony and that of your husband, as well as documentary evidence presented, relevant portions of the NDP sources for Colombia, and considering and applying the guideline regarding women refugee claimants fearing gender-related persecution. As well as guide (inaudible) child refugee claimants.\n12] I find you, XXXX XXXX, TC2-03607; XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, TC2-03615; XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX TC2-03619; and XXXX XXXX XXXX, TC2-03621, to be Convention refugees within the meaning of section 96 of the Act.\n[13] Reasons of my decision are as follows.\n[14] Having reviewed your passports and other relevant documents, as well as based on your sworn oral testimony and that of your husband. I find, on a balance of probabilities, that you have established your own personal identity and country of reference, which is Colombia. As well as that of your husband and children who are associate claimants in this matter.\n[15] I find, on a balance of probabilities, that you have established a nexus to a Convention ground based on your imputed political opinion.\n[16] I also find that all three (3) associate claimants have a nexus to a Convention ground based on their membership in a particular social group as your family members, namely spouse and children respectively.\n[17] In terms of credibility, the Refugee Protection Division holds a view that when a claimant swears the truth of certain allegations, this creates a presumption that they are true, unless there\u2019s reason to doubt their truthfulness.\n[18] The determination regarding whether or not evidence is credible is made on a balance of probabilities.\n[19] I find, on a balance of probabilities, that both you and your husband offered direct, clear and spontaneous testimony.\n[20] You answered the questions asked accurately and to the best of your knowledge and understanding.\n[21] You did not attempt to exaggerate the incidents of harassment and threats committed against you to embellish and boost your claims.\n[22] You also provided ample evidence to substantiate your involvement as a social activist and a human rights defender for the interest of vulnerable members of the society in your community.\n[23] You credibly testified and you believed that the FARC dissidents groups turned against you because you were trying to empower the vulnerable communities against all guerrilla groups so that they could understand their rights. And then stand up to protect their rights and interest against such criminal groups and their allies in their criminal activities.\n[24] You credibly testified that on several occasions you were threatened and warned to stop your activities helping community members. As the threats increased in intensity, you became more fearful for your life as well as that of your spouse and children.\n[25] You moved to different location within Colombia, hoping that you would not be located by the agents of persecution in heart. However, that did not happen, they found you and threatened you.\n[26] Based on your general knowledge and observation having been raised in Colombia, you also believe that the police or other state agencies would not be either willing to help and protect because they are corrupt or would not be able to protect for lack of requisite resources.\n[27] Hence, you did not report the matter to police because you were also afraid that your confidential information would be leaked out to the agents of persecution, and they would become more vindictive towards you and your family.\n[28] This whole situation led you and your husband to realize and believe that your life would be constantly in danger if you stayed on in Colombia. You were already in possession of valid U.S. and Canadian visas.\n[29] You left Colombia for Canada on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2021, and later filed inland (ph) refugee protection claim in XXXX 2021.\n[30] In addition to credible oral testimony, you provided sufficient credible documentary evidence to support your allegations.\n[31] These documents include relevant employment documents; affidavits of natural support from family members, friends; and relevant country conditions documentary evidence.\n[32] After reviewing these documents, I find, on a balance of probabilities, that they offer probative value; therefore, I have given them weight.\n[33] I find, on a balance of probabilities, that your evidence, inherently consistent and plausible in consistent with the evidence on country conditions in Colombia.\n[34] I find that you have credibly established, on a balance of probabilities, that the FARC dissidents groups have the motivation and the means to locate and harm you and your family, no matter where you relocated in Colombia.\n[35] Hence, I find, you have credibly established a subjective fear of persecution in Colombia.\n[36] Objective evidence for Colombia demonstrates that social activist and human rights defenders and their families, face risks from the drug mafia organizations, including the FARC dissidents groups such as Dagoberto Ramos Guerrilla Column, and from their allies as well who are (inaudible) throughout Colombia.\n[37] I considered the relevant available documentary evidence as well as your oral sworn testimony and that of your husband to assess and analyze your profiles. I also considered and assessed the profile of the agents of persecution in this context.\n[38] After reviewing the relevant documentary evidence, I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the FARC dissidents groups are once again regrouping themselves and gaining strength and ground.\n[39] Item 7.1 and 7.2 of the NDP note that the FARC dissidents groups are involved in extortion, death threats, kidnapping, money laundering, drug trafficking and murder against those who speak out against their interests and agenda.\n[40] I also note in Item 7.37 of the NDP that generally criminal groups target those they perceive as a nuisance or obstacle to their economic objectives in a given region.\n[41] The same NDP sources further note in Item 1.7 that when women who oppose human rights violations refuse to stop doing so, some groups result to physical attacks and increase the intensity, frequency and cruelty of psychological, physical or sexual aggression. In several cases, leading to the death of these women or of their loved ones after disrupting or destabilizing their mental, emotional or psychological health.\n[42] These documents objectively corroborate your stated fear of persecution by the FARC dissidents groups. And thus, I find you have established a well-founded fear of persecution in Colombia.\n[43] As regard to state protection, I find the evidence on state protection in Colombia is mixed. The Colombian government authorities have certainly tried to enhance protection for victims of non-state armed actors, such as FARC dissidents groups.\n[44] However, on a balance of probabilities, I do not find that these efforts have resulted in adequate protection on the ground. Particularly considering that problems of corruption and lack of resources limit the Colombian state\u2019s ability to reduce the influence of these groups in the country, as stated in Item 7.1 of the NDP.\n[45] Item 7.10 of the NDP states that government protection is limited. It adds that a person in a position of leadership or power by a person who is a public servant in the judicial system might receive protection from the authorities, but not otherwise.\n[46] In this I find, on a balance of probabilities, that you who will lose special provision of power nor are you a public servant in the judicial system.\n[47] According to Item 1.9 of the NDP, Colombia continues to experience murders and threats of violence against human rights defenders, social activists and others working in the street. These ongoing assaults effect constraints of the Colombian judicial system to effectively prosecute criminals and overcome impunity.\n[48] Given the infiltration of all guerrilla groups including FARC into the armed forces, which is one of the most (inaudible) organ of the State, I find it unreasonable in the circumstances to expect the State to be able to adequately protect you and your family on a balance of probabilities.\n[49] I also find on a balance of probabilities that there\u2019s no viable internal flight alternative available to you in Colombia.\n[50] Having assessed the evidence, I note that you moved to two (2) different locations for your safety; however, the threats continued.\n[51] This demonstrated on a balance of probabilities that the agents of persecution in this matter have the ability and the motivation to locate you even after you relocated to a different place inside Colombia.\n[52] The NDP for Colombia notes that human rights defenders face the same risks of persecution throughout Colombia.\n[53] The objective evidence from Colombia references many times that these paramilitary groups and criminal organizations operate in strategic alliances and target drug related trafficking persons, human rights defenders and social activists in many communities throughout the country.\n[54] For them this is a key part of gaining, indicating territorial control, which is essential for the drug trade which is what these groups are really interested in. Social activist and human rights defenders often end up as natural enemies to the drug industry.\n[55] Based on the totality of the evidence, I find that you and your family would face a serious possibility of persecution throughout Colombia and that there\u2019s no viable IFA, internal flight alternative, available to you.\n[56] Having considered the totality of the evidence madam, I find you, XXXX XXXX; your husband, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX; your children XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX, to be Convention refugees within the meaning of section 96 of the Act.\n[57] Hence, I accept your claim today.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

These are relevant, probative, and given full weight to support the existence of both medical conditions.\n[9] I found your testimony credible, and consistent with the known country documentation.\n[10] To establish a person\u2019s status as a Convention refugee, or a person in need of protection, one (1) must show that there was a serious possibility that they would be persecuted, or that they would be subjected, on a balance of probabilities, to a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or a danger of torture if removed to Brazil.\n[11] Although you were able to have relationships with men in Brazil, your mannerisms resulted in assaults and violence at the hands of your family members and the community more widely. You were excluded for most of your child and teen years. Bullied and punished for failing to meet society\u2019s expectations of manliness. A fear of violence is something you dealt with regularly in Brazil as a gay man. This was on a constant basis.\n[12] You\u2019ve been assaulted by strangers in public, you never reported your treatment to school or police out of fear for your safety. In Brazil, you were concerned about how to dress or how to behave on the street because you were worried about violence. You were unable to find a job because you were not masculine enough to be hired. You have been verbally attacked on public transit. You hid in your house after this event for a whole month.\n[13] You\u2019ve had to run away from aggressors on multiple occasions. Fearing the political climate, and seeing support from the new government from your friends and family members, you worked on a way to leave Brazil.\n[14] In your oral evidence, you noted differences regarding your life as a gay man in Canada. While in Brazil, you were afraid to be involved in the LGBTQ+ Pride parades, because it was dangerous. By comparison, you and your current partner have a life in Toronto. You spoke about how you enjoyed the Pride parade in Toronto, where it felt safe and accepting. Your closing comments were that you really wanted the opportunity to live here. And to live your life, be yourself openly, not fake who you are. You wanted the opportunity to be accepted and not judged. And hear that you do not need to be afraid of that, and you\u2019re safe. You just wanted to live your life and be who you are.\n[15] I find, taking into consideration the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9, that the evidence presented in support of the allegations has established more than a mere possibility of persecution. As per paragraph 8.5.1, therein it is \u201cwell established in law that being compelled to conceal one\u2019s SOGIESC identity constitutes a serious interference with fundamental human rights and that may, therefore, amount to persecution\u2026a claimant cannot be expected to conceal their identity as a way to avoid persecution in their country of reference.\u201d\n[16] In Canada, you learned you were XXXX XXXX in XXXX 2020. In XXXX 2020, you broke up with your boyfriend; you were relieved that he was XXXX XXXX. You are concerned about returning to Brazil given the increased violence following the election of the homophobic president. Your friend in Brazil was almost murdered in XXXX 2020 because he was gay. He has been unable to leave Brazil as his recovery is long. I\u2019ll note the attack was savage. You provided newspaper articles detailing the attack. I\u2019ll also note, at this point, you do have another friend who passed away from XXXX complications. He was unable to afford and secure XXXX XXXX. That was in XXXX 2021. You have told me that you feel you don\u2019t have any support in Brazil, and you feel you could not secure XXXX XXXX there.\n[17] It was against this backdrop, and the government rhetoric regarding COVID-19 and XXXX, that you decided to seek out refugee protection. You did not realize that there was legal support. You were afraid that losing your claim would mean losing everything. You were also afraid to tell your father the truth about your situation.\n[18] The timing of your XXXX XXXX test in 2020, combined with the expiry of your work visa in 2020 during COVID-19, lying to your father that you had a work permit, and the fear of speaking with your father about XXXX, resulted in your mental health suffering. The delay ensued. You are now receiving mental health treatment and you feel supported. I do not draw a negative inference from your delay in claiming, considering all of the circumstances.\n[19] On the matter of country conditions, I rely on your country conditions documents, as well as NDP Items 2.1, 2.3, 6.2, 6.3, and 6.4. There is considerable documentary evidence regarding the treatment of LGBTQ persons in Brazil. This evidence includes the US Department of State report which refers to violence against LGBT individuals being a serious concern. The report from human Rights Watch indicates hundreds of complaints of violence, discrimination, and other abuses against the LGBTQ people. It\u2019s received by the National Human Rights Ombudsman\u2019s Office in the first half of 2017. And other documents, while being somewhat dated, two (2), three (3), and four (4) years old, they indicate long-standing concerns about murders of hundreds of LGBTQ persons in Brazil each and every year.\n[20] You quote the death rate to be approximately one (1) person a day. Country conditions reports commonly underestimate the true numbers, as police are not inclined to identify murders targeting LGBTQ individuals as anything other than garden variety homicides. Which, in themselves, remain exceedingly high in number in Brazil. The country conditions documents established that there are patterns. These are patterns of violence and, sadly, includes what appears to be growing violence and homicide rates for members of the LGBTQ community in Brazil.\n[21] I acknowledge that Brazil in some ways presents a study in contrast. In 2019, over 3 million attendees celebrated the June 2019 Sao Paulo Pride parade. In 2019, the Brazilian Supreme Court criminalized homophobia. While Salvador appears to be the capital of hate crimes against LGBTQ+ people, I find there is no evidence that Sao Paulo is much safer.\n[22] Now, the President has consistently voiced his own viewpoint, as a self-confessed, proud homophobe. In the country conditions, both in the New York Times and Guardian articles, they state that violent deaths of LGBTQ people in Brazil is hitting an all-time high. I\u2019ll note that Out magazine states that gay travel websites warn LGBTQ tourists to steer clear of Brazil. The Minister of Education shut down a section of the ministry devoted to diversity and human rights. He has come out against the discussion of gender theory, which studies gender identities in the classroom.\n[23] I\u2019ll quote directly from an article provided by Counsel: \u201cVirtually all survey respondents \u2013 over 98 percent \u2013 believe that hate speech promoted by politicians and candidates against LGBTQ rights contributes to increased violence on social networks.\u201d There is considerable anecdotal evidence about how many police, prosecutors, and judicial authorities are biased against the LGBTQ community. There is even less support provided to the LGBTQ community to defend themselves from online attacks.\n[24] The low level of official reporting by LGBTQ people is often a result of the prejudices they face from policing in the criminal justice system. While no specific law prohibits discrimination against LGBTQ persons in essential good and services, such as health care. In 2019, however, the STF criminalized discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. Offenders face sentences of one (1) to three (3) years\u2019 imprisonment, and a fine. Or two (2) to five (5) years\u2019 imprisonment and a fine if the offender disseminates the incident via social media, thereby exposing the victims. All that to say, intolerance persists.\n[25] The National Human Rights Ombudsman\u2019s Office reported to Human Rights Watch that between January and June 2020, it received 1,134 complaints of violence, discrimination, and other abuses against LGBTQ people. Data from the government\u2019s hotline to report abuses reveals that between 2011 and 2017, there were 12,477 complaints violence against LGBTQ people in Brazil. Hate crimes in Sao Paolo, Brazil\u2019s largest city, peaked in the months leading up to October\u2019s presidential election. The city registered an average of 16 hate crime cases a day in August, September, and October 2019. That was more than triple the daily average for the first half of the year. According to a tally of police reports, using freedom of information requests, homophobic crimes, in particular, rose 75% during those months.\n[26] Even bearing in mind that the local metropolitan Sao Paulo population is approximately 21 million people, with a country of 207 million people, one (1) may well understand that the frequency of reports of such death would be of grave personal concern to you.\n[27] I find that your subjective fear has an objective basis. And accordingly, your fear of persecution on the basis of your membership in a particular social group, namely, gay men, is well founded.\n[28] Given the involvement of senior government officials, including the current president, in promulgating anti-gay rhetoric, and the evidence pointing to limited police effectiveness regarding homophobic crimes, I find that you\u2019ve rebutted the presumption of state protection in this specific case.\n[29] Also, there is no safe internal flight alternative available to you in all the circumstances.\n[30] For the above reasons, I conclude that you have a well-founded fear of persecution in Brazil, on the ground of your sexual orientation and, specifically, because of your distinct and personal circumstances, you would be unable to live openly as a gay man.\n[31] Therefore, I determine you are a Convention refugee under section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[32] Accordingly, I accept your claim.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

The hearing date is July the 28th, 2022. It is Warren Chin rendering the decision. The claimant has waived interpretation for the purposes of rendering the decision. Thank you for that. I have considered your testimony and the other evidence in this case, and I am ready to render my decision orally. The claimant is claiming to be a citizen of Pakistan and is claiming refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and sub section 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nDETERMINATION\n[2] I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee on the grounds of his religion. And considering that there is a nexus between what the claimant fears in section 96, I have assessed this claim pursuant to section 96.\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] The claimant\u2019s allegations are found in his Basis of Claim form, which are found in Exhibit 2. In summary, the claimant alleges persecution from a militant group, specifically the Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, hereafter referred to as the LEJ. The claimant alleges to have a history of being a Shia-Muslim, being religious growing up and becoming more involved with his imambargah since returning to Pakistan in XXXX of 2021 and becoming a part of the XXXX XXXX. The claimant alleges that on XXXX XXXX, 2021, he XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX for the extension of his imambargah, as the claimant owned a plot of land that was adjacent to the imambargah. He claims that the news spread of his gesture.\n[4] The claimant alleges that on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2021, while the claimant was inspecting the site, four (4) people visited inquiring about claimant and these individuals were LEJ members. They attacked the claimant by hitting the claimant head (sic) on a wall. And the claimant suffered injuries to his head and was bleeding. He was given a warning to forget about that project and to leave his activities within the imambargah. The claimant was taken to the hospital and treated for those injuries. The claimant alleges then on XXXX XXXX, 2021, he was in the market while collecting donations for the project. The claimant then witnessed a beating and the claimant intervened and the attacker instead assaulted the claimant. The claimant was called a Shia Kafir and the attacker then made a phone call for reinforcements, at which point the claimant fled to his home.\n[5] The claimant alleges that on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2021, there was a groundbreaking ceremony for the imambargah and his XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The claimant invited prominent leaders to talk about the sacrifices of Ahl al-Bayt. And the claimant also gave speeches on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2021. The claimant learned that there was a fatwa order issued against him, which ordered LEJ goons to kill the claimant. The claimant alleges that on XXXX XXXX, he learned from his friend that the police have started searching for the claimant due to an FIR, First Information Report that was filed by the maulvi against the claimant for blasphemy\n[6] On XXXX XXXX XXXX 2021, the claimant fled Pakistan. He transited through the United States and arrived in Canada on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2021, and made a claim for refugee protection shortly thereafter. The claimant alleged that he will be harmed or killed anywhere throughout Pakistan and that he will not be protected.\nIdentity\n[7] The claimant\u2019s identity is established on a balance of probabilities by his passport on the record that can be found in Exhibit 1.\nCredibility\n[8] I do find this claimant to be in an overall credible witness and I, therefore, believe what he has alleged in support of his claim. He testified in a straightforward manner. He spoke naturally and he did not embellish his story. He gave spontaneous details and there were no relevant inconsistencies between his testimony or contradictions within his evidence, which have not been explained in a satisfactory manner. The claimant\u2019s refugee claim is well-documented, and I will take this opportunity to go through the claimant\u2019s material evidence. In support of the claimant\u2019s religious identity, he supplied two (2) affidavits from The Imam XXXX XXXX (ph) that attest to the claimant\u2019s involvement within the imambargah and his appointment to the XXXX XXXX. In relation to his fears, he disclosed two (2) police reports dated XXXX XXXX, 2021, and XXXX XXXX XXXX 2021 \u2014 sorry, it was XXXX XXXX XXXX 2019 and XXXX XXXX XXXX 2021, as well as copies of the FIR. And a copy of the fatwa issued against him, that could be found at pages 35 through 41 at Exhibit 5. He also disclosed the newspaper article outlining the attack on the claimant. He provided several other affidavits from his brother\u2019s wife, his father, and his lawyer in Pakistan. And there are other documents that establish the claimant\u2019s status as a Shia-Muslim. He provided XXXX slips, evidencing his XXXX history with the imambargah in Pakistan. He also provided evidence of his religious involvement here in Canada. He supplied a letter from the Al Imam Society (ph) in Toronto, Canada that is dated XXXX 2022.\n[9] Now, in particular this evidence, in my view, corroborates the claimant\u2019s testimony and his allegations is set out in his Basis of Claim form. And after reviewing these documents, I have no reason to doubt their authenticity. The claimant also testified in detail about the attack on him in XXXX 2021. The claimant was able to correctly identify the injuries that he sustained, being injuries to his face. He provided corroborative documents for that attack as well. He provided entry from the daily diary evidence, his complaint to the police. And on the basis of the documentary evidence combined with the claimant\u2019s testimony, I accept the claimant\u2019s allegations, in particular, I find the claimant has established that he a Shia-Muslim, that he is being targeted by the LEJ due to his religious identity as a Shia-Muslim, and the high-profile nature of his activities. Therefore, his subjective fears are established on a balance of probabilities.\nObjective Basis\n[10] I find that the claimant has established that he has a serious possibility of persecution or harm should he return to Pakistan, and that he is an active member of his imambargah, and that he has held the position of authority within it. I find that the objective country condition evidence also supports the claimant\u2019s allegations. At Item 2.1, which is a US Department of State Country report on human rights practices for 2019, indicates that societal violence in Pakistan due to religious intolerance remains a serious problem throughout the year. And it reported severe restrictions on religious freedoms. It further indicates that violence, abuse, the social and religious intolerance by militant organizations and other non-state actors contributed to a culture of lawlessness throughout the country. Item 2.3, which is an Amnesty International document on human rights in Pakistan at page 8, indicate that armed groups carry out such a tax on individuals belonging to religious minority groups throughout 2019, which include members of the Shia community.\n[11] The Australian DFAT, a document dated February 2019 at Item 1.13 at paragraphs 3.99 and 3.100, indicate that sectarian violence in Pakistan has been historically targeting individuals, places of worship, shrines, and religious schools, and that the Shia community traditionally represented a higher proportion of the casualties. Moreover, the Shia community continued to face threats from anti-Shia militant groups, including the LEJ, and other extremist groups. The LEJ stated its objective is to establish an Islamic Sunni state in Pakistan, and it seeks to have all Shia declared as nonbelievers or apostates, and to alienate other minority religious groups. Therefore, on the basis of the objective evidence, I find that the claimant\u2019s subjective fear has an objective basis.\nState Protection\n[12] Item 1.8 of the UNHCR eligibility guidelines for assessing the international protection needs of members of religious minorities from Pakistan states that the government has been criticized for failing to protect Shia-Muslims from attacks and allowing militant organizations to operate with impunity, by failing to investigate and punish those responsible for violent attacks. The DFAT reports that the US Commission on international religious freedoms designates Pakistan as a country of particular concern and that the Pakistani government has failed to provide adequate protections to religious minorities and furthermore, that it perpetrated systematic and egregious violations of religious freedoms and that can be found at Item 1.13 of Exhibit 3. The claimant\u2019s evidence is that he went to the police. He was attacked in XXXX of 2021. He disclosed the daily diary entry to corroborate his efforts. He also went to the police after the attack in the market in XXXX of 2021. And given that the claimant\u2019s evidence is that he has already gone to the police and has not received any help, I find that it is objectively unreasonable for the claimant to seek any further protection in this instance and that state protection cannot be seen as being reasonably forthcoming. I, therefore, find the presumption of state protection has been provided with clearing and convincing evidence.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[13] Item 1.8 of Exhibit 3 of page 66 states that an IFA will generally not be available to individual score members of religious minorities and who have a credible risk of being targeted by armed militant groups, given the sustained religiously motivated sectarian violence and the wide geographical reach of such groups. Furthermore, some non state agents of persecution, such as militant groups, reportedly have links to or closely associated with influential actors and the local and central administration, law enforcements, and the judiciary. As a result, these militant groups often operate with impunity and the reach may extend beyond areas not under their immediate control. So, given that the high-profile nature of the claimant\u2019s involvement in the Shia community in Pakistan, along with the objective evidence considering the national reach of the agents of persecution, I find that the claimant has established on a balance of probabilities that he would not be safe throughout Pakistan, even if he were to relocate. The first prong of the internal flight alternative analysis fails and therefore, an internal flight alternative is not available to this claimant.\n[14] So, in conclusion, I find on a balance of probabilities that the claimant would face a serious possibility of persecution if returned to Pakistan on account of his religious profile and based on this evidence, I accept his claim pursuant to section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act and I find that he is a Convention refugee. Sir your claim is accepted.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

Bourassa\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Pierre-Luc Bouchard\nCountry: Sierra Leone\nRPD Number: TC2-22296\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2022-01960\nATIP Pages: N\/A\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] The claimant, XXXX claims to be a citizen of Sierra Leone and is claiming refugee protection pursuant to Sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (\u2018IRPA\u201d).\n[2] In coming to its decision, the panel considered post-hearing written submissions received from counsel on December 9, 2022.\n[3] The panel has considered and applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9: Proceedings Involving Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity Expression, and Sex Characteristics.\nDETERMINATION\n[4] Having considered the totality of the evidence, the panel finds the claimant to be a Convention refugee under s. 96 of IRPA as he has established a serious possibility of persecution should he retum to Sierra Leone based on his membership in a particular social group based on his sexual orientation as a gay man.\nALLEGATIONS\n[5] The claimant\u2019 s allegations are set out in his Basis of Claim (BOC) form[1] and narrative, as amended.[2] In short, he alleges a fear of persecution in Sierra Leone due to his sexual orientation as a gay man.\n[6] The claimant alleges a fear of persecution from his father who assaulted him with a knife, authorities in Sierra Leone and the community. The claimant alleges that there is no available protection in Sierra Leone. Same sex relations are criminalized in Sierra Leone and are disapproved of in society. He alleges that he could not live safely anywhere in Sierra Leone.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[7] The panel finds that the claimant\u2019s personal identity and as a citizen of Sierra Leone have been established on a balance of probabilities through the claimant\u2019s testimony and the supporting documents on file that include his passport, a certified true copy of which was provided to the Board by CBSA\/IRCC.[3]\nNexus\n[8] The panel finds that there is a link: between what the claimant fears and one of the five Convention grounds, membership in a particular social group, based on his sexual orientation. Therefore, his claim has been assessed under s. 96 of IRPA.\nCredibility\n[9] Overall, the panel finds the claimant is a credible witness.\n[10] The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant has established his sexual orientation as a gay man through a combination of his testimony and supporting documentation.\n[11] The claimant testified credibly that he did odd day jobs for an individual that he referred to as the \u201cwhite man\u201d who started to pay him for sexual favours. Intime, he asked the claimant to bring a friend. He testified that he brought a friend, XXXX and that they fell into a relationship as same-sex partners after the white man left in 2015. He described himself as the woman in their relationship. He testified that he was aware that consensual same-sex sexual activity is criminalized in Sierra Leone and of the prevailing cultural norms and attitudes.\n[12] The claimant testified credibly about his same-sex relationship with XXXX that extended over several years, including what he liked about him and what they liked to do together. He added that no one was suspicious of their relationship. They were viewed as good friends. In support of his claim, the claimant submitted several photos[4] of himself and his partner explaining when each was taken. The panel finds the photos to be credible and trustworthy and gives them weight.\n[13] The claimant testified credibly that he and his partner went clubbing on XXXX 2019, to celebrate XXXX. They stayed out late and returned to the claimant\u2019s house. Uncharacteristically, they slept late. He testified that a step-sister came into his room which also acted as a storeroom, in order to get a bag of rice, and caught them having sex. She left immediately. He then locked the door after she left, adding that they may have forgotten to lock the door. His step-mother then knocked on the door and asked to come in and get the rice and then left. He overheard her asking the step-sister what she had seen and was told that she had seen them having sex.\n[14] The claimant testified credibly that he and his partner went to sit outside waiting for his step-mother to finish cooking the rice. They were then approached by four men who identified themselves as Community Service Volunteers who told him that his step-mother had reported that he was gay and caught having sex. They also witnessed the claimant and his partner sharing a kiss. Two of the men proceeded to hit the claimant with batons and beat him. He was dragged to the front of the house where his father stabbed him with a knife in XXXX, vowing to kill him. The claimant managed to escape and made his way to his sister XXXX\u2019s house. His partner who had tried to intervene, was beaten and apparently died.\n[15] The claimant testified that he disclosed what had happened to his brother-in-law and to his sister XXXX who arrived home later. His brother-in-law told him that he would be killed if he returned home. His sister accompanied him to a clinic for medical attention. He left for Ghana\nXXXX days later, and then travelled to Ecuador and eventually to the United States. The claimant testified that he has remained in regular contact with his sister XXXX, who informs him that his father remains angry and upset and has threatened to kill him.\n[16] The claimant testified credibly that he was detained in California for attempting to enter the United States (US) illegally. He was able to leave detention after XXXX months with the assistance of an organization that advocates for LGBTQ persons in US Immigration detention. In support of his claim, the claimant provided a letter of support[5] from XXXX of the XXXX who confirm that they paid the claimant\u2019s XXXX immigration bond in coordination with XXXX and XXXX who provided temporary housing to the claimant and organized his transportation from detention to his sponsor. Mr. XXXX also states that the claimant has remained in touch with him and individuals that he worked with at XXXX and shared the danger he fears in Sierra Leone because of his sexual orientation. It is also noted that the claimant facilitated the retum of the-\nbond to his organization. The panel finds the letter to be credible and trustworthy and gives it weight.\n[17] The claimant testified credibly that since being in Canada, he has participated in some support programs and social activities with AGIR, a non-profit organization for migrants who self-identify as sexual and\/or gender minorities. In support of his claim, he submitted a letter6 from AGIR confirming that that the claimant approached the organization and self-identified as a gay man and shared the danger he fears because ofhis sexual orientation from Sierra Leone, and has participated in 4 AGIR support groups and social events for LGBTQ+ migrants. The panel finds the letter to be credible and trustworthy and gives it weight.\n[18] The claimant testified that he is currently involved in a same-sex relationship with a man called hat he was acquainted with in Sierra Leone and with whom he reconnected with\n5 Exhibit 5, item P-8.\n6 Exhibit 6.\nwhile living in the US in different cities. He was able to provide information about his partner who remains in the US and details of their relationship. However, his partner did not appear at the hearing as a witness. When asked why his partner did not appear as a witness at the hearing, he responded that he did not know he could. His partner had provided a letter7 of support and proof of his identity. The panel noted that the letter is not signed and inquired whether the second page was missing. Counsel confirmed that the one page was all that he had received. The panel gives little way to the unsigned letter and notes that it is unfortunate that his partner did not attend the hearing to testify in support of his same-sex partner\u2019 s claim, as one might reasonably have expected him to be available.\n[19] The claimant also submitted a letter of support from hom he described as the husband of his stepsister, l his father\u2019s daughter from another relationship. The claimant stated that his brother-in-law witnessed the incident at his father\u2019s house. The panel noted some inconsistencies between his written and oral testimony and the letter. For instance, the claimant testified that he was stabbed in 1\nand managed to escape, running uphill to eventually make his way to his sister house and later fled to Ghana. The brother-in-law states in his letter that the claimant was stabbed in the\nand dragged unconsciously to a nearby drainage. He also refers to the claimant fleeing to Guinea, Conakry and having contributed to his travel. The claimant explained that his brother-in\u00ad law may not have written it well and made a mistake about Guinea. He added that he had pretended not to get up in order to flee. The panel does not find his explanations to be reasonable. One might reasonably have expected someone who had allegedly witnessed the attack to recall basic facts. Furthermore, it is not clear from the letter that he witnessed the incident at the claimant\u2019s father\u2019s house given that he appears to reside in a different community. For these reasons, the panel does not find the letter to be credible and trustworthy and gives it no weight. However, there is other credible and trustworthy evidence before the panel.\n[20] The panel finds, based on a balance of probabilities, the claimant has established his sexual orientation as a gay man and whose sexual orientation is known in Sierra Leone. The panel finds that the claimant has established a subjective fear of returning to Malawi.\n7 Exhibit 5, item P-9.\nObjective Basis\n[21] The Board finds that the claimant\u2019 s allegations are supported by the documentary evidence, namely the national documentation package for Sierra Leone8 and that the claimant would face a serious possibility of persecution should he return to Sierra Leone based on his membership in a particular social group, based on his sexual orientation as a gay man.\n[22] The documentary evidence9 indicates that the law criminalizes same-sex sexual activity between men under the Offences Against the Person Act, carrying a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. The law is not enforced.10\n[23] The constitution does not offer protection from discrimination based on sexual orientation.11 No hate crime law covers bias-motivated violence against LGBTI+ persons.12 Although LGBTQI+ advocacy groups noted that police discrimination against LGBTQI+ individuals had not disappeared, they reported that police were increasingly treating LGBTQI+ persons with understanding.13\n[24] The panel notes that Guideline 9 at Section 8.5.6.1 indicates that even where laws are not enforced in a country against same-sex relationships, they may create a climate of impunity for perpetrators of violence and contribute to discrimination against SOGIESC individuals as they may reinforce negative societal attitudes against this population as well. According to one source, even though the anti-buggery law is not actively enforced, it contributes significantly to the stigma and discrimination of people on the basis of their sexual orientation. 14\n[25] There is significant societal discrimination based on sexual orientation in Sierra Leone in nearly every facet of life.\n8 Exhibit 8, National Documentary Packager for Sierra Leone, 31 March 2020 version.\n9 Exhibit 3, items 2.1 and 2.2.\n10 Exhibit 3, item 2.1.\n11 Exhibit 3.\n12 Exhibit 3.\n13 Exhibit 3.\n14 Exhibit 3, item 6.1.\n[26] LGBTQI+ advocates reported the community faced challenges ranging from violence, stigma, discrimination, blackmailing, and public attack to denial of public services such as healthcare and justice. According to one source,15 in 2019, two men were reported to the police by their family members after being caught having sex in their house. The couple was able to escape and managed to leave the country before they were arrested.\n[27] Discrimination occurs in housing, in healthcare, also in employment in Sierra Leone and that there is a failure of the State to investigate or punish public entities and private persons complicit in abuses against LGBTQI+ persons.16\n[28] It is difficult for LGBTQI+ individuals to receive health services; many chose not to seek medical testing or treatment due to fear their right to confidentiality would be ignored and their sexual identity would be compromised. According to a study, healthcare professionals have refused treatment or abused LGBT patients after discovering their identities.\n[29] Obtaining secure housing was also a problem for LGBTQI+ persons. Families frequently shunned their LGBTQI+ children, leading some to tum to commercial sexto survive. Adults risked having their leases terminated if their LGBTQI+ status became public.\n[30] The panel finds that the discrimination that LGBTQI+ persons including gay men face in Sierra Leone rises to the level of persecution. In making this finding, the Board has made reference to the UNHCR Handbook. The UNHCR Handbook indicates the discrimination rises to the level of persecution, where there are a number of discriminatory acts which are substantially prejudicial to the person concemed, that take place in a general atmosphere of insecurity, and which result in feelings of apprehension and insecurity with regard to the future existence of that person.17\n15 Exhibit 4, item 6.2.\n16 Exhibit 4, item 6.2.\n17 Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status under the 1951 Convention and the 1967 Protocol relating to the Status ofRefugees of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, at paras. 54-55.\n[31] The Federal Court has noted that the Board must take into account the cumulative nature ofvarious acts ofharassment and attacks to determine whether they amount to persecution.18 Based on the objective evidence regarding Sierra Leone, the Board finds that this does amount to persecution in the claimant\u2019s particular circumstances.\n[32] Considering all of the evidence including the documentary evidence as well as the credible evidence of the claimant, the panel finds that the claimant would face a serious possibility of persecution in Sierra Leone as a gay man. The country conditions documentation supports the claimant\u2019s allegations.\nState Protection\n[33] Based on the claimant\u2019s persona! circumstances as well as the country documentation referred to above, the panel finds on a balance of probabilities that the claimant has rebutted the presumption of state protection with clear and convincing evidence. Adequate state protection is not available as same-sex activity is criminalized in Sierra Leone.\nInternai Flight Alternative (IFA)\n[34] Based on the objective documentary evidence as set out above, the panel finds that there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout Sierra Leone for the claimant as same-sex activity is criminalized throughout Sierra Leone and as such there is no viable IFA.\nCONCLUSION\n[35] Having considered the totality of the evidence, the panel finds the claimant to be a Convention refugee under s. 96 of IRPA as he has established a serious possibility of persecution should he retum to Sierra Leone based on his membership in a particular social group based on his sexual orientation as a gay man.\n18 Mete v. Canada (MC\/), 2005 FC 840 (CanLII), at paras. 5, 6; Canada (MC\/) v.

The claimants claim to be citizens of Jamaica and seek refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA)[i].\n[2] The claims were heard jointly pursuant to Rule 55(1) of the Refugee Protection Division Rules. The Refugee Protection Division appointed AC1 to be the Designated Representative for his two minor children XXXX and XXXX, the minor associate claimants in this claim.\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] The allegations of the claim are found in the Basis of Claim form (BOC)[ii]. The adult claimants each filed their own BOC narratives, on which the minor associate claimants rely. Only the adult claimants testified at the hearing. In summary, AC1 alleges a fear of persecution at the hands of the Jamaican society at large because of his sexual orientation as a bisexual man. PC, AC2 and the minor associate claimants, being the wife and children of AC1, allege a fear of persecution at the hands of the Jamaican society at large because of their association with AC1. If returned to Jamaica, they fear that they would face harassment or would be beaten or killed.\nDETERMINATION\n[4] The panel finds that AC1 is not excluded under Article 1F(a) of the Refugee Convention. The panel further finds that the claimants have established a serious possibility of persecution if returned to Jamaica and therefore they are Convention refugees pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA. In rendering this decision, the panel has considered and applied Guideline 9: Proceedings Before the IRB Involving Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Expression, and Sex Characteristics (SOGIESC).\nNOT EXCLUDED UNDER ARTICLE 1F(a)\n[5] Pursuant to Rule 26 of the Refugee Protection Division Rules, the panel notified the Minister in writing of possible exclusion under Article 1F(a) of the Refugee Convention. Upon review of the file, the Minister indicated that it did not intend to intervene at the hearing[iii].\n[6] For the following reasons, the panel finds that the principal claimant is not excluded under Article 1F(a) of the Refugee Convention. His testimony in this regard was straightforward and unembellished. The panel finds him a credible witness.\n[7] AC1 was a XXXX with the XXXX 2001 to XXXX 2009. According to a table entitled \u201cDetails of XXXX\u201d[iv], AC1 declared that this duties included XXX. He testified that, during his service, he was a XXXX and at certain periods, XXXX attached to the XXXX. His duties included XXXX and XXXX. When curfews were enforced, the police would be brought into joint operations with the Jamaica Defence Force to check citizens\u2019 identification cards and maintain law and order. He further testified that he had neither committed a crime against peace, a war crime or a crime against humanity. There is insufficient evidence to establish that the actions of AC1, as a XXXX (including when he was engaged in operations with the XXXX),\nled to any of the proscribed acts. Further, AC1 did not hold a high rank within the XXXX and his duties and activities do not demonstrate a link with any of the proscribed acts. Therefore, in consideration of AC1 \u2018s credible testimony, the panel finds that there is insufficient evidence to establish that there are serious reasons for considering that he had made a knowing, significant and voluntary contribution or was complicit to a crime against humanity. As such, the panel finds that AC1 is not excluded under Article 1F(a) of the Refugee Convention.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[8] The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimants\u2019 personal and national identities have been established by their Jamaican passports, Elector Registration Identification Cards, birth certificates[v] and testimonies.\nNexus\n[9] The panel finds that AC1 has established a nexus to section 96 of the IRPA by reason of his membership in a particular social group based on his sexual orientation as a bisexual man. The panel finds that PC, AC2 and the minor associate claimants have also established a nexus to section 96 of the IRPA by reason of their membership in a particular social group because of their familial relationship with AC1 (i.e. as the immediate family members of a bisexual man in Jamaica who have also been harassed and threatened).\nCredibility\n[10] The panel finds the adult claimants credible. Their testimonies were spontaneous, responsive, consistent with each other and in keeping with their BOC narratives and supporting documents. For the following reasons, the panel finds that AC1 has credibly established his sexual orientation as a bisexual man.\n[11] AC1 provided detailed and specific testimony of his experiences in Jamaica as a bisexual man, including when and how he discovered his sexual orientation; how he feels when he is around the same sex as opposed to the opposite sex; how he had tried to keep his sexual orientation from his family and the community for fear of reprisal; and how he has intimacy issues with the opposite sex, including his former girlfriend and PC. His provided a realistically detailed account of the mistreatment and harassment he received from those who had suspicions about his sexual orientation, including staring and finger pointing, rumours, verbal abuse, segregation and death threats. He testified that he ended his service with the XXXX because fellow officers taunted him by saying that he was in breach of the buggery law. PC and AC2 also provided detailed and specific testimony about the difficulties of having a family member who is bisexual and how they and the minor associate claimants were stigmatized, bullied and threatened by the community because of their association with AC1. In particular, AC2 told the panel that she and the minor associate claimants have had to miss school due to the bullying and threats. The adult claimants were able to provide the kind and level of details one would expect from someone telling their own story. In support of their testimony, the claimants provided letters of support from family members and relatives and AC1 \u2018s registration with the XXXX in Canada[vi]. The panel finds no valid reason to doubt the authenticity of these documents and affords them full weight. The letter of support from AC1\u2019s mother is particularly compelling, considering how difficult it must have been for her to acknowledge and confirm her son\u2019s sexual orientation. On a balance of probabilities, the panel finds that the persuasive testimonies of the adult claimants, coupled with their credible supporting documents, established that AC1 is a bisexual man and that the claimants were harassed and mistreated by the Jamaican society due to his sexual orientation.\n[12] AC1 testified that he did not have any intimate same-sex relationships in Jamaica. He did, however, have a same-sex highschool friend, PS, whom he finds sexually attractive and wishes to be intimate with. AC1 explained that, given that the Jamaican society was homophobic, he had never engaged in any same-sex relationships because he feared for his life. In light of the objective evidence that members of the LGBTQ+ community in Jamaica face arrest, detention and prosecution for their sexuality under the law[vii], the panel finds this explanation reasonable. When asked why he did not have any letter of support from or photos or text messages with PS, AC1 explained that although he has PS\u2019 telephone number, they do not speak often and PS does not know that he is currently in Canada. Given the homophobic climate of Jamaica and that AC1 had been concealing his sexual orientation for the most part of his life, the panel finds that it is not unreasonable for him not to have any corroborative evidence about his attractions towards PS and therefore no negative credibility inference is drawn against AC1 in this regard. On a balance of probabilities, the panel finds that AC1 has established that he is attracted to his same-sex friend, PS, which further supports his credible testimony that he is a bisexual man.\n[13] AC1 also testified that he did not have any same-sex relationships in Canada. When asked why this is the case, AC1 explained that he is working on trying to suppress his same-sex urges so that he is able to build a connection with PC, given that she loves him and has been very patient with him throughout the years. The panel accepts this explanation, noting from Guideline 9 that a panel should not assume that (a) SOGIESC individuals would not have had heterosexual sexual experiences or relations or would not voluntarily enter a heterosexual marriage or have children; or (b) SOGIESC individuals would necessarily act upon their attractions by engaging in same-sex activity. The panel therefore finds the fact that AC1 chooses to maintain a relationship with PC instead of having a same-sex relationship does not detract from the credibility of his sexual orientation as a bisexual man. The panel accepts that departures from one\u2019s true sexual orientation are not necessarily indicative of a lack of credibility and therefore no negative credibility inference is drawn against AC1 in this regard.\n[14] Having considered the adult claimants\u2019 testimonies and their supporting documents, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that AC1 has credibly established his sexual orientation as a bisexual man. Correspondingly, the panel finds that PC, AC2 and the minor associate claimants are the immediate family members of a bisexual man and are at risk of persecution because family members of LGBTQ+ persons are targeted in Jamaica.\n[15] The panel notes that PC and AC1 had made multiple trips to the US and returned to Jamaica thereafter. PC explained that his trips were predominantly work-related and AC1 explained that she had made several trips to visit and help her friend who had just given birth to a newborn. Both testified that they did not know about the asylum process in the US and had returned to Jamaica because they still had their family and children there. The panel accepts these explanations because both PC and AC1 were raised in a society in which same-sex relationships are illegal and considered a taboo. This is not something that they would openly discuss and make inquiries about. Under such circumstances, it is not for PC and AC1 not to have claimed asylum in the US on the ground of AC1\u2019s sexual orientation. It is also not unreasonable for a parent to return to their children, despite the dangers that exist in their country of reference.\n[16] The claimants delayed leaving Jamaica and left at different time periods between 2020 and 2021. While PC and AC1 obtained their Canadian visas in XXXX 2019, AC2 and the minor associate claimants did not obtain theirs until XXXX 2019. It is understandable that a parent would delay leaving their country of reference until their children also secured valid Canadian visas. PC (who was pregnant at the time) and her youngest child (XXXX) left in XXXX 2020, followed by AC1 in XXXX 2020 and AC2 and XXXX in 2021. The COVID pandemic also contributed to their delay. In the light of the above circumstances and the uncertainties caused by the COVID pandemic, the panel does not draw any negative inference from the claimants\u2019 delay in leaving.\n[17] The claimants also delayed making a refugee claim until the entire family was reunited in Canada. They submitted their claims in February 2022. It is understandable for the claimants not to have made a claim until AC2 and XXXX arrived in XXXX 2021 because they are a family unit. In any event, the panel notes that delay is not determinative of a claim. Given that the panel finds that AC1 has credibly established that he is a bisexual man and that PC, AC2 and the minor associate claimants are the immediate family members of a bisexual man, the delay in claiming does not impact their forward-looking subjective fear of persecution based on their membership in a particular social group, namely bisexual men and family members of a bisexual man in Jamaica respectively.\n[18] The claimants\u2019 subjective fear is supported by the objective evidence in the National Documentation Package for Jamaica and the country documentation that they submitted to support their claims.[viii] According to the objective evidence, same-sex acts between men are criminalised in Jamaica. Therefore, members of the LGBTQ+ community face arrest, detention and prosecution for their sexuality under the law[ix]. Physical and sexual violence, including severe beatings and even murder, are part of the lived reality of SOGIESC individuals in Jamaica. The level of brutality leads many to fear what could happen if their sexual orientation or gender identity is disclosed[x]. Sources indicates that homophobia is widespread in Jamaica and is considered to be a \u201ccultural norm\u201d. As a result, members of the LGBTQ+ community \u201cface both general societal discrimination as well as discrimination in access to services, including healthcare, housing, and employment\u201d[xi].\n[19] The U.S. Department of State\u2019s most recent report on human rights in Jamaica states that the law does not extend anti-discrimination protection to SOGIESC persons, and the law \u201clegitimizes violence toward LGBTI persons\u201d[xii]. Harassment and violence against SOGIESC individuals are frequently ignored by the police and discrimination is pervasive[xiii]. The objective evidence also indicates that that family members of individuals with diverse SOGIESC are affected by stigma in Jamaica. According to a 2019 LGBT Community Experience and Needs Assessment Survey Report, 11% of respondents experienced blackmail and threats of exposure to family[xiv]. An official at J-FLAG, a prominent LGBT NGO, withdrew his petition against Jamaica\u2019s buggery law due to threats against himself and his family[xv]. The above is in line with PC and AC2\u2032 s testimonies of their experience of being stigmatized, bullied and threatened due to their association with AC1, a bisexual man.\n[20] Based on the objective evidence which shows the persecution of SOGIESC individuals and their family members in Jamaica, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that there is an objective basis for the claimants\u2019 subjective fear by reason of AC1 \u2018s sexual orientation as a bisexual man and their association with him. The panel therefore finds that the claimants have established a well-founded fear of persecution in Jamaica based on their membership in a social group, namely bisexual men and family members of a bisexual man in Jamaica respectively.\nSTATE PROTECTION\n[21] There is a presumption that states are capable of protection their citizens unless it is in a state of complete breakdown[xvi]. The claimants bear the burden of rebutting that presumption.\n[22] Sources report that \u201charassment of and violence against LGBT+ people remains a major concern and is frequently ignored by the police\u201d[xvii]. Human Rights Watch provides that police officers have continued to respond to reports of homophobic violence with derogatory comments and inaction[xviii]. The above supports AC1 \u2018s testimony that he would be taunted by his fellow XXXX which was why he XXXX.\n[23] In spite of procedures that the Jamaican government has put in place, it has so far failed to prevent and protect against violence and discrimination, or to punish the perpetrators of crimes\nagainst LGBT persons. In some cases, rogue police officers themselves are perpetrators of violence and extortion against LGBT people. There remains a prevalence of homophobic attitudes within the police force and some police protection remains inadequate. Consequently, there is continuing evidence that LGBT people are not provided with adequate protection and that the authorities fail to punish those responsible for such human rights abuses[xix].\n[24] Paragraph 8.6.4 of Guideline 9 also provides that \u201c[t]he existence of laws criminalizing non-conforming sexual orientations, sexual behaviours, gender identities or expressions, or sex characteristics and the enforcement of these laws by the state may be evidence that state protection is inadequate. Even if irregularly enforced, the criminalization of the existence or behaviours of SOGIESC individuals may create a climate of impunity for perpetrators of violence and normalize acts of blackmail, sexual abuse, violence, and extortion by state and non-state actors\u201d.\n[25] The panel is persuaded by the objective documentary evidence that it would be unreasonable to expect the claimants to seek protection from the Jamaican police and authorities as, in some cases, they may be the agents of persecution. The claimants have therefore rebutted the presumption of state protection. Accordingly, the panel finds that there is no adequate state protection available to the claimants in their circumstances.\nINTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE (IFA)\n[26] Jamaica is a small island country. It is clear from country documentation that LGBT individuals face persecution throughout Jamaica. If returned to Jamaica, AC1 would be forced to conceal his sexual orientation, which he has been doing for the most part of his life. Paragraph\n8.7.1 of Guideline 9 states that it is well-established in law that an IFAis not viable if a SOGIESC individual must conceal their SOGIESC in order to live in that location. As such, AC1 cannot be expected to conceal his sexual orientation as a way to avoid persecution. Further, the homophobic climate and oppressive treatment towards the families of LGBT individuals are supported by objective evidence cited above. It would not be safe for PC, AC2 and the minor claimants to relocate within Jamaica, given their familial association with a bisexual man. The panel therefore finds that there is a serious possibility of persecution for the claimants throughout Jamaica and therefore they do not have a viable IFA.\nCONCLUSION\n[27] The panel finds that the AC1 has demonstrated that he faces a serious possibility of persecution in Jamaica on the basis of his sexual orientation as a bisexual man. The panel further finds that PC, AC2 and the minor associate claimants have demonstrated that they face a serious possibility of persecution in Jamaica on the basis of their familial association with a bisexual man. The panel finds that they are Convention refugees pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA. Their claims for protection are accepted.\n(signed) Christine Tam\nDecember 20, 2022\n\n[i] Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.

In 2016 the mother learned that XXXX pesos had been stolen from the judiciary\u2019s bank account and placed in accounts unrelated to the judiciary department. On XXXX, 2016, when XXXX was murdered, the principle claimant\u2019s mother was told by government authorities and the police to keep the situation quiet. On XXXX 2016 the principle claimant\u2019s mother was physically assaulted by two men who identified themselves as members of La Familia Michoacana. The men advised the principle claimant\u2019s mother that the government worked for them. On XXXX 2019 a young man was assassinated in front of the home of the principle claimant\u2019 s mother. Police did not respond when they were called. Months later, while in a car, the principle claimant\u2019 s mother and her partner where shot at which caused the mother to XXXX. The principle claimant\u2019s mother fled to Canada where her claim for refugee protection was accepted on February 2, 2021.\n[4] After her mother left the country, the principle claimant moved from her mother\u2019s home to the home of an aunt. Beginning in XXXX 2019 the principle claimant became aware of two men appearing in her area. By XXXX 2020, the principle claimant saw the same two men almost everyday. On a few occasions the principle claimant and associate claimant saw one of the two men following them while they were in their car.\n[5] On XXXX, 2020 the claimants relocated to the home of the principle claimant\u2019s mother\nbecause of a family dispute with the principle claimant\u2019s aunt. Shortly thereafter, a neighbour informed the principle claimant that a stranger had been inquiring about her mother. The principle claimant began to notice that she was again being tailed.\n[6] On XXXX 2020 the principle claimant learned she was pregnant. On XXXX, 2021 the principle claimant was physically assaulted at her home by two men who were looking for her mother. The men threatened to kill the principle claimant if she did not disdose the whereabouts of her mother. As a result of the assault, the principle claimant XXXX. When the associate claimant attempted to report the assault of XXXX, 2021 on the principle claimant, the authorities refused to accept their complaint because the attackers could not be identified. The claimants moved to the home of the associate claimant\u2019s parents. Within a few days, two men began to tail the claimants. On XXXX 2021, while driving in the city of XXXX 40 minutes from home, the claimants were followed. Subsequently, the claimants were directed by a police officer to the office of a lawyer who informed them that he could file a notarized document for them.\n[7] The claimants arrived in Canada on XXXX, 2022 and made claims for refugee protection on June 21, 2022.\nDesignated Representative\n[8] The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act requires the designation of a representative for all claimants less than 18 years of age.[3] For the purposes of the claims for refugee protection, in accordance with subsection 167(2) of the IRPA, the RPD appointed the principle claimant to be the Designated Representative for the minor claimant. At the beginning of the hearing, the principle claimant affirmed her willingness to be the Designated Representative for the minor claimant.\nThe hearing\n[9] The hearing was held by videoconference using Microsoft Teams.\nDETERMINATION\n[1O] I find that the principle claimant, XXXX is a person in need of protection pursuant to section 97(1) of the IRPA.\nANALYSIS\n[11] The issues in this claim, as outlined at the beginning of the hearing, are:\nNexusCredibilityInternal Flight AlternativeIdentity\n[12] The claimants\u2019 personal identities and country of citizenship have been established, on a balance of probabilities, as per certified true copies of their passports.[4]\nNexus\n[13] Considering section 96 of the IRPA, the principle claimant testified that she fears returning to Mexico because of actions against her and her family of La Familia Michoacana criminal organization. When asked why the cartel members have continued to search for her mother for more than three years, the principle claimant stated that the cartel members want the money that has gone missing. I find persuasive the decision in Bulbarela[5] where the court stated that, \u201c[t]he law is, I believe, settled that neither fear ofreprisals constituting revenge or a personal vendetta, nor fear of criminal acts, constitutes a fear of persecution linked to a Convention ground.\u201d\n[14] Therefore, I find that the claims have no nexus under section 96 of the IRPA. I have, thus, considered the claims under section 97(1) of the IRPA\nCredibility\nOral Testimony\n[15] I found the principle claimant testified in a forthright manner. She made no apparent attempts to embellish her claim. I find the principle claimant to be a credible witness and I have identified no material contradictions, inconsistencies, or discrepancies in her telling of her story. Through her testimony the principle claimant provided a detailed account of events in Mexico which caused the claimants to :flee Mexico and seek refugee protection. Through her testimony the principle claimant established the core elements of her claim.\nPersonal Documentary Evidence\n[16] The claimants provided documentary evidence to support their claims. These include: i) a medical report, issued XXXX 2021, diagnosing the principle claimant\u2019s XXXX caused by a physical assault,[6] ii) a letter from the XXXX issued XXXX 2021, describing the attack upon the principle claimant which XXXX,[7] iii) a letter from the associate claimant\u2019s sister providing information regarding the attack on the principle claimant of XXXX 2021,[8] iv) a letter from the associate claimant\u2019s parents providing information regarding the refusal of Mexican authorities to accept a report of the attack on the principle claimant of XXX 2021,[9] v) a notarized document, issued XXXX 2021 by lawyer XXXX, outlining the tailing of the principle claimant by two unknown persons,[10] and vi) a letter from the XXXX issued XXXX 2021, which outlines the events of 2021 that caused the claimants to flee Mexico[11].\n[17] The claimants also provided documentary evidence associated with the claim of the principle claimant\u2019s mother. These include: i) the mother\u2019s BOC,[12] ii) a letter to be served for legal proceedings, dated XXXX 2019, outlining events in the mother\u2019s professional life that subsequently led her to flee Mexico,[13] a medical certificate outlining injuries sustained by the principle claimant\u2019s mother and subsequent hospitalization in XXXX 2017,[14] iii) photographs of the injuries sustained by the mother in XXXX 2016,[15] iv) a letter from the XXXX issued XXXX, 2018, informing the mother of continued personal protection for her and her family,[16] v) the RPD decision accepting the claim of the mother for refugee protection, dated XXXX 2021[17].\n[18] I give significant evidentiary weight to the documents provided by the claimants. I find that the claimants\u2019 personal evidence is genuine, reliable, probative and corroborates the allegations of the principle claimant.\n[19] I find that the principle claimant has established her allegations, on a balance of probabilities, and has credibly established a subjective basis for her fear, her husband\u2019s fear, and the minor claimant\u2019s fear of persecution in Mexico. I have, therefore, considered the objective evidence in this case.\nObjective Evidence\n[20] A 2020 InSight Crime report indicates that La Familia Michoacana cartel is very much still active today and partaking in drug trafficking, kidnapping and extortion activities.[18] The report corroborates the notorious ability of the cartel to corrupt government officials due partly to the excessive profits from the cartel\u2019s illegal drug related activities. The objective evidence also indicates that La Familia Michoacana resorts to physical abuse including torture and death to silence those who disclose its involvement in corruption.\n[21] I am satisfied that the objective evidence provides an objective basis for the claimants\u2019 fear of persecution at the hands of La Familia Michoacana because of their relationship with the principle claimant\u2019s mother.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[22] At the outset of the hearing, I proposed Merida and Campeche as potential IFA locations. The objective evidence indicates that La Familia Michoacana cartel operates in the southwestern region of Mexico,[19] and the IFA locales are outside of the cartel\u2019s area[20].\n[23] Internal flight alternative arises when the claimant, who otherwise meets all the elements of the Convention refugee definition, is able to find refuge in a part of his or her country of citizenship where there is nota serious possibility of being persecuted and that that location would not be unreasonable, in all circumstances, including those particular to the claimant, for him or her to seek refuge there. The basis for this two-pronged test is the cases of Rasaratnam[21] and Thirunavukkarasu[22]. The test asks two questions:\nThe Board must be satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that there is no serious possibility of the claimant being persecuted in the part of the country to which it finds an IFA exists.[23]Conditions in that part of the country considered to be an IFA must be such that it would not be unreasonable in all the circumstances, including those particular to the claimant, for him or her to seek refuge there.[24][24] Claimants bear the burden of proof to show that they face a serious possibility or reasonable chance of persecution in the entire country and specifically in the potential IFA areas named.\nFirst Prong\n[25] As stated earlier in this decision, the cartel continues to search for the principle claimant\u2019s mother because of a large amount of money that is missing. This testimony is corroborated by the evidence in the mother\u2019s claim for protection. I, thus, find that the agents of persecution are motivated to locate the mother through the principle claimant and her family.\n[26] Regarding the capacity of the agents of persecution to locate the claimants, the principle claimant argued that the cartel would be able to locate her anywhere in Mexico. She stated that the cartel is connected to other cartels in Mexico, and it utilizes different methods to track individuals throughout the country, even outside their areas of operation.\n[27] The objective evidence supports the principle claimant\u2019s testimony. One Response to Information Request (RIR)[25] addresses the issue of the ability of cartels to track individuals outside their areas of operation, citing methods used by Los Zetas cartel to establish a network among the Mexican cartels:\nAccording to the 2014 Popular Science article, Los Zetas set up a communications network across Mexico using cameras and radios, allowing them to monitor \u201cever[y ]\u201d aspect of their drug trafficking network, and communicate covertly (Popular Science 25 Mar. 2014). According to a DEA agent quoted by the same source, \u201c\u2018[i]t essentially linked all the different members of the cartel-the people doing the trafficking and the people doing the protection-so there was a communication between them\u201d\u2018 (Popular Science 25 Mar. 2014). Sources indicate that this system allowed Los Zetas to monitor drug trafficking within Mexico, into Guatemala (Popular Science 25 Mar. 2014; Wired 27 Dec. 2011) and along the border with the US (Popular Science 25 Mar. 2014). The Popular Science article indicates that the network was used to plan attacks and seize territory held by other groups (Popular Science 25 Mar. 2014). Other sources state that its primary purpose was surveillance (Wired 27 Dec. 2011) or \u201coff the grid\u201d communication (Stratfor 13 Sept. 2011). According to the Popular Science article, the network could be managed remotely, connecting members from different areas to coordinate and communicate about operations (Popular Science 25 Mar. 2014). The article further explains that the cartel uses ground-level informants to gather information.[26]\n[28] The same RIR states that cartels use family networks and private investigators to track people, as well as property records in the US and Mexico and place GPS trackers on cars (Assistant Professor, May 28, 2019). Similarly, Texas Monthly, a magazine covering issues such as politics, the environment, industry, and education reports that an attorney with ties to drug cartel leaders, who had been providing information to the US government, was located by means including a GPS tracker on his car and cameras in his neighbourhood. The assistant professor stated that a large debt or a personal vendetta could motivate a gang to track someone outside of their area and that gangs can use \u201ccorrupt law enforcement agents\u201d to obtain information about people they pursue. Further, in order to extend their influence beyond their areas of operation, cartels rely on the \u201crepresentation\u201d they have in other areas.[27]\n[29] Another RIR states that cartels such as La Familia Michoacan and Los Zetas operate on the same basis\/foundation for tracking individuals within Mexico.[28]\n[30] A further RIR states that if a criminal group has a very strong motivation to find and retaliate against a certain person, especially if the criminal group were one of the more powerful groups in Mexico, then the ability to track or retaliate against a certain person would be a reasonable concern to have and that if organized crime groups in other parts of Mexico are interested and willing to retaliate against people in Mexico City, they could doit easily.[29]\n[31] I find that the cartel has both the motivation and the means to track the claimants throughout Mexico, including in the IFA locations.\n[32] The cartel members have shown a strong interest in pursing the principle claimant. They believe the principle claimant can lead them to her mother. The cartel followed the principle claimant from the time her mother left Mexico in 2019. The cartel beat the principle claimant and threatened her life and the lives of her family.\n[33] For all of the above reasons, I find on a balance of probabilities that the La Familia Michoacana cartel has the means and motivation to pursue the principle claimant throughout Mexico and that the principle claimant therefore does not have a viable IFA within the country. She faces a risk to her life throughout Mexico.\n[34] Since the first prong of the IFA test fails, it is unnecessary to consider the second prong.\nCONCLUSION\n[35] For the foregoing reasons, I conclude that the principle claimant is a person in need of protection within the meaning of subsection 97(1)(b) of the IRPA. Therefore, I accept her claim.\n[36] The claims of the associate claimant and the minor claimant are dependent upon the claim of the principle claimant. I, therefore, find that the associate claimant and the minor claimant are persons in need of protection within the meaning of subsection 97(1) of the IRPA. Therefore, I accept their claims.\n(signed) Leslie Mason\nNovember 21, 2022\n\n[1] Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c.27, sections 96, 97(l)(a) and 97(l)(b).\n\n[2] Exhibit 2.1\n\n[3] IRPA, supra, footnote 1.\n\n[4] Exhibit 1.\n\n[5] Bulbarela, Oscar Cessa v.

In summary, the claimant is a 51year old Sikh XXXX who fears persecution at the hands of the Punjab police on the basis of an imputed political opinion. The claimant alleges that he was unlawfully arrested twice by Punjab police officers (police), who took his fingerprints, photos, and signatures on blank papers while the claimant was in custody. The police allegedly falsely accused the claimant of being a militant and a mediator between Muslim and Sikh militants.\nDETERMINATION\n[3] Having considered all of the evidence, including the claimant\u2019 s testimony, the panel finds that the claimant has established a well-founded fear of persecution based on a Convention ground. The panel concludes that the claimant is a \u201cConvention refugee\u201d as per section 96 of the IRPA.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[4] The claimant established his personal identity and nationality on a balance of probabilities, through his testimony and a copy of his Indian Passport.[2]\nNexus\n[5] The claimant allegedly fears for his life due to an imputed political opinion of being a militant. As such, his claim has been analyzed pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA.\nCredibility\n[6] In assessing the credibility of the evidence presented by the claimant in support of his refugee claim, the panel is guided by the principles established in the Federal Court of Appeal\u2019s decision of Maldonado.[3] The principle asserted in Maldonado is that \u201cwhen a refugee claimant swears to the truth of certain allegations, a presumption is created that those allegations are true unless there are reasons to doubt their truthfulness.\u201d The claimant testified in a spontaneous, persuasive, and straightforward manner and there were no major inconsistencies in his evidence that were not reasonably explained. The claimant\u2019s testimony was relevant and probative toward establishing his credibility.\n[7] The claimant testified that he is a XXXX and XXXX in Punjab. The claimant testified that he assisted a young man (F.K) to gain employment at the place that he worked, and he also provided shelter for him between XXXX to XXXX 2014. The claimant testified that F.K\u2019s friends often visited F.K at the claimant\u2019s place even though the claimant did not know them personally. The Punjab Police alleges that F.K was linked with militants. The claimant testified that he has been unlawfully arrested twice, tortured, and falsely accused of being a militant by the Punjab police. The claimant testified that the Punjab police had to be bribed heavily before they released him and that they took his photograph, fingerprints, and signature on blank sheets of paper. The claimant testified that asides the two unlawful arrests, the Punjab police often harassed and raided his house and questioned him about militants. The claimant testified that the Punjab police claimed that the militants in their custody admitted links with the claimant, and that the militants in their custody, who were F.K\u2019s friends had the claimant\u2019s name in their diaries because they visit F.K at his home.\n[8] The claimant testified that he has no links to militants, and he is nota militant. The claimant testified that he became a target of the Punjab police because he provided shelter to F.K, and welcomed F.K\u2019s friends as guests. The Punjab police officers claim that F.K and his friends are militants. The claimant testified that the Punjab police became more aggressive with him when they discovered that he consulted an advocate for legal recourse. The claimant testified that the Punjab police physically assaulted him and asked him about the location where militants keep their weapons and where F.K and friends are located, and they assaulted him because he did not know and could not provide the answers that the Punjab police wanted. The claimant testified that the police harassed and exploited his relatives in Chandigarh. The claimant testified that the Punjab police believe that he is a militant aiding the militants in India while he is abroad and that they continue to harass his relatives about when he would return.\nDelay In Claiming\n[9] The claimant arrived in Canada in XXXX 2014, and he sought refugee protection in May 2019. The claimant explained that he delayed seeking protection because the agent that assisted him in fleeing India, told him he should only speak with a particular set of people and agents. He explained that he trusted the agent and paid for the services of the agents, who then delayed and threatened him multiple times. The agency never got the work permit that they promised to assist him with, and they deceived and defrauded him. The claimant provided a copy of an article corroborating that the agency had defrauded many people, the article is located in exhibit 5. The panel is empathetic about the deceit and exploitation that the claimant faced at the hands of these agents. However, the panel finds that the explanation is not reasonable because he faced a risk of getting remove to a country that he feared and because waiting almost five years for uncooperative agents is not reasonable. The panel finds that it is reasonable to expect that the claimant should have sought out alternative professional immigration advice to avoid the risk of being removed. The panel draws an adverse finding in this regard. However, this adverse finding does not outweigh the cumulative credible evidence in this claim.\n[10] Apart from his oral testimony, the claimant has also submitted corroborating documentary evidence to support his claim. This evidence is part of Exhibit 4. The panel has no reason to doubt the genuineness of these documents and accepts them as genuine and the panel assigns the documents high weight due to their probative value and relevance. Exhibit 4 contains but is not limited to the following documents:\nAffidavit from the claimant\u2019s wife: corroborating the claimant\u2019s allegation of unlawful arrest, continuous harassment of the claimant and his, wife and relatives by the Punjab and Chandigarh police and a continuing interest in the claimant by the Punjab police. the affidavit also corroborates the claimant\u2019s intention to seek legal resolution by consulting an advocate. The affidavit also states that the Punjab police have now claimed that the claimant must be a militant that is assisting other militants from outside India.Affidavit from the claimant\u2019s aunt: corroborating the claimant\u2019s allegations, including the claimant\u2019s move to Chandigarh to avoid harassment from the Punjab police and the Chandigarh police\u2019 search for the claimant.Affidavit from the Sarpanch: corroborating the details of the two unlawful arrests of the claimant by the Punjab police. The bribe paid for the release, the false accusations that the claimant is linked to militancy and the continuing interest in the claimant by the Punjab police.Flyers and posters that corroborate that the claimant is a XXXX.[11] Given that there are no serious credibility issues with respect to the claimant\u2019s allegations, coupled with the documentary evidence set out above, the panel finds on a balance of probabilities that the claimant has been falsely accused by the Punjab police of being a militant because he provided shelter to a suspected militant, F.K. and for hosting F.K\u2019s friends who are suspected to be militants too. The panel finds that the claimant has established his subjective fear of persecution based on a perceived political opinion as a militant.\nObjective Evidence\n[12] The claimant has established his subjective fear and the panel finds that the subjective fear is objectively well founded by the documents in the National Documentation Package (NDP) located in exhibit 3.\n[13] The National Documentation Package (NDP) corroborates police abuse being a significant human rights concern in India. Item 2.1 of the NDP, The US Department of State report refers to extrajudicial killings, torture, arbitrary arrest, and detention by police, as well as widespread corruption and impunity. Item 10.1 of the NDP states that the police use Torture to punish, to gather information or to coerce confessions with impunity. Those seeking accountability for police abuse often face intimidation and threats. In item 2.1 of the NDP there are reports about security forces torturing, raping, and mistreating insurgents, and alleged terrorists in custody, as well as reports of government agents committing extrajudicial killings of suspected criminal and insurgents. Item 4.9 of the NDP reports that Punjab police believes that militancy is returning to the state. Item 12.4 reports that Sikh youths were arrested by Punjab police for allegedly attempting to revive militancy in Punjab. The same item 4.9 of the NDP further reports that there has been regular arrest of alleged terrorists often based on false charges and the arrests are used as a tool to silence or harass political opponents.\n[14] Item 1.4 of the NDP states that certain individuals are often charged with terrorism related cases which can result in being detained for years before being released due to a lack of evidence. Item 4.9 of the NDP reports that there are several notable examples of everyday people who are suspected of associating with Sikh militants and being arrested under ostensible and unverifiable evidence. There are some accused that are sentenced to prolonged sentences including life in prison.\n[15] Item 10.1 of the NDP corroborates the allegation of the police not following proper arrests procedures, which makes suspects more vulnerable to abuse and cover up of police mistreatment.\nThere has been failure to hold police accountable for custodial deaths as internai departmental inquiries to examine wrongdoing rarely find the police culpable. This same item of the NDP supports the allegation that families of victims of police mistreatments leading to custodial deaths, seeking justice often face intimidation and threats. There is information about the persistence of custodial torture and ill-treatment by the police. While there is legislation in place on how lawful arrests should be made, the lack of training and police reforms leads to disregard of the legislation by the police.[4] There are also instances where police officiais are said to intentionally give false evidence and lay false charges against a suspect. Item 10.7 of the NDP gave instances of where terror cases have resulted in acquittais, where the court concluded that false charges were levelled against suspects.\n[16] The panel finds that the claimant\u2019s subjective fear is objectively well-founded, and that on a balance of probabilities the claimant faces a serious possibility of persecution in India based on an imputed political opinion.\nState Protection\n[17] In all refugee claims, a state is presumed to be capable of protecting its citizens unless there is clear and convincing evidence to the contrary. The claimant has been arrested, harassed, falsely accused, and tortured on false accusations of being linked to militancy by the Punjab Police. The Punjab Police force is the agent of persecution. The claimant tried to seek legal recourse and resolution to the Punjab police officers\u2019 harassment and raids by speaking to an Advocate and the Punjab police discovered this and arrested the claimant a second time. The Punjab police were more aggressive with him and falsely accused him of being a militant and attempting to make false complaints against the Punjab police.\n[18] Where agents of the state are the persecutors, claimant\u2019s efforts to seek state protection need not exhaust all avenues of recourse. As set out above, there is objective country evidence indicating a lack of professionalism, high level of abuse and misconduct, and severe corruption and impunity issues within the police forces in India.[5] Further, Item 1.5 of the NDP also confirms that corruption is widespread among all levels of government in India and corruption remains a part of daily life across India with facilitation payments and bribes common, particularly at the local level.[6] Item 4.9 of the NDP reports states that the Punjab police continues to violate the human rights of Sikhs by arresting Sikh youths illegitimately and labelling them with blanket term \u2018dangerous terrorist\u2019. As a result, there is an unwillingness to protect citizens against police misconduct generally. The panel finds that it would be objectively unreasonable for the claimant to seek the protection of the state considering their particular circumstances. As a result, the panel finds that the claimant has rebutted the presumption of state protection.\nInternal Flight Alternative (IFA)\n[19] The panel identified Kolkata and Mumbai as IFAs at the beginning of the hearing. For a refugee claim to succeed, the claimant has the burden to establish that there is no viable internal flight alternative (\u201cIFA\u201d) within his country of nationality. The test for an IFA was articulated by the Federal Court of Appeal in Rasaratnam.[7] For a claim to succeed, claimant bears the burden of satisfying the panel, on a balance of probabilities, that a proposed IFA:\nis not safe from a serious possibility of persecution or from being personally subject to a danger of torture, a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment; or,is objectively unreasonable or unduly harsh in all the circumstances, including those particular to the claimant.[20] The Punjab Police force is the agent of persecution, and the panel has considered whether the Punjab police in India has the means and motivation to track down the claimant in Mumbai and Kolkata. According to the Associate Professor in item 12.8 of the NDP, security services are more likely to focus on separatists or militants because they represent a \u201cperceived political threat to the unity of India.\u201d In item 12.8, a WSO representative states that terrorists are seen as anti\u00ad national can be legitimately targeted for violence. The objective evidence shows that the police as government authorities have the means to pursue the claimant throughout India.\n[21] The claimant testified that he is famous because of his XXXX and XXXX and that in Canada some people recognize him and ask for selfies, thus he would be at risk of being recognized anywhere in India. He testified that he would be easily recognized in other parts oflndia due to his popularity in the Punjab. The claimant testified that after his release from the second unlawful arrest and detention by the Punjab police, he fled to his relatives\u2019 place in Chandigarh. During his time in Chandigarh the Punjab police harassed his wife and relatives leading them to tell them where the claimant was in Chandigarh. The Chandigarh police raided his relatives\u2019 place and arrested his relatives in Chandigarh based on the information they got from his relatives in the Punjab. The claimant has shown that the Punjab police have continuing interest in him by periodically inquiring about him from his relatives. The claimant testified that the Punjab police inquired about him from his wife and relatives as recently as last month.\n[22] The Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and Systems (CCTNS) is a database with information on crime and criminals to interconnect police stations across the country.[8] The aim of the CCTNS is to create a nationwide network that integrates data and records of crime, but it appears to still be a work in progress. According to the June 2018 RIR, while 94% of police stations across India have CCTNS hardware, there are varying levels of implementation of the CCTNS in different states and large disparity in efficiency between police stations.[9] The one area where there appears to be the most robust inter-state police communication is in respect of major crimes like terrorism.[10] Similarly, surveillance schemes implemented in India are particularly focused on terrorism.[11] The police falsely accuse the claimant of being linked to militants and terrorists and so the panel finds on a balance of probabilities that the claimant is considered a persan of interest to the Punjab police. The panel finds that there is a high possibility that the Punjab may use the inter-state police communication in regard to the claimant because the false accusation is in regard to major and serious crimes like terrorism, and militancy.\n[23] The panel has observed that the objective documentary evidence differs on the extent to which the CCTNS is accessible to and used by police across India. However, there is sufficient evidence contained within the NDP to establish that the CCTNS exists in at least some police stations in the states of Mumbai and Kolkata, where the proposed IFAs are located.[12] The NDP also gives some indication that during tenant verifications, tenant information forms are used by police superintendents to inquire in other states as to the criminal history of the tenant and that, while slow, according to some sources responses to these inquiries are generally eventually received.[13] Tenant verifications are routinely conducted for the purpose of confirming that tenants are not wanted criminals, terrorists, or fugitives from the law.[14] The panel finds that the police have the means and ability to find the claimant anywhere in India.\n[24] Given that the claimant has established that the Punjab police have both the means and motivation to pursue him in the IFAs proposed, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that there is a serious possibility of persecution in the proposed IFAs because the claimant is perceived to be a militant who is aiding his co-militants from outside India. The Punjab police continue to harass his family and relatives to inquire about him. The Panel finds that the claimant has established that he faces a serious possibility of persecution throughout India and that there is therefore no viable internal flight alternative for him. Since the first prong of the analysis has not been met, there is no need to assess the second prong.\nCONCLUSION\n[25] Having considered all the evidence, the panel concludes that the claimant has established that he would face a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground should he return to India as set out in section 96 of IRPA. His refugee claim is therefore accepted.\n(signed) Moyosore Sadiq-Soneye\nOctober 7, 2022\n\n[1] Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C.2001, c. 27.\n\n[2] Exhibit 1.\n\n[3] Maldonado, Pedro Enrique Juarez v.

Obazee\nCountry: Nigeria\nRPD Number: TC2-24356\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2022-01960\nATIP Pages: N\/A\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: I have considered your testimony and the other evidence in the case before me, and I am now ready to render my decision orally.\n[2] The claimant XXXX XXXX XXXX, claims to be a citizen of Nigeria, and seeks refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[3] I have considered guideline 4: Gender Considerations in Proceedings Before the Immigration and Refugee Board, and Guideline 9: Proceedings before the Immigration and Refugee Board involving sexual orientation, gender identity and expression and sex characteristics, and have applied them within this decision. The names of all third parties have been reduced to their initials for privacy and safety reasons.\n[4] I find that you are a Convention refugee as you have established on a balance of probabilities, that you meet the definition of a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, that is persecution based on membership in a particular social group bisexual woman.\n[5] The allegations for your claim are outlines in the narrative to your Basis of Claim form at Exhibit 2.\n[6] In summary, that as a bisexual woman you face legal implications and sanctions as well as harm from people in your state, such as the police and your community should you return to Nigeria.\n[7] You allege that you discovered same sex attraction when you were in secondary school and began an intimate relationship with a female classmate BA (ph). When she was caught with another female classmate, there were rumours about you and BA that prompted you to have a boyfriend to cover up your sexual identity. You testified that your next same-sex relationship was with a woman named OB, which lasted less than a year until you both graduated from university.\n[8] You allege that you met your last girlfriend BM, at second-year university through mutual friends. You both went to a club that was tolerant of SOGIESC individuals but unfortunately it was raided by the police. While you managed to escape the police raid, you were later arrested for your sexual orientation.\n[9] You allege being insulted and harassed by your community which impacted your business and led you to leave Nigeria. You allege that the cultural hatred of homosexual activities and the legislation which punishes individuals engaged there in, is a factor everywhere in Nigeria. In other words, you allege that neither state protection nor an internal flight alternative is available to you in Nigeria.\n[10] Your allegations establish a nexus to the Convention ground of a particular social group, specifically bisexual woman. I have therefore analyzed the claim pursuant to section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[11] As bisexual is the term you testified that you identify with, this decision will also refer to bisexual throughout the decision in accordance with the SOGIESC Guideline.\n[12] You have established on a balance of probabilities, your personal and national identity by a copy of your valid Nigerian passport which were seized by the refereeing immigration office and found in Exhibit 1.\n[13] Sworn testimony is presumed to be credible unless there is a valid reason to doubt it. I am cognizant of the difficulties faced by individuals in establishing their claims, including different levels of education, cultural factors and the milieu of the hearing room. Overall, I have found you to be a credible witness.\n[14] You are educated and have worked professionally in Nigeria as an XXXX XXXX for over 10 years. Throughout your testimony you have demonstrated a willingness to ask for clarification when you did not fully understand a question. In light of your overall profile, and your ability to communicate effectively, I reasonably expected you to speak with insight and detail about your aspects of your life related to your sexual orientation. As a result, I inquired extensively about how your understanding of your sexual orientation evolved, how that awareness has impacted you, and how your sexual orientation led you to seeking safety in Canada. I find that you have credibly established your sexual identity.\n[15] You testified about past same-sex relationships and opposite-sex relationships. You were able to answer my questions in a manner which was consistent with what one would expect for relationships of this nature. You described in sufficient details genuine relationships with your ex-girlfriends BA, OB, and BM, and there were no major inconsistencies or omissions with respect to these relationships. You testified of not displaying your affections in public for fear of discovery and arrest, and meeting with your girlfriends at each other home. I therefore find on a balance of probabilities, that you have established that you have engaged in same-sex relationships which supports your profile as a bisexual woman.\n[16] You testified that once you came to Canada in XXXX 2022, you spent more time exploring your sexuality and living more freely, and that you are somewhat open with your sexual orientation.\n[17] You provided a letter of advocacy from the XXXX, and a reference letter from the XXXX XXXX XXXX of Toronto, found in Exhibit 5.4., that confirms your interest and active participation in various 2SLGBTQ+ activities.\n[18] I find these documents credibly establishes your identity and engagement in 2SLGBTQ+ community, and therefore assign them full weight.\n[19] I find your testimony and the documentary evidence credibly further establishes on a balance of probabilities, your profile as a bisexual woman. Specifically, how you express your sexual identity openly which contrasts the way you had to hide your sexual identity in Nigeria.\n[20] You testified in detail about self-identification and exploration in Nigeria with respect to sexual identity as a bisexual person. Which to you means having an attraction to women and men. You testified about how same-sex activity is against the law in Nigeria and that the community punishes same-sex relationships by reporting to the police or what you call jungle justice.\n[21] You described feeling scared of being discovered, so you dated a man to quash rumours of having same-sex attraction with another classmate. You describe the public corporal punishment of your first girlfriend BA, which amplified your fear of aggression and hostile behaviour towards you as a bisexual woman.\n[22 In assessing your overall credibility, I find that your testimony was consistent with someone whose sexual orientation did not conform to societal norms and expectations, and did not comply with national legal requirements. I find that your description of your own strategies for mitigating risks to life and safety, reflected an authentic and lived experience. As well, I find your ability to testify was sincere and the way you spoke was compelling, and answering questions about being publicly outed as bisexual, indicated a significant degree of experience trauma.\n[23] Based on this finding and the credibility of your allegations, I also find you have established your subjective fear of persecution. I further find on a balance of probabilities, that you have an objective basis for your fear of returning to Nigeria because of the documented country conditions.\n[24] The National Documentation Package for Nigeria, which is found at Exhibit 3, have several sources that indicate prosecution based on sexual orientation by the government found at Items 2.1, 2.6, 2.8, 2.9, as well as research found at ITEM 6.2, 6.7,6.11 and 6.12. For example, Item 6.12 indicates that a 2014 law effectively renders illegal all forms of actively supporting or promoting lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex LGBTI rights. According to the law, anyone convicted of entering into a same-sex marriage or civil union may be sentenced to up to 14 years imprisonment. The law also criminalizes the public show of same-sex amorous affection. The report also indicates that LGBTI persons reported increase harassment, threats, discrimination, and incidents of violence against them based on their real or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity, and face a range of discriminatory treatment from societal actors because they are perceived to be different. They are frequently victims of physical violence, and psychological abuse, extortion and discrimination in different aspects of daily life.\n[25] As another example, Item 6.2 states that the harsh laws enforced in Nigeria and its effects on LGBT people had been widely documented. In fact, Nigeria has been cited as one of the most homophobic countries in the world. Not only due to the severity and comprehensiveness of its legislation that criminalizes same-sex relations, but also for the discriminatory and violent treatment given to LGBTI people.\n[26] And finally in Item 6.11 sexual minorities may face violence from family members, of society, and state authorities, and can be killed by community members as a result of their sexual orientation and \/or gender identity and expression.\n[27] To summarize, the National Documentation Package for Nigeria makes multiple references to the maltreatment of both men and women who chose to have same-sex relationships. I am satisfied there is ample evidence of an objective basis for your subjective fear in this case. I find you have demonstrated on a balance of probabilities, that you are a bisexual woman, and that you have experienced persecution in Nigeria because of your sexual orientation.\n[28] I therefore find you have demonstrated a subjective fear of persecution in Nigeria that is objectively well-founded.\n[29] In assessing state protection, there is a presumption that the State can protect its citizens, except in situations where the State is in complete breakdown. As noted in section 8.6.4 of the SOGIESC Guideline, the existence of laws criminalizing nonconforming sexual orientation, sexual behaviours, gender identities or expressions or sex characteristics and the enforcement of these laws by the State, may be evidence that state protection is inadequate.\n[30] As same-sex sexual activity is criminalized in Nigeria and since homophobic violence continues with impunity, I find there is clear and convincing evidence that state protection in Nigeria would not be forthcoming to you as a bisexual woman, should you try to seek it upon return to that country. I find that you have rebutted the presumption of state protection.\n[31] I have also considered whether there is a viable internal flight alternative. It is well established in law that an internal flight alternative is not viable if the SOGIESC individual must conceal their SOGIESC in order to live in that location.\n[32] Given the State\u2019s capacity, the criminalization of same-sex conduct, and homophobic attitudes that exist country-wide, as outlined in the objective evidence cited earlier, I find there is no safe place for you to live openly as a bisexual woman in Nigeria, and nowhere in Nigeria where you would not face a possibility of persecution based on your membership in this particular social group.\n[33] As noted in section 8.7.1 of the SOGIESC Guideline, it is well established in law that an internal flight alternative is not viable if you must conceal your SOGIESC in order to live in that location.\n[34] Therefore, I find that there is no viable internal flight alternative available to you anywhere in that country.\n[35] In conclusion, on the totality of the evidence, I find that you have a serious possibility of persecution in Nigeria on the grounds of membership of a particular social group as a bisexual woman. I find you to be a Convention refugee, and I accept your claim.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

All three (3) claims were heard jointly pursuant to Rule 55 of the Refugee Protection Division Rules.\n[5] At the time of the hearing, XXXX was a minor child and XXXX acted as XXXX designated representative.\n[6] The allegations of the claim can be found in the claimants\u2019 Basis of Claim forms and in the testimony of the claimants.\n[7] The claimants allege a fear of persecution on the basis of their imputed political opinion. In particular, the claimants allege that, should they return to Iran, they would be subject to arrest, detention, and possible prosecution by agents of the State, because the State imputes to them the political opinion of opposing the Iranian government.\n[8] The claimants have established, in my view, a serious possibility of persecution on the Convention ground of political opinion, should they return to Iran, pursuant to section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[9] As such, all three (3) claimants are Convention refugees.\n[10] At the outset of the hearing, I identified credibility as the primary matter for the hearing to focus on. In particular, an assessment of credibility was required to determine whether the claimants were, as alleged, fearful of persecution in Iran, because of their political opinion.\n[11] With respect to identity.\n[12] On file, at Exhibit 1, is a certified copy of each of the claimants\u2019 passports from Iran. Other identification documents can be found at Exhibit 5, submitted by the claimants.\n[13] Through these documents and their testimony, the claimants have established their personal identities and their citizenship of Iran.\n[14] With respect to credibility.\n[15] XXXX and XXXX testified at the hearing.\n[16] Claimants testifying under oath or affirmation are presumed to be telling the truth, unless there are valid reasons to disbelieve the testimony.\n[17] In this case, I find no valid reasons to reject either XXXX or XXXX testimony, with regard to the fear they have of persecution in Iran.\n[18] Both claimants who testified were straightforward in their testimony. Both claimants testified spontaneously and in a forthright manner. There were no major material inconsistencies or contradictions in their testimony. Their testimony was consistent with the narrative found in their Basis of Claim forms, consistent with each other\u2019s testimony, and was supported by a number of documents, submitted as part of Exhibit 5, including letters of support from people who witnessed some of the events that led the claimants to leave Iran.\n[19] XXXX testified that she was first challenged about a political opinion of hers while XXXX in 2008. The result was that she was dismissed from her XXXX XXXX.\n[20] She travelled to Sweden to do a master\u2019s degree and testified that, on her return to Iran, she was questioned at length by custom and immigration officers about her trips outside Iran and her history of making anti-government comments.\n[21] She testified that she was required to sign an undertaking not to make such comments again and she testified that, after this, she found it difficult to get a state-approved job.\n[22] XXXX testified that he made comments while XXXX an XXXX XXXX, regarding the Muslim takeover of Constantinople. He testified that he was summoned to the Herasat Office and informed that he was being fired for making unislamic (ph) comments.\n[23] Both claimants testified about attending a party in XXXX 2020, one (1) where alcohol was served. This party was raided by police and the claimants were arrested, then separated. XXXX was released after a day, upon payment of a fine. XXXX, however, was not released for five (5) days and was mistreated during her detention, including being sexually assaulted.\n[24] Both claimants testified that, after they were released, they felt like they were being monitored and followed. At one (1) point, an anonymous caller telephoned their home to threaten their son and to repeat recent conversations the claimants had had amongst themselves privately, suggesting that their place of residence was being bugged.\n[25] The claimants decided it was no longer safe for them to stay in Iran and left shortly after this.\n[26] As noted, I find the claimants to be credible.\n[27] Taking into account the supporting evidence, I\u2019m satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that both the adult claimants came to the attention of the Iranian government, because of comments they made while XXXX, which could have been viewed as criticism of the Iranian government or its policies.\n[28] I\u2019m satisfied that both adult claimants have been arrested and are now the subject of increased governmental scrutiny.\n[29] I\u2019m satisfied that the claimants have suffered persecution in the past and that they have a fear that such persecution will continue in the future.\n[30] Having found the claimants to have a subjective fear of persecution, I turn to the question of whether this fear has an objective basis.\n[31] As noted above, the claimants have credibly described events and incidents that support the allegation that the Government of Iran believes them to be opposed to the Iranian government.\n[32] Country condition reports in the Immigration and Refugee Board\u2019s National Documentation Package for Iran, dated April 29th, 2022, support the claimants\u2019 allegations that having been publicly branded as being anti-regime, they are now at heightened risk of increased scrutiny. People who have been subject to government scrutiny may have difficulty getting officially sanctioned appointment in the future.\n[33] Item 4.4 of the National Documentation Package for Iran highlights that those who are thought to be anti-government activists may be subject to harassment, arrest, and prosecution in Revolutionary Courts, where the level of procedural fairness is typically lower than at other criminal tribunals in Iran.\n[34] I conclude that all three (3) claimants have an objective basis for their fear of persecution.\n[35] Accordingly, all three (3) claimants have established a well-founded fear of persecution.\n[36] With respect to state protection and internal flight alternative.\n[37] As the State is the agent of persecution, the claimants have no reasonable internal flight alternative within Iran.\n[38] For the same reason, as the State is the agent of persecution, there is clear and convincing evidence that the State is unable or unwilling to protect the claimants against persecution.\n[39] This is my conclusion.\n[40] Based on the evidence before me and the testimony of the two (2) adult claimants, I conclude that all three (3) claimants have established a serious possibility of persecution on the Convention ground of political opinion, if they were to return to Iran.\n[41] All three (3) claimants are, therefore, Convention refugees as described in section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[42] All three (3) claims for protection are accepted.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

I have considered your testimony and the other evidence in the case, and I am ready to render my decision orally.\n[2] You are claiming to be a citizen of the Republic of India and no other country. And you are claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nI ca [sic]\nDETERMINATION\n[3] I find that you are a Convention refugee because you face a serious possibility of persecution. And here are my reasons.\nALLEGATIONS\n[4] You allege the following.\n[5] You are a citizen of India. You allege that you are persecuted because of your decision to become a practising member of the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses.\n[6] In addition, you say that as a Dalit, you are a person who is subjected to rules that include your inability to choose your own religion. And as a result, you say that members of Indian society at large as well as Hindus, as well as extremist Hindus, including the members of the BJP, as well as the police in your home state of Punjab, all are part about the fabric of your persecution. You say that you fear a risk to your life if you were to return to India. And you say that there is no state protection or a viable internal flight alternative for you in India.\nIdentity\n[7] Your personal identity as a citizen of India has been established by your testimony and the supporting documents filed in the exhibits, including the copies of the passport that I found there, which bears your photograph, which you know is unmistakeably you.\n[8] And therefore, I find, on a balance of probabilities, that both personal identity and country of nationality have been established.\nNexus\n[9] I find that there is a link between what you fear and one (1) of the five (5) the Convention grounds, specifically, religion. And further, I find that your claim cannot be properly understood unless we also take into account your membership in a particular social group, Dalits. And so, I find that it is the combination of both of these Convention grounds that represents your risk.\nCredibility\n[10] In terms of your general credibility, I have found you to be a highly credible witness. And I, therefore, accept on a balance of probabilities what you have alleged in your oral testimony as well as in your Basis of Claim form.\n[11] Your testimony and the evidence are presumed to be true. And this includes two (2) major things. Number one (1) that you established with me that you are a Jehovah\u2019s Witness through your credible testimony about your beliefs and what drew you to that faith, and why it is that you believe so deeply that your home is there. And the other thing is that you have established through your credible testimony as well as supporting documents that you are a member of a Dalit caste. And so, I accept these things to be true.\n[12] You also told me that your father was taken into police custody and tortured until he later died because of what happened in there. You have testified to me that your brother has been in hiding since 2018 because of the whole concern that the society around you had with your decision to become a Jehovah\u2019s Witness. And you have also established with me through your credible testimony alone that you were physically attacked.\n[13] And so, I also want to point out that there are documents on file to support your allegations, and these include the medical records of your injuries, your documents to support your membership of a scheduled cast via your father. You provided an affidavit concerning the death of your father after having been in police custody. And so, I find all of these things to have been established, and therefore I find that the claimant has established that he fears death at the hands of the police and death at the hands of members of the general public because of his decision as a Dalit to become a Jehovah\u2019s Witness.\n[14] And I find that the claimant has established his subjective fear of returning to India.\nObjective Basis\n[15] The BJP was named by the claimant as an organization he fears, including its membership. This party is in its second term as a central government of India. During its tenure, intolerance against non-Hindus has been on the rise. India\u2019s Constitution defines the nation as secular, and it protects freedom of religion or belief, including the right to proselytize, as Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses are called upon to do. This is according to the United States Commission on Religious Freedom 2020 report, at Tab 12.2. However, religious freedom, it reports, is \u201csubject to public order\u201d and this has been used to justify anti-conversion laws.\n[16] The BJP has also challenged the secular principles of the constitution by implementing policies that reflect Hindu nationalist ideology. And its rise in extremist violence is documented at Tab 12.8. The Panel accepts this subjective evidence and finds it establishes a climate of hostility in India generally towards non-Hindus.\n[17] Now, the claimant has established he is a member of the Dalit caste, and the objective evidence at Items 13.2 and 13.4 indicate that caste-based discrimination is prevalent everywhere in India.\n[18] Now, one (1) of these documents talks in-depth about the attraction many Dalits feel toward Christianity, including Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, because there is generally a climate in which all church members are treated as equals. Now, the claimant testified that he had not even been allowed to fully practise his Hindu faith because he is a Dalit. However, he testified Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses welcomed him with open arms.\n[19] According to these documents, violence against Dalits continues and that Dalits have been victims of violent attacks by vigilante cow protection groups who are Hindus. These incidents have involved killings, mob violence, assaults, and intimidation, and the Panel accepts this subjective evidence and finds that it establishes the following.\n[20] Number one (1), there is a longstanding hostility in the general Indian population toward Dalits, and there is growing hostility in the general Indian population, which is majority Hindu, towards non-Hindus.\n[21] Furthermore, the objective evidence with regard to the police in India is worthy of consideration, as your counsel pointed out. For this, the Panel relies on Tabs 10.8 and 10.10. These establish that the police in India are a law onto their own. They operate with impunity, and they use torture as a way to extract information. The Panel accepts this objective evidence and finds it corroborates the claimant\u2019s allegation that his father was tortured until he died because of the claimant\u2019s decision to follow the Jehovah\u2019s Witness faith.\n[22] The Panel finds that the claimant has established that there is an objective basis for his objective fear of serious harm, including death. And therefore, I find the claimant has a well-founded fear of persecution.\nState Protection\n[23] Now, the claimant also established through his credible testimony that police did not assist him when he went to them following an attack he suffered. He testified at that time that the police told him he was a Dalit; he should not be a Jehovah\u2019s Witness.\n[24] The claimant established with his credible testimony as well as documentary evidence found at Exhibit 6 that his father died as a result of what he endured in police custody. He testified that his father was arrested by the police, who told the family they expected that the family would produce the claimant. And the Panel accepts this documentary evidence and testimony and finds the police are among the agents of persecution since they have taken up the cause of trying to get hold of the claimant and punish him for his decision to become a Jehovah\u2019s Witness.\n[25] Therefore, I find in these circumstances, it would be unreasonable for the claimant to seek the protection of the police, which is one (1) of the agents of persecution. And I also find that given the objective evidence concerning the police all over India, the claimant would not receive better service from a police force of the central government or the police force of any other jurisdiction.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[26] It is up to the claimant to establish that there is no viable internal flight alternative for him anywhere in India. And the Panel canvassed him about two (2) locations, New Delhi and also the region of Manipur out to the far east of the country, at the farthest point away from Punjab.\n[27] However, the Panel finds that there is no viable internal flight alternative because the objective evidence establishes that wherever there are Hindus, there are Hindu extremists. And everywhere, therefore, there is a risk to the claimant because as a Jehovah\u2019s Witness, and as he testified, he will continue to be a Jehovah\u2019s Witness.\n[28] The Panel finds the objective evidence establishes, and the Panel takes judicial notice that Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses have a firm obligation to spread the word that they believe in to others. And the claimant has testified the same.\n[29] The Panel finds given the climate of hostility everywhere toward Christians as non-Muslims, and toward Dalits, it is very unlikely that the claimant would be able to find a safe place anywhere in India where he could practise his religion openly and freely.\n[30] The Panel, therefore, finds on a balance of probability that there is no viable internal flight alternative for the claimant. The test fails on the first prong, that of safety.\n[31] In conclusion, based on the totality of the evidence, I find the claimant to be a Convention refugee, as he faces a serious possibility of persecution because of his religion and also because of his membership in a particular social group, Dalits. And therefore, his claim is accepted.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

In writing this decision I have considered and applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline for Women Refugee Claimants fearing Gender-Related Persecution. I have considered the claimants\u2019 testimonies and the other evidence in the case and I am ready to render my decision orally.\n[2] The claimants\u2019 allegations are fully set out in their Basis of Claim forms filed as Exhibits 2.1 to 2.3, and the addendum to the narrative filed as Exhibit 7.1. To summarize, the principal and associate claimants allege persecution at the hands of the authorities and drug dealers because of their real or imputed political opinion, namely as anti-drug activists who are critical of the government\u2019s position as it relates to drug dealing. The minor claimant alleges persecution at the hands of the authorities and drug traffickers or drug dealers, because of his membership in a particular social group, namely his familial relationship with the principal and associate claimants. The claimants allege that there is no state protection for them, or an internal flight alternative. I find that the claimants are convention refugees pursuant to Section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. The associate and principal claimants have demonstrated a serious possibility of persecution in India by virtue of their real or perceived political opinion, as anti-drug activists who are critical of the government\u2019s position as it relates to drug dealing.\n[3] The minor claimant has demonstrated a serious possibility of persecution in India by virtue of his membership in a particular social group, namely his familial relationship to the principal and associate claimants. I find that the claimants\u2019 personal and national identities as citizens of India have been established on a balance of probabilities, by the claimants\u2019 testimonies, and their supporting documents; namely their passports issued by the Government of India and filed as part of Exhibit 1.\n[4] I find that there is a link between what the claimants fear and the grounds enumerated in Section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, namely imputed or real political opinion and membership in a particular social group. Therefore, I have assessed the claimants\u2019 claims under Section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. The test under Section 96 is whether there is a serious possibility of persecution should the claimants return to India, and I have found that the claimants have met that test.\n[5] In terms of the claimants\u2019 credibility I generally found the principal and associate claimants to be credible witnesses, and I therefore believe what they have alleged in their oral testimonies and Basis of Claim forms and addendum to the Basis of Claim forms. The principal and associate claimants\u2019 evidence as it pertained to the core elements of the claims was consistent, both internally and with the documentation. The principal and associate claimants were responsive and forthright, they were able to elaborate on their narrative and gave explanations to the questions. The claimants filed documentary evidence to support their claims, which were filed as Exhibits 7.1 to 7.3 and 8. There is no reason to cast any doubt on the veracity of the documentary evidence and as such I place great weight on the evidence to support their claims. Based on the claimants\u2019 testimonies and documentary evidence the claimants have established on a balance of probabilities the following.\n[6] The claimants are of the Sikh faith. The principal and associate claimants became concerned about the number of kids from their village taking drugs. As a result, in or around 2015 the associate claimant and a circle of friends and relatives, including his cousin, XXXX, began XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX to motivate the younger generation so they would not be inclined to use drugs. The drug dealers soon started threatening the associate claimant and his group to stop doing such activities. This claim is supported by the principal and associate claimants\u2019 credible testimonies and narrative, photos of some of the sports activities, and affidavits from the associate claimant\u2019s mother, a neighbour, and a former municipal councillor of the village. These are entered as Exhibits 7.1 and 7.3.\n[7] In XXXX of 2017, the associate claimant and his cousin, XXXX, were going to a relative\u2019s house in Kartarpur, on bike. About six (6) or seven (7) unknown individuals believed to be drug dealers attacked. The associate claimant and his cousin were rescued by local villagers who rushed them to the hospital. The associate claimant tried to file a complaint with the police but because of lack of evidence the police did not pursue the matter further. A few months later the associate claimant\u2019s cousin succumbed to his injuries. The associate claimant explains that he could not get the death certificate for his cousin as XXXX\u2019s father has passed away and his brother lives in the United States. Instead, the associate claimant was able to file a photo of XXXX on the day of his cremation. I find this explanation reasonable in the circumstances. The claim is supported by the principal and associate claimants\u2019 credible testimonies and narrative, the medical report attesting to the associate claimant\u2019s injuries and treatment, affidavits from the associate claimant\u2019s mother, neighbour, and former municipal councillor, and a photo of XXXX on the day of his cremation. These are filed as Exhibits 7.1 and 7.2. The drug dealers hired a man to kill or attack the associate claimant. The associate claimant filed a complaint to XXXX XXXX XXXX of police in Jalandhar City in XXXX 2017. Police arrested someone in connection to the complaint, but he was soon released.\n[8] The associate claimant testified that the drug lords have close ties to the authorities and as such have power over the police. In XXXX 2018 the associate claimant went into hiding in Mumbai, first with a friend who came from his village. With intimidation of the friend\u2019s family in their hometown, the police discovered the whereabouts of the associate claimant. After about five (5) days the associate claimant left his friend\u2019s house in fear of being attacked, and hid in various Sikh temples. The associate claimant fled India with the assistance of an agent in XXXX of 2018. This claim is supported by the principal and associate claimants\u2019 credible testimonies and narrative, chat messages between the person who hired the man to kill the associate claimant and a friend of his cousin\u2019s, and affidavits from the associate claimant\u2019s mother and a former municipal councillor. These are all filed as Exhibits 7.1 and 8.\n[9] In XXXX 2019 the police attended twice at the principal and associate claimants\u2019 residence, looking for the associate claimant. The principal claimant was mistreated by police. In XXXX 2019 the police raided the claimants\u2019 residence and took the principal claimant and her son, the minor claimant, into detention. They were both mistreated by the authorities. Once released, the principal claimant sought medical attention. The principal and minor claimant fled India shortly thereafter. The principal claimant did not have time to get a visa for her younger child, her daughter. The daughter remains in India and is being taken care of by relatives. The claim is supported by the associate and principal claimants\u2019 credible testimonies and narrative, the medical report attesting to the principal claimant\u2019s injuries and treatment, and affidavits from the associate claimant\u2019s mother, a neighbour, and a former municipal councillor, all filed as Exhibit 7.1.\n[10] In Canada, the associate claimant continues to transfer money to assist children in his village in India. The associate claimant filed an affidavit from his mother stating that the police are still looking for them and the latest they came to look for him was in XXXX of 2022. This claim is supported by the associate and principal claimants\u2019 credible testimonies and narrative, the associate claimant\u2019s mother\u2019s affidavit, and proof of money transfer to the recipient from the claimant\u2019s village. These are filed as Exhibits 7.1 and 7.2.\n[11] I find that the claimants\u2019 subjective fear is established by the claimants\u2019 credible testimonies and overall evidence, and I believe that the claimants have alleged on the balance of probabilities. I turn now to the objective basis.\n[12] The National Documentation Package for India dated June 30th, 2022 at Exhibit 3, supports the claimants\u2019 evidence about their subjective fear of arrest, detention, and mistreatment by the police and drug dealers because of the claimants\u2019 alleged anti-drug activism against the government\u2019s position about drug dealing. The National Documentation Package for India confirms that political and human rights activists or those perceived to be such as the claimants, are often harassed and arrested for their political opinion. The United States Department of State Report on Human Rights for 2021 at Exhibit 3, item 2.1 notes that, \u201cIndividuals routinely criticized the government publicly and privately via online platforms; television, radio, or in print media. The government increasingly harassed, arrested, and prosecuted rights defenders, activists, journalists, students, academics, and others critical of the government or its policies\u201d.\n[13] The World Report 2022 on India, at Exhibit 3, item 2.3 also notes that, \u201cCritics of the BJP party, including activists, journalists, peaceful protestors, and even poets, actors, and businesses increasingly risked politically motivated harassment, prosecutions, and tax raises. Authorities shut down rights groups using foreign funding regulations or allegations of financial irregularities\u201d. The National Documentation Package for India also discusses prevalence of drug dealing in India. The United States Overseas Security Advisory Council at Exhibit 3, item 7.1 notes that, \u201cIndia is the leading generic drug manufacturer in the world. Drug traffickers exploit their commercial infrastructure to market dangerous synthetic drugs in the United States or elsewhere\u201d.\n[14] \u201cIndian law enforcement officials have made arrests for trafficking heroin near the Nepal border, with a believed terrorism nexus. Illegal drugs are commonly used and are widely available. Foreign criminal elements have distributed methamphetamine widely in New Delhi and increasingly elsewhere throughout India\u201d. The Asian Centre for Human Rights at Exhibit 3, item 10.8 notes that, \u201cWe are not oblivious to the fact that police in India has to perform a difficult and delicate task, particularly when there are many hardcore criminals like extremist terrorist drug pedallers, smugglers, who have organized gangs that have taken strong roots in the society. Such criminals must be dealt with by the police in an efficient and effective manner so as to bring them to justice by following the rule of law. We are of the view that it would be useful and effective to structure appropriate guidelines to restore faith of the people in the police force. In a society governed by the rule of law it is imperative that extrajudicial killings are properly and independently investigated so that justice may be done\u201d.\n[15] I find that the claimants\u2019 subjective fear of being arrested, detained, and abused should they return to India is supported by the objective country condition evidence. When making a refugee claim a claimant must establish on a balance of probabilities that adequate state protection is not available. There is a presumption that state protection is available and the onus is on the claimant to provide clear and convincing evidence to rebut such presumption. I accept that the associate claimant complained to the authorities at least twice about the threats from the drug dealers. I also accept that in the first instance the police refused to investigate for lack of evidence and in the second instance the man hired to attack or kill the associate claimant, was arrested but released the same day and there was no further outcome.\n[16] The objective country condition reports note, more specifically the United Kingdom Home Office Report at Exhibit 3, item 10.10, that, \u201cCitizens often face substantial obstacles including demands for bribes, in getting the police to file a First Information Report, which is necessary to trigger an investigation for an alleged crime. Corruption within the police force remains a problem\u201d. The same report adds that, \u201cPolice services are undermined by inadequate training and equipment, limited resources, political influence, and corruption. Police investigations are seriously hampered by some police officers refusing to register victims\u2019 complaints, poor quality of investigations, insufficient training and legal knowledge, inadequate and outdated forensic and cyber infrastructure, and a lack of public trust. There are legal remedies for severe police misconduct and corruption, although some victims may be reluctant to report police violations due to fear of retribution\u201d.\n[17] Considering the inadequacy of police services in India, I find that protection would not be reasonably forthcoming in the case of the claimants and there is no adequate state protection available in India for them. I turn now to whether or not there\u2019s an internal flight alternative for the claimants. I raised the issue of an internal flight alternative at the beginning of the hearing and identified Jaipur or New Delhi as the possible internal flight alternative cities. I also canvassed the issue during the hearing. The onus is on the claimants to produce sufficient credible evidence to establish that they face a serious possibility of persecution or a personal risk of torture, or risk to their life, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in the proposed internal flight alternatives. The claimants must establish that the agents of persecution have the means and motivation to harm them in the internal flight alternative. The panel finds that the claimants have met this burden of proof. The panel accepts that although the police have not issued a warrant for the claimants\u2019 arrest or a First Information Report against them, the police are still looking for the claimants; in particular the associate claimant. The panel accept that the associate claimant fled his own town in Jalandhar to live in hiding in Mumbai, a city that is more than 1,500 kilometres away.\n[18] The panel accepts that the police, through intimidation of relatives of the person the associate claimant stayed with, soon discovered his location in Mumbai. The panel accepts that the associate claimant had to continue living in hiding by staying in Sikh temples instead of renting a place where he would have to divulge his identity. The panel also accept that as of XXXX 2022, the police were still looking for the claimants. The panel accept that if the claimants were to return to India to live either in Jaipur or New Delhi, they would have to live in hiding. The Federal Court in Murillo Taborda v. Canada 2013 FC 954 [sic] has held that, \u201cAn internal flight alternative is not viable if the claimant must live in hiding in the internal flight alternative for fear of being discovered by the agent of persecution\u201d. The panel finds that the claimants would be forced to live in hiding should they return to India to live either in New Delhi or Jaipur.\n[19] The Federal Court in Abbas against Canada 2019 FC 1576 has also noted that, \u201cThe size of the internal flight alternative may be misleading where there are family networks and connections that would facilitate an easier access of locating the claimants\u201d, such as is the case in the claimants\u2019 circumstances. The claimants filed affidavits from the associate claimant\u2019s mother, a neighbour, and a former municipal councillor who could be pressured to provide the claimants\u2019 whereabouts should they return to India. The panel also notes that the associate claimant\u2019s location in Mumbai was discovered by intimidation of the family of the friend with whom the associate claimant stayed.\n[20] The Federal Court in Emuze v. Canada 2021 FC 894 also recognizes that the Refugee Protection Division must consider the fact that an agent of persecution found the claimant in another city. I accept that when the associate claimant moved to Mumbai his location was discovered.\n[21] The principal claimant testified that the claimants could not relocate to another part of India because they would have to register their identity to obtain lodging, employment, or access other services, which would lead the police to contact the local authorities who are still looking for the claimants. I note that there are several means for the police to locate the claimants anywhere in India. The objective country condition reports, more specifically, Human Rights Watch at Exhibit 3, item 3.22, discusses the government\u2019s mandatory biometric identification project, Aadhar. \u201cIt is a large-scale collection of personal and biometric data which is linked to a range of services\u201d. In other words, a person requires the Aadhar card to access several government services. Human Rights Watch notes that it raises, \u201cSerious concerns about violations of the right to privacy. There are legitimate concerns about privacy, surveillance, or just misuse of personal information and the government should address these problems instead of coercing people to enrol and link existing services to Aadhar\u201d. The Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada\u2019s Response to Information Request dated May 14th, 2019 and available at Exhibit 3, item 14.8, describes the tenant registration and verification process in India. It notes that, \u201cSuch process aims at detecting criminal background and maintaining a database of people living in a particular area\u201d. It adds that, \u201cThrough police verification the history of any tenant can be verified whether the person had any criminal involvement or absconding from other states\u2019 police\u201d. It also notes that, \u201cTenant registration or verification with local authorities is mandatory. Officers in different states can communicate with each other if they wish to locate someone\u201d.\n[22] In addition, a May 26th, 2021 Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada report at Exhibit 3, item 10.13, discusses police databases and criminal tracking. It describes the Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and Systems, or CCTNS, \u201cLaunched in 2009 as a system with the aim of establishing seamless connectivity among 15,000 police stations across the country, CCTNS entails digitization of data related to First Information Reports, registered cases investigated, and charge sheets filed in all police stations, to develop a national database of crime and criminals\u201d.\n[23] It adds that, \u201cSince 2015 the scope of the CCTNS project was extended beyond establishing a national database of crime or criminal records, to the establishment of an interoperable criminal justice system by integrating data from prisons, courts, prosecution, forensics, police, and fingerprints\u201d. The same report confirms that, \u201cThe National Crime Record Bureau is implementing the CCTNS; as of October 31st, 2020 connectivity was available at 15,620 police stations out of 16,098 police stations, so more than 95 percent in India. Since the launch of the digital portal in 2017, CCTNS enables not only searches for criminals but also suspects. The CCTNS records data not only from First Information Reports but also from the daily recording of events taking place at the police station\u201d.\n[24] Two (2) recent Refugee Appeal Division decisions have found a serious possibility of persecution throughout India, when police are motivated to search for a claimant via various database. In one case, X (Re) 2019 CanLII 133689 at paragraph 20, the Refugee Appeal Division noted that overall the research information in the most recent NDP or National Documentation Package, \u201cSuggests that tenant verification requirements in India could lead to the police in one of the proposed internal flight alternative cities communicating and cross-checking information with the Punjabi police and that this process appears to be supported by a digital portal\u201d. In a second decision in X (Re) 2019 CanLII 133689 at paragraph 20 [sic], the Refugee Appeal Division noted again, \u201cTaking into account the context of refugee determination and on the basis of the current state of the National Documentation Package information, I am prepared to find that there is a reasonable chance that police from Indian states sometimes include in the police national database persons they have interest in who have as yet no criminal record or formal accusations, and that this would as a result come to the attention of the Mumbai or Delhi police through a tenant verification check of the CCTNS\u201d.\n[25] In addition, the evidence supports the proposition that the Punjab police is motivated to pursue the claimants anywhere in India. The evidence establishes that the police enquired about the claimant\u2019s whereabouts with the principal claimant as early as XXXX 2022. I find that the authorities in India still have the motivation to locate the claimants. In conclusion, the police still have the motivation to locate the claimants and there are several possible ways in which the police could come to know of the claimants\u2019 location in any of the internal flight alternative cities; either through the tenant registration and verification process, the mandatory biometrics project, the CCTNS system, or simply through contacts with family and acquaintances. Accordingly, I find that there is no internal flight alternative for the claimants in their particular circumstances.\n[26] And now, Madam Interpreter, will be the conclusion. For the decision, based on the totality of the evidence and for the reasons outlined above, I find that the claimants are convention refugees pursuant to Section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. The principal and associate claimants face a serious possibility of persecution in India because of their imputed or real political opinion as anti-drug activists against the government\u2019s position on drug dealing. The minor claimant faces a serious possibility of persecution in India because of his membership in a particular social group, namely his familial relationship with the associate and principal claimants. I accept their claims.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

You are claiming to be a citizen of Cuba and are claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. I find you are a Convention refugee within the meaning of section 96 of the IRPA for the following reasons.\n[2] In terms of the allegations, the full allegations are set out in your Basis of Claim form. In summary, you fear persecution at the hands of the Cuban authorities on account of your political opinion and political activities against the Cuban government.\n[3] You have established your identity on a balance of probabilities as a citizen of Cuba with the certified true copy of your Cuban passport.\n[4] You have a nexus to the Convention because of your political opinion. You believe that a political opinion was imputed to you owing to your travels to Canada and that you also expressed a political opinion outright by sharing photos from your trip to Canada at the XXXX you were assigned which contrasts with conditions in Cuba and resulted in verbal reprimand and demotion specifically\n[5] 5. [HK1] While holding a position of power and authority in your role as XXXX XXXX, the expression of your views on the differences between Canada and Cuba were perceived to be a threat by the authorities. You also participated in protests and have observed differences in the handling of these in Cuba and in Canada. And given this your claim was analyzed under section 96 of the IRPA.\n[6] You testified in a straightforward way without any inconsistencies or omissions. And overall, I found you to be credible and I accept your allegations. You offered detailed testimony about your work history, particularly following your first trip to Canada. Your testimony about your employment was consistent with the information you provided in Exhibit 1 and your BOC, that is your Basis of Claim, in Exhibit 2. You corroborated your work history with copies of your XXXX XXXX and a letter from the office of XXXX XXXX found at Exhibit 5, pages 8 and 11. I find you have established on a balance of probabilities that you held position of status and authority as a XXXX XXXX and then as a XXXX XXXX (inaudible) in a XXXX and as a XXXX. While in these positions, you made a few trips to Canada. Following your first trip you were demoted and transferred from XXXX to the XXXX XXXX XXXX. Starting your position as XXXX XXXX XXXX, after returning from your first trip abroad, you testified that you shared photos with colleagues and XXXX and your observations about differences in the conditions of life in Canada and in Cuba. You testified that the XXXX authorities perceived these to be counter revolutionary and you were reprimanded twice, once in private by the XXXX and once by the XXXX and the committee. You testified that you continued to show photos and express your thoughts to those who were interested. You also continued to travel to Canada. You were eventually terminated from your position as XXXX XXXX on XXXX 2019 and you testified that you were unable to find another placement after this termination despite your years and experience in XXXX.\n[7] You made another trip to Canada following this termination and stayed with your daughter, who lives in Canada, for about XXXX (XXXX) months. On return to Cuba, you were in COVID lockdown for most of 2020 and 2021. However, in XXXX 2021 you and your son participated in the national protests in Cuba and owing to this participation you faced a number of summonses and you felt like you were being monitored. Your last summons resulted in a warning that if you protested again, you would be arrested. Your BOC indicates that that last summons was in XXXX 2021. Following this warning, you fled to Canada where you demonstrated a commitment to your political opinion by protesting with your daughter against oppression in Cuba. You disclosed a photo to corroborate your participation in that protest which took place in XXXX XXXX, 2021. You testified about your observations of the different treatment of protesters in Canada compared to Cuba and it was clear from your testimony that you are impassioned about your opposition the Cuban government and its treatment of citizens. On a balance of probabilities, I find that you have established your political opinion, imputed and otherwise. Given the relationship between your travel and demotion and termination as well as your testimony about being questioned by authorities following on your participation in the XXXX XXXX protests, I also find that you have established on a balance of probabilities that you faced harm owing to your political opinion. Therefore, I find you have established on a balance of probabilities a subjective fear of persecution in Cuba.\n[8] I am satisfied that your opposition to the Cuban government is a genuine and legitimate expression of your political opinion. And I also found that you have an objective basis for your subjective fear of persecution given the evidence from the Cuban National Documentation Package or NDP. The objective evidence shows that similar protesters in Cuba have faced repression by the government. According to Item 2.1 of the NDP, the Cuban regime is noted as having significant human rights abuses including abuse of political dissidence, detainees and prisoners by security forces, arbitrary arrest and detentions, significant problems with independence of the judiciary and arbitrary or unlawful interference with privacy. Cuba is an authoritarian state with only one (1) legal political party and Cuban security forces have committed numerous abuses against civilians. The NDP indicates that XXXX is a high-status occupation in Cuba and XXXX are highly qualified. Item 2.3 indicates that material on human rights was confiscated as counter revolutionary by authorities. The Cuban government has denied access to XXXX to XXXX who held political and religious views that differ from the state and Item 2.11 indicates that, \u201cXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Given the status of your position and that you spoke out, I believe that you have established an objective basis to your fear of persecution should you return to Cuba. But moreover, specifically referring to your participation in protests, the government regularly engages in censorship and imposes restrictions on the right of peaceful assembly. Government authorities perpetrate forced disappearances, political dissidents are regularly imprisoned and face degrading and life-threatening treatment in prison. And according to Item 2.1 the arbitrary arrests are common. Items 2.12 and 2.14 state that Cuban authorities recently detained hundreds of protesters who attended demonstrations on July the 11th, 2021. And In a Human Rights report cited in Item 2.12, President Miguel Diaz-Canel, on Sunday, July the 11th, 2021, \u201cUrged government supporters and security forces to respond to protests violently saying we call on all revolutionaries to go to the streets to defend the revolution.\u201d \u201cHe said, the order to fight has been given.\u201d Articles you disclosed indicate that hundreds of people were detained during protest including ordinary citizens, where onlookers received months in prison and other sentences of more than a decade for public disorders, sedition and other charges were placed. Item 2.1 also indicates that Cuban government has increased arbitrary arrest powers under the pretext of COVID-19 pandemic. So on a balance of probabilities you have been identified as being an opposition to the government through your political expression and should you return to Cuba you would face detention or arrest like others who are similarly situated. Having considered the objective evidence together with your consistent and credible testimony, I find that your subjective fear of persecution is well-founded. As such, I find you would face a serious possibility of persecution should you return to Cuba.\n[9] Regarding state protection and an internal flight alternative, you fear the Cuban state and you have testified that you cannot move anywhere in Cuba because state authorities can find you anywhere in the country. I agree with this and based on the documentary evidence, I find on a balance of probabilities that you would not be able to avail yourself of the protection of the authorities in Cuba and adequate state protection is not available to you. I am satisfied that you have rebutted the presumption of state protection. And given that the current actions taken by the state against political oppositions nationwide, there is no internal flight alternative throughout Cuba available to you. It is established in law that there is no internal flight alternative or state protection when you credibly fear state authorities.\n[10] In conclusion, based on the totality of the evidence I find that pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA you have established a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground, namely, your political opinion. Therefore, your claim for protection is accepted.\n[11] Mister Interpreter?\n[12] CLAIMANT: Thanks to my lawyer for carrying out this process as well. To you, Madam Member, I wish you well. Thank you, interpreter.\n[13] INTERPRETER: Thank you very much.\n[14] MEMBER: Congratulations to you and welcome to Canada.\n[15] CLAIMANT: God bless you, Madam Member.\n[16] MEMBER: Okay.

The claimant is found by the Panel to be a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of this Act. Therefore, an analysis respecting section 97(1) is not provided.\n[4] In making this determination and throughout the proceedings, the Panel considered and applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9, Proceedings Before the IRB Involving Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Expression, and Sex Characteristics, revised on December 17, 2021.\n[5] The basis of the claim relates to, according to the written and oral testimonies, the claimant\u2019s sexual orientation. The claimant identifies as a gay man, which for him means that he is sexually, physically, and emotionally attracted to men, not to women. Based on his sexual orientation, the claimant fears persecution in Nigeria from the community at large as well as authorities in Nigeria, who would not be there to assist him and provide him with protection.\n[6] The Panel turns to the various elements of the definition of a Convention refugee to discuss how they are met.\n[7] There is firstly the element of the claimant\u2019s identity. Though not directly referenced in section 96, it is the core element of finding the claimant to be a Convention refugee. As noted, the claimant is XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX he is an 18-year-old male born on XXXX XXXX, 2004, in Nigeria. The claimant\u2019s personal identity is established on a balance of probabilities by his testimony and the supporting documents submitted into evidence, as well as testimony from his brother, XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. And in regard to the documentary evidence, the Panel refers to a copy of his passport as found in Exhibits 1 and 4.\n[8] The claimant also testified that he is a citizen only of Nigeria and does not have permanent residence in any other country.\n[9] The definition of a Convention refugee requires that a forward-looking threshold of risk be met, and that risk threshold is met. The Panel finds that the claimant, were he to return to Nigeria, faces a reasonable chance of persecution based on his sexual orientation. The Panel makes that finding because the claimant has credibly established the basis of his claim on a balance of probabilities. The Panel finds on a balance of probabilities that the claimant\u2019s account that he is a gay man is credible and trustworthy. As noted, the claimant is a young man, 18 years old. The Panel finds from the quality of his written and oral testimonies that this quality reflects, on a balance of probabilities, genuine information concerning his sexual orientation and his path to realizing that he is gay. The Panel accepts on a balance of probabilities the credibility of the account of his experiences in Nigeria as a gay man, and the Panel also observed how fluid the claimant\u2019s oral testimony was. In answer to questions posed by the Panel, the claimant would, for example, volunteer other aspects of his account that relate directly to the questions posed and which are documented in the written account, namely the narrative account that is found in the basis of the claim. For example, the claimant volunteered testimony about the identity of the \u2014 one (1) of the aggressors in Nigeria and the aggressor\u2019s friends, all of whom are noted in the narrative account.\n[10] The claimant\u2019s testimony about his relationships in Nigeria were also consistent with his written account, that being that he was in only one (1) relationship in or about 2019 that lasted for XXXX (XXXX) months with a man whose name he fully gave, who I will refer to as XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and I note that that name is also given in the narrative account. And the claimant readily identified other persons who are named in his account and who provided supporting letters, as found in Exhibits 5 and 6, identifying them as only his friends, but who are also gay, as supported in information provided by the authors of those letters. Those are just some examples of the evidence that the claimant volunteered orally today, without hesitation, without memorization, that confirms what is in his narrative account.\n[11] The claimant\u2019s account of his sexual orientation is, as noted, also supported by his personal disclosures found in Exhibit 5 and 6. Such disclosures include letters of support, not only from persons named in his account who continue to reside in Nigeria, but also from his two (2) brothers in Canada who are XXXX and also XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.\n[12] The Panel did not discern any material credibility concerns regarding the trustworthiness of such disclosures that would the rebut the presumption of truth of the claimant\u2019s account of his sexual orientation. The Panel considered, for example, that some disclosures are titled as affidavits whereas they clearly are not affidavits, however, what is determinative is the content of such disclosure. Among such disclosure is the report of the social worker in Exhibit 5, which also attests to the claimant\u2019s sexual orientation, and a medical report from Nigeria, which attests to one (1) of the incidences that was described in the narrative account and again, with which the Panel finds no cause for concern in terms of its trustworthiness.\n[13] The claimant\u2019s brother XXXX, who was formerly his designated representative before the Board, also testified on the claimant\u2019s behalf today, and his account was consistent with the claimant\u2019s oral testimony and his written testimony, as found in the Basis of Claim form. As also noted, the claimant\u2019s brother XXXX provided a letter of support, and he would likely corroborate the claimant\u2019s account, were he also called to testify, given the content of his letter of support.\n[14] There is also no contradictory information about the claimant in his application for a study permit, as found in Exhibit 4, when considered with the information in his Basis of Claim form and in the schedules that are found in Exhibit 1.\n[15] The claimant\u2019s account in his Basis of Claim form as to his path of realizing his sexual orientation is therefore also corroborated by the information that is consistent in regard to his educational history, as this is where his path was realized.\n[16] Given the credibility of the claimant\u2019s Basis of Claim, there is a link established with a Convention ground, specifically his membership in a particular social group as a gay man.\n[17] The meeting of the threshold of a serious possibility or reasonable chance of persecution is also grounded in the objective documentary evidence in addition to the claimant\u2019s personal experiences in Nigeria. Those personal experiences include his having been bullied, harassed, threatened, and beaten by other students at school and by members of the community who perceived him to be gay.\n[18] With regards to the objective documentary evidence, the Panel refers to the June 30, 2022, version of a National Documentation Package for Nigeria, which is Exhibit 3. Because the claimant\u2019s Basis of Claim is credible, he has established a credible link to the information in the NDP about the treatment of SOGIESC, S-O-G-I-E-S-C, individuals. In this regard, the Panel refers briefly to the following information. Same-sex relationships and acts are criminalized in Nigeria pursuant to the Nigerian Federal Criminal Code such that anyone having physical relationships with members of the same sex is considered to be acting against the order of the \u2014 of nature and to be committing an unnatural offence and is subject to a 14-year prison term. There is also the Same-Sex Marriage (Prohibition) Act, which criminalizes same-sex marriages and civil unions as well as gay clubs and gay organizations, meetings of gay people, and the support of LGBTQ organizations. And in this regard, the Panel refers to Item 1.4 of the NDP, which also notes that, as an example, anyone who supports or participates in a pro-LGBTQ organization is liable to a 10-year prison term. Item 6.12, as another example, references that gay people have been noted by objective observers to be at a serious risk of persecution by the state, which criminalizes same-sex relationships. They are also at risk of persecution by society in general, which is known to be not supportive of same-sex relationships and often considers them alien to traditional African culture. Item 6.7 continues with this theme that the perception of the community at large regarding SOGIESC individuals is founded upon assumptions and opinions that same-sex relationships are unnatural, sinful, and an abomination. Item 6.1 references that SOGIESC individuals are victims of community-sponsored violence.\n[19] According to 6.12, SOGIESC individuals conceal their sexuality and face significant pressure to marry individuals of the opposite sex. Item 6.11 references that it is not possible to live openly as a sexual minority in any area of Nigeria, not even in the big urban areas such as Lagos, Port Harcours (sic) \u2014 sorry, Port Harcourt, or Abuja. So, all of such evidence, including the claimant\u2019s own personal credible account, shows that the claimant would face a reasonable chance of persecution in Nigeria for a Convention ground, were he to return to that country.\n[20] All such evidence also shows that adequate state protection would not likely be forthcoming to the claimant given that one (1) of the agents of persecution is also the state, in regard to its laws and in regard to its approach to providing protection. In this regard, in addition to the evidence already cited, Item 6.11 indicates that there is little state protection from community violence, that the roles of discriminatory laws are evident in the forms of violence perpetrated by both state and non-state actors, and that impunity is one (1) of the driving forces for the continual violation of LGBTQ people\u2019s rights in Nigeria.\n[21] Given the evidence that supports the finding of the likelihood that the claimant would not receive adequate state protection in Nigeria and given that the state, through also its security forces, is an agent of persecution in his claim, there is also no viable internal flight alternative for the claimant in Nigeria. The viability of an IFA fails on the first prong of the IFA test established by the Federal Court of Appeal, as the claimant faces a reasonable chance of persecution in every part of Nigeria due to his sexual orientation.\n[22] The Panel also returns to the issue of credibility and wishes to add that another document that comes to mind that was disclosed by the claimant are documents from XXXX XXXX, which show that he is associated with this organization. The Panel will also address the claimant\u2019s testimony in answer to the Panel\u2019s questions that he is not currently in a relationship in Canada since his arrival here. The Panel finds that this does not undermine the credibility of the claimant\u2019s account, The Panel references the claimant\u2019s tender age, despite that he is an adult, and his explanation, which is reasonable on a balance of probabilities that he simply has not yet met someone with whom he could consider a relationship. The claimant also emphasized that he has never been in a relationship with a woman, not here in Canada and not in Nigeria, and that he continues to identify as a gay man. And, as noted, the Panel has already discussed what the claimant has said as to what that personally means to him.\n[23] So, in conclusion, the Panel finds that the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, and that the claim is allowed.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

Hollander\nCountry: Bangladesh\nRPD Number: TC2-08675\nAssociated RPD Number(s): TC2-08679, TC2-08682\nATIP Number: A-2022-01960\nATIP Pages: N\/A\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: All right, we are back on the record. These are the reasons for the decision in the claims for refugee protection by XXXX XXXX XXXX, TC2-08675, XXXX XXXX XXXX, TC2-08679, and XXXX XXXX, TC2-08682. You are all claiming to be citizens of Bangladesh and are claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. I have considered your testimony and the other evidence in your case, and I am ready to render my decision orally.\n[2] My determination is I find that you are all Convention refugees who face a serious possibility of persecution in Bangladesh. I note that due to the allegations raised by the associate claimants, I considered and applied Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 4, Gender Considerations in Proceedings Before the Immigration and Refugee Board.\n[3] Your allegations are found in your Basis of Claim forms at Exhibit 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3, and were expanded upon through your testimony today. You allege that you face a serious possibly of persecution in Bangladesh from state and non-state actors due to Mr. XXXX \u2014 the principal claimant\u2019s being a publicly vocal atheist who is viewed as anti-Islamic.\n[4] Mr. XXXX, you allege that you are a long-time XXXX and XXXX XXXX user who posts regularly about, among other things, atheism, secular topics, and some criticism of Islam. You spent more than 10 years living outside of Bangladesh in Bermuda and Canada while engaged in these activities, and though you did receive some online threats, you were not particularly concerned. However, on a return to Bangladesh in XXXX 2022, you received a call that your wife and mother-in-law, the associate claimants, had been kidnapped, directly related to your anti-Islamic online activity or your perceived anti-Islamic online activity. The associate claimants were able to escape their captures, however, not before being told that they would be taught a lesson due to Mr. XXXX anti-Islamic or perceived anti-Islamic activity, and both the associate climates were physically and sexually assaulted by their captors prior to their being able to escape. You stayed in hiding at your sister-in-law \u2014 the sister of associate claimant and daughter of the other associate claimant, for several days, and then all fled to Canada using your valid Canadian visas and made refugee claims shortly after your arrival. You alleged that there was nowhere you could be safe in Bangladesh and that state protection is not available to you.\n[5] Regarding your identities, I find that your personal and national identities as citizens of Bangladesh were established on a balance of probabilities by your testimony and by the certified copies of your Bangladesh passports on file at Exhibit 1 as well as additional identity documents including the national ID card for XXXX XXXX and birth certificates at Exhibit number 5. I did have some concern about a previous passport in Exhibit 4 for XXXX XXXX that has a different spelling of her name and a different ID number. However, that was discussed in the hearing, and I received a fully plausible and credible explanation that she had had a voter ID card with incorrect information, that was what the passport was based on, and she needed to have the voter ID and the passport corrected to give her the correct spelling of her name, resulting in a changing of the ID card number, which resulted in a new ID card number on the passport, and I find this is credibility explained, and I find you have all established your identities on a balance of probabilities.\n[6] I did also raise an issue of possible exclusion for Mr. XXXX under article 1E of the Convention, as he did live and work for nearly a decade in Bermuda. But, sir, you testified that your status there was only through a work permit taken care of by your employer. I note you held no permanent status there. I find your testimony is supported by the information in the Bermuda National Documentation Package at Exhibit 3.1 \u2014 or 3.2, sorry, specifically document 3.1 of that package outlines the strict requirements for attaining permanent resident status in Bermuda, which you would not have met based on your 10 years being there on a work permit. Therefore, I find that you do not hold and have not held status in Bermuda with the rights and obligations of a national and are thus not excluded.\n[7] Regarding nexus for Mr. XXXX, I find there is a nexus by reason of your religion or a lack thereof, atheism, and your imputed religious profile of being anti-Islamic, and for the associate claimants by reason of your membership in a particular social group, particularly being female family members of someone deemed to have anti-Islamic views and who are at risk of gender-related violence. Thus, I find there is a nexus for all three (3) of you to the refugee Convention and assess your claims pursuant to section 96.\n[8] For credibility, I have found you all to be credible witnesses, although I note that the bulk of the testimony did come from Mr. XXXX, as his allegations are the primary one (1)\u2019s in the heart of the claim. I accept what you have alleged in your oral testimony and your Basis of Claim forms. Your testimony was relatively straightforward. There were no material contradictions, omissions, or discrepancies between what you said and the documentary evidence, and you were able to give a detailed testimony when asked. I found you, sir, credible regarding your being an atheist who has made XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX promoting secular views critical of Islam. You were able to speak in some detail of your journey to atheism and why you find yourself with this set of beliefs.\n[9] You also provided nearly 50 pages of XXXX XXXX at Exhibit 5. Now, I note that almost none of these postings are translated into English or French, so I cannot give them great weight for the most part for the content or the specifics of their content, however, there are several comments in English which do support your allegation that you were making a commentary that would be viewed as critical of Islam and offensive to conservative Muslims in Bangladesh. You included screenshots of your own account, showing your username as a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX which you said would be viewed as XXXX by conservative Muslims in Bangladesh. Also, you included posting of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, including the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and your critical commentary, which was in English, of these figures. And your posts also show that you were engaged in communication publicly with individuals well known as XXXX XXXX and publishers who were later murdered by extremists in Bangladesh for their XXXX and XXXX XXXX. This is supported by the news articles you presented at Exhibit 7, which speaks specifically about these individuals who you were friends with on Facebook being murdered. Therefore, I can assign these documents some weight in establishing that you were engaged in public posting of religiously sensitive material and were engaged in public discussions with a number of individuals whose imputed anti-Islamic views led to their own murders.\n[10] Regarding the attacks on the associate claimants in Bangladesh, your testimony, particularly XXXX, was in line with your Basis of Claim narrative and also the statement provided from the associate \u2014 from XXXX (sic)\u2019s \u2014 or, sorry, pardon me, XXXX daughter \u2014 sister, and XXXX daughter at Exhibit 5, who was herself a witness to parts of this event and corresponds with your testimony and Basis of Claim. I can offer this statement significant weight in establishing that the principal claimant was threatened, that the associate claimants were kidnapped and assaulted in relation to the principal claimant\u2019s perceived anti-Islamic activity. Overall, I find you on a balance of probabilities to have credibly established the central elements of your claims, that the principal claimant is an atheist who vocally and publicly engaged in online postings and discussion that was viewed as critical of Islam, that the associate claimants were kidnapped and assaulted in direct relation to this.\n[11] Regarding subjective fear, you fled Bangladesh for Canada just days after the attack and made your refugee claim within weeks of arrival here. Therefore, I find on the balance of probabilities that your subjective fear has been established.\n[12] Regarding objective support for your allegations, I turn to the National Documentation Package for Bangladesh at Exhibit 3.1 as well as the country disclosure submitted by you and your Counsel at Exhibit 7. I look at document 12.2 of the National Documentation Package which indicates that Bangladesh is majority a Sunni Muslim country. Bangladesh does have secularism as a fundamental principle, however, according to article 2(a) of the Constitution, indicates that state religion of Bangladesh is Islam. The document further indicates that in 2016, alleged Islamic state affiliates in Bangladesh conducted a series of attacks against individuals within religious minority communities, including XXXX XXXX and activists \u2014 online activists, which is what you allege you were viewed as, Mr. XXXX. Document 12.8, a United Kingdom Home Office Report indicates that \u2014 again, discusses the recent murders of XXXX XXXX and others deemed to be criticizing Islam in the online sphere, and it indicates that while the government did condemn these threats and acts of violence committed in the name of religion, government representatives have also publicly admonished online activists who have expressed critical views on religion, Islam in particular, and have indicated that limits should not be crossed in criticism of religion. In addition to official sanctions, individuals who have publicly criticized Islam had faced significant societal pressure in the form of threats and violence from Islamist militant organizations.\n[13] Mr. XXXX, you indicated that you believed that your threat \u2014 those who threatened you may have been connected to the XXXX XXXX XXXX. Document 1.5 discusses this organization and says that they XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, threatening the lives of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, who they termed apostates and enemies of Islam. And again, it is also well documented in your articles at Exhibit 7 of the murders of the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. According to document 1.17, the Australia Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade Report, religion is central to Bangladeshi Culture and professed atheism is extremely rare. Islamic organizations regularly use the term atheist against individuals who criticize Islam, and the government has periodically used blasphemy laws against such individuals such as yourself, Mr. XXXX, and accused them of blasphemy or defamation of religion, and are \u2014 those who do so are likely to face legal sanction, which may even include imprisonment, which you, Mr. XXXX, declared that you have personally feared.\n[14] For the associate claimants, document 1.5, the European Asylum Support Office Report indicates that rape, sexual harassment, and other gender-based violence is common in Bangladesh and that there are reports that sexual assault and rape has been used in politically motivated violence, which appears to be the case here. Based on the evidence before me, I find that your fear of harm does have an objective basis, and along with your established subjective fear that you all have a well-founded fear of persecution in Bangladesh.\n[15] Turning to state protection, there is a presumption of \u2014 that states are capable of protecting their own citizens, but that presumption can be rebutted with clear and convincing evidence of the unwillingness or inability of a state to protect a claimant. In your case, you declare that you did not go to police after the abduction and threats, as you fear that you yourself could be arrested, Mr. XXXX, for your vocal online atheism and criticism of Islam, which is supported by the objective evidence I just discussed, and feared for the associate claimants, as female assault victims are often mistreated by police, this is also supported in the National Documentation Package at document 1.17, and the UK Home Office Report at document 5.15 indicates that women face barriers to getting police help due to a prevailing culture of impunity and lack of government commitment for sexual assault survivors.\n[16] Furthermore, the Australia Report at 1.17 reports that public distrusted in police and security services in Bangladesh is widespread, and many Bangladeshis do not approach police for help. Human rights organizations have expressed concern over persistent use of excessive force by police and that most Bangladeshis do avoid any engagement with police. So, I find on a balance of probabilities that adequate state protection would not be forthcoming to you and you have rebutted the presumption of state protection in this case.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[17] Sir, Mr. XXXX, you have established that you are a vocal atheist and critic of Islam, and I find it would not be reasonable to expect you to keep silent about your religious beliefs, as that would be a violation of your human rights. The country condition documents indicate that the risk of being a vocal atheist and anti-Islamist for most state and non-state actors exists throughout the country, and furthermore, the associate claimants would, on a balance of probabilities, be linked to the principal claimant, as this has already happened within just a month of your return to Bangladesh in 2021. So, I find that they too, on a balance of probabilities, would be at risk throughout the country.\n[18] Therefore, I find that there is no viable internal flight alternatives for you anywhere in Bangladesh.\n[19] For the aforementioned reasons, I conclude that you all three (3) claimants face a serious possibility of persecution in Bangladesh, and I find you are Convention refugees, and your claims are accepted.\n[20] And with that, I will go off the record and close the proceeding.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

Fedder\nCountry: Uganda\nRPD Number: TC2-09589\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2022-01960\nATIP Pages: N\/A\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: This is the decision of the Refugee Protection Division for XXXX XXXX. You are claiming to be a citizen of Uganda and are claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. You alleged that you fear persecution and a risk to your life in Uganda on the basis of your sexual orientation. I have considered your testimony and the other evidence in this case, I am ready to render my decision orally. In coming to my decision, I have also considered and applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline number 9: Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Expression and Sex Characteristics. This Guideline assists in assessing the key evidently elements in determining the harm individuals may face due to their sexual orientation or gender identity.\nDETERMINATION\n[2] I find that you would face a serious possibility of persecution should you return to Uganda and are a Convention refugee on the grounds of your membership in a particular social group, namely gay men. My reasons are as follows.\nIdentity\n[3] Your personal identity as a citizen of Uganda has been established by your testimony and the copy of your Uganda passport filed in Exhibit 4.\nCredibility\n[4] In terms of your general credibility, I have found you to be credible witness. Your testimony today was direct, responsive to questioning, and at times very emotional. There were no material omissions, inconsistencies, or contradiction between your testimony and your BOC, and other evidence before me that were not reasonably explained.\n[5] You spoke in vivid detail about how you discovered your sexual orientation when you 11 years old at school with JK. You described how you were aroused by seeing other boys naked in the showers, and you realized you were different. You were caught and expelled from school, but nothing came from it, because the school did not want the attention. Your mother never confronted to you about it, because she was hoping you would change. You testified that over the years, you have had relations with other men, but nothing serious until you met your current partner, JL, in 2016. You described the moment you met him and why you were so attracted to him. You were able to spontaneously tell me what you did together, where you met, how you kept it a secret, what you like about his personality, and what it has been like to be apart from them for nearly a year.\n[6] You emotionally recounted the two (2) times you were arrested last year for unnatural sexual offenses, and how traumatic it was spending in time in jail, and the mistreatment you suffered by police and fellow inmates. You explained how you had read a great deal about how accepting Canada is to gay men, and you had been there before, so you thought it would be the best place to flee to.\n[7] I did question you on your subjective fear and your failure to claim in the various countries you had traveled to due to your employment with XXXX XXXX. You credibly explained that you never considered leaving Uganda before that second arrest because you did not have a direct threat. You had a good job and your partner was in Uganda. Over the years, you were able to keep your encounters and relationship secret by blocking family members on social media. Even after your first arrest, you figured that you could work harder at avoiding attention, but it was after you were arrested the second time that you realized you had to leave the country, especially since you suffered more abuse while you were imprisoned. I find your explanation reasonable in that you did not establish a subjective fear until your second arrest.\n[8] Since being in Canada, you have volunteered for LGBTQ groups, attended pride parade, and used apps to meet other gay men, though you have remained faithful to JL. You described being in Canada as totally different from Uganda. You feel supported and safe. Your life is no longer in danger, and you do not have to worry about the police or being judged by society.\n[9] I also note that your claim is supported by supporting documents filed in Exhibit 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. These include a letter from your partner JL, a letter from your friend in Canada, a letter from your cousin, a statutory declaration from your friend who was your surety for bail when you were arrested for unnatural sex, a letter from your old church condemning your sexual orientation that you received when they excommunicated you, a police summons and release on bond for when you were charged with unnatural sexual offenses, a letter from the LGBTQ neighborhood group confirming your membership, a letter from the chairman of your former local counsel, and letters from XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX. The letters from your friends corroborate your allegations that you are a gay man who has been targeted by the police. The letters from your cousin, former church, and local chairman demonstrate that you have been discriminated against by both your family and society. The police documents show that you have been arrested for your sexual orientation, and the letter from your church confirms you were excommunicated due to your sexual orientation. The letters from XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX demonstrate that you have been active in the LGBTQ community in Canada. You testified that your friend who bailed you out of jail helped you collect all the letters from Uganda, and that he took a risk in obtaining the statutory declaration, but he was a well-connected XXXX XXXX and knew of a lawyer who would help him. You said he did this for you because he was a good friend. I find this explanation to be credible, based on your particular circumstances. These documents are reliable because the letters are accompanied by ID, and there is no reason to doubt the authenticity of the police documents. I assign all the documents full weight in corroborating your core allegations as a gay man and who persecuted by your family, society, and the police. Accordingly, on the whole, in terms of your general credibility, I have found you to be credible witness, and I therefore accept what you have alleged in your oral testimony and Basis of Claim form.\n[10] I find that your subjective fear is established by your credible and corroborated testimony.\nObjective Basis\n[11] I also find that your claim is objectively well-founded. In making this finding I am referring to the National Documentation Package or NDP for Uganda, which is dated April 29th, 2022, and is filed at Exhibit 3. According to Tab 6.2 of the NDP, the Ugandan Penal Code criminalizes sexual acts between mutually consented people of the same sex. Senior government ministers have engaged in openly hostile rhetoric against the practice and the criminalization of same-sex sexual behaviour. At Tab 2.1 of the NDP, the United States Department of State Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2021 for Uganda indicates that there is a penalty of up to life imprisonment for same-sex sexual acts, and that the law does not prohibit discrimination against LGBTQ persons in housing, employment, nationality laws, or access to government services. Multiple sources in the NDP, including Tabs 2.1, 6.2, and 6.4 indicate that Ugandan police are often among the principal violators of the rights of the LGBTQ citizens. The same sources show that homophobic views are widespread across Ugandan society. LGBTQ persons are not only not accepted for who they are, they are often believed to be, or accused to being an intrusion of western values into Ugandan society.\n[12] I find the documentary country evidence supports your allegations of being persecuted by the police and society if you were to return to Uganda. I therefore find that your subjective fear of persecution is objectively well-founded.\nState Protection\n[13] In terms of state protection, in this case, the state is one of the agents of persecution that you fear. Based on the objective evidence of the mistreatment of LGBTQ individuals by Ugandan state authorities as described above, I find that you have rebutted the presumption of state protection with clear and convincing evidence based on your personal circumstances and the objective country documentation. I find that adequate state protection would not be available to you in Uganda if you were to return there.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[14] I have also considered whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for you. The country documentation referred to above indicate the situation for LGBTQ individuals and circumstances like yours is the same throughout the country, and that you would face a serious possibility of persecution or a risk to your life anywhere in Uganda, based on your sexual orientation. As such, I find there is no viable internal flight alternative for you in that country.\nCONCLUSION\n[15] In conclusion, based on the totality of the evidence and my analysis above, I find that you have established a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground in Uganda. I therefore find you to be a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA, and I therefore accept your claim. Thank you.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

Young\nCountry: Iraq\nRPD Number: TC2-10041\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2022-01960\nATIP Pages: N\/A\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: So I have had a chance to consider the evidence. I am prepared to render a decision in this matter orally. This will be \u2014 this decision will be sent to you following our hearing and may be edited for spelling and grammar purposes.\n[2] This is a decision in the claim for refugee protection by XXXX XXXX XXXX file number TC2-10041. You are claiming to be a citizen of Iraq and you are seeking refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[3] So my determination is based on all the evidence, I find on a balance of probabilities you face more than a mere possibility of persecution in Kurdish Iraq based upon your political opinion, which you have been critical of the administration and operation of the XXXX system in the XXXX province.\n[4] In summary, the allegations in this matter as follows. You describe your fear of persecution originates from the tragic passing of your wife from COVID in a XXXX hospital in the spring of 2021. You describe that the medical care of your wife was substandard, particularly in so far as despite the highly contagious nature of COVID, patients were inadequately separated from each other in the hospital and old and inadequate ventilators were used to sustain them. In the aftermath of the tragedy, you expressed your anger both in the hospital and outside the hospital at her care and gave a number of XXXX XXXX publicly sharing your opinion of what you believed to be substandard healthcare. Almost immediately, you received attention from police, including while trying to file an official complaint with the judicial system about her treatment, leading you not to go forward. After you triggered an investigation of the system of medical treatment in XXXX by speaking to two (2) journalists, they broadcast television expos\u00e9s on the health situation in XXXX, which led to public responses from both government \u2014 health officials and the head of the XXXX province. Around the same time, you fled Iraq in late XXXX 2021 based upon the stress you had already received. You stated that there is nowhere you can go in Iraq to be safe and there is inadequate state protection available to you. You pledge to continue speaking out about the substandard health care in Kurdish Iraq if you return there.\n[5] On the matter of your identity, your personal identity as a citizen of Iraq has been established by your credible testimony, a copy of your Iraqi passport, which has been entered into evidence, as well as the multiple other documents provide. I find on a balance of probabilities that identity and country of reference have been established.\n[6] On the matter of nexus, I find there is a nexus between your political opinion, expressing public criticism of healthcare in Kurdish Iraq, and your fear of persecution there. Given this nexus to the ground of political opinion, your claim is being assessed under section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[7] On the matter of credibility, I find you to be a credible and consistent witness without major discrepancies or contradictions. You described, in compelling detail, your personal situation, the public statements you have made as a result of that situation and how your information to journalists led to Tv expos\u00e9s on the healthcare system in XXXX. The video evidence provided shows that these expos\u00e9s were compelling enough to provoke public statements by high-ranking politicians in about late XXXX or early XXXX 2021. I accept as credible that if you return to Iraq you would personally face persecution based upon your past and prospective statements criticizing the nature of, and quality of, healthcare in Iraq. You supported your oral evidence with abundant documentation, including various identity documents, documents confirming your education, your marriage certificates and documents confirming your wife\u2019s passing. Video footage of your television interviews and statements and transcriptions and translations of the Iraqi tv broadcast. So based upon the evidence provided, I find on a balance of probabilities you have a credible subjective fear of persecution should you return to Iraq.\n[8] Turning to the objective evidence. The objective evidence from the NDP for Iraq confirms your oral evidence. Item 1.7 of the NDP by the UNDP states that any individual who opposes or is perceived to oppose KRG authorities may be in need of international protection. Freedom House has quoted in Item 4.2 is indicating that, \u201cPolitical speech in the Kurdistan region can prompt \u201carbitrary detention or other reprisals from the government or Kurdistan forces.\u201d\u201d The government of KRG has stated, in that article, to use the threat of prosecution to intimidate critics. It clearly shows that people who publicly criticized the KRG\u2019s response to the the pandemic were either arrested or jailed. Both Item 2.9 and the ESO report in 1.11 repeat that in Kurdish Iraq, Kurdish security actors openly target government critics, who face threats of intimidation, physical attacks, arbitrary arrest, politically motivated prosecutions or even civil actions against them. In Item 2.9 the Danish information service quotes one (1) source as saying, \u201cThe only way one (1) can criticize or stand up to the people in power in KRG is if you are well connected.\u201d I have no evidence before me to show that you have such an ability or capacity. Accordingly, based upon this objective evidence, I find your fear of persecution in Iraq, based upon your political opinion is well-founded.\n[9] On the matter of state protection, given the fact that your principal agent of persecution is the government, I am satisfied, on the totality of evidence, that the presumption of state protection is rebutted in this case. Item 4.6 of the NDP at page 4 repeats that the KDP have an iron grip on the region\u2019s institutions in XXXX and, \u201cIncluding law enforcement.\u201d The objective evidence provided by your Counsel shows that despite the rivalry between the ruling parties in northern Iraq, the PUK and KDP will cooperate in efforts to detain and persecute critics in their respective regions. Even if this were not the case, the NDP confirms that access to the rule of law in the Kurdistan region is still dependent on affiliation and connections and it is very difficult for someone like you to individually speak up for their own right. The NDP also indicates that in most cases, if anyone complains about state treatment in Kurdish Iraq, what occurs is a lack of effective investigation prompting a description of the situation as, \u201cAn atmosphere of impunity.\u201d So based on all the evidence, I am satisfied that the presumption of state protection is rebutted on a balance of probabilities.\n[10] On the matter of internal flight alternative, I have also had to consider whether there is somewhere you can go and live in Iraq safely. I am not persuaded, on a balance of probabilities, that there is one (1) for you. While the NDP does indicate a large Kurdish population near Baghdad, it also indicates that the requirement to speak Arabic to properly resettle in the area is mandatory. Item 1.19 of the NDP at paragraph 534 to 537 says that successful relocation in Iraq will typically depend on the availability of support network in the region, with relocation beyond those networks being a difficult proposition indeed. Your Counsel has provided objective evidence showing that relocation from KDP\u2019s stronghold of XXXX to PUK held areas is not a viable option for you given the cooperation between these ruling authorities to detain and persecute critics. Because your agents of persecution are government-based actors in Kurdish Iraq, on all the evidence, I am satisfied there is no viable internal flight alternative for you in Iraq.\n[11] In conclusion, based on all the evidence, I conclude you face a serious possibility of persecution in Iraq connected to your political opinion without adequate state protection or a viable IFA. Therefore, I conclude you are a refugee within the meaning of section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act and I accept your claim.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

The date is August 11, 2022.\nAllegations\n[2] The details of the claimant\u2019s allegations are fully set out in his Basis of Claim form. To summarize, the claimant was threatened because of his family ties to his brother-in-law, an ex-police officer in the state of Veracruz, who has been persecuted and sworn to death by the cartel Jalisco Nueva Generacion, or CJNG. The claimant\u2019s brother-in-law was responsible for the detention of an important member of the CJNG. After being released from jail for unknown reasons, the cartel started fierce persecution against the claimant\u2019s brother-in-law and the claimant\u2019s sister, who eventually fled to Canada, requested and were granted refugee protection.\n[3] The claimant used to live with his sister and his brother-in-law. He also arrived in Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2019. The claimant did not make a refugee claim before because the cartel never threatened him. The situation changed in XXXX 2021, when the claimant was located on social media and personally threatened by the cartel. The claimant realized that returning to Mexico was not a viable option anymore. The claimant applied for refugee protection on November 19, 2021.\nDetermination\n[4] I find that the claimant has satisfied the Board in establishing that he would face a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground, namely his membership in a particular social group, which is his family tries to a persecuted ex-police officer.\nIdentity\n[5] I am satisfied with the claimant\u2019s identity as a citizen of Mexico which established by his testimony and the copy of his passport in evidence.\nCredibility\n[6] The claimant was a credible witness and; therefore, I believe that he has alleged in support of his claim. The claimant testified in a straightforward, forthright, detailed manner. The claimant also provided extensive evidence of his allegations, such as personal documents, news articles, official documents and even a recent video with death threats against him and his family. He did not seem to exaggerate or tailor his evidence. In summary, his testimony was consistent with the other evidence on central aspects of his claim. I find no reason to doubt the truthfulness of the claimant.\nNexus\n[7] To qualify as a refugee under the refugee Convention, an individual must demonstrate that they have a well-founded fear of persecution based on one of the five Convention grounds. From the totality of the evidence before me, I find the claimant has established a nexus to the Convention, namely membership in a particular social group, as he has family relating to an ex-police officer, particularly subject to harm from the cartel members in Mexico. Therefore, the claim was analysed under section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution and Risk of Harm\n[8] The National Documentation Package or NDP for Mexico states at Tab 7.2 that cartels are known to punish the person who does not collaborate or betray them. To analyse whether the claimant personally faces a serious possibility of risk to his life due to his family association, I considered the objective evidence regarding the CJNG and how it operates. According to country condition evidence, organized crime is pervasive in Mexico and is responsible for alarming high levels of violence. Mexico\u2019s major drug trafficking organizations have become more fragmented recently, but many large cartels retain considerable power.\n[9] NDP Tab 7.12 shows me that CJNG is Mexico\u2019s major crime threat and appears to be expanding. The same reference further states that although CJNG has suffered some setbacks due to internal divisions and splintering, the group has maintained its dominance in Mexico.\n[10] NDP Tab 7.18 shows that some people directly or indirectly related to cartels\u2019 operation are particularly exposed to violence from criminal groups. Politicians, journalists and police officers are major targets and face more significant risks. As a family member of a persecuted ex-police officer, I find that the claimant is highly exposed to a vendetta from the cartel. The claimant has established on a balance of probabilities that he faces a serious risk of persecution if he returns to Mexico. Therefore, he has demonstrated a well-founded fear of persecution on a subjective and objective basis.\nState Protection[HK1]\n[11] The Panel has also considered whether the state protection is available to the claimant and concluded that it is not. There is clear and convincing evidence before me that the state is unable or unwilling to protect the claimant. It would be objectively unreasonable for the claimant to seek the protection of the state in light of his particular circumstances.\n[12] In terms of state protection, Mexico\u2019s local and state authorities are generally unwilling and unable to protect victims of gang violence. According to NDP Tab 7.22, ongoing corruption, weakness and the lack of confidence in Mexico law enforcement, particularly of local and state police forces, have created a sense of impunity and increased criminal violence. Despite the state\u2019s attempt to eradicate drug trafficking and targeting top level gang leaders, these strategies have resulted in shifting alliances and the emergence of new gangs.\n[13] According to Tab 2.3 and 2.4 of the NDP, state corruption and complacency with criminals are rampant. The Mexican Federal Statistics Agency estimates that 94% of crimes were unreported or not investigated, according to the NDP Tab 2.1. There were reports of some government agents complicit with the international organization of criminal gangs and low prosecution and conviction rates for these abuses.\n[14] In the case (inaudible), I find the claimant produced extensive evidence of the lack of straight protection. Even for his brother-in-law, when he was working as a police officer in Mexico. It is logical to conclude that the state protection would not be forthcoming to the claimant in this particular case.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[15] Finally, the Panel has considered whether a viable Internal Flight Alternative exists for the claimant in Merida, Yucatan as this issue was raised with him at the hearing. The claimant alleges that he would not be safe in Mexico in any location, as his agents of persecution could locate him throughout Mexico. The test for a viable IFA has two prongs. First, I must be satisfied that the claimant would not face a serious possibility of persecution and would not be personally subjected to a risk to his life of cruel or unusual treatment, punishment or danger of torture in the proposed IFA.\n[16] Second, I must be satisfied that it would not be unreasonable in all circumstances for the claimant to seek refuge in the proposed IFA location. To perform the IFA test, I must analyse the cartel\u2019s mean and motivation.\n[17] On the issue of the cartel\u2019s means, according to Tab 7.8 and Tab 3.5 of the NDP, a powerful cartel could use several tactics to locate a person of interest, such as having access to a national database through corrupt government officials. The NDP Tab 7.15 describes the strategic alliances that the cartels have forged with each other to extend their reach beyond their areas of operation. Considering the profile of the Jalisco cartel being the most influential cartel in Mexico at the moment, I find that there is a serious possibility that the cartel has the means to locate the claimant if properly motivated.\n[18] On the issue of motivation, according to Tab 7.8 and Tab 7.15 of the NDP, a personal vendetta to the ones that refuse to collaborate with the cartels or are considered traitors could motivate a gang to track someone even outside their area of operation. The claimant testified and I believe him that the cartel has a strong vengeance wish against the claimant\u2019s family due to his brother-in-law\u2019s activity as a XXXX XXXX when XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, which the cartel sees as a form of betrayal. Considering previously cited sources, in the circumstances, I find that there is a serious possibility that the Jalisco cartel would be motivated to locate and murder the claimant due to his family ties to his brother-in-law.\n[19] For the cited reasons, I find that there is a serious possibility that the Jalisco cartel has both the means and the motivation to pursue the claimant throughout Mexico. Therefore, the claimant does not have a viable IFA within the country. Since the first prong of the IFA test was not met, I will not discuss the second prong.\nCONCLUSION\n[20] For the preceding reasons, I find that that XXXX XXXX XXXX is a Convention refugee as defined in section 96 of the Act. Therefore, I accept his claim.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n[HK1]Note that this was originally not bolded in the Word doc received through the ATIP request\n\n",

Pritzker Schmitt\nCountry: Peru\nRPD Number: TC2-11228\nAssociated RPD Number(s): TC2-11231\nATIP Number: A-2022-01960\nATIP Pages: N\/A\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: This is the decision of the Refugee Protection Division in the claims of the principal claimant XXXX XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, RPD file numbers\nTC2-11228 and TC2-11231.You are citizens of Peru, you claim refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97 (1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, the IRPA.\n[2] On the matter of your allegations, you fear the return to Peru, because you fear gender-based persecution as a victim of extortion, robbery, assault and death threats at the hands of criminal. You fear that they will continue to threaten you, abuse you and kill you.\n[3] I have reviewed and applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 4:Gender Considerations and Proceedings Before the Immigration and Refugee Board, during the hearing and in this decision.\n[4] You provided further details in your Basis of Claim forms at Exhibit 2.1 and 2.2, some of which I will highlight in this decision.\n[5] I find that you\u2019re Convention refugees pursuant to section 96 of the Act for the reasons that follow.\n[6] On the matter of identity, I find that you have established your identities on a balance of probabilities, by copies of your Peruvian passports.\n[7] On the matter of credibility, you provided detail testimony consistent with your Basis of Claim forms and narrative, and your supporting documents including your identity documents, screen shots of threats, courts and police records, and these are found at Exhibit 5.\n[8] Accordingly, I find you are credible witnesses. You testified through the hearing in Spanish, and that is the language of your Basis of Claim form.\n[9] You provided compelling, and difficult testimony that was detailed today. This was regarding past instances of abuse including physical and psychological abuse, and the death threats against you. You gave emotional testimony and as I said, it was detailed.\n[10] On the matter of well-founded fear of persecution and risk of harm, the objective evidence at the National Documentation Package\u2014 I am going to refer to a Response to Information Request produced by the IRB which supports your fears of return, and your testimony regarding gender-based violence that you experienced firsthand.\n[11] It indicates that it continues to be widespread traditional patriarchal attitudes, machismo, and a perpetual culture of violence against women in Peru. Woman and girls are subjected to violence in all spheres of life at home, in school, the workplace, and public spaces. This report also indicates that Peru has one of the highest rates of violence against women in the region. Civil society experts claim that there is a significant underreporting, due to stigma, mistreatment, a fear of retribution, including further violence and weak competence in the authorities. Studies show that only 27 percent of women aged 18 or more who suffered an attack reported it. Most reports did not result in proper sanctions.\n[12] Based on the totality of the evidence before me, I find that you\u2019ve both established a nexus to membership in a particular social group, as victims of gender-based persecution. Considering all the evidence before me, I find you\u2019ve provided sufficient credible evidence to support your allegations. I find you face a serious possibility of persecution on the basis of your gender in Peru.\n[13] On the matter of state protection, you testified you reported the abuse against you, the threats to police. You testified you have never received any help from the police, there have been no arrests made against anyone. You were never told the identity of the persecutors, despite the fact that you have made police complaints and the police have appeared to anonymize their identities.\n[14] The NDP report 5.1, supports your testimony regarding a lack of adequate state protection. It indicates that a 2015, study said in approximately 81 percent of cases, no measures were taken to protect survivors of attempted killings, and it indicates that there is a need for improvement in the law. Now there are laws on the books to protect, but there is a lack of implementation, a lack of space to provide support to women as well as impunity, and insufficient funding to fight violence against women in both public and private spaces.\n[15] On the matter of the obstacles that exist, the implementation of the regulations shows that there is problems regarding training and awareness of staff who receive complaints.\n[16] The ombudsman found that 40 percent of police stations did not have adequate facilities to interview victims. The majority of police officers and prosecution office personnel did not have specialized training in the treatment of abused women.\n[17] The majority of police staff did not know that Law 30,364, existed despite their work regarding crime and investigating femicides. Authorities frequently don\u2019t want to accept claims ,because they are not considered serious due to lack or proof provided by victims, even though under Law 30,364, such proof is not required. Between January and November 2020, there were one 171,631 calls to gender-based violence hotlines, compared to 88,399 in 2019, and there 121 cases of femicides.\n[18] The ineffectiveness of the laws further demonstrated by an increase in femicides since the passing of the law, which is actually called the Law to Prevent, Sanction, and Eradicate Violence Against Women and Members of the Family Unit, and this is supposed to focus on the protection of victims. It\u2019s noted that government officials see gender-based violence as a priority to address, but it hasn\u2019t translated into concrete action.\n[19] In your case, you were never provided any support from the police who by law were required to incorporate you into victims of the National Victims and witness assistant program, or to require protection measures from the court.\n[20] Item 2.1 of the NDP, indicates that prosecutors in 15 percent of these cases, flat out ignores this requirement. In your case prosecutors appear to have completely ignored the gender-based violence aspect of each one of your complaints, and as such you were not afforded access to these services.\n[21] The human rights ombudsman in Peru stated and this is a direct citation \u201cThat the State treats female survivors of physical violence with absolute neglect.\u201d And so, you were never offered protection, police solely investigated the extortion, ignoring violence against you. And I\u2019ll note you attended three (3) different police stations in two (2) provinces, you were extorted by police at one of them.\n[22] Accordingly, I find there is no operationally effective state protection available to you in your particular circumstances.\n[23] On the matter of internal flight alternative, I must be satisfied on a balance of probabilities, that you would not be subjected personally to a danger of torture, or a risk to life, or cruel and unusual treatment of punishment, and that you wouldn\u2019t face a serious possibility of persecution in the proposed IFA.\n[24] Now I noted Cusco as the potential IFA, secondly that conditions in that part of the country are such, that it would not be objectively reasonable in all the circumstances, including your personal circumstances, for you to seek refuge there.\n[25] You testified you fear a criminal group. You allege they can find you throughout Peru, including in the proposed IFA of Cusco. You testified that this criminal group is connected to other criminal groups and can track your whereabouts. You provided a photo that was taken of the two (2) you at place unknown to you, many screen shots and threatening letters.\n[26] Finally, the agent of harm in your case is a non-state actor. You also gave testimony regarding past attempts that you made to relocate, including trying to live with your friend and your brother. And that you were found there as well, in two (2) different provinces which is a six (6) hour drive apart. You were emotional in explaining that you sought psychological treatment, that you installed your own security systems, electrified fences, and your fear for your physical safety given the threats to both of you, which include threats of rape.\n[27] You also gave testimony that if you were to relocate to Cusco, that corruption is prevalent throughout Peru. You\u2019d also face violence which is pervasive against women in Peru, and you would have difficulty living in another location with no support or limited support.\n[28] As you testified, there would be no government assistance or family support available to you in the IFA. You also testified that you could not continue to live in a state of continuous fear.\n[29] The objective evidence supports your testimony regarding the prevalence of violence against women, and the corruption in and throughout Peru.\n[30] This is in the National Documentation Package again at Item 2.1, it indicates that significant human rights issues include credible reports of serious government corruption at all levels, including the judiciary, lack of investigation, and lack of accountability for gender-based violence. It also indicates there is ongoing discrimination and it\u2019s very difficult for women, with respect to housing, employment and education.\n[31] You indicated that you\u2019d be at risk from criminal groups in the purposed IFA, as they operated a similar manner as the gangs that threatened and harassed you both in Lima. Considering that criminal gangs operate in the IFA and engage in extortion threats, intimidation, I find that there is a reasonable chance that you would be threatened and extorted by criminal gangs if you relocated to Cusco.\n[32] Further, I find that the evidence before me, indicates that these criminals in revenge of your police reports and the resulting investigation, have the ongoing motivation and ability and capacity to find you in the IFA.\n[33] Now, the documentary evidence of the criminal actors to track you through cell phones in Peru was provided today prior to your hearing in support of your allegation that they would find you. And I agree that their persistence in tracking you from XXXX 2020,through XXXX 2021, illustrates their motivation.\n[34] I have also considered many of the relevant factors with respect to the second prong of the internal flight alternative test. Namely, your agents, your status as single women, the fact that you have no male support in Cusco.\n[35] You testified to the trials you had when arriving in Canada. You were homeless, you relied on the shelter system for XXXX (XXXX) months after coming to this country, and you rely on Ontario works now. There is no such active system of safe harbour and shelter that operates in Peru. There is a shelter system, it\u2019s focused on emergency and basic short-term services, and emergency short-term accommodation for survivors specifically, of domestic violence and human trafficking. I find that the evidence before me indicates that it would be objectively unreasonable to expect you to relocate anywhere in Peru, on account of your vulnerability as single women with no support, and that it would be very difficult for you to obtain basic necessities such as housing and employment.\n[36] Accordingly, and based on the totality of the evidence, I find that there is no viable internal flight alternative available to either of you in your unique circumstances.\n[37] And for the foregoing, I find that you are Convention refugees, pursuant to section 96 of the Act, and the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada therefore accepts your claims.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

Thank you so much. Madam Interpreter, you can just be on standby.\n[12] INTERPRETER: Okay.\n[13] MEMBER: Thank you. Okay, so XXXX XXXX XXXX, the claimant, alleges to be a citizen of Pakistan. He is seeking refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nALLEGATIONS\n[14] The specifics of the claim are set out in the claimant\u2019s Basis of Claim form. The following is a summary of the claimant\u2019s allegations. The claimant alleges to be a citizen of Pakistan. He fears persecution at the hands of the Sunni extremist organization, Sipah-e-Sahaba, SSP, due to his religion as a Shia Muslim.\nDETERMINATION\n[15] Having considered the totality of the evidence, the Panel finds that the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act for being a Shia Muslim.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[16] The claimant\u2019s personal and national identity has been established on a balance of probabilities through the documentation filed, namely, his Pakistani passport.\nCredibility\n[17] In making this determination, the Panel has considered all of the evidence, including the claimant\u2019s testimony, the Basis of Claim form, and all of the documentary evidence entered as exhibits. When a claimant affirms to tell the truth, this creates a presumption of truthfulness, unless there is evidence to the contrary. The claimant provided a cogent testimony relating to his religion as a Shia Muslim, and how he became an active member of his imambargah. He testified that he was a XXXX in Pakistan, and he served as the XXXX XXXX of his imambargah starting in XXXX 2020. The claimant provided a consistent and detailed testimony about receiving threatening phone calls from SSP for his activities in his imambargah, and even though he reported the phone calls to the police, the police did not provide any assistance. The claimant testified in a straightforward manner about moving to Rawalpindi in XXXX 2021, and then to Lahore in XXXX, 2021 due to his fear of SSP, while continuing to receive threatening phone calls from SSP and that they knew of his locations that he had moved to in Rawalpindi and Lahore. The claimant provided a consistent testimony about receiving a threatening phone call in XXXX 2021, in which the caller threatened him to pay money if he wants to save his life.\n[18] The claimant\u2019s testimony was generally consistent, detailed, straightforward, and spontaneous. The Panel did not note any contradictions, inconsistencies, or omissions that would go the heart of the claim. Therefore, the Panel finds that the claimant was a credible witness and finds that the claimant has established his religious profile as a Shia Muslim.\n[19] The claimant provided a number of documents in support of his claim, which includes the following. Documents corroborating that he was a XXXX in Pakistan, a letter from the imambargah in Pakistan confirming his membership as a Shia Muslim, and corroborating his allegations relating to his role as the (inaudible) secretary and receiving threats from SSP. A letter from the XXXX XXXX XXXX in Scarborough confirming his membership. An application for case registration, dated XXXX XXXX, 2020, relating to the threatening phone calls he received. A report at the police station in Lahore relating to the threatening phone call he received in XXXX of 2021. A letter from the XXXX XXXX he was employed corroborating his allegations relating to the threats he was receiving from SSP. And affidavits from family and friends corroborating his allegations relating to the threats he was receiving from SSP and moving to Rawalpindi as a result and continuing to receive threats even after moving. In light of the fact that the claimant\u2019s testimony was consistent, and the documents offered in evidence corroborates his allegations, the Panel accords the documents considerable weight. Based on the totality of the evidence in this case, the Panel finds on a balance of probabilities that the claimant has established his profile as Shia Muslim and has established a subjective fear of persecution.\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution\n[20] Country documentary evidence shows that societal violence due to religious intolerance remained a serious problem in Pakistan. Violence, abuse, and social and religious intolerance by militant organizations and other non-state actors, both local and foreign, contributed to a culture of lawlessness. Though as Muslims, Shias are free from certain restrictions affecting other religious groups, Shias are still regarded as apostates by some extremist Sunni groups and individuals. As a result, many face regular hostility from extremists and public calls fro members to be killed. There has been an increase in sectarian violence targeting Shia groups at least since 2012, with attacks primarily targeting ordinary Shia individuals. Though the escalation of violent attacks against Shia in the last decade has occurred alongside a general deterioration in the country\u2019s security context, the specific attacks against Shias are distinct in character and intent to most political killings, armed conflict deaths, and indiscriminate violence against civilians. Bombings carried out by militant and terrorist organizations have targeted social gatherings and crowded Shia areas with near impunity. Armed sectarian groups, including Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, Taliban, Pakistan, and the once banned anti-Shia group SSP, which is connected to other organizations banned by the government as extremists, and groups designated as terrorist organizations by the United States and other governments, continue to stage attacks targeting Shia Muslims. Throughout the year, unidentified individuals targeted and killed Shia Muslims in attacks believed to be religious motivated. Human rights activists reported numerous instances of societal violence related to allegations of blasphemy, of efforts by individuals to coerce religious minorities to convert to Islam, and of societal, harassment, discrimination, and threats of violence directed at members of religious minority community. Sunni groups held three (3) large rallies in Karachi in September, in which speakers warned Shia Muslims of dire consequences, including beheadings, if they continue to blaspheme against their Prophet Mohammed\u2019s companions. Police are generally unable to stop attacks when they have occurred and have failed to prevent and investigate in a meaningful way. The claimant has established his profile as a Shia Muslim. Based on the claimant\u2019s personal experiences and the documentary evidence, the Panel finds that his fear of return to Pakistan to have an objective basis. The claimant has established, on a balance of probabilities, a well-founded fear of persecution in Pakistan.\nState Protection\n[21] Except in situations where the state is in complete breakdown, states must be presumed capable of protecting their citizens. In this case, the country documents show that the authorities are unable to offer adequate protection as previously discussed. Shias are attacked with impunity, and the state is unable to prevent this in any meaningful way. Accordingly, the Panel finds that state protection is not adequate, and the presumption of state protection is rebutted.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[22] An internal flight alternative arises when claimants who otherwise meet all the elements of the definition of a Convention refugee in their home area of the country nevertheless are neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection because he can live safety elsewhere in that country. Religious intolerance and subsequent societal violence is a widespread and serious problem in Pakistan. Therefore, I find that the claimant faces a serious possibility of persecution throughout the entire country, and there is no viable internal flight alternative for the claimant in Pakistan.\nCONCLUSION\n[23] For the foregoing reasons, the Panel finds that the claimant is a Convention refugee under section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. The Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada therefore accepts his claim for refugee protection.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

In deciding this claim, I have taken into consideration the claimant\u2019s testimony, the totality of other evidence in this case. Additionally, I considered the social and cultural context, difficulties which claimants may face in obtaining documents, the milieu of the hearing room and the stress of responding to oral questions, all at arriving at my finding.\nPreliminary Matters\n[2] The Panel conducted a capacity assessment at the outside of the hearing. The claimant was found capable of understanding the seriousness of the hearing and the Panel determined he was not a vulnerable person. The Panel proceeded with the hearing without any other concerns for the claimant\u2019s ability to understand and, therefore, the Panel did not need to designate him a vulnerable person nor assign a representative to him.\nDETERMINATION\n[3] I find that you face a serious possibility of persecution in India based on imputed political opinion. I, therefore, find that you are a Convention refugee under section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, the IRPA. The Panel notes that there is also a dual nexus to membership in a particular social group, those with mental health disorders. Although this nexus exists, it will not form the bulk of the analysis as the claimant\u2019s imputed political opinion will be discussed at length and is the basis on which this finding is made.\nIdentity\n[4] I find that you have established your personal and national identity on a balance of probabilities through your oral testimony and the submission of your Indian passport at Exhibit 1.\nALLEGATIONS\n[5] You allege the following. That you operated and owned a XXXX XXXX business and rented the second floor of your family home to two (2) individuals. That you began renting to VK (ph) and RK (ph) in XXXX 2018. That you completed the mandatory police verification check on them by submitting their identity documents to the Delhi police. That in XXXX 2018, following the arrest of several college students, the Delhi police mandated that landlords resubmit tenant information for their verification. That you were on a trip to the USA at this time, but when you returned in XXXX 2018, you complied with this requirement. That on XXXX XXXX 2018, you resubmitted the same forms and information for VK and RK to the police. That on XXXX XXXX 2018, both Delhi police and Jammu and Kashmir state police came to the residence and you were required to let them into the unit. That they alleged to have found anti-national materials within that unit. That the police detained you for questioning for XXXX (XXXX) days until XXXX XXXX 2018. That the police interrogated you about the tenants, accused you of supporting their plot against India, accused you of being an anti-nationalist or militant, and that they subjected you to severe violence and made threat against your life. That you were hospitalized for XXXX (XXXX) days after your release. That you went into hiding XXXX (XXXX) XXXX XXXX XXXX hours away from your home, after both a lawyer and your family told you they were unable to help you, and another visit to the police station as required by the conditions put on you at your release. That you secured a Canadian visa and travelled to the USA before coming to Canada. That the police continued to question and harass your family, neighbours and municipal councillor giving explicit instructions to locate and alert them to your return.\nCredibility and Fact Finding\n[6] In terms of general credibility, I found you were a credible witness and I, therefore, believe what you have alleged in your oral testimony and in your Basis of Claim form. I found that you were spontaneous and detailed and that there were no contradictions in your testimony which go to the core of the claim. You established your credible testimony when you spoke about your fear of the police in an unembellished manner. I find the following documents support your allegations. The affidavit at Exhibit 4 from your parents supports the allegations of your arrest and the police continued interest in you. The letter from the advocate at Exhibit 4 which supports your allegations of seeking assistance, being denied assistance and the advice given to leave India. The medical letters from the Montreal-based hospital and support services at Exhibit 4 which supports your allegations regarding your mental health. The proof of Indian \u2014 of your Indian business at Exhibit 4 which supports the allegations that you were the renter of the premises and that this was the business you operated by yourself. The news article at Exhibit 5 which supports the allegation that the Delhi police forced landlords to resubmit tenant information starting in XXXX 2018. The letter from the municipal councillor at Exhibit 4 which supports the allegation of his involvement in your release from detention and the police continued interest in you. I have no reason to doubt the voracity of these documents and, therefore, assign them full weigh.\n[7] The Panel questioned the claimant on his delay in leaving India, as well as his time in the USA prior to coming to Canada and his delay in claiming once arrived in Canada. The Panel asked why he decided to apply for a Canadian visa and remain in India well in danger, rather than use the valid US based visa to immediately flee. The claimant provided the explanation that in speaking with this friend in California, that he was told that he could only stay for six (6) months in the US without leaving again. That they had discussed that if he had a Canadian visa, he could, essentially, shuttle back and forth between the US and Canada and continue to be safe for at least another period of six (6) months within Canada while matters calmed down in India, if necessary. The claimant also explained that neither he, nor his friend, were certain if he could apply for a Canadian visa while visiting the USA. So he went into hiding XXXX (XXXX) XXXX XXXX XXXX hours from his home in India while waiting for that visa. The Panel finds this is a reasonable explanation and that the claimant took significant steps to maintain his safety and that this supports his subjective fear.\n[8] The Panel also asked why, after the Canadian visa was issued in XXXX 2019, he remained in India until XXXX XXXX, 2019. The claimant explained that the agent he employed held onto his passport until he was paid in full and the payment was not received until early XXXX 2019. He then explained that when he gave his last payment installment, that he received his passport and the agent arranged his flight to the US. Again, the Panel accepts that this is a reasonable explanation. The Panel asked why the claimant did not make a refugee claim while in the USA for XXXX (XXXX) months prior to coming to Canada. He explained that as President Trump had been in power at that time, that he and community members discussed whether he could make a claim or not. He explained that they felt that the USA was now supportive of claims from India and that he feared being returned to India as a result. The Panel finds that this is well-documented fear and accepts this as a reasonable explanation. The Panel asked why he waited XXXX (XXXX) months, from arriving in Canada, to make his claim. Again, the claimant provided a reasonable explanation in saying that he sought advice from community members in Montreal and looked for Counsel to represent his interest during that time. The Panel accepts this response. Therefore, the Panel does not make any findings which impact the claimant\u2019s subjective fear. I find your subjective fear is established by your credible testimony and I believe what you have alleged on a balance of probabilities.\nObjective Basis\n[9] I have assessed the National Documentation Package and found that the objective basis for your fear is well established. The National Documentation Package widely acknowledges the police in India are often viewed as a corrupt organization and that they engage in torture, extrajudicial detention and extrajudicial murder. Items 2.1 highlights this, as does Item 10.5. 10.5 states that although there are mechanisms in place to denounce police actions or abuse, that those mechanisms are ineffective or non-operational at best. Item 12.8 highlights that the police and security organizations will harass and implicate those that they suspect of participating in anti-national or anti-Indian unity activities. And in many cases, falsely implicate those people in criminal cases which take years to resolve. The Panel also notes, although it is not determinative, that the NDP highlights the stigma attached to mental health disorders and the lack of available care for individuals such as the claimant. This is discussed at length in Item 1.14 which is a UK Home Office report. Therefore, the objective basis for this claim is established and the claimant has credibly established his well-founded fear of persecution.\nState Protection\n[10] As the agent of persecution in this claim is the police, the Panel finds it would be unreasonable for the claimant to approach the agent of persecution for his \u2013 for assistance. Therefore, the presumption of state protection is rebutted.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[11] I have considered whether the claimant would be able to safely live anywhere else in India. On the evidence before me, I find the test fail in the first prong and the claimant would not be safe in either Bengaluru, Mumbai or Hyderabad, which were the proposed internal flight alternatives. The police have shown their continued motivation and ability to locate the claimant through their dual interests and interconnection of the Delhi police and the Jammu and Kashmir police. They have done so by visiting his family members over the last three (3) years. Given the ongoing harassment of the claimant\u2019s family by the police, the claimant will be unable to disclose his whereabouts to his immediate ouldd be unreasonable for the claimant\u2019s family to place their own lives in danger by either denying knowledge of his whereabouts or by deliberately misleading police. To require the claimant to return and not disclose his location to his family will be tantamount to requiring him to hide in the IFAs. And the federal court has stated in both Zamora Huerta, Z-A-M-O-R-A, second name H-U-E-R-T-A, and in Ali, A-L-I, that this is an unreasonable burden to place on the claimant. As a result, the test fails and there is no internal flight alternative available to the claimant.\nCONCLUSION\n[12] Based on the totality of the evidence before me, I conclude that the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA based on his imputed political opinion. His claim is, therefore, accepted.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

Bohbot\nCountry: India\nRPD Number: TC2-17872\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2022-01960\nATIP Pages: N\/A\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: So, this is a decision in TC2-17872. In deciding this claim, I have taken into consideration the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9 on sexual orientation and gender identity, expression, and sex characteristics. I have considered the claimant\u2019s testimony and totality of the other evidence in this case. Additionally, I have considered previously stated guideline, the social and cultural context, difficulties which a claimant may faced in obtain documents, the milieu of the hearing room, and the stress of responding to oral questions all during the course of arriving at my finding.\nDETERMINATION\n[2] I find that you face a serious possibility of persecution in India based on the ground of particular social group being a gay man. I note that the claim also has a basis for finding under section 96 for political opinion. The claimant is a Khalistan supporter who has a long history of questioning Hinduism publicly as the ruling party, the BJP, view India as a Hindu nation and promote Hinduism and its values as central to country unity. His known questioning and comments on Hinduism dating back to 2013 also raises a serious possibility of persecution. Although I acknowledge that the political opinion nexus exists, this decision will only arrest (sic) the membership in a particular social group, gay men. As a result, I have considered this claim under section 96 of the IRPA.\nIdentity\n[3] I find that you have established your personal and national identity, on a balance of probabilities, through your oral testimony and the submission of your Indian passport at Exhibit 1.\nALLEGATIONS\n[4] You have alleged the following, that you are a gay man, that you are a citizen of India but primarily resided in the United Arab Emirates, that on vacation in India with your family, you were there for a period of XXXX (XXXX) months in 2013, that in 2013, you were in Amritsar from \u2014 which is where your parents are from, and you met an individual, BS, who is a gay man and that you began a friendship, that you would gather in restaurants, cafeterias, and at BS\u2019s home and often spoke about gay rights and religion with BS and his friends, that in XXXX 2013, during a movie night at BS\u2019s is home, the local Hindu XXXX XXXX, OP, the local XXXX XXXX, HD, and the local sarpanch arrived and shamed the gathering before taking you to the temple, that at the temple, you were beaten and accused of insulting the Hindu gods and being a homosexual, which, at the time, was still illegal, that they produced an audio recording of you insulting the Hindu gods for being unable to protect a temple from a Muslim conqueror, that after escaping, your family arranged your return to the UAE when they were unable to secure for forgiveness from the sarpanch, and that after returning to the UAE in XXXX 2013, that a \u2014 you learned a police complaint had been filed against you following a ruling of the \u2014 I am just going to spell it now. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, that you continue to live in the UAE until the father of your boyfriend, SM, threatened to have your family\u2019s visas revoked in XXXX \u2014in XXXX 2015, so you fled to Canada on a student permit, that the police continued to visit your relatives within India and that once your parents had returned to India in XXXX 2020, they located them in Delhi and started visiting them as well, that you remained in Canada without status until XXXX 2020, when you learned from a member of the gay community that you can make a refugee you claim on the basis of your sexual orientation and that you did so in a timely manner.\nCredibility and Fact-Finding\n[5] In terms of general credibility, I found you to be a credible witness, and therefore, I believe what you have alleged in your oral testimony and in your Basis of Claim form. I found that you are spontaneous and detailed and there were no contradictions in your testimony which go to the core of your claim. You established your credible testimony when you spoke regarding the realization of your sexual orientation, your continued fears regarding being discovered, your in-depth conversation \u2014 as well as your in-depth conversation about your religious identity and sexual orientation all in an unembellished manner.\n[6] I find that the following documents support your allegations. The letter from the Indian advocate at Exhibit 4, which indicates the continued police interest in you, including a complaint, the affidavit of your parents at Exhibit 4, which supports your allegations around how they learned of your sexual orientation, the medical certificate at Exhibit 4, which supports your allegation of the injuries you sustained in XXXX 2013, the declaration of your partner here in Canada at Exhibit 4, which supports your allegations of your live-in partner, a membership card for XXXX, a gay club in Toronto, at Exhibit 4, which supports your allegations of involvement with the gay community here in Canada, the Backward Caste certificate at Exhibit 4, which supports your allegations regarding your caste. I have no reasons to doubt the veracity of these documents and therefore assign them full weight.\n[7] As a result, I find, on a balance of probabilities, that you have established the following, that you are a gay ma, that a complaint was made about you to the police in XXXX 2013, that your community in Amritsar, India, knew of your sexual orientation or should know about your sexual orientation based on the XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, that you are a Sikh man from a lower caste who has lived a substantial portion of his life outside of India.\n[8] In examining your subjective fear, I also considered the delay in your claim, and I found your explanation for it reasonable, being that you are unaware that you could claim based on sexual orientation and that as you did not speak with community members about the difficulties you had faced in India for fear of backlash, that you did not know the possibility until your out of status.\n[9] I considered additionally that you were willing to present your partner as a witness in today\u2019s claim. However, I declined as I found it not necessary to establish your sexual orientation.\n[10] I considered and applied Guideline 9\u2019s guidance on understanding the challenges faced by individuals with diverse sexual orientations in establishing their orientation in their refugee hearings. The guideline informs the Panel that individuals with diverse SOGIESC recognize and may act on their SOGIESC differently, that an individual\u2019s self-awareness and self-acceptance may present as gradual or in a non-linear process. It also says that many individuals with diverse SOGIESC concealed their sexual orientation in their country of reference out of mistrust or fear of repercussions by the state or non-state actors as well as due to previous experiences of stigmatization and violence. I therefore find your subjective fear is established by your credible testimony and I believe what you have alleged, on a balance of probabilities.\nObjective Basis\n[11] The objective evidence in the National Documentation Package indicates that homosexuality has been decriminalized in India since 2018 but that prevailing societal attitudes still view it as unacceptable and immoral. The objective evidence at Items 2.6 indicates that the SOGIESC community in India continues to face substantial discrimination, including violence and harassment in some instances, that police opinion reflects the societal opinion, and that police now use nuisance and other unassociated laws to harass, manipulate, and threaten gay men. Reference to that can be found in Item 6.4. Item 6.1 shows that there has been an increase in hate crimes against SOGIESC individuals and human rights violations regarding employment. The SOGIESC people have no positive protection in either the constitution or broader protection in employment against hate crimes, against incitement, and that there is no ban on conversion therapy. Item 6.6 also objectively shows the cumulative nature of discrimination in the areas of housing, employment, access to public spaces, and concludes that the SOGIESC community members face discrimination which impedes civil, cultural, economic, political, and social rights and indicates that the community remains at a high risk of violence both by members of state security forces and by the broader society.\n[12] The claimant testified that he believes he would struggle to find housing and employment in India because the community in Amritsar knew or highly suspected he was gay and that if individuals in other areas learned of his sexuality, that he would be highly discriminated against as well. The objective evidence supports this conclusion because there are no positive laws which prohibit discrimination against SOGIESC people. Based on the evidence before me, the Panel finds that the objective basis is made out and the claimant has therefore established his well-founded fear of persecution.\nState Protection\n[13] States are presumed capable of protecting their citizens except in situations where the country is in a state of complete breakdown. To rebut the presumption of state protection, a claimant must provide clear and convincing evidence of the state\u2019s inability or unwillingness to protect its citizens. The claimant is required to approach the state for protection if protection might be reasonably forthcoming. However, the claimant is not required to risk their life seeking ineffective protection of the state merely to demonstrate that ineffectiveness.\n[14] There is no positive legal protection at law from discrimination in employment, or from hate crimes, or against conversion therapy within India. Police authorities are frequently the source of discrimination and violence against SOGIESC people and harass, abuse, and use threats of arrest on falsified charges against members of the SOGIESC community. Police corruption in India remains a significant problem and police in India regularly torture your or extrajudicially kill suspects with impunity. Indian police share the same prejudice as the community at large, and as a result, SOGIESC people have less access to state protection than other Indian citizens and are at a risk of abuse and violence from the police due to being SOGIESC.\n[15] The claimant, having had previously a police complaint in 2013 for insulting Hindu gods, would further be exposed to anti-Sikh or religious hatred in addition to his identity being a Sikh man. As a result, in the particular circumstances of this claim, the presumption of state protection is rebutted.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[16] In determining whether an IFA exists, the Panel must apply the two (2) prong has set out in Rasaratnam (mispronouncing). The test requires that the claimant show, on a (inaudible), that there is a serious possibility of persecution or a risk to life or cruel or unusual punishment throughout the country, including in the suggested IFA location, and, two (2), that the proposed internal flight alternative can be unreasonable given the particular circumstances of the individual claimant. Panel, at the outset of the hearing, identified Delhi and Mumbai as potential IFAs. The Panel finds that the test fails in the first prong and the claimant does face a serious possibility of persecution in any place in India, on a balance of probabilities, as the attitudes towards the SOGIESC community, although varied in India based on location, tends to be negative and that violent harassment and discrimination is widespread with few repercussions. The Panel therefore finds there is no viable internal flight alternative in the particular circumstances of this claim. Based on the \u2014\nCONCLUSION\n[17] Based on the totality of the evidence before me, the Panel finds that the claimant has established that he is a Convention refugee and his claim is therefore accepted.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

Yerzy\nCountry: Georgia\nRPD Number: TC2-18302\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2022-01960\nATIP Pages: N\/A\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: I am ready to make my decision in this case. These are the reasons for that decision, in the matter TC2-18302, Mr. XXXX XXXX.\n[2] Mr. XXXX alleges citizenship in Georgia and seeks the protection of Canada pursuant to section 96 or 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, which I will refer to as the Act.\n[3] The claimant\u2019s allegations may be found in full in his Basis of Claim, that is B-O-C, BOC, and narrative, at Exhibit 2. He also submitted an amended BOC, found at Exhibit 5.\n[4] In summary, he alleges that he has been harmed and fears further severe harm from Georgia\u2019s Georgian Dream party, which I will call the GDP, and government.\n[5] He alleges that the threat arises because he opposes the government as a member of the United National Movement, or UNM.\n[6] I find that the claimant has established that he is Convention refugee under section 96 of the Act.\n[7] My reasons follow.\n[8] First, with respect to identity.\n[9] The claimant has demonstrated his personal and national identity, on a balance of probabilities, through his testimony and by a copy of his Georgia passport and national identity card. Those are at Exhibit 1 and Exhibit 6, document 2.\n[10] Next, nexus.\n[11] As the claimant alleges harm on account of one of the Convention grounds enumerated in section 96 of the Act, that is, political opinion, I evaluate his claim under section 96.\n[12] Now, as to credibility.\n[13] A claimant\u2019s sworn testimony is presumed truthful, absent a valid reason to doubt it. The determination about whether it is credible is made on a balance of probabilities.\n[14] The claimant testified today in a manner fully consistent with the core allegations set forth in his BOC and amendment. My questioning covered his background, political opinion, and the harm resulting from that opinion.\n[15] His responses were spontaneous, responsive, and sufficiently detailed yet unembellished. He was able to fill in details about the allegations when asked, and to easily address the allegations out of chronological order. The testimony was internally consistent, and I detected no material contradictions with, or omissions from, the documentation submitted.\n[16] The claimant testified, as alleged in his BOC and amendment, that he is a XXXX XXXX XXXX, having XXXX for several years through 2021 with XXXX XXXX XXXX, known as the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, after its founders. He has XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and the company is popular with Georgians. It XXXX around Georgia and internationally. The claimant was featured on the XXXX 2020 XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and has been viewed over 1.3 million times XXXX in a XXXX 2020 XXXX XXXX of a XXXX XXXX. He submitted a copy of the XXXX XXXX and the video, found at Exhibit 6, document 20.\n[17] I do not see a reason not to find them authentic; they corroborate these allegations and I give them full weight.\n[18] I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant is well known in Georgia as a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.\n[19] Concerning his political views, the claimant testified, again consistently with his BOC and amendment, that he never agreed with the GDP, but kept quiet about it until 2022, out of respect for the XXXX XXXX ban on political expression. Because of his mother\u2019s Ossetian background, and because he grew up in an area he sees as subsequently occupied by Russia, he despises the GDP\u2019s pro-Russian position.\n[20] He chose to join the UNM opposition party in XXXX 2022, because he happened to have befriended a former party official, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, after being invited over to Mr. XXXX house after a performance. Over the coming period, he was active on social media about his political views.\n[21] The claimant submitted documents to support his allegation that he formally opposed the GDP and joined the UNM. These include a letter from the UNM\u2019s leader, which he testified that he obtained through his friend XXXX, and screenshots of the claimant\u2019s 2022 social media denouncing Russia and the GDP. These documents may be found at Exhibit 6, document 5, and documents 15 through 17.\n[22] They appear authentic, on a balance of probabilities, and they corroborate an open anti-GDP stance.\n[23] I give them full weight, therefore, and find that the claimant has openly displayed a political opinion openly hostile to the GDP government and party, and in line with the UNM.\n[24] As to the fallout from the claimant\u2019s open political opinion, he testified consistently with the BOC and amendment, about the escalating harm that befell him before leaving Georgia. He first received an anonymous phone call insisting that he stop his political expression, about a week after he joined the UNM. Shortly thereafter, someone smashed into his car. That incident was followed by a phone call to let him know that he needed to stop political advocacy or\u2014\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 AUDIO #1 ENDS (03:59:58) \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 AUDIO #1 BEGINS \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u2026face worse harm than occurred to his car.\n[25] The following month, XXXX 2022, he was driving when a car tried to cut him off, distracting him and causing him to run into the car in front of him. He got out to discuss and noticed that both drivers were approaching. They kicked him, he fell, and they kicked him some more. Before leaving, they told him that this was the final warning, or he would be killed.\n[26] He sought medical treatment and provided verification of this at Exhibit 7, document 6, from the hospital to which he drove.\n[27] During XXXX (XXXX) days there, he spoke with police who returned to tell him that they would not help him as it would jeopardize their jobs. I see no error in the medical certificate and give it full weight as to the injuries sustained, timing, and length of stay.\n[28] And I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant was harmed and ultimately attacked by GDP operatives in XXXX 2022, plus threatened with death if he did not silence his political, his anti-government political expression.\n[29] The claimant left Georgia on XXXX XXXX, 2022, shortly after the attack, using a Canadian visa that he already had for professional reasons. He entered Canada the same day.\n[30] I questioned why he did not report his fears to CBSA upon entry. He answered that he was afraid to, and I accept this reasonable in his circumstances. He signed his BOC soon thereafter, on March 21st, 2022.\n[31] I asked, as well, about whether the threat from the GDP had abated because he left. He testified consistently with his XXXX XXXX, 2022, BOC amendment, that his brother in Georgia had been beaten up and injured on May 2020 22 (sic) by GDP by supporters. At Exhibit 6, documents 9 and 10, he submitted a medical certificate and a letter from his parents about the harm both the claimant and his brother experienced, linking it to the GDP.\n[32] These documents appear authentic and corroborative, and I give them full weight.\n[33] I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant is still in the sights of the GDP because of his politics.\n[34] For these reasons, I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant has credibly established that he has been threatened and attacked by the GDP because of his expressed anti-GDP political opinion. As well as that, he continues to face a risk in his country for this reason.\n[35] I also find that he has established a subjective fear of harm about what would await him in Georgia, because of his political opinion.\n[36] I now must assess whether there is objective evidence sufficient to support the claimant\u2019s subjective fear.\n[37] I find, on a balance of probabilities, that there is, that the fear is well founded.\n[38] Open opposition to the GDP Georgian government can be dangerous, as the objective evidence describes widespread government monitoring of political opposition, and continued reports of politically motivated violence. The most recent National Documentation Package at Exhibit 3, reports that the Georgian government threatens and abuses those that it disfavours.\n[39] The US State Department found that credible reports last year of cruel treatment and arbitrary and selective investigations, detention, and prosecutions. That information is at Exhibit 3, Tab 2.1.\n[40] The claimant here was beaten, injured, and threatened with death by the GDP. He testified reasonably that his prominence in Georgia made him more likely to be a target of a corrupt and repressive government.\n[41] The election system in Georgia, and politics there as a whole, have been troubled by corruption, and this persists. During the 2020 parliamentary elections, there reportedly were \u201cpervasive allegations of pressure on voters and blurring of the line between the ruling party and the State.\u201d That quote is at Exhibit 3, Tab 2.1, paragraph 52.\n[42] The US State Department reports that Georgian NGOs submitted hundreds of electoral complaints about those 2020 elections and that six (6) of those NGOs described the October 31st, 2020, elections as the worst the GDP has ever held. Again, that\u2019s at Exhibit 3, Tab 2.1. They featured voter intimidation and violence against journalists trying to report accurate news. Transparency International describes the ability of voters to speak and vote freely may well have been impacted, compromised, may well have compromised the outcome of the election in favour of the GDP. Again, that is at Tab 2.1.\n[43] With stakes this high, the GDP party and government would not be expected to tolerate open opposition by persons of prominence and with connections in Georgia, such as the claimant.\n[44] On a balance of probabilities, I find that the claimant\u2019s subjective fear is well founded and that he continues to face a serious possibility of persecution for openly defying the GDP government.\n[45] I turn to state protection now.\n[46] Except when in complete breakdown, a state is presumed capable of providing its citizens adequate protection, and a claimant must present clear and convincing evidence that the protection is not adequate.\n[47] Georgia is not in complete breakdown, but the objective evidence does indicate that the Georgian government is not willing to provide adequate protection for those who are perceived to oppose it. The claimant reported to the police the serious attack he experienced in XXXX 2022, to no avail. When the police returned to the hospital after taking his report, they told him that they would not investigate because they wanted to keep their jobs.\n[48] Georgian law enforcement is not independent of the GDP government, and is subject to the same sort of corruption described in a consensus of the NDP items.\n[49] Voter intimidation, for example, has been reported to involve law enforcement. Georgia\u2019s constitution provides for the right of political speech and assembly for political protests without obtaining government permission. The Human Rights and Education Monitoring Centre reported in 2016, however, that these rights were often violated when convenient for the government. This is to be found at Exhibit 3, Tab 10.3, chapters two (2) and three (3).\n[50] Beginning in 2012, the Centre states, Human Rights Watch observed the Georgian government performing arbitrary arrests and taking punitive measures against political activists and others expressing political opinions. The Centre states that Georgia\u2019s police system is \u201csharply centralized,\u201d posing a high risk that officers will be used for political ends.\n[51] For these reasons, I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the presumption that adequate state protection would be available to the claimant in Georgia, has been rebutted.\n[52] Finally, I address internal flight alternative.\n[53] Protection in Canada is to serve as a surrogate for the protection that a claimant ought to be able to find in the home country. I now address whether there is a location within Georgia in which the claimant could live without facing, on a balance of probabilities, harm, in this case a serious possibility of persecution.\n[54] I find that there is not.\n[55] Zugdidi was proposed as a potential IFA at the outset of the hearing.\n[56] But because Georgia\u2019s national government is intertwined with the GDP political party, and has demonstrated a willingness to engage in persecution for political opinion, and because the claimant is well known to the GDP and around Georgia, and is still sought by the GDP, I find, on a balance of probabilities, that he has no viable internal flight alternative.\n[57] To conclude, for the reasons given, I find that the claimant has established a serious possibility of persecution in Georgia, because of his political opinion and I accept his claim.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

The file number is TC2-19299.\n[2] I have considered the testimony and the other evidence in the case, and I am ready to render my decision orally.\n[3] You are claiming to be a citizen of India and are claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[4] In rendering my decision, I have considered the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 4 on Gender Consideration in Proceedings Before the IRB.\nDETERMINATION\n[5] I find that you are a Convention refugee, on the grounds of your membership in a particular social group as a woman fearing gender-based violence.\nALLEGATIONS\n[6] Your allegations are set out in your Basis of Claim form, which is found in Exhibit 2, as well as the addendum to your narrative that was submitted.\n[7] In summary, you allege that you are a citizen of India and are Sikh from Punjab.\n[8] You allege that your father has been a XXXX XXXX since 1993 and worked XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.\n[9] You allege that your father did play a role in the arrest of gangsters and members of the XXXX XXXX gang. As a result, you allege that these criminals started to threaten to harm you in retaliation.\n[10] You allege that criminals attacked your home in XXXX of 2021, looking for you, and after this attack, your father moved you to Kolkata. However, criminals found you there, sexually assaulted you in front of your father, and threatened to kill you if your father did not withdraw the case against their gang members.\n[11] Fearing for your safety, you allege that your father, then, sent you to Canada.\nIdentity\n[12] Your identity as a national of India has been established, on a balance of probabilities, by your passport, which is found in Exhibit 1.\nCredibility\n[13] In terms of your general credibility, I find that you are a credible witness, and therefore, believe what you have alleged in your oral testimony and Basis of Claim form.\n[14] Your testimony was spontaneous, and you were forthright in your responses. There were no major omissions or inconsistencies. There were certain things that you did not have a lot of information about, but this was in relation to events where you were not present or with respect to information that your father may have withheld from you, and I find that this is reasonable that you would not have all the information as a young woman and are, therefore, relying on what your father has shared with you.\n[15] You testified about how and why these criminals started targeting you, what happened when you were in Kolkata, and why you fear returning to India today.\n[16] You explained that these criminals are targeting you, because you are your father\u2019s daughter, and they see you as a weakness for your father.\n[17] You\u2019ve explained that your parents are currently living in police quarters and are relatively safe there, but that you would not be able to live there, because you are over the age of 18 and therefore, not allowed to live there.\n[18] You also provided documents to corroborate your allegations, including the order, appointing your father as a XXXX XXXX in 1993, as well as his XXXX ID card; an affidavit from your father, explaining his work history and why these criminals are targeting you, and an affidavit from your mother who also talks about why these criminals are targeting you specifically.\n[19] Now for based on your testimony, as well as the corroborating documents filed, I find that you have established, on a balance of probabilities, that you are Sikh from Punjab, that your father is a XXXX XXXX who worked XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and that these gangs have now threatened to harm you in retaliation for his work.\n[20] Furthermore, based on the totality of the evidence, I find that you have established a subjective fear of persecution.\nObjective Evidence\n[21] The objective documentation in the National Documentation Package and in the articles provided by Counsel also support your allegations and the risk that you face in India.\n[22] While there are laws in the books to prevent crimes against women, violence against women in India persists. At Item 1.5, it says that there are sociodemographic and sociocultural risk factors for various forms of violence and abuse towards women in India. These include patriarchal attitudes towards marriage and motherhood, stigmatisation of unmarried, separated, or divorced women, illiteracy and low education levels, low socioeconomic status, and lack of independent income.\n[23] According to the United Nations Special Rapporteur on violence against women, sexual violence is widespread across the country and perpetrated in public and private spaces, and there is a general sense of insecurity for women in public spaces, which is (inaudible) at Item 5.9 in the National Documentation Package.\n[24] At Item 2.1 of the National Documentation Package, it says that rape continues to be a persistent problem in India.\n[25] At Item 5.4, it says women who experienced sexual violence are stigmatised. Rape is still constructed as women\u2019s shame and there are so many social barriers for women to talk about it.\n[26] And this is something you testified about as well, since you had experienced a sexual assault in India. You said that you felt very embarrassed about what happened to you and that it was difficult for you to talk about this experience.\n[27] At Item 5.9, it says that sexual offenses are underreported, due to social stigma, deeply entrenched patriarchal attitudes of the police, and justice system that blames victims, and a fear of victimisation by police personnel.\n[28] The objective evidence also establishes that single women face high levels of depravation, social taboos, limited freedom to remarry and secure property rights, social restrictions on living arrangements, restrictive employment opportunities, emotional and other forms of violence and a lack of social support. And discrimination and violence against women in India is high, which is stated at Item 5.9 of the National Documentation Package.\n[29] Additionally, the barriers that you would face obtaining housing and employment as a single woman without a support network, which is referenced in Item 5.11, as well as the risk of sexual and gender-based violence, which again is noted in Item 5.9, all of this constitutes persecution.\n[30] You also provided articles about the XXXX XXXX gang and their criminal activities, which corroborate your allegations about this gang and their existence, and their activities in India.\n[31] And I do note that these gangs were targeting you not only because of your relationship to your father who is a XXXX XXXX, but specifically because of your gender.\n[32] Therefore, based on this documentation, I find that you have an objectively well-founded fear of persecution.\nState Protection\n[33] I find that state protection would not be available to you in India, were you to seek it. Your father is a XXXX XXXX and was unable to get help from his colleagues and superiors. It said he was advised to take a bride and sweep the charges under the rug, so that these men would stop threatening you.\n[34] And this suggestion or advice from the other XXXX XXXX is supported by the objective evidence, which does talk about the corruption amongst XXXX XXXX and the prevalence of XXXX XXXX taking bribes.\n[35] The objective evidence also demonstrates that in general there is inadequate protection for victims of sexual violence. Item 2.1 of the National Documentation Package says that law enforcement and legal recourse for rape victims was inadequate, and the judicial system was overtaxed and unable to address the problem effectively.\n[36] Item 5.14, the National Documentation Package says that in cases where a woman is able to overcome institutional barriers and stigma and have a complaint filed, court cases can last years or even decades, resulting in low conviction rates.\n[37] Therefore, based on your personal circumstances, as well as the objective evidence in the National Documentation Package, I find that you have rebutted the presumption of state protection and that adequate state protection is not available to you in India.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[38] I have also considered whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for you in India.\n[39] However, as a single woman, I find that you face a serious possibility of persecution throughout the country.\n[40] You did try to relocate to Kolkata in XXXX 2021, however, the criminals that were threatening you were able to locate you there and sexually assault you there as well.\n[41] You do not have anywhere to go in India, so you would be returning as a young, Sikh, single woman, trying to find housing in a way to support herself.\n[42] At Item 1.5 in the National Documentation Package, it says that the viability of internal relocation in India is limited by factors such as a lack of familial or community networks, lack of employment opportunities and discrimination based on ethnicity, religion, caste, or gender.\n[43] At Item 5.11, as I previously noted, single women face significant barriers obtaining housing and employment without a support network and at Item 5.9, it also talks about how single women face difficulties accessing housing.\n[44] Item 5.11, it says that landlords do not want to rent to single women, because women are expected to live with their father or spouse, and this is something that you also testified about that there is a suspicion (ph) of single women who were living alone and that landlords think that if there is a single woman there, that men or other people are going to be coming and hanging around and trying to harm them.\n[45] You also explained that you and your father were forced to stay in a gurdwara in Kolkata, because no one would rent to you as Sikhs from Punjab, and given your father\u2019s occupation as XXXX XXXX, people were very hesitant to provide you with accommodation, and your counsel also provided articles about he discrimination that Sikhs face outside of Punjab, as there is a rise of Indian nationalism.\n[46] Item 5.14 in the National Documentation Package, it says that without support in another city and without access to adequate housing, you would be vulnerable to exploitation, sexual assaults, and trafficking.\n[47] Therefore, based on your personal circumstances and experiences, as well as the objective evidence on the record, I find that there is no viable internal flight alternative for you in India.\n\nCONCLUSION\n[48] Based on the totality of the evidence, I find that you are a Convention refugee on the grounds of your membership in a particular social group.\n[49] Your claim is, therefore, accepted.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

On that same day, the panel rendered its oral positive decision and reasons for decision. This is the written version of the oral decision and reasons that have been edited for clarity, spelling, grammar, and syntax with added references to the documentary evidence and relevant case law where appropriate.\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: This is the decision for the following claim, TC2-20798, by XXXX XXXX XXXX. You claimed to be a citizen of Jamaica and you are claiming refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. I have considered your testimony and all the evidence in this claim, and I am ready to render an oral decision. In hearing and assessing this claim I have considered and applied Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 4, women refugee claimants fearing gender-related persecution, which offer guidance in recognizing women as members in a particular social group, and also with respect to the other gender issues specifically present in this claim.\n[2] The allegations are set out in your Basis of Claim form and narrative found in Exhibit 2. In summary, you allege that you have been physically and emotionally abused by your ex-partner whom you have six (6) children (typographical error as amended) with, and that this abuse started in 1998, for which you moved out of your home in 2007 and later return back in 2016 after the death of your mother, with the intention that your ex-partner have changed. You testified that you fear that should you return to Jamaica, you will be killed by your ex partner. In the examination, I found you are a Convention refugee on the grounds of membership in a particular social group as a female victim of domestic violence for the following reasons.\n[3] With regards to your identity, your personal and national identity has been established on a balance of probabilities by a copy of your passport found at Exhibit 1. There is a link between your claim and the Convention ground of particular social group, namely victims of domestic and\/or gender-based violence. Therefore, your claim has been assessed under section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. With regards to credibility, I found you to be a credible witness. Your testimony was clear and consistent with your written narrative and evidence on file. However brief your testimony was today, in your brief testimony you established your relationship with your ex-partner, how and when he became abusive to you. You noted the serious impacts that this abuse had on you and your attempts to rid yourself of your ex-partner. You testified about that your ex-partner started abusing you in 1998 when he started coming home drunk. You also narrated how you went to look for him in his cousin\u2019s house and saw him in a truck with another woman, for which you confronted him for not giving you money for your children and he beat you up in front of his girlfriend. You testified that you went home to pack your bag, but he came back in, and he did not want to leave without his children, and you stayed back. You testified that in 2001 your ex-partner came home and saw you with your friend, XXXX (ph), who is a lesbian, and that he put (inaudible) down and threatened to cut you into pieces if you did not end your friendship with XXXX, as he hated lesbians.\n[4] You testified as to the continuous cycle of abuse and how the second which you moved to stay with your mother and then your uncle and later returned back to your ex-partner\u2019s house after every abuse. You testified that it was very difficult for you to leave your ex-partner\u2019s house. You testified that you eventually moved to XXXX XXXX in 2007 with three (3) of your children, and you left the other children in different locations, one (1) with your mother, one (1) with your cousin, and another with your ex-partner. You testified that you lived in XXXX XXXX from 2007 to 2016 and returned after your mother passed on in 2016, and that your ex-partner was very supportive during the period your mother passed. You testified your ex-partner showed you that he had changed, and he did not want to be separated from his children. You testified that you thought he had changed, and you moved back with him, for which things were normal for a while until the abuse started again. You testified that your ex-partner wants to kill you because he accused you of being a lesbian and that you had brought shame to his name. You also testified that he wants to kill you because he accused you of turning your children\u2019s mind away from him.\n[5] You testified that you reported all the abuse to the police, who did nothing about it, but advised you to settle with your partner for the sake of your children. I find on the balance on probabilities that you are genuine, as your testimony was detailed and persuasive and consistent with someone recounting a personal event. You supported your testimony with some letters from your children, noting their knowledge of what was happening to you. You also provided letters from your friend in XXXX XXXX whom you lived with from 2007 to 2016, as well as your cousin who took in your child when you left your partner in 2007. This is marked as Exhibit 5. I accord significant weight to this evidence as they are reliable and consistent with the overall testimony. I find on the balance of probabilities that you are are credible. You established you are a victim of domestic violence and gender-based violence. You established that you made multiple efforts to secure state protection, but that protection was not for forthcoming. As a result, your subjective fear has been established.\n[6] With regards to objective basis, I also find that an objective basis for which you fear in Jamaica and country condition documents in the National Documentation Package corroborates the testimony provided by you and indicate that violence against women in Jamaica is widespread. Item 5.2 of the NDP indicates that while the government of Jamaica has passed legislation which allows women who have been victims of domestic violence to apply for protection of courts, this legislation is poorly enforced. The United Nations Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights Committee has expressed its profound concerns for the high rates of domestic and sexual violence in Jamaica. The government of Jamaica has stated that there is an unacceptably high level of violence against women and children in the country. This prevalence of domestic violence is indicated in a more recent 2019 OECD report found at Item 5.1 and in a 2019 UK Home Office report found at Item 1.5. The UK Home Office report also indicates that gender-based violence is a widespread phenomenon in Jamaica, and that women face challenges in protection due to lack of resources, backlogs in judicial system, and a lack of shelter. The objective evidence indicates that your threats are real, as gender-based violence is widespread. The fear you face from your ex-partner is reflected in the objective basis. Therefore, based on this documentary evidence I find that you have an objectively well-founded fear of persecution in Jamaica.\n[7] With respect to state protection, the objective evidence noted above supports your fear that there is no operationally effective state protection available to you in your particular circumstances. While Jamaica may have made some steps to address domestic violence, country condition documents indicate that at an operational level, effective state protection is not available in the country. You asked about whether you had attempted to speak to the police to receive protection. You testified that you reported to the police on several occasions, and they advised you to settle within yourselves and try to live with it for the sake of your children. The evidence demonstrates that when you sought protection from the police, it was not taken seriously and was seen as a private matter. The evidence demonstrated that if you seek help in the future, you would not get help. I therefore find that state protection will not be forthcoming, given your personal circumstance.\n[8] With respect to internal flight alternative, I find that there is no viable internal flight alternative for you in Jamaica. You face a serious possibility of persecution in all of Jamaica. Therefore, I find on a balance of probabilities that there is no safe IFA in Jamaica.\n[9] In conclusion, based on the totality of the evidence, I find that you have established a serious possibility of persecution due to your membership in a particular social group, as a female victim of domestic violence. I find you to be a Convention refugee and I accept your claim. These are my reasons. Thank you.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

        "unofficial_text":"2022 RLLR 39\n\nCitation: 2022 RLLR 39\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: October 17, 2022\nPanel: Alexandra Kotyk\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Jeffrey Nadler\nCountry: Pakistan\nRPD Number: TC2-21802\nAssociated RPD Number(s): TC2-21803, TC2-21804, TC2-21805, TC2-21806\nATIP Number: A-2022-01960\nATIP Pages: N\/A\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: So, this is the decision for the following claimants, TC2-21802, XXXX XXXX, TC2-21803, XXXX XXXX XXXX, TC2-21804, XXXX XXXX, TC2-21805, XXXX XXXX, and TC2-21806, XXXX XXXX. You are claiming to be citizens of Pakistan and are seeking refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. I have considered your testimony and the other evidence in this case, and I am ready to render my decision orally. Designated representative at the time of this hearing, the claimants XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX were minors. The principal claimant, XXXX, is their father, and so served as the designated representative and confirmed his role at the start of this hearing.\nDETERMINATION\n[2] I find that all claimants are Convention refugees on the section 96 nexus grounds of religion, and for the associate minor claimants, as membership in a particular social group as family members of the principal claimant for the following reasons.\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] The allegations are set out in the Basis of Claim forms found at Exhibits 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, and the amendment at Exhibit 5. In summary, the principal claimant\u2019s family has been targeted by the LHA and SSP since his brother made an agreement with the Shia community to use his land. The principal claimant himself was directly targeted after statements he made to a religious leader while he was working in Kuwait, and this led to a fatwa and police report alleging blasphemy being issued against him.\n[4] (inaudible) in the US, the principal claimant testified that the family entered the US on XXXX XXXX, 2020, but did not make refugee claims, as they planned to join his brother at the time who was already in Canada. I accept this explanation and draw no negative conclusion from it, as it relates to the claimant\u2019s subjective fear.\nIdentity\n[5] Your country of reference and identities as nationals of Pakistan has been established on a balance of probabilities by your testimony and a copy of passports found at Exhibit 1.\nCredibility\n[6] The principal claimant, XXXX, provided the majority of the testimony for the hearing as the person who was most directly impacted by the events. I found him to be a credible witness. I noted no omissions or inconsistencies between his oral testimony and the Basis of Claim form and amendment. He was spontaneous and detailed in the answers asked and internally consistent, even when we had one (1) date that was momentarily incorrect, he was quickly able to clarify that date to the satisfaction of myself.\n[7] The principal claimant testified to the origin of the problems with \u2014 starting with targeting of his family in 2016, as his brother, XXXX (ph), made an agreement with the Shias in the community to use his land. This led to the brother being targeted by the SSP and LHA, and during an altercation with these people on XXXX XXXX, 2016, his cousin was killed. The principal claimant testified that he himself began to be targeted starting on XXXX XXXX, 2020, when he was at a gathering, which included a religious leader from his hometown. This maulvi was attempting to solicit donations, and when the principal claimant questioned the work that they were doing in the community with this money, he said it was to train people as soldiers to bring back the real spirit of Islam to Pakistan and made negative statements against other religions. When the principal claimant pushed back against these statements and questioned who was behind the plans, this maulvi said that the notable people were two (2) other maulvis in the community, XXXX (ph) and XXXX (ph). And when he mentioned these names, the principal claimant remembered that these were the people who had been behind the issues with his brother and leading to the death of his cousin. And he mentioned this to the people at the gathering. The maulvi who was there said that then when he returned to Pakistan he would tell the community \u2014 religious community about this and that they would decide the principal claimant\u2019s fate.\n[8] On XXXX XXXX, 2021, a fatwa was issued against the principal claimant, which was seen in both his hometown and other cities, including Lahore by a family friend. As well, the religious members went to the police and made a false accusation of blasphemy, which will be \u2014 this led to a copy of an application being issued by the police, and to the police and members of the LHA and SSP both looking for the principal claimant at his family home as recently as XXXX of this year.\n[9] In support of his testimony, the claimants have provided Exhibits 5, copies of affidavits from the brother in Canada who himself has made a positive refugee claim and been accepted, including his RPD notice at the same exhibit, an affidavit from a brother still in Pakistan who explained what has occurred and why he himself has not been targeted while his brothers have been, a copy of the cousin\u2019s death certificate, a copy of the application to the police, and a copy of the fatwa. I give full weight to these documents as they support the events as alleged, and I have no reason to doubt their genuineness. I find that the claimant\u2019s subjective fear is established by the credible testimony, and I believe what they have alleged on a balance of probabilities.\n[10] I also find that there is an objective basis for what they fear in Pakistan. The National Documentation Package for Pakistan provides objective evidence in various places, but specifically 1.8, which talks about extremist Sunni groups, such as the LHA and SSP, which view Shias as heretics, infidels, and apostates who should be punished by death. Although the claimants themselves are Sunni Muslims, they are being targeted as they are seen to support Shias, which has also led to targeting by these groups. The LHA continue to operate across Pakistan, despite government and military operations attempting to disrupt their activities. Item 7.12 of the NDP says that the LHA has a reputation for being one (1) of the most violent Islamic extremist organizations in Pakistan, with links to Al-Qaeda and the Taliban. And since 2003, it has been on the list of terrorist organizations produced by the Canadian government.\n[11] Therefore, based on this documentary evidence, I find that the claimants all have an objectively well-founded fear of persecution due to their views as someone \u2013 views by the extremist groups as people who support Shias, and specifically for the associate and minor claimants, as family members of the principal claimant who has himself been accused of blasphemy and had a fatwa issued against him.\nState Protection\n[12] I find that state protection would not be available to any of the claimants should they seek it in Pakistan.\n[13] Information in the National Documentation Package at Items 1.13 and 10.4 confirm that the police force in Pakistan is inept due to operational deficiencies and external influences. Information at Item 1.8 establishes that these extremist organizations have ties to corrupt elements and law enforcement providing them with reach throughout Pakistan, which would likely enable them to locate the family.\n[14] Considering the objective country documentation, as well as their personal circumstances, I find that the claimants have all rebutted the presumption of state protection, and adequate state protection would not be available to them in Pakistan.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[15] I have also considered whether there was a viable internal flight alternative for them in Pakistan. Item 7.9 and 7.10 of the National Documentation Package discuss how the police and government in Pakistan work together with extremist organizations. And Item 9.12 show the police depend on fatwa\u2019s when applying blasphemy charges, which has likely occurred in this case. Additionally, the principal claimant has credibly testified to the fatwa that was issued being seen across Pakistan, indicating that he would be sought in other parts of the country.\n[16] Based on the testimony and the claimants\u2019 specific circumstances, I find that on a balance of probabilities all claimants\u2019 lives would be at risk throughout Pakistan, and they do not have a viable internal flight alternative.\nCONCLUSION\n[17] Based on the totality of the evidence, I find that all claimants have established a serious possibility of persecution on the nexus ground of religion, and for the associate and minor claimants, as membership in a particular social group as family members of the principal claimant. I find you all to be Convention refugees, and I accept your claims.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

however, on XXXX XXXX, 2021, soldiers came to your home and took you to a detention center where you were asked to insert the XXXX XXXX for badly tortured prisoner.\n[16] You explained to me that this prisoner had XXXX XXXX and you told the forces that he had required urgent hospital care; however, they refused and you were verbally and physically abused, told to do as they ordered and were threatened to not disclose this incident to anyone with the threat of cutting off your tongue.\n[17] This happened on two more occasions and the third time you tried to pretend you were not home when the forces came by but the officers found you hiding in your kitchen.\n[18] After you had done their bidding, the officers physically assaulted you and threatened to kill you as well if you did not comply with their orders.\n[19] After this incident, you fled to your friend\u2019s home and left the West Bank without returning back to your family\u2019s home.\n[20] You testified compellingly that as a XXXX your duty was to XXXX XXXX in need but you were being actively thwarted from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to these tortured patients or tortured prisoners and you fear that if you returned to West Bank you would end up as one of these tortured prisoners.\n[21] After you were able to leave for the US, the Palestinian Authority forces came to your home and to your wife in XXXX 2021 and threatened her specifically stating that if you ever returned you would be taken directly from the airport to the Jericho Detention Center which was also known as the \u201cslaughter house.\u201d\n[22] After this incident, you applied for an F-2 visa for your wife and children so they could join you in the US and three or four days after your wife and children arrived in the US you made your claims at the Canadian border.\n[23] Now, I note that you did not make a refugee claim in the US as you testified you feared anti-Muslim discrimination there and also because you were hoping that you would be able to return to Nablus once things dies down \u2014 died down; however, you realized that this would not be possible once the officers came to your house and threatened your wife and shortly after your wife joined you in the US and you made your refugee claims in Canada.\n[24] I draw no negative inference with respect to subjective fear from these delays as I find they are reasonable for the above reasons.\n[25] I note as well that your testimony as well as your wife\u2019s testimony was consistent at all times with the basis of claim forms and internally consistent as well.\n[26] Your personal documents which you provided in Exhibit 4 go to the core of your claims and include evidence of your employment at the XXXX XXXX XXXX, your XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, an article that confirmed that XXXX XXXX (ph) is the XXXX XXXX of the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Centre, and a witness letter and ID card from your friend with whom you stayed in hiding before fleeing the West Bank.\n[27] The information contained in these documents is consistent with your BOC, your testimony, and the other information you have provided to support your claim.\n[28] And having considered all of this evidence, I find that the information you presented in your testimony and documents is credible on a balance of probabilities.\n[29] I am satisfied of the facts of your case that the principal claimant faces persecution under section 96 in West Bank in the Occupied Palestinian Territories based on his political \u2014 imputed political opinion while your wife and children face persecution as members of a particular social group that is family members of a political target.\n[30] The NDP for the Occupied Palestinian Territories confirms the Palestinian Authority\u2019s heavy handedness against real and perceived political opponents.\n[31] Item 2.1 which is the US DOS report confirms that the PA arrested opposition supporters and other critics and tortured them in their custody.\n[32] The same report notes that with respect to the Palestinian Authorities, there are credible reports of unlawful or arbitrary killings; torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment by Palestinian Authority officials; arbitrary arrest or detention; political prisoners and detainees; and serious government corruption.\n[33] Human Rights Watch reported systematic and routine abuse in Palestinian Authority prisons, particularly in the Palestinian Authority\u2019s Intelligence, Preventive Security, and Joint Security Committee detention facilities in Jericho.\nHuman Rights Watch reported practices that included forces \u2014 forcing detainees to hold painful stress positions for long periods, beating, punching, and flogging.\n[34] There is also evidence that the authorities in the West Bank repress dissent by arbitrarily arresting tens of thousands of peaceful \u2014 tens of hundreds of peaceful demonstrators, opponents, critics, journalists, and human rights activists and that security forces in the West Bank used excessive force during law enforcement activities. This can be found at item 2.2.\n[35] Freedom House at item 2.3 reports that in 2018, evidence emerged that the Palestinian Authority has engaged in extensive electronic surveillance of lawyers, activists, political figures, and others deemed to oppose the government and that opponents are beaten and tortured in custody.\n[36] Amnesty International at 2.2 also reports that in the West Bank authorities made widespread use of administrative detention without any charges or trial.\n[37] Based on all the above evidence, I find that on a balance of probabilities you have established the objective basis of your claims and I further find that your family members face the same risks due to their association with you.\n[38] As the Palestinian Authority are the agents of persecution, I find that there will be no State protection for you in the Occupied Palestinian Territories.\n[39] Item 2.1 of the NDP indicates that there is severe restrictions on the freedom of movement internally and externally for Palestinians.\n[40] Palestinians remain restricted based on complex system of physical and administrative barriers such as checkpoints, road blocks, and a permit system.\n[41] Item 14.5 of the NDP also indicates that mobility for Palestinians is extremely difficult and restricted and the freedom of movement between the West Bank and Gaza is nearly nonexistent.\n[42] Based on this, I find that there is no viable IFA for you and your family in the Occupied Palestinian Territories.\n[43] I have considered your testimony and evidence and for all of these reasons, I find that you are all refugees under section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act and I accept your claims.\n[44] Okay, whenever you\u2019re ready, Mr. Interpreter.\n[45] CLAIMANT: Thank you very much.\n[46] MEMBER: I want to thank both of you for sharing your stories with me today and I wish you the best of luck.\n[47] Thank you, Mr. Interpreter, for your excellent interpretation as always.\n[48] INTERPRETER: My pleasure, Madam Member.\n[49] MEMBER: And thank you, counsel, as well for all your assistance.\n[50] COUNSEL: It was my pleasure to work with you today. Thank you.\n[51] MEMBER: Likewise, counsel, thank you. Have a good afternoon everyone. Bye-bye.\n[52] COUNSEL: Thank you, bye-bye.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

I have considered the testimony and other evidence presented. Mr. XXXX you allege persecution based on a previous relationship you had in India that defied familial and social norms in your and your girlfriend\u2019s community.\nDETERMINATION:\n[2] I have determined that you are a Convention refugee for the following reasons.\nALLEGATIONS:\n[3] You are a citizen of India. You allege if you return to India, you will be harmed by your ex-girlfriend\u2019s family and those individuals with whom her family is connected including the police in your home state of Punjab. All of this is on account of your previous relationship with this girl, now woman, named XXXX who her family disapproved of being in a relationship with you.\n[4] You allege there is no state protection or internal flight alternative available to you.\nIDENTITY:\n[5] Your identity is confirmed by your Indian passport.\nNEXUS:\n[6] There is a Nexus between this claim and the Convention ground of particular social group for couples who defy deeply ingrained social norms. Therefore Mr. XXXX I have assessed your claim under section 96.\nCREDIBILITY:\n[7] Mr. XXXX, I found you to be a credible witness. I want you to know that at the outset that you appeared alone today unrepresented by Counsel. This was not your first choice and you had expressed your hopes at having today\u2019s hearing postponed, a decision that was denied just before today\u2019s hearing.\n[7] Nevertheless, you attended and you spoke sincerely that you were forthright. You never embellished and you did not try to speculate. You were able to recall events that happened over a decade over and it is clear from the testimony and a point I made during the hearing that these experiences are still with you today and the impacts are clearly felt.\n[8] Mr. XXXX you established that you were in a relationship in high school with someone named XXXX. You testified how you were friends first, what you liked about her, that she used to sit on the bus together. You also established that her family disapproved of this relationship, a fact that you didn\u2019t realise at first until they discovered that you and she were together.\n[9] You described what they did to you as a result of this, how they abused you. How they used their connections with the police to have you abused further and you described what it was like to be in that situation. How you wanted to understand and what was driving this behaviour but were too concerned with trying to protect yourself in those moments.\n[10] You described the fear that you had of them, especially knowing their connections in the community which you also described. You testified how your cousin was the type of person that people were afraid to talk to or hold accountable. That he would walk around with a gun over his shoulders instead of keeping it safely at home the way one should normally do that.\n[11] You established that when you were initially targeted by your family in 2007, XXXX was kept away from you for years but you would still out of love and affection try and find out what was happening with her. You would try and sneak glances of her if you knew she would be somewhere and that 4 years later in 2011 you managed to have one secret encounter with her.\n[12] That was discovered by your family and this reignited their animosity towards you. Something that lasted for over a year until 2012 when they attacked you again signifying that they are animus and their desire to harm you has gone on for 5 years and showed no signs of ending.\n[13] In 2012, your father decided that the danger to you was too great and you said that something you only realise now that how right he was to appreciate the situation you were in and he sent you abroad. You were sent to Canada at the XXXX of XXXX 2012. Your legal status here expired in XXXX of 2014. You brought a refugee claim and you signed your Basis of Claim in 2020.\n[14] Then we spoke about the intervening years between 2014 and 2020 and to try and understand the delay and you explained your situation very eloquently. You were scared. You were alone. At first you didn\u2019t even realise that you were illegal until 2015 or 2016 when you tried to get a job and realised you didn\u2019t have a SIN card and your employer helped you discover that you had no status.\n[15] This made you increasingly fearful and mistrustful of people because you said you were alone without family and you didn\u2019t know who could be trusted and you discovered that you had been taken advantage of many times. Promised jobs, promised payments, things never came through.\n[16] Despite all of this I want to note on record you had developed an appreciation or admiration towards police here in Canada and expressed an interest in becoming a police officer. You went so far as to begin the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. You worked. Saved money and paid what you could to enroll in those courses only to then discover that you could not take them because you were not a Canadian citizen and then the money you paid was not returned to you.\n[17] Later due to some good fortune talking to friends about how scared you were to return to India you were advised that maybe you should come clean and tell Canadian authorities that you were scared and that perhaps you could be protected and this is what happened and you brought your refugee claim and so I find that your delay is reasonable and explained in your circumstances.\n[18] So as a result, Mr. XXXX I find that you are credible. That you established your relationship. That you established you were targeted because of your relationship both by XXXX\u2019s family and the police and that this targeting went on for a long period of time. Your subjective fear has been established.\nPERSECUTION:\n[19] Objective country evidence supports your claim. Couples in India in either love marriages or relationships that defy honour are at risk. India is a traditional society and couples whose relationships contravenes family wishes or perceived family honour can jeopardise their safety. Communities in India and traditional family strictly adhere to notion who can and cannot be in a relationship.\n[20] The law commission refers to the type of violence that comes from this as honour killings or honour crimes. A report by the immigration refugee Board notes that honour killings are under reported in India and Punjab is a state where they are especially \u2013 where they are especially a problem. Perpetrators of these crimes are most frequently family members of those involved in the relationships.\n[21] The report continues and notes that police hold attitudes that are similar to those of the broader society and that this leads to them colluding with the dominant group or the group that is targeting the individuals for having violated honour. Punjab is a state with a known problem of honour-based violence.\n[22] This supports your allegations concerning the harm you experienced and harm you would experience should you return. The objective evidence also notes that Indian police that can track and locate citizens throughout the country. Here the evidence is mixed on how Indian officials can track or locate citizens throughout the country but the evidence indicates on a balance of probabilities Indian authorities can locate individuals in certain circumstances.\n[23] This is through a combination of tracking methods, either through tenant verification or the Crime and Criminal Tracking Network System, CCTNS which is a national digital system aimed to establish connectivity across 15,000 police station throughout India. 97% of police station can connect to CCTNS and software is deployed at 95% of stations.\n[24] Tennent verification is a system for landlords to submit perspective tenants for police verification including from their home and state district. The objective evidence indicates a system is in place but verification is not adhered to widely or strictly across India. Communication between state and police offices is poor.\n[25] Reading of the objective evidence on the ability to track individuals in India is mixed. The means exists but are imperfectly used. What matters therefore is the desire on the part of state agents to use the tools at their disposal. This is something I will address shortly.\n[26] Also, important here is the corruption within India police. This indicates on a balance of probabilities police could be persuaded to use means to locate individuals in India if given the right incentive or pressures. A point that further supports your allegations given your testimony that you personally witnessed XXXX\u2019s family exchanging money with the police when you were being abused.\n[27] Therefore, on a balance of probabilities Mr. XXXX I find your fear of persecution in India is well-founded given the prevalence of honour violence, police corruption and the ability of state agents to locate individuals across India. These findings rely on NDP items 1.5, 5.10, 10.10, 10.13 and 12.5.\nSTATE PROTECTION:\n[28] Mr. XXXX, I find that state protection would not be available to you. The evidence above notes that state agents have been involved in your abuse and targeting and they are connected to XXXX\u2019s family and influenced and corrupted by them.\n[29] As well the evidence above indicates that police often hold the same views as XXXX\u2019s family that led to you and her being targeted in the first place. This indicates that you would not necessarily find the safety you needed if you had to run from XXXX\u2019s family to police.\n[30] Therefore, the presumption of state protection is rebutted on a balance of probabilities.\nINTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE:\n[31] There is no viable internal flight alternative available to you in India. The objective evidence discussed above discloses the agent of persecution have the means to locate you throughout India on a balance of probabilities. The question is whether they also have the motivation.\n[32] On a balance of probabilities, the answer is yes. This is because the motivation to locate you is driven by family animosity and questions of honour. Mr. XXXX you are not just one person who is fleeing a local village police because they have taken an interest in you in one reason or another, something that with the passage of time, as it\u2019s been 10 years in your case is something that could likely recede and the police could be distracted.\n[33] But this is different. You are someone who according to XXXX\u2019s family, an influential family, created a lasting blemish on their honour. They are animus against you lasted 5 years in India. There is no evidence to indicate it has subsided or evaded over time. This is further informed by your testimony describing what types of people are after you, the types of views they hold and their attitudes about themselves and their attitudes about others.\n[34] XXXX\u2019s family believes you have robbed them and their daughter of their honour. The evidence indicates on a balance of probabilities her family will continue its quest and use the means at its disposal including family connections to target you if you returned to India.\n[35] Therefore, I find there is no viable IFA available to you in India on a balance of probabilities.\nCONCLUSION:\n[36] For the aforementioned reasons and based on the totality of the evidence Mr. XXXX I find you to be a Convention refugee. You have a well-founded fear of persecution in India based on your membership in a particular social group. Your claim is accepted.\n[37] In closing, Mr. XXXX you have been very honest in talking about the sacrifice that you, XXXX and your whole family has had to endure on account of what happened. You testified movingly to your regents. You also testified about everything this experience has taught you and your personal growth and that over the past couple of years due to the lessons you learned and due to your own capacities, which you might now have know you have been able to start rebuilding. I have met, many, many fine and able and courage\u2019s people through this job.\n[38] Your testimony today will stay with me as someone who has overcome a very challenging situation and proven himself to be better and so I just want to encourage you to continue building what you are building and to contributing as you have been contributing to helping people when you can, as you say you were not helped and I hope that just in the same way that you have said you have learned a lot living here.\n[39] You learned a lot from Canada I hope that over your many years here in the future people can learn a lot from you. That brings the decision to a close.\n[40] Mr. XXXX that is the end of your hearing.\n[41] CLAIMANT: Okay.\n[42] MEMBER: I think I said everything I needed to say. I want to wish you the very best going forward. You will get a copy of that in the mail and all the normally a lawyer would explain what happens next. I actually can\u2019t tell you exactly what the next steps are. It will all be laid out for you in the mail.\n[43] CLAIMANT: Okay.\n[44] MEMBER: But rest assured that everything is now official and now it\u2019s just a matter of the paperwork and bureaucracy handling itself. If for whatever reason you don\u2019t get something in the mail, it might take some time. It might take up to a month.\n[45] CLAIMANT: Okay.\n[46] MEMBER: Please make sure to contact the Refugee Board. Do you have a phone number for it?\n[47] CLAIMANT: No.\n[48] MEMBER: Okay so you can go on the internet to the Refugee Board website. Just make sure that you have a record, you will have your name and your file number and they will be able to look you up but if in a month you haven\u2019t heard anything just, please make sure, don\u2019t leave this to chance. You have now you have to be in control of it. So \u2013\n[49] CLAIMANT: Okay.\n[50] MEMBER: It should be coming but if not get in touch with them.\n[51] CLAIMANT: Okay.\n[52] MEMBER: Okay. Dr. Khan thank you for being here. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.\n[53] INTERPRETER: XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX\n[54] MEMBER: Okay.\n[55] INTERPRETER: But it\u2019s the weather nowadays.\n[56] MEMBER: Yes.\n[57] INTERPRETER: XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.\n[58] MEMBER: Yeah. Okay. Mr. XXXX thank you again very much for speaking so honestly and sharing.\n[59] CLAIMANT: Thank you to you sir.\n[60] MEMBER: You\u2019re welcome.

Khan\nCountry: India\nRPD Number: VB9-02908\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2022-01960\nATIP Pages: N\/A\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: So, this is the decision at the Refugee Protection Division, or the RPD, in the claim of XXXX XXXX as a citizen of India, who is claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act or the IRPA. In evaluating this claim and coming to my decision, I have considered and applied the chairperson\u2019s guideline nine (9), proceedings before the IRB involving sexual orientation, gender identity and expression and sex characteristics or SOGIESC. I ensured that my questioning was conducted in a sensitive, non-confrontational manner offering breaks to the claimant and explaining that he could request a break at any time. I have considered the potential impact of trauma on the claimant\u2019s testimony and have considered his particular intersectionality in my analysis of his claim. In application of the SOGIESC guidelines at the outset of the hearing, the claimant was asked to advise the Member on what terms he was comfortable using in reference to his sexual orientation and he identified himself as a gay man. Therefore, this term was used throughout the hearing. And this decision, unless otherwise stated by the claimant, are within supporting documents or when referring in general to the LGBTQI+ community.\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] The full allegations are set out by the claimant in his Basis of Claim form or his BOC. As amended, see Exhibits 2 and 10. In summary, the claimant fears persecution from his relatives, the police and society writ large in India on the basis of his sexuality as a gay man.\nDETERMINATION\n[3] I find that the claimant has established that he is a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[4] The claimant\u2019s personal identity and his identity as a national of India has been established by his foreign testimony and a certified copy of his Indian passport in Evidence C, Exhibit 1. I accept that he is a national of India and no other country.\nCredibility\n[5] In line with the federal court\u2019s decision in Maldonado, claimant\u2019s sworn testimony creates a presumption that the individual\u2019s allegations are true unless there is reason to doubt their truthfulness. In this case, the claimant\u2019s BOC form was missing significant and substantial information that he only provided in an updated narrative the day before his hearing. Additionally, there is a substantial delay between the claimant\u2019s arrival in Canada and his submission of his refugee claim. However, I found that the claimant has provided reasonable explanations for these concerns. I also found that the claimant\u2019s testimony regarding his experiences was detailed, spontaneous and compelling. And I found no other contradictions or inconsistencies in his testimony and the documents before me. I find that the claimant has credibly established on a balance of probabilities that he is a gay man. The claimant testified about his experience of realizing he was different growing up and explained that he struggled with a feeling of unrest because his sexuality went against his religion, Hinduism, and against his family\u2019s beliefs. He stated that that he was fighting with himself and with his identity and that he tried unsuccessfully to convince himself that he could be with woman. The claimant notes in his narrative that his first same-sex experience was being sexually assaulted and raped when he was around 13 or 14 years old. He testified however that his first same-sex relations, that were consensual, were with a school friend, XXXX (XXXX), when he was almost 17 years old. The claimant explained that they tried to keep their relations secret to protect themselves. However, the claimant\u2019s father began to suspect that he was gay, as he was not dating other woman, as his brother did. The claimant\u2019s father sent him to XXXX for schooling after he graduated, where he stayed with a friend of his father. The claimant explained that he hooked up with men in cars and in the park during this time, but he can not bring anyone back to his father\u2019s friend house. The claimant returned to his family home in Jalandhar in 2016 and testified that this home was like a prison for him. As he was kept under close watch and under the control of his father due to his father\u2019s suspicion of his sexuality.\n[6] The claimant began a relationship with XXXX (XXXX), a school friend. They started their relationship online but would meet up whenever the claimant could make an excuse to leave the house. The claimant explained that XXXX was Hindu, handsome, strong, smart, happy and with a jovial character. The claimant and XXXX were caught in an intimate situation in a car park following a religious ceremony at the end of XXXX 2017. They were beaten and the claimant escaped to a police station. He was mocked and beaten by the police who told his father what had happened. They escorted the claimant home, and his father was waiting with a priest. This priest prayed while the claimant\u2019s father beat him with a stick. The claimant\u2019s brother looked through his computer and found compromising information. The entire community knew what had happened in the car park. The claimant was locked in his room and his father arranged for him to be married to a woman within two (2) weeks. The claimant\u2019s mother arranged for him to flee to Kolkata, and she obtained a student visa for him to come to Canada. The claimant came to Canada in XXXX of 2017. The claimant was studying in Canada, but his relatives continued to call and threaten him. They noted that he dishonored their family, that he broke them and that they wished he would die. The last time he had a threatening call from his family was two (2) days ago. The claimant was struggling with his mental health and was also financially struggling to pay for his courses while studying, so he stopped his studies in XXXX of 2018.\n[7] The claimant testified that he dated four men while in Canada and that he has financially contributed to XXXX XXXX, an LGBTQI+ organization. It was a volunteer for this organization that advised him that he could submit a refugee claim. The claimant submitted a refugee claim in April of 2019. He explained that previously he had not known this was an option. I find his explanation reasonable, and I make no negative finding regarding subjective fear.\n[8] The claimant\u2019s BOC form is bare and contains few details. He submitted a very detailed amended narrative and three (3) supporting letters from friends, the day before his hearing, the 31st of May 2022. The claimant explained that he had struggled emotionally to recount the events as occurred as they were very traumatizing. And that took him these years to be able to relay a coherent narrative of events. His Counsel arranged for the claimant\u2019s friends to be present to support him while he wrote his narrative. Prior to this, the claimant had been asked by the RPD to submit documents which he indicated he would be able to submit in April of 2021 and never did. The claimant explained that during this time he was struggling with the Covid-19 pandemic and that his Counsel was facing licensing difficulties that meant he could not represent the Claimant for a period of time. This is documented on file. The claimant noted that he forgot to submit these documents in light of other issues he was struggling with at that time.\n[9] From a trauma informed perspective, I note that the claimant has been subjected to significant and brutal violence and harassment from a very young age. This harassment continues to this day. I understand that preparing a narrative of this violence would be retraumatizing and difficult and I accept that the claimant has faced numerous difficulties, not just with this trauma but also with the pandemic and his Counsel. I accept the claimant\u2019s explanations as reasonable, and I make no negative credibility finding.\n[10] The claimant has submitted three (3) affidavits from two (2) friends and an ex-boyfriend here in Canada, see Exhibit 10. These friends note that they know the claimant is gay, that they have met his boyfriends and that they have been present when he has received threatening calls from his family members. One (1) friend notes that he knew the claimant from childhood in India and that his family members came looking for the claimant at this friend\u2019s house in India when he had fled to Kolkata. This friend additionally notes on a recent trip to India, the claimant\u2019s mother said to him that his relatives are still searching for the claimant to harm him. I accord these documents full weight. I find the claimant to be credible and I accept his allegations. I find that he has established on a balance of probabilities that he is gay and that his relatives wish to harm him on this basis.\nNexus\n[11] I find that there is a nexus between the claimant\u2019s allegations and the Convention ground of membership of a particular social group, being a gay man.\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution\n[12] Based on the claimant\u2019s testimony and the available documentary evidence, I find that he has established that he has a well-founded fear of persecution in India given his sexual orientation. I note that in 2018 the Supreme Court of India rendered a judgement decriminalizing same-sex sexual relationships, see Tab 6.2 and 6.5 of the National Documentation Package, or the NDP. The court also offered a judicial apology to the Indian LGBTQI community. This was an important decision, a landmark decision, which marked the first step in the journey towards full equality of LGBTQI persons in India. However, the question is whether this ruling has been effectively implemented and whether as a gay man, the claimant could live safely in India and openly expressing his sexual identity. I find that the ruling has yet to result in adequate operational efficiency. There have been some positive changes since the Supreme Court of India\u2019s ruling. The report at Tab 6.1 of the NDP says that after the decriminalization of same-sex sexual relations, there has been a surge of pro LGBTQI events and campaigns across the country. Many major cities now see pride events taking place on a larger scale of a larger participation. The report mentions that there were some 15 000 people who participated in a queer azadi pride parade in Mumbai, Kolkata, Delhi and Bangalore. They have all had pride events and even smaller towns, such as Shelan, have held pride events. Despite these gains, the response to information request, or the RIR, on the treatment of LGBTQI persons, found at Tab 6.1 of the NDP indicates that social rejection of LGBTQI sexuality remains widespread. LGBTQI groups report that they face widespread and societal discrimination and violence, particularly in rural areas, and that they face physical attaps, sorry, physical attacks, rape and blackmail. The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, or DIFAT, report at Tab 1.5 of the NDP states that LGBTQI persons lack protection. They have poor health and education outcomes, and they face intolerance, abuse and violence on a day-to-day basis. This report refers to discrimination in employment, housing and inability to access public spaces. The report also mentions that police still use nuisance laws to arrest gay man and that while there are some gay nights in a few bars, there are no true safe spaces for gay or bisexual men. The report of the International Commission of Jurists found at Tab 6.6 of the NDP, identifies obstacles and issues that prevent effective implementation of the Supreme Court ruling. And this report also notes that LGBTQI persons frequently encountered threats to personal safety and security from family members, landlords and neighbours. The report states that notably recurrent were complaints about violations to the right to housing and to work. And the same report refers to difficulty in accessing equal and effective access to public spaces and facilities. The UK home office echoes these sentiments at Tab 6.4 stating that gay and bisexual men continue to suffer ill treatment and discrimination in many aspects of their lives.\n[13] I note that the claimant\u2019s family have attacked him and continue to threaten his life to this day as they claim that he has dishonoured them. The claimant has been beaten by his family, he has been held against his will in his family home and his father attempted to him to, sorry, attempted to force him to marry a woman. Viewing this evidence cumulatively, I find that the claimant faces a serious possibility of persecution in India, both from his family and society writ large. If he were to attempt to live openly as a gay man in India, even apart from his family, he would face chronic harassment, violence and discrimination in many facets of his life, including in the demands of housing, access to public services and employment. And the cumulative impact of this harassment, violence and discrimination amounts to persecution. I find that the claimant\u2019s fear of persecution is well-founded.\nState Protection\n[14] There is a presumption that countries can protect their citizens. The claimant bears the burden of rebutting that presumption with clear and convincing evidence. In the claimant\u2019s case, however, there is clear and convincing objective evidence that demonstrates that the state is unwilling or unable to provide adequate protection to LGBTQI people. The objective evidence suggests that the attitude and behaviour of authorities presents a barrier for protection of sexual minorities. Many LGBTQI people have reported suffering violence, abuse and harassment at the hands of the police, judges and public prosecutors. See Tab 1.5 of the NDP. Police have used the threat of arrest to coerce LGBTQI victims into not reporting incidence of harassment and crime. See Tab 2.1 of the NDP. Furthermore, LGBTQI individuals themselves are reluctant to file complaints due to the prejudice, preconceptions and stereotypes held by authorities, See Tab 6.3 of the NDP.\n[15] The claimant himself has approached the police for assistance and was beaten and mocked. The police disclosed his sexuality to his family putting him at further risk of harm instead of protecting him. Given the claimant\u2019s experience of a failed request of protection from the state, alongside the prevailing attitude of authorities to LGBTQI individuals and the evidence of limited police effectiveness and even complicity with regards to LGBTQI related crimes, I find that it would be objectively unreasonable for the claimant to seek the protection of the state. I find that the presumption of state protection has been rebutted.\nInternal Flight Alternative or IFA\n[16] I have also considered whether a viable IFA exists for the claimant and find that it does not. Anti-LGBTQI attitudes are deeply entrenched across the country. Discrimination against sexual minorities does appear to be less severe in major cities. Nonetheless, social contempt for gay man and other members of the LGBTQI community is prevalent throughout India. And I therefore find if the claimant attempted to live openly as a gay man, as is his right, he would face severe problems in finding housing and employment and he would be at a high risk of harassment and violence. Anti-discrimination laws are (inaudible) in the formal sector. But even there, the penalties are not sufficient to deter violations. Moreover, 90 percent of people work in the informal sector in India, and the anti-discrimination laws do not apply to that sector. So, I therefore find that the claimant does not have a viable internal flight alternative to him on two (2) counts. One (1), he would face persecution throughout the country. And two (2), it would not be reasonable to expect him to relocate given the difficulties that he would face in finding work or housing.\nCONCLUSION\n[17] For the foregoing reasons I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA and as such, I accept his claim, and this concludes my reasons.\n[18] So that will be transcribed and sent to you. But otherwise, we are finished for today, and I want to say thank you to Counsel and to the claimant for your time today. And I wish you all the best with your life in Canada.\n[19] COUNSEL: Madam thank you very much indeed.\n[20] CLAIMANT: Thank you very much.\n[21] MEMBER: Thank you. Enjoy the rest of your day.\n[22] COUNSEL: Thank you. Bye-bye\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

        "unofficial_text":"2022 RLLR 35\n\nCitation: 2022 RLLR 35\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: April 28, 2022\nPanel: Sandeep Chauhan\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Marianne Lithwick\nCountry: Nigeria\nRPD Number: VC1-04970\nAssociated RPD Number(s): VC1-04971\nATIP Number: A-2022-01960\nATIP Pages: N\/A\nREASONS FOR DECISION\nINTRODUCTION\n[1] These are the reasons for the decision in the claims of XXXX XXXX (the \u201cprincipal claimant\u201d), and her daughter XXXX XXXX (the \u201cminor claimant\u201d), who are citizens of Nigeria, and are claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).[i]\n[2] XXXX XXXX was appointed as the designated representative of her minor child XXXX XXXX. In rendering my reasons, I have considered and applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guidelines on Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution.\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] The following is a brief synopsis of the allegations put forth by the principal claimant in her Basis of Claim (BOC) form.[ii] She fears persecution at the hands of women from her in-laws\u2019 village in Nigeria who want to subject the minor claimant to female genital mutilation (FGM).\n[4] The claimant is a 33-year-old female from Benin City who met her husband, XXXX, in 2014. They got married on XXXX XXXX, 2016. The minor claimant was born on XXXX XXXX, 2016 in Benin City. A week after the minor claimant\u2019s birth, women from XXXX\u2019s village came to see the minor claimant and informed the principal claimant that as per the clan\u2019s tradition, the minor claimant will have to undergo FGM before she turns 5 years old. The principal claimant informed the women that she will not subject her child to the procedure. Over the following years, the women continued to call the principal claimant to tell her that the minor claimant will have to undergo FGM.\n[5] The claimants moved to Lagos in XXXX 2017 due to XXXX\u2019s employment opportunity in that city. The principal claimant gave up her catering business in Benin City and opened up a salon. The claimants travelled to the United Kingdom (UK) in XXXX 2020 when they found out that the principal claimant was pregnant with another baby girl. The principal claimant and the minor claimant travelled to Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2020 after hearing a person in a mall in the UK talk about the refugee protection system in Canada. The claimants filed for refugee protection and fear returning to Nigeria due to the threat of FGM for the minor claimant.\nDETERMINATION\n[6] I find that the claimants have satisfied the burden of establishing more than a mere possibility of persecution on a Convention ground for the following reasons.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[7] I find that the claimants\u2019 identities as nationals of Nigeria are established, on a balance of probabilities, based on certified copies of their Nigerian passports on file.[iii]\nNexus\n[8] For a claimant to be considered a Convention refugee, the well-founded fear of persecution must be by reason of one or more of the five grounds: race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion.\n[9] In this case, the evidence before me is that the principal claimant fears persecution in Nigeria due to her refusal to subject her daughters to FGM. I find that she has established nexus to a Convention ground \u2013 membership in a particular social group: namely a female fearing gender-based persecution. The evidence before me also is that the minor female claimant faces persecution in Nigeria due to the threat of forcibly subjecting her to FGM. I find that she has established nexus to a Convention ground \u2013 membership in a particular social group: namely a female child fearing gender-based persecution.\n[4] Accordingly, I have assessed their claims under section 96 of IRPA and not under section 97.\nCredibility\n[10] When a claimant swears to the truth of certain allegations, this creates a presumption that those allegations are true unless there be reason to doubt their truthfulness. (Maldonado [1980] 2.F.C. 302 (C.A.)) In this case the principal claimant did not offer a reasonable explanation as to why she did not claim refugee protection in the UK. She was not forthcoming about her marital status initially during the hearing. Initially, the principal claimant stated that she has not spoken with XXXX for quite some time. Then upon being questioned further on the issue, she stated that she spoke with her husband last week. In spite of these credibility concerns, I accept, on a balance of probabilities that the principal claimant left Nigeria along with the minor claimant and XXXX as she feared forcible FGM on her daughter, that she is now separated from her husband, that her in-laws also support female circumcision, and that she and her daughter have subjective fears of returning to their country. The principal claimant has also provided corroborating documentary evidence[iv] to support her and her daughter\u2019s claims. I have no reason to doubt the genuineness of these documents and accept them as genuine.\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution and Risk of Harm\n[11] To establish their status as Convention refugees, the principal claimant and the minor female claimant had to show that there was more than a mere possibility that they would be persecuted if removed to Nigeria. I find that the evidence presented in support of their allegations does establish more than a mere possibility of persecution for them. My reasons are as follows.\n[12] The principal claimant was told by her mother-in-law and the community elders, that she has to abide by the family and community directive of honoring the age-old tradition of subjecting the minor claimant to FGM. This fear increased for the principal claimant when she found out that she was pregnant with another girl, at which time she escaped to the UK. She now fears going back to Nigeria with her daughter, especially since she is separated from her husband, and she is a single mother. I find that the claimants\u2019 subjective fears are supported by objective evidence.\n[13] The country condition documents for Nigeria corroborate the facts alleged by the associate claimant and the objective basis for her and her daughter\u2019s claims. FGM is widespread in Nigeria and the procedure has been performed on 20 million women and girls in the country.[v]\n[14] Although Nigeria has passed legislation to criminalize the FGM as well as the procurement, arrangement, and\/or assistance of acts of FGM, the prevalence of this social evil remains concerning and there are no reported instances of any prosecutions brought under federal legislation since its introduction in 2015 in Nigeria.[vi]\n[15] The United Kingdom Home Office report notes that:\nThe 2019 UNICEF country profile report also noted that in Nigeria the prevalence of FGM varied significantly by state, and that almost eight out of ten adolescent girls who experienced the practice were cut before the age of five. Over half of girls and women and boys and men think FGM should stop and there is evidence of significant generational change in the prevalence of FGM in Nigeria as women aged 45-49 are more than twice as likely to have been cut than girls aged 15-19.[vii]\n[16] The objective evidence discussed above establishes that FGM is prevalent in Nigeria, in spite of the legislation banning this practice. There appears to be lack of political will to implement the law as there have been no reported instances of prosecutions brought under federal legislation in Nigeria since 2015, when the legislation took effect. Therefore, based on all the evidence before me, I find that the principal claimant and the minor female claimant will face more than a mere possibility of persecution if forced to return to Nigeria, especially since XXXX\u2019s family members are still adamant on having the minor claimant circumcised and are motivated to force the minor female claimant into undergoing female circumcision. I find that their fears are indeed well-founded.\nState Protection\n[17] I find that adequate state protection would not be reasonably forthcoming in this particular case.\n[18] States are presumed to be capable of protecting their citizens, except in situations where the country is in a state of complete breakdown. The responsibility to provide international (or surrogate) protection only becomes engaged when national or state protection is unavailable to the claimant. To rebut the presumption of state protection, a claimant must provide \u201cclear and convincing\u201d evidence of the state\u2019s inability to protect its citizens. A claimant is required to approach the state for protection if protection might reasonably be forthcoming. However, a claimant is not required to risk their life seeking ineffective protection of a state, merely to demonstrate that ineffectiveness (Ward [1993] 2 S.C.R. 689).\n[19] The principal claimant testified that she will not be able to seek police protection in Nigeria because the issue of FGM is considered private, in which the police do not intervene. She testified that\u2019s she tried to seek their help on three different occasions and was told that this is a private family tradition matter, in which they will not intervene.\n[20] Objective evidence states that authorities often do not take complaints about FGM seriously. There are no reported instances of any prosecutions brought under federal anti-FGM legislation since its introduction in 2015. A recent study conducted by UNFPA and UNICEF does not list any arrests, cases, or convictions for FGM in Nigeria.[viii]\n[21] Objective evidence also states that there are reports which indicate that it remains extremely difficult for women and girls to obtain protection from FGM due to community support for these practices, the attitude of police, and treatment by the police of FGM as a community or family matter.[ix]\n[22] Finally, I quote the United Kingdom Home Office report, which indicates that the police may be discriminatory in their treatment of victims of ritual practices, including FGM, and that women often do not report such practices to the police due to a lack of trust. Police themselves can be part of the culture and thus fail to treat such practices as criminal.[x]\n[23] The objective evidence discussed above establishes that FGM is considered a private matter in Nigeria. It is a prevalent practice in the country, thereby influencing the response of the police as not taking such acts seriously and thereby failing to provide protection to victims or potential victims of FGM and gender-based violence. Therefore, based on the objective evidence discussed above, I find that the claimants will not be able to access adequate state protection in Nigeria and that the presumption of state protection has been rebutted in this case.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[24] The final issue is whether the claimants have a viable internal flight alternative (IFA) in Nigeria. In order to determine whether an IFA exists, I must assess whether there is any location in Nigeria in which they would not face a serious possibility of persecution and whether it would be reasonable to expect them to move there.[xi] I proposed Lagos and Abuja as potential IFA locations during the hearing. The principal claimant argued that being a single mother, it will be nearly impossible for her to relocate to either of these two cities or anywhere in Nigeria as no one is willing to rent premises to the single mothers. She stated that she may be able to find employment due to her work experience but there are several other factors that will render it unreasonable for her and her daughters to go back to Nigeria. The principal claimant stated that earlier her marriage was intact, and she had the support of her husband. Now, she feels alone and will have to fend for herself and her daughters on her own. I agree with the principal claimant\u2019s arguments.\n[25] On the issue of the ability of single women, who head their own households, to relocate within Nigeria, objective evidence states that:\nIn a report published in 2019, the UK Home Office indicates that relocation may present greater challenges for single women who do not have access to a support network (UK Mar. 2019, para. 2.2.5). In correspondence with the Research Directorate, a doctoral candidate and research fellow [1] at Murdoch University, Australia, stated that without support, surviving in \u201cany place\u201d of Nigeria, including in the cities of Lagos, Ibadan, Port Harcourt and Abuja, is very difficult for women heads of households (Doctoral Candidate 4 Nov. 2019). The same source explained that it would be very difficult for such women [widows, divorced or separated women, abandoned women, married women with a non-resident (polygynous or migrant) husband, single women or single mothers] to settle down successfully if they relocate to any place in Nigeria because of the risks and vulnerabilities that they may be exposed to, [such as] stigmatisation\/labelling, insecurity, economic hardship, family problems and trauma, among others. (Doctoral Candidate 4 Nov. 2019) The EASO states that \u201csingle able-bodied women\u201d who attempt to relocate \u201cmay encounter additional difficulties in relation to education, work, housing, etc.\u201d (EU Feb. 2019, 31).[xii]\n[26] Single women need male support to access housing in Nigeria and encounter discrimination in securing employment opportunities. \u2018According to the doctoral candidate, accessing employment or vocational training in Abuja, Lagos, Ibadan or Port Harcourt is \u201cvery difficult\u201d for women heads of households (Doctoral Candidate 4 Nov. 2019).\u2019[xiii]\n[27] Objective evidence discussed above corroborates the principal claimant\u2019s argument that it will be unreasonable in all circumstances, including those particular to her and the minor claimant, for them to seek refuge anywhere in Nigeria, including the proposed IFAs of Lagos and Abuja. Therefore, I am satisfied that there is no viable IFA for the claimants in Nigeria.\nCONCLUSION\n[28] Based on the analysis above, I find that the claimants are Convention refugee under section 96 of IRPA. Accordingly, I accept each of their claims.\n(signed) Sandeep Chauhan\nApril 28, 2022\n\n[i] Immigration and Refugee Protection Act,S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n\n[ii] Exhibit 2.\n\n[iii] Exhibit 1.\n\n[iv] Exhibit 4, 5.\n\n[v] Exhibit 3, National Documentation Package, Nigeria, 30 November 2021, tab 1.4: \u200bEASO Country of Origin Information Report: Nigeria.

The following is only a brief summary of those allegations.\n[4] The claimant fears persecution in Ethiopia on the basis of her imputed political opinion. The claimant\u2019s family has long been associated and connected with the Ogaden National Liberation Front (ONLF). As a result, members of her family have been targeted, harassed, and in some cases killed, by the Liyu police in the Ogaden region of Ethiopia.\n[5] The claimant comes from the Ogaden region, known as the Somali region of Ethiopia. Her uncles XXXX XXXX XXXX within the ONLF. Her brother and brother-in-law were both members of the ONLF. As a result of the family\u2019s close connection to the ONLF they were constantly targeted and threatened by the Liyu police. Both her father and sister were murdered by the authorities based on their connections to the ONLF. In about 2013, the claimant herself was detained by the authorities, raped, and threatened. She was only about 14 at the time. Shortly after this incident, the claimant fled Ethiopia with her mother and younger siblings.\n[6] The claimant first fled to Yemen with her mother and younger siblings in about 2013. The claimant\u2019s mother had an aunt living in Yemen. She remained there for approximately a year and a half. While in Yemen, her mother and siblings were presumed deceased after a house fire in about 2015. She then fled with her mother\u2019s aunt to Sudan, and then took a vehicle to Libya. Prior to reaching Libya, the aunt passed away. The claimant remained in Libya for approximately XXXX months, and then took a boat to Italy. The claimant was advised by others on the trip not to make a claim in Italy but instead to travel onwards to Sweden. The claimant did this and eventually arrived in Sweden where she initiated her claim for protection.\n[7] The claimant\u2019s application for refugee protection in Sweden was ultimately denied in about 2017. The claimant explained that her claim was decided in Sweden without a hearing, in part based on her credibility and also because the Swedish authorities felt the new leader of Ethiopia was making things better for the citizens of that country, and that she would not be at risk on return.\n[8] The claimant has no identity documents. The claimant was not born in a hospital and had only ever lived in a rural village in the Ogaden region of Ethiopia. She states that the only identity document she has ever received was the one issued to her by the Swedish authorities when she sought asylum in that country. The spelling of her name on this card is incorrect given the translation from Somalia to English. The claimant testified that she had no legal representation to assist her with her forms, or corrections of those forms, in Sweden.\n[9] The claimant fears that if she is returned to Ethiopia, the authorities will continue to view her as connected to the ONLF and persecute her as a result. She fears arrest, detention, or worse should she return to Ethiopia.\nDETERMINATION\n[10] I find the claimant is a Convention refugee.\n[11] I find the claimant has established a nexus to the Convention ground of political opinion. I have therefore assessed this claim under section 96 of the Act, and not section 97.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity and Credibility\n[12] When a claimant swears to the truth of their allegations, this creates a presumption that those allegations are true, unless there is reason to doubt their truthfulness. In this case, I found the claimant to be a credible witness. In coming to this decision, I have considered the personal circumstances of this claimant, including that she is uneducated, fled from her country of origin as a minor child, and also including the fact that she has suffered immense loss and trauma in her life that would reasonably impact an individual\u2019s ability to recall and speak about difficult experiences. Despite these obvious barriers, the claimant testified in a spontaneous, forthcoming and detailed manner that was consistent with the other evidence before me. There were no material inconsistencies or omissions not reasonably explained. I found the claimant to be emotive and forthcoming in her responses. Overall, I believe the claimant\u2019s allegations.\n[13] A material issue in this case is the claimant\u2019s identity. The claimant arrived in Canada on a Swedish Passport under the name XXXX XXXX XXXX. The claimant testified that she obtained this passport using an agent in Sweden. She testified that the photograph on the passport is not a photograph of the claimant and that the agent facilitated her entire travel to Canada, including providing her the passport and plane ticket. Despite the existence of this passport, the claimant has maintained at all times that she is XXXX XXXX XXXX of the Ogaden Region of Ethiopia.\n[14] Possession of a national passport can create a rebuttable presumption that the claimant is a national of that country. In this case I find this presumption has been rebutted. I accept the claimant\u2019s testimony that she obtained this passport fraudulently in an attempt to facilitate her journey from Sweden to avoid deportation to Ethiopia. It is not uncommon for claimants to utilize the assistants of agents to facilitate their travel to Canada, often including fraudulently obtained passports. Further, I also find the photograph on the passport is not of the claimant as the photograph does not sufficiently resemble the claimant on a balance of probabilities.\n[15] The claimant does not have any government issued identify documents form Ethiopia. She explained in testimony that this is because she was born a rural part of the Ogaden region, in a village hut. She was not issued a birth certificate, has never had a passport, and the only identity document she has ever had was the refugee ID document she received when she initiated her claim in Sweden. She fled from the Ogaden region in 2013 after she experienced a violent rape by a police officer, and after her father and sister had been murdered by police for the family\u2019s connection to the ONLF. She left without any documentation.\n[16] I questioned the claimant at length about her upbringing in XXXX XXXX XXXX, Ethiopia. Her testimony was detailed, spontaneous and consistent with the other evidence before me. She was able to describe the lay out of the village, the houses in the village, and how many people occupied the village. She explained her father\u2019s position in the village as a teacher of the Qur\u2019an, and was able to describe where the lessons were held in the village and how many other students would attend these lessons.\n[17] Along with the claimant\u2019s testimony about her upbringing in Ethiopia, I also found the other elements of her testimony to be detailed, consistent and spontaneous. Overall, I found the claimant to be a credible witness on a balance of probabilities, and so I believe what she has alleged in her Basis of Claim and very detailed narrative, including the elements of the testimony relating to her identity as a national of Ethiopia only. The claimant explained her harrowing journey from Ethiopia, to Yemen, to Libya, and then to Sweden. Her testimony was detailed. She described her experiences with emotion, including the hardships she faced along the way which included having to work as a minor child in Yemen and the difficulties that she and her family faced. Her testimony about her journey to Canada was consistent with her very detailed Basis of Claim form in Exhibit 2, and both were materially consistent with the detailed interview notes taken by the Border Officers when the claimant first arrived in Canada and initiated her claim.\n[18] Along with the claimant\u2019s credible testimony, she was also able to provide a supporting letter from the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (XXXX). The letter, written by the organization\u2019s XXXX XXXX, corroborates that the claimant is known to be from the Ogaden region of Ethiopia. The letter states that the organization interviewed the claimant, along with another individual from the same region, and ascertained that the claimant is from the Ogaden region of Ethiopia, and specifically that her family is known to be from XXXX XXXX XXXX. I have no reason to doubt the authenticity of this document and I assign it weight as it corroborates the claimant\u2019s identity.\n[19] The claimant also had a witness testify to corroborate her identity as a national of Ethiopia, and in particular the Ogaden region of the country, and also to her allegations of risk. The witness appeared by video. He explained knowing the claimant from their village in XXXX XXXX XXXX in the Ogaden region of Ethiopia. He testified that his father was a close friend to the claimant\u2019s father. The witness\u2019s father was XXXX XXXXof the sub-clan that both the witness and claimant belong to in Ethiopia. The witness was able to identify the detailed family tree of sub-clan, down to the branch where the claimant and the witness\u2019s ancestral lines diverge. The witness was also able to provide details about what he knows of the claimant\u2019s father (including his role in the community as a XXXX XXXX), the claimant\u2019s mother, and their circumstances in Ethiopia as having been targeted for the family\u2019s connection to the ONLF. I found the witnesses testimony to be consistent, detailed and spontaneous. I believe what he has stated in support of the claimant\u2019s identity, and I assign his testimony weight in helping corroborate the claimant\u2019s identity.\n[20] The claimant also produced a copy of her asylum card from Sweden. Notably, the name on that card is misspelled as XXXX XXXX XXXX. I asked the claimant about the misspelling, and she explained that the misspelling occurred when the name was translated from Somali to English. The claimant received this document without the assistance of counsel, including not having counsel to assist in completing her asylum forms, nor having counsel to assist in correcting any errors resulting from those forms. The Swedish asylum documents do properly note the claimant purported to be from Ethiopia, speaks Somali, and also included the correct birth date information. Counsel submitted a series of post-hearing documents purporting to demonstrate the translation of XXXX to \u201cXXXX\u201d \u201cXXXX XXXX XXXX\u201d and \u201cXXXX XXXX\u201d. Ultimately, I accept that translation from Somali to English would result in perceived spelling errors such as those demonstrated on the claimant\u2019s Swedish asylum ID. I accept the claimant\u2019s explanation for the obvious misspellings on the Swedish asylum documents and do not find these documents undermine her credibility in any respect.\n[21] I find the claimant has established that her name is XXXX XXXX XXXX, a national of Ethiopia, from the Ogaden region. Based on her credible testimony and the supporting testimony of the witness, I find she has established that she has been targeted, detained, abused, and violently assaulted by the authorities in Ogaden on the basis of her family\u2019s ties to the ONLF. I find the claimant has established that her uncles held XXXXpositions with the ONLF, that her brother and brother-in-law were both members of the ONLF, that her father and sister were killed by the police for the family\u2019s involvement with the ONLF. I find the claimant has established that she was forced to flee Ethiopia, along with her mother and younger siblings, when she was just about 13-14 years old because of the risk to the family by the police. I find the claimant continues to fear being targeted in Ethiopia for her family\u2019s involvement with the ONLF if she were to return to Ethiopia, and that she fears being targeted by the police because she fled the country against their demands.\n[22] I find the claimant has established her subjective fears on a balance of probabilities.\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution\n[23] I find that the objective evidence before me establishes that the claimant\u2019s fears of persecution as a perceived supporter of the ONLF in Ethiopia are objectively well-founded. The country condition evidence as outlined in the National Documentation package for Ethiopia[3] supports the claimant\u2019s allegations as follows.\n[24] According to the Human Rights Watch report for 2020, the \u201csecurity and human rights situation in Ethiopia deteriorated\u2026The rights landscape was defined by ongoing abuses by government security forces, attacks on civilians by armed groups, deadly violence along communal and ethnic lines, and a political crisis.\u201d[4]\n[25] The claimant is from the Ogaden region of Ethiopia. According to a LandInfo report, \u201cinformation about the conditions of the Somali region, including the Liyu police, is very limited.\u201d[5] The report explains that the Liyu police were established after an attack in 2007 by the Ogaden National Liberation Front (ONLF). The Liyu police were originally only present in parts of the Somali Region that constituted the heartland of the Ogaden clan, but today are known to operate throughout the entire Somali region. The Liyu police have grown considerably in recent years. The Liyu police operate with a \u201chigh degree of legal impunity\u201d[6]. The LandInfo report confirms there is \u201clittle doubt that Liyu Police has committed a number of serious violations, including executing civilians.\u201d The claimant explained in testimony that her father and sister were both murdered by the Liyu Police, and she herself detained and raped. I find her testimony is unfortunately consistent with the evidence before me concerning the Liyu police.\n[26] I accept the claimant\u2019s testimony that her family has been targeted for their connection to the ONLF. The country evidence before me establishes that the Liyu police, who operate in the Somali region of Ethiopia, were tasked with fighting against the ONLF. I find it likely that if the claimant were to return to the Somali region of Ethiopia, where she is from, that the Liyu police would continue to have an interest in her pursuing her, ultimately leading to her likely detention and persecution as a result. Despite the passage of time since the claimant fled Ethiopia, the country continues to suffer from sectarian divide and violence, and those viewed as part of the political dissent (real or imputed) continue to be targeted by the authorities. The evidence before me demonstrates that the Liyu police have grown considerably since the claimant left Ethiopia and continue to act with impunity. Therefore, I find the claimant continues to face risk despite having left the country in about 2013.\n[27] I find the claimant\u2019s subjective fears are objectively well-founded.\nState Protection\n[28] States are presumed capable of protecting their citizens. In this case, however, I find that the state is the agent of persecution. The country evidence indicates that the ONLF was listed as a terrorist organization by the authorities in Ethiopia until 2018.[7] Despite President Abiy\u2019s announcements on policy reform, \u201cpeace agreements with the OLF and ONLF have yet to be fully revealed.\u201d[8] The country evidence indicates that a peace deal was struck between the Ethiopian authorities and the ONLF, however, \u201cthe reforms, which the [security sector] is part [of] has started but there is still a long way to go until\u201d[9] the country sees lasting change. I find that the country evidence establishes that despite some marginal signs of reform, those who perceived to oppose the government continue to face arbitrary arrest, detention, cruelty, and ill treatment, and opposition supporters have been subjected to mass arrest and violence, and this is expected to continue. Reports confirm that \u201cindividuals who are known dissidents are at high risk of detention\u201d[10] on return home to Ethiopia. The state continues to direct violence at actual and imputed government opponents.[11] The country condition evidence establishes that opposition members, which may include individuals perceived as being members of the ONLF, face risk are persecution by the state in Ethiopia. Further, in this case, the claimant\u2019s uncles held XXXXroles in the ONLF and she herself has already been targeted for her perceived connection to the organization.\n[29] Despite marginal improvement in Ethiopia after the election of President Abiy, the country evidence before me continues to indicate the state remains actively engaged in persecuting and harming political opposition. In this way, it is unknown how durable, significant and effective any positive reform brought forward by President Abiy is to have on the nation as a whole. Whether the claimant was to seek state protection from the Liyu Police or from another state agent in Ethiopia, I find she would be at risk of persecution for her family\u2019s tie to an opposition group. Further, given the state\u2019s involvement in persecuting those perceived as political opponents and given the states involvement in directly persecuting the claimant in the past, I find the presumption of state protection has been rebutted in this case.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[30] The test for a viable IFA has two prongs and the panel must be satisfied of both on a balance of probabilities in order for there to be a viable IFA. First, the panel must be satisfied that the claimants would not face a serious possibility of persecution and that they would not be personally subjected to a risk to life, of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or danger of torture in the IFA. Second, the panel must be satisfied that it would not be unreasonable in all the circumstances, including those particular to the claimants, for the claimants to seek refuge there.[12]\n[31] For reasons similar to those relating to the lack of state protection and including the fact that the state has control over its territory, I find the claimant also faces a serious possibility of persecution by the state and its agents throughout Ethiopia as someone who would be perceived a political opponent given her family\u2019s ties to the ONLF. As the state is the agent of persecution, I find there is no viable internal flight alternative available to this claimant.\nCONCLUSION\n[32] For the foregoing reasons, I find the claimant is a Convention refugee. I accept her claim.\n(signed)Kay Scorer\nApril 25, 2022\n\n[1] Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (IRB) Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 4: Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution, Ottawa, Canada, March 1993, updated November 1996.\n\n[2] Exhibit 2.\n\n[3] Exhibit 3.1.\n\n[4] Exhibit 3.1, at item 2.3.\n\n[5] Exhibit 3.1, at item 10.3.\n\n[6] Exhibit 3.1, at item 10.3.\n\n[7] Exhibit 3.1, at item 1.5.\n\n[8] Exhibit 3.1, at item 1.8.\n\n[9] Exhibit 3.1, at item 1.13.\n\n[10] Exhibit 3.1, at item 4.16.\n\n[11] Exhibit 3.1, at item 4.21.\n\n[12] Ranganathan v.

Fung\nCountry: Cameroon\nRPD Number: VC1-04999\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2022-01960\nATIP Pages: N\/A\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER:\nINTRODUCTION\n[2] These are the reasons of the Refugee Protection Division for the decision in the claim of XXXX XXXX, XXXX, who claims to be a citizen of Cameroon and is claiming protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] The claimant\u2019s allegations were outlined in detail in his Basis of Claim form at Exhibit 2 and in oral testimony before the Board. There are also some minor amendments to the Basis of Claim form at Exhibit 4. The following is only a brief summary. The claimant is a 49-year-old man who is a citizen of Cameroon and no other country. He is anglophone, and in Cameroon, he had a long career as a XXXX at different XXXX XXXX XXXX. Most recently, he worked at the XXXX XXXX XXXX, an anglophone region, as a XXXX and XXXX for about eight (8) years. In 2016, the claimant participated in peaceful protests to protect anglophone XXXXrights. Those protests ultimately spiraled into a situation of civil war in Cameroon between the majority francophone government forces and anglophone armed groups that is ongoing. The claimant and his family have been targeted for attack by anglophone militants seeking support for their ongoing fight against government forces. And also, the claimant has been arrested by government forces who wish to punish him for being involved in the XXXX protests. The claimant has been kidnapped at gunpoint and received threats that escalated in the context of the December 2020 elections in Cameroon. He and his family relocated within Cameroon to try and escape these threats, but they continued. Many of the claimant\u2019s colleagues have been harmed or killed. The claimant fled to Canada in XXXX 2020 and his Basis of Claim form on file is signed in July 2021.\nDetermination And Nexus\n[4] I find the claimant is a Convention refugee as he faces a serious possibility of persecution in Cameroon. There is a nexus between his allegations, and his perceived political opinion. He has been targeted by government forces who perceive him as having an anti-government political opinion due to his participation in XXXX protests and his profile as anglophone XXXX and XXXX in the XXXX XXXX. Also, he has been threatened by supporters of anglophone separatism as anglophone militants have targeted him and his family for threats in order to compel material support for their struggle against the government. I also recognize that apart from political opinion, there is a possible nexus to a particular social group, as the claimant is an anglophone male of fighting age who has spent time abroad outside of Cameroon. This could result in him being perceived as a supporter of anglophone separatism by francophone authorities in Cameroon. In this case, I find the claimant\u2019s overall profile as an anglophone man who has participated in the XXXX protests to support anglophone rights, and who has spent significant amount of time outside of Cameroon establishes that he faces a risk of persecution from the Cameroonian government, as Cameroonian government authorities are likely to perceive him as a political opponent due to the specific profile.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[5] The claimant\u2019s identity was established on a balance of probabilities by his passport at Exhibit 1. The claimant also provided identity documents that speak to his Cameroonian nationality as well at Exhibit 4. These documents include his birth certificate, his marriage certificate, birth certificates for his children, and his driver\u2019s licence. I accept on a balance of probabilities the claimant\u2019s identity is what he alleges it is and he is Cameroonian. For the record, I would like to note that the claimant\u2019s name is entered incorrectly in the Refugee Protection Division\u2019s digital case management system. In the Refugee Protection Division\u2019s digital case management system, as of today\u2019s date, on April 7th, 2022, the claimant\u2019s name is entered backwards. However, the claimant confirmed at the hearing that his name, as it appears in his Cameroonian passport, is correct. His family name is XXXX, and his two (2) first names are XXXX XXXX. The claimant\u2019s allegations about his name line up with his name as it appears in his passport, and I find the reversal of his name in the Refugee Protection Division\u2019s digital case tracking system is simply an error, and I accept the claimant\u2019s identity is what he says it is and his name is as it appears in his Cameroonian passport on file at Exhibit 1.\nCredibility\n[6] I find the claimant to be a credible witness. He testified in a straightforward manner, and I did not identify any material contradictions, omissions, or inconsistencies within his testimony or between his testimony and the documentary evidence before me. I have no reason to doubt that his allegations are true, and I accept on a balance of probabilities that all of his allegations are true.\n[7] I note the claimant provided extensive documentary evidence in support of his allegations at Exhibit 4. This includes evidence of his work as a XXXX in Cameroon, such as his XXXX XXXX, and lists of employees working at the XXXX XXXX XXXX, as well as evidence of his earlier work as a XXXX XXXX. The claimant also provided documentary evidence corroborating his allegations about threats of harm from both government agents and anglophone militant groups in Cameroon. There is a testimonial letter from his spouse and a testimonial letter from his colleagues about threats against him, as well as photographs of damage to his home and damage to his car caused by bullets. Records of emails exchanged between the claimant and his spouse indicate that the Amba Boys group continued to ask about the claimant at his former home, as they want to know who owns the compound. Also in documentary evidence is a letter from the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, Greater Toronto Area chapter, confirming the claimant has been involved in their events since coming to Canada, as well as emails from the group XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, which corroborates the claimant\u2019s allegations that he remains interested in the political situation in Cameroon and opposed to violence in Cameroon, including violence inflicted by the Cameroonian government. Having examined these documents in the context of the overall evidence before me, I have no reason to believe the claimant has submitted anything false or fraudulent, and I accept his documents corroborate the material allegations that he is an anglophone XXXX from Cameroon who has suffered repeatedly from violent threats from both government agents and militant anglophone groups.\n[8] In assessing credibility, I have considered the claimant visited the United States in 2020 for about XXXX (XXXX) weeks but did not claim asylum there. I questioned the claimant about why he returned to Cameroon despite the fact he says in his Basis of Claim form he felt unsafe in Cameroon. He explained that he was motivated to return to Cameroon by profound concern for his family there, including his spouse and four (4) children who are all minors. He explained he made the difficult decision to leave Cameroon a second time to flee to Canada only after threats intensified in Cameroon and he had no other choice or ability to change his family situation in Cameroon. I found the claimant\u2019s explanation highly credible, and I accept it. I do not find his failure to claim asylum in the USA demonstrates a lack of subjective fear, and I do not draw any negative inference regarding his credibility from his failure to claim there. Also in assessing credibility, I questioned the claimant why there was apparently a delay of several months between when he arrived in Canada in XXXX 2020 and when his Basis of Claim form was signed in July 2021. The claimant explained he decided to claim asylum in Canada in late January 2021 after considering the implications of this decision very carefully, and after learning about the recent death of one (1) of his colleagues. He furthermore explained he attempted to make his claim in approximately February 2021 but there were some administrative delays related to mistakes about the order of his first and middle and last names. As a result, the final paperwork was not submitted until July 2021. I accept the claimant\u2019s explanation and I do not draw any negative credibility inference from the record before me suggesting there was a delay of some months before his Basis of Claim form was signed.\n[9] In summary, I find the claimant to be a highly credible witness, and I also accept he has provided probative and genuine documentary evidence in support of his allegations. On a balance of probabilities, I find all of his allegations are true.\nRisk Of Harm\n[10] I find the claimant would face a forward-looking risk of persecution if returned to Cameroon. This persecution would take the form of physical violence, arbitrary arrest or detention, and psychological abuse from police authorities in Cameroon. The claimant also faces a risk of detention, physical abuse, and psychological harm from anglophone militant groups in Cameroon. Both of these agents of harm, I also find, may kill the claimant should he return to Cameroon. Both of the agents of harm are motivated to harm the claimant as a direct result of their perception of his political opinions. Cameroonian authorities perceive the claimant as having an antigovernment opinion due to his profile as a XXXX XXXX who is anglophone phone and has been out of the country for some time. Anglophone militants perceive the claimant as not adequately supportive of their violent efforts against Cameroonian authorities and, therefore, their wish to retaliate against the claimant is also based in a perception of political opinion.\n[11] I have based my findings on the following country condition information, which corroborate the claimant\u2019s allegations. At Tab 2.1 of the National Documentation Package, there is a US Department of State Report indicating that Cameroonian authorities have conducted unlawful or arbitrary killings, including extrajudicial killings by security forces. Most of these killings have recently been associated with the armed conflict between anglophone militant groups and the majority francophone government. Many unarmed civilians have been affected by this violence, and the government is known to use excessive force on citizens. They are known to raid anglophone neighborhoods in Cameroon while searching for suspected militants. A report at Tab 2.3 confirms the conflict between government security forces and anglophone separatists has resulted in widespread civilian deaths and displacements. And a report at Tab 2.5 confirms armed groups and government forces committed widespread human rights abuses including extrajudicial or summary executions and mass killings across Cameroon\u2019s anglophone regions throughout 2020. The report at Tab 3.2 indicates Cameroonian authorities have imposed restrictions on anglophone regions including curfews, a ban on public meetings, and other restrictive measures. Armed forces in Bamenda have fired live ammunition, sometimes raiding homes during the night for searches, and carrying out arbitrary arrests and excessive force in various circumstances. The claimant\u2019s own experience in Bamenda relates to this information.\n[12] I have also carefully noted information from Tab 13.2 of the National Documentation Package for Cameroon. This report indicates that anglophone Cameroonians who have been living abroad for some time, such as people like the claimant, have been arrested upon their return to the airport in Cameroon. Those arrested include failed asylum seekers. Failed asylum seekers who are anglophone have been imprisoned, harmed, and fined. The claimant himself has already been accused of supporting the anglophone XXXX protest movement that sparked the ongoing conflict in Cameroon, and he has been detained as a result of that. He has claimed protection in Canada as an anglophone person. I find these circumstances contribute to the risk he would face if he returned to Cameroon, as he could be targeted by police for questioning or abuse at the airport if he returned to Cameroon. The claimant\u2019s age as a man who is within fighting age further contributes to this risk.\n[13] The claimant has also expressed fear of anglophone militant groups who have repeatedly threatened and attacked him and his family. At Exhibit 4, there are emails from the claimant\u2019s wife indicating that Amba Boys, who are a militant anglophone group, continue to seek out the claimant. Country condition evidence before me corroborates the risk the claimant could also face from anglophone militants if returned to Cameroon. I find the risk the claimant faces from Cameroonian government authorities adequate to accept this claim and I, therefore, find it unnecessary to assess the risk he faces from anglophone militant groups in detail. However, I will note that I do find the claimant credible with respect to the risks and threats he has experienced from anglophone militant groups. At Tab 2.1, 2.5, and 2.7, as well as 2.8 of the National Documentation Package, there is clear and consistent information indicating that anglophone separatist groups have engaged in egregious human rights abuses against civilians in Cameroon including extortion, kidnapping, and extrajudicial killings of people who they see as not adequately loyal to the anglophone cause or supporting the francophone government. The claimant indicated that he was threatened by anglophone militant groups who wanted to prevent him from returning to work as a XXXX as they considered XXXX who return to work as not being adequately loyal to the anglophone cause.\n[14] In summary, the evidence before me indicates that Cameroon\u2019s government continues to crack down on people who it suspects of supporting anglophone militants, and that the claimant\u2019s profile matches the profile of people who the Cameroonian government have harmed. I find that the claimant, as an anglophone person and a XXXX who participated in protests for anglophone rights and who has previously experienced abuse from Cameroonian authorities, would face a forward-looking risk of persecution if returned to Cameroon.\nState Protection and Internal Flight Alternative\n[15] States are generally considered capable of offering adequate protection to their citizens unless the state is in a state of complete breakdown. Although there is some argument to be made that the ongoing civil war in Cameroon may in itself indicate adequate state protection is unavailable, I find that even if the state of Cameroon is found to be in adequate control of all of its territories, there is clear and convincing evidence before me that state protection is not available to the claimant. I have found that the claimant faces a serious risk of harm in the form of persecution from Cameroonian police and security agents, including those who would meet him at the airport in Cameroon if he were to return. There is no evidence before me to suggest there are adequately independent state authorities in Cameroon who the claimant could approach for protection from the state authorities who have targeted him for persecution.\n[16] Furthermore, I find there is no viable internal flight alternative available to the claimant. The claimant has demonstrated on a balance of probabilities that he has been targeted for violent attacks and threats by both the Cameroonian government authorities and by militant anglophone groups. He has tried to relocate within Cameroon, as have his family, but the threats continue. I do not believe there is anywhere within Cameroon that he could be safe from a serious possibility of persecution due to his political opinion or imputed political opinion from either Cameroonian government authorities or anglophone militants. In particular, I have noted that there is a serious possibility the claimant would face persecution upon returning to Cameroon at the airport from government authorities who suspect him of an antigovernment political opinion due to his profile as an anglophone XXXX who has spent a significant amount of time abroad. It would, therefore, be not possible for him to even safely relocate within Cameroon even if a viable internal flight alternative existed, which I find it does not.\nCONCLUSION\n[17] I find the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, and I accept his claim.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

        "unofficial_text":"2022 RLLR 32\n\nCitation: 2022 RLLR 32\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: March 8, 2022\nPanel: Kari Schroeder\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Alfonso Mejia-Arias\nCountry: Mexico\nRPD Number: VC1-05483\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2022-01960\nATIP Pages: N\/A\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] This is the decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) in the claim of XXXX XXXX XXXX as a citizen of Mexico who is claiming refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (the \u201cAct\u201d).[1]\n[2] In hearing and assessing this claim, I have considered and applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline on Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution,[2] which offers guidance in recognizing women as members of a particular social group and also with respect to other gender specific issues present in this claim.\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] The claimant fears a man named XXXX XXXX \u201cXXXX\u201d who sexually assaulted her in XXXX 2019. He had been a customer at the XXXXshe worked at and prior to the assault he had been sexually harassing her. She alleges that he is involved in a criminal organization. The claimant reported the rape to the police the next day but nothing came of it and a police officer told her just to let it go. XXXX days after the assault, the claimant\u2019s husband was beaten. They relocated to Puebla. In XXXX 2019, the claimant received threatening phone calls. In XXXX 2019, the claimant states that XXXX associates found her in Puebla and attempted to shoot at her and her neighbour\u2019s car that she escaped into. The claimant travelled to Canada and claimed protection in February 2020.\n[4] There was an application to join the claimant with her son but was denied as the claimant did not want to discuss the rape with her son present.\nDETERMINATION\n[5] I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee under s. 96 of the Act.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[6] I find that the claimant\u2019s identity as a national of Mexico has been established on a balance of probabilities by her testimony and a copy of her Mexican passport.[3]\nCredibility\n[7] When a claimant swears to the truth of her allegations, this creates a presumption that those allegations are true, unless there is reason to doubt their truthfulness. In this case, I have found no reason to doubt the claimant\u2019s truthfulness. She testified in a straightforward and convincing manner, answered all of the questions posed to her, and was able to speak out of chronological order about the events giving rise to her refugee claim in Canada.\n[8] I have some documentary evidence to corroborate the allegations, most significantly a police report taken on the night of the assault as well as a letter from the claimant\u2019s husband confirming he was assaulted two days after his wife\u2019s assault and was told it was retaliation for reporting to the police. I also have letters from the claimant\u2019s former colleagues at the restaurant, confirming that the agent of harm had been repeatedly harassing the claimant in the months leading up to the assault.\n[9] In addition to these documents, the claimant testified spontaneously and in a detailed manner about the risks that she faces in Mexico. I thus find that the claimant is a reliable witness and I believe what she has alleged in support of her claim.\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution\n[10] In order to satisfy the definition of a Convention refugee found in section 96 of the Act, a claimant must establish that he or she has a well-founded fear of persecution by reason of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion. In this case the claimant was a victim of sexual violence and was targeted because of her gender. I thus find that there is a nexus to the Convention ground of particular social group, namely women. I have therefore assessed this claim under s. 96 of the Act.\n[11] The claimant testified that XXXX is a very dangerous man who was known to be part of a criminal organization. She did not know the name of the organization, however, included into evidence were screen shots of an anonymous facebook group that tries to identify and expose members of criminal organizations, due in part to the fact that police are helpless to do so. In this case XXXX repeatedly sexually harassed the claimant at the XXXXwhere she worked. She testified that although he was rude to other waiters, the focus of his advances were on the claimant. When she rejected his request to celebrate her birthday with him, he followed her with his friends from the restaurant, forced her into the vehicle, and raped her. I find that the claimant has established a subjective fear of returning to Mexico to face further sexual violence from the agent of harm.\n[12] The objective evidence indicates that violence against women is a significant problem in Mexico. Sources indicate that the rate of femicides in Mexico has increased by 137 percent over the last five years, while homicides have comparatively increase by 35 percent over the same periods. Sources indicate that the number of femicides committed by organized crime groups is \u201con the rise\u201d with some analyses indicating that 63 percent of femicides reported in March and April 2020 were connected to organized crime.[4]\n[13] Organized crime femicide occurs in areas where there is a presence of \u201cgang cultures\u201d, which women are considered \u201cdisposable\u201d and that violence against them represents \u201cgang cohesion and masculinity.\u201d Sources further state that organized crime culture is \u201cvery macho, patriarchal, with very sexist undertones\u201d and that organized crime groups murder women because they are \u201cseen as an object owned by the rival and, to cause damage, they kill their women.\u201d A recent Response to Information Request cites a case where a woman was killed in her home by persons who broke in looking for her husband, their presumed target, who was not home at the time.[5] The objective evidence indicates that a number of criminal organizations operate in Mexico and that their \u201cpredatory\u201d activities include extortion and kidnapping.[6]\n[14] Considering all the evidence before me, I find that the claimant would face a serious risk of persecution were she to return to Mexico.\nState Protection\n[15] The next element in my analysis is whether there is adequate state protection for the claimant in Mexico. While there is a presumption of state protection, this presumption can be rebutted with clear and convincing evidence that protection would not be forthcoming to the claimant.[7]\n[16] The objective evidence confirms that police corruption in Mexico remains a major problem. A recent Response to Information Request (RIR) on the subject emphasizes that corruption within the federal police and the armed forces \u201cunderpins state collusion with criminals.\u201d According to sources cited in the RIR, \u201canalyses of drug trafficking, organize crime and human rights violations also highlight the role of police at all levels \u2013 federal, state, local \u2013 in facilitating illegal businesses, working for organized crime, and systematically violating human rights.\u201d There are credible reports of police involvement in a number of crimes, including kidnappings for ransom.[8]\n[17] A 2017 article from InSight Crime on police corruption, including police affiliation with cartels and police effectiveness, states that \u201cin Mexico, organized crime has deeply permeated police institutions\u201d and reports that in most Mexican states local police \u201chave been infiltrated by organized crime.\u201d In a different article, InSight Crime further notes that an entire municipal police force in the municipality of Tehuacan in central Puebla state was disbanded due to allegations of corruption and links to organized crime. According to that source, the \u201cwholesale suspension of an entire municipal police force demonstrates the level to which organized crime and corruption networks penetrate the state on a local level.\u201d[9]\n[18] Compounding the above, the country condition documents indicate that laws addressing violence against women are not effectively enforced. Sources indicate that there has been \u201csystemic impunity\u201d in terms of how gender-based violence is addressed, and note the \u201ccomplicity, indifference, and mismanagement of cases\u201d involving violence against women. The United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women, amongst other sources, has emphasized that there are \u201cdeep-rooted institutional, structural and practical barriers\u201d which continue to hinder access to justice for women, including that officials within the criminal justice system, including law enforcement officers, hold \u201cdiscriminatory stereotypes\u201d and \u201climited knowledge\u201d of women\u2019s rights.[10]\n[19] In this case the claimant reported the rape to the police, but nothing was down. They told her to not to pursue anything further. Her husband was then beaten XXXX days later when XXXX found out about the police report. In view of both the objective evidence, which indicates that authorities have been compromised by corruption, and that gender-based violence is committed with impunity, as well as the claimant\u2019s testimony on her inability to access state protection, I find that the presumption of state protection has been rebutted.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[20] The final issue is whether the claimant has a viable internal flight alternative (IFA) in Mexico. In order to determine whether an IFA exists, I must assess whether there is any location in Mexico in which the claimant would not face a serious possibility of persecution and whether it would be reasonable to expect her to move there.[11] At the hearing I canvassed whether the claimant would have an IFA in Merida. However, after considering the evidence, I find that the claimant does not have a viable IFA because I am satisfied that the agent of harm would have the motivation and means to pursue her throughout Mexico.\n[21] With respect to XXXX\u2019s motivation, I considered that he has not contacted or threatened the claimant or her husband in the two years since she left Mexico. Conversely however, XXXXtargeted her specifically and violently attacked her when she rejected his advances. I find that if he were to learn that the claimant had returned to Mexico, he would have the motivation to pursue her in another city.\n[22] Further, XXXXwas able to find the claimant in Puebla, which is five hours away from Mexico. This is the case despite the fact that she changed her phone number. His associates tracked her from the market and shot at her. The objective evidence before me also states that if organized crime groups in other parts of Mexico are interested and willing to retaliate against people relocated in Merida, Campeche, Cabo San Lucas, or Mexico City, they could do it easily. According to sources, criminal groups are motivated to track certain individuals because they steal or lose money; due to personal rivalries or due to personal vengeance; perceived betrayal; or public exposition of relationships with public officials.[12]\n[23] Further, although the claimant is married, her testimony was that she and her husband\u2019s relationship has changed since she came to Canada, and she is not certain that he would relocate to Merida with her. She is currently working in Canada and sending money back to the children, as he is not able to entirely support them. In terms of relocating in Mexico as a single woman, the evidence before me establishes that low-income single mothers with children under 15 years of age face limited access and enjoyment of the right to food, as well as economic, social and cultural rights due to, among others, the \u201cvulnerable income status in which they find themselves, the discrimination they have suffered in different sectors such as social, labour and family, unequal access to employment opportunities, as well as low-paid jobs. Women face \u201cdifficulties and discriminatory practices \u2026 when attempting to enter the labour market.[13]\n[24] I therefore find that an IFA would be objectively unreasonable in the claimant\u2019s circumstances.\nCONCLUSION\n[25] For these reasons, I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee and I accept her claim.\n(signed) Kari Schoeder\nMarch 8, 2022\n\n[1] Immigration and Refugee Protection Act,S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n[2] Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (IRB) Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 4: Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution, Ottawa, Canada, March 1993, updated November 1996.\n\n[3] Exhibit 1.\n\n[4] National Documentation Package, Mexico, 29 September 2021, tab 5.20: \u200bWomen whose past partners are involved in criminal activities and implications for their safety (2019\u2013August 2021).

        "unofficial_text":"2022 RLLR 31\n\nCitation: 2022 RLLR 31\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: February 3, 2022\nPanel: Siobhan Yorgun\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Jacques Beauchemin\nCountry: Sudan\nRPD Number: VC1-06798\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2022-01960\nATIP Pages: N\/A\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: I have considered your testimony and the other evidence in the case, and I am ready to render my decision orally.\nINTRODUCTIONS\n[2] These are the reasons for the decision in the claim of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, a citizen of Sudan who is claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refuge Protection Act.\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] The claimant\u2019s allegations were fully set out in his Basis of Claim form. To briefly summarize, the claimant is a 41-year-old citizen of Sudan and no other country. The claimant is a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX for a contracting company, was working on a road project for local government in South Sudan starting in 2009. In XXXX 2010, he received a substantial payment in cash for completion of the project from XXXX XXXX. He requested XXXX XXXX office manager XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to keep the money for him, as there was fighting in the area at the time, until it was safe for him to travel with the payment back to his company in Khartoum. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX failed to return the money to the claimant. After the claimant complained that he would take the matter up with XXXX XXXX, he was assaulted at his home and threatened not to approach XXXX XXXX office and to keep his mouth shut.\n[4] The claimant returned to Khartoum and explained the situation to his boss. His boss was disbelieving and threatened to file a suit against the claimant. The claimant said his manager could follow the matter up with the governor in question. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX then called the claimant saying he had only himself to blame for failing to keep his mouth shut. The claimant was informed by a neighbor that two (2) men came looking for him at his house, whereupon he fled to his uncle further north in Atbara, after which he fled to Egypt and then on to Oman when his uncle told him three (3) men had come looking for him at his uncle\u2019s house in Atbara. When his job was terminated in Oman, and the claimant could not find another to prevent the cancellation of his work visa, he fled to Canada via the US, where he had a visa to attend an international civil engineering conference. The claimant fears for his life at hand of security forces under the influence of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.\nDETERMINATION\n[5] I find the claimant is a Convention refugee the pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[6] I find the claimant\u2019s personal identity and identity as a national of Sudan has been established on a balance of probabilities by his Sudanese passport and birth certificate.\nNexus\n[7] I find the claimant\u2019s allegations establish a nexus to the conventional ground of imputed political opinion because he claims to fear persecution (inaudible) his conflict with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, the next spokesperson for the ruling Military Transition Council, will be considered or construed as opposition to the government. Opposition to corruption or criminality may constitute a perceived political opinion when it can be seen to challenge the state apparatus, and indeed the claimant\u2019s personal knowledge of the wrongdoing of a senior political and military figure has been identified as a challenge to the state apparatus, and the state apparatus engaged in addressing this perceived threat. As such, I have examined this claim under section 96 of the IRPA.\nCredibility\n[8] When a claimant swears to the truth of certain allegations, this creates presumptions that those allegations are true unless there is reason to doubt their truthfulness. Claimant\u2019s testimony was forthright, and he provided spontaneous detail and testimony that was fulsome and consistent with his BOC and supported by the documentary evidence submitted. Which included, the letters confirming his employment in Sudan and Oman, and educational qualifications as a civil engineer. Birth certificates of his immediate family, supporting letters from family and friends attesting to their knowledge of certain events, and information on the conference for which he received a US visa. The claimant also submitted two (2) news articles from 2019, which include reference to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX as a spokesperson for the Transitional Military Council. Having assessed these documents, I have no reason to doubt their authenticity and find on a balance of probabilities that they and are genuine and give them full weight as they corroborate the claimant\u2019s narrative.\n[9] In light of the claimant\u2019s credible testimony and the corroborative evidence, I therefore find that the claimant entrusted a considerable sum of money to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, then XXXX XXXX for the local government for safekeeping while in Malakal and the south of Sudan during a period of fighting. That this money was intended as payment for XXXX XXXX to the claimant\u2019s company for completion of the (inaudible) project. And that when the claimant asked XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to return the funds so that he could deliver it to his company in the north, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX failed to do so. When the claimant threatened to report the matter to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX superior, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX threatened him and had two (2) men dressed in local suits assault the claimant.\n[10] I find the claimant on return to Khartoum had a court case initiated against him by his company for the loss of money. A company which the claimant testified was owned by the brother of then President, al-Bashir. I find the claimant was warned by his neighbour in Khartoum that two (2) men not in uniform, but in smart suits, the neighbor understood as indicating they were government security, had been looking for him. After the claimant had fled from his uncle further north in Sudan in Atbara to Egypt, his uncle called him with a similar description of three (3) men wearing suits, who appeared to be government security, looking for the claimant.\n[11] I find XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is both a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and currently in a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, described by the claimant as XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in Sudan. I find that the claimant has established on a balance of probabilities that he has personal knowledge of threatening behavior of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and that official\u2019s theft of monies from local government intended for a politically connected company. And I find the claimant has been personally threatened twice by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to silence him, and is on balance of probabilities, being sought by security apparatus of the state at the instigation of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. And that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX has a continued interest in the claimant remaining silent, as his reputation and influence grow.\nWell-founded Fear of Persecution\n[12] The claimant fears returning to Sudan as he alleged he will be on a wanted list and immediately captured by security and made to disappear to maintain the security and reputation of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. As well as having a subjective fear of persecution, I also find that the objective evidence before me establishes that the claimant\u2019s fear of by persecution by security agents of the state are objectively well-founded.\n[13] The country condition evidence has outlined in the National Documentation Package for Sudan supports the claimant\u2019s allegations regarding the treatment of perceived opponents to the state in Sudan by state agents. Corruption is endemic throughout Sudan and occurs with impunity. Those who speak out against it are punished. US Department of State report from the NDP for Sudan states that the World Bank rates corruption as a severe problem in the country. Officials found guilty of corrupt acts could often avoid jail time if they returned ill-gotten funds.\n[14] Journalists who reported on government corruption were sometimes intimidated, detained, and interrogated by security forces. Freedom House similarly reports that citizens who exposed public malfeasance faced arrest. And the rule of law is increasingly perceived as conditional on political connections. According to the US Department of State, the Sudanese government engages in arbitrary or unlawful killings, including of detainees. There are disappearances by or on behalf of the government authorities. Security forces continue to beat and torture detainees. Even without torture, prison conditions in Sudan are harsh, overcrowded, and life threatening. Arbitrary arrest and detention is common and for extended periods.\n[15] I find that the country conditions evidence establishes that those who have evidence of government corruption and perceived opponents of the state are arrested, tortured, and killed, amounted to persecution. I find that this threat remains ongoing for any person such as the claimant identified as a political reputational risk. As such, I find that there is more than a mere possibility of persecution should the claimant return to Sudan.\nState Protection\n[16] There is a presumption that unless in complete breakdown, states are capable of protecting their citizens. However, I find that presumption has been rebutted in this case, as the agent of persecution in this case is the state, and the NDP is clear on a politically dependent inability to take action against corruption. Accordingly, I find that there is no effective state protection available to the claimant.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[17] I find that the claimant does not have a viable internal flight alternative, that there is nowhere within Sudan that the claimant will be able to relocate without fear of persecution. The state of Sudan has effective control over its territory. The claimant would not be able to enter into or move within Sudan without coming to the state\u2019s attention. There is no evidence before me to suggest that there are adequately independent state authorities in Sudan who claimant could approach for protection in any part of the country. The claimant does not have an area within Sudan safe from persecution, and so does not have an internal flight alternative.\nCONCLUSION\n[18] Based on the analysis of both, I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA. and I accept this claim.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

As an initial matter, and I mean no disrespect by using your first names, but XXXX, you are the designated representative for XXXX XXXX XXXX who is still a minor.\n[3] I have considered and applied the chairperson\u2019s guideline 4 regarding claims of gender-based persecution.\n[4] I specifically note as a starting point at paragraph 11.2.1, the guideline states that the Convention refugee ground of membership in a particular social group includes individuals fearing gender-based persecution.\n[5] At paragraph 4.3 and paragraph 4.4, the guideline states that Members should avoid the application of myths, stereotypes, and incorrect assumptions when making findings of fact and law and when making decisions. Specific examples of these incorrect myths and stereotypes include assumptions that survivors of gender-based violence can be expected to behave in a particular manner, including pursuing criminal complaints, that a person in an abusive relationship will seek to leave at the first opportunity, that a person who has experienced gender-based violence once in Canada will automatically seek out counselling or assistance in overcoming trauma, that well-educated women or women with a capacity for self-sufficiency are less likely to experience gender-based violence, and that a person who is a victim of gender-based violence will necessarily know before arriving in Canada that they possess basic human rights, that what has happened is an infringement of those rights, and that there may be avenues of recourse available to them.\n[6] At paragraph 8.2.1, the guideline talks about corroborating evidence and notes that survivors of gender-based violence may not have access to any corroborating evidence, any independent evidence. And that of course makes sense when one (1) considers that the allegations are of domestic violence, violence that happens in the home, in a very personal and private setting, that other people in the community are not likely to see or not \u2014 in any event, not likely to see the full extent of.\n[7] At paragraphs 11.3.1 through 11.3.3, the guidelines discuss persecution. The guideline states that an individual\u2019s experience of gender-based violence may not necessarily amount to persecution in every case. It is \u2014 it needs to be analyzed on a case-by-case basis. But discrimination amounts to persecution if the consequences are substantially prejudicial, such as the right to earn a livelihood, rights to private and family life, freedom of movement, or the right to an education, and that harassment that is sufficiently serious and occurs over a period of time of time such that the person\u2019s physical or moral integrity is threatened may constitute persecution.\n[8] Having considered all of the evidence, I find that each of you is a Convention refugee under section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[9] Very briefly, you allege that you have in Barbados been living in a household with long standing domestic violence, physical and emotional. The worst of the physical violence was directed against you, XXXX, but all three (3) of you did suffer threats of physical violence at the very least, as well as ongoing psychological, emotional violence. The agent of persecution, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, is still alive, well, still living in the family household in Barbados.\n[10] Turning to analysis, the first issue is identity. I have copies of your current passports in Exhibit 1 and copies of your birth certificates in Exhibit 5. I am satisfied that each of you is a citizen of Barbados. I have heard your testimony and reviewed all of the evidence.\n[11] I find that each of you is a credible witness, and I accept your testimony. There are no significant inconsistencies or omissions between your testimony and the other evidence before me. Your allegations are at the very least not inconsistent with objective evidence about current conditions in Barbados. You both testified in a spontaneous and forthright manner. You did not exaggerate or tailor your evidence.\n[12] You have provided some corroborating documents in Exhibit 5, but I accept your testimony. I find that you are credible witnesses and specifically accept your evidence that you have all survived a long standing violent domestic home at the hands of XXXX XXXX in Barbados. (Inaudible) that you have all suffered psychological harm, and that you have all been victims of \u2014 threats of, or actual physical violence from XXXX. Now, there is \u2014 I find XXXX, that you are not excluded from protection under article 1(f)(b) of the Convention. There is no evidence that \u2014 well, that XXXX XXXX XXXX father, XXXX, has consented to her coming to stay in Canada. It is potentially the crime of abduction under the Canadian criminal code, which does have a maximum penalty of 10 years, and so is presumed serious.\n[13] However, section 285 of the Canadian criminal code provides a full defense if the person who removes the child from the other parent does so to either protect the child from imminent harm, or is him or herself escaping a danger of imminent harm. As I will explain, I find that you were escaping a danger of imminent harm, as well as protecting XXXX XXXX XXXX from danger of imminent harm. You therefore have access to the full defence under section 285, and so there is no serious reason to consider that you would be excluded from protection because you might have committed a serious non-political crime outside Canada before arriving in Canada to seek protection.\n[14] There is a nexus between the persecution alleged and the particular social group of women in Barbados. The UN compilation at the NDP Exhibit 3, Tab 2.4, note that patriarchal attitudes in Barbados for example, prevent women from among other things, participating in governmental decision making. The country gender assessment at Tab 5.3 notes that very high levels of overall human development in Barbados have not been accompanied by a correlating and an expected gender equality, and that these patriarchal norms are used to justify violence against women who do not \u201cknow their place\u201d, and support male control over women and girls\u2019 bodies, including use of violence to get access to sex.\n[15] I find that women and girls in Barbados do constitute a particular social group for the purposes of the refugee Convention in section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. Further, XXXX XXXX XXXX, I find that there is also a particular social group (inaudible) your case as the family member of a person who fears persecution under section 96. You testified that if you were to return a loan, you may face a harm or at the very least ongoing pressure from XXXX to get information from you about your mother and sister that \u2014 in addition to potentially pursuing you \u2014 to pursue you, he would also pursue you to get after your family members who allegedly face gender-based persecution, and so, there is this additional particular social group in your circumstances.\n[16] Turning to the well-founded fear of persecution, that has two (2) parts. A subjective fear and an objective basis. I have heard your testimony and I accept that each of you does have a subjective fear of persecution if you were to return to Barbados today. In the case of XXXX XXXX XXXX, I note guideline 3, dealing with child refugee claims \u2014 notes that due to a child\u2019s age, the child might not be able to testify or give evidence themselves about specific issues in their claim, which can include whether or not they are afraid to return. But the Panel, the Division, as the deciding member, I can consider all of the evidence, and I can infer details of XXXX XXXX XXXX claim from all of the evidence provided. And based on the evidence, I can certainly infer, and I accept that she also has a subject subjective fear of persecution if she were to return to Barbados today.\n[17] Considering all of the evidence, I find that your subject fear is objectively well-founded, and that you would face a serious risk of persecution if you were to return to Barbados today. Specifically, based on the evidence I have, I am satisfied that each of you would face at the very least, a serious risk of threats of physical violence, physical violence, and ongoing psychological violence causing psychological injury from XXXX, if you were to return.\n[18] As the guideline notes, persecution can and should be considered to include threats to a person\u2019s moral integrity. And the law is quite clear that psychological health is also health. Psychological harm is harm, just the same as physical harm. Threats of violence that cause psychological harm is as persecutory as threats and violence that cause physical harm. And it is analytically wrong to require an element of actual physical violence or harm if a person faces a serious risk of psychological harm. The evidence is that the physical violence has mostly \u2014 largely been directed against you, XXXX. But there have been threats of physical violence, and there has been, I find, on the evidence demonstrated, psychological harm to all three (3) of you.\n[19] XXXX XXXX XXXX, you and XXXX XXXX XXXX have both sought out psychological treatment for the harm you have suffered. XXXX, you have looked into the availability of psychological treatment. XXXX XXXX XXXX in particular has \u2014 you have seen \u2014 shown very concerning signs of serious psychological harm that has led her to cut herself to inflect physical harm, just to demonstrate the depth of her psychological harm. If you were to return, there is a serious risk that XXXX would continue to act as he has done in the past. That he would continue to threaten you, that he would continue to manipulate you, that he would continue to use violence or threats of violence to control you, down to the level of what you can spend for groceries, something that is not even in your control. And that these threats of violence and violence would cumulatively, seriously threaten your physical and your moral integrity, would threaten your physical and your psychological health, and amounts to persecution.\n[20] This is consistent with the objective evidence about conditions in Barbados. At Tab 2.2, the report by Freedom House notes that violence against women in Barbados remains widespread, and laws addressing domestic violence are not well enforced. At Tab 5.11, the report notes that rates of domestic violence have increased with the COVID-19 pandemic, which has forced families to remain at home.\n[21] At Tab 5.3, the report notes that Barbados has a very high rate of gender violence with 27 percent of women and girls, or more than one (1) in four (4) reporting having experienced domestic violence. At Exhibit 6, there is an article from April 2022, where the chief magistrate correctly observes that domestic violence is harmful to everyone in the family. The chief magistrate notes that \u2014 states that domestic violence around children creates war zones in households, that unleash terrorists on society. It is a recognition that domestic violence has serious ongoing long-lasting harm, whether or not that instant of physical violence is directed against that individual or someone else in the family. I will come back to that article in a moment.\n[22] If you were to return, Barbados is a very small country with a very small population. It is about 400 square kilometres, and has a population of just over 300,000 people. You would either be living with the agent of persecution again, or in the same community. There is simply not enough physical space or population to not be either living with him or living near him. If you are living with him, there is a serious risk that the same circumstances are simply going to continue, and you are going to continue to experience physical violence and psychological violence. If you were to live independently, out \u2014 away from him in another household, that would be \u2014 there would be a serious risk that would be seen as a loss of his face in the community.\n[23] The reports note that \u2014 sorry, let me just find it \u2014 that \u2014 lethal violence against women. Murders of women in Barbados have increased. They did dip for one (1) year, but have remained well, far too high. And so, simply removing yourself from the same household does not reduce the risk of ongoing violence, and maybe an inciting incident, a triggering event that can lead to an increase in violence. If you were to return based on all of the evidence, I am satisfied that each of you would face a serious \u2014 persecution.\n[24] XXXX XXXX XXXX, you are an adult. If you were to return, then it is possible that you could live outside the same home as the agent of persecution. However, you have testified, and I accept that there is a serious risk. He would still continue to pursue you either to continue to exert his control over you, as he is the man of the house, and you are therefore one (1) of (inaudible) \u201chis women in the house to control.\u201d But there is also a serious risk he would continue to pursue you to force you to give information about your mother, his wife, about your sister, his child daughter. And there is a serious risk given his use of violence in the home in the past, in a domestic situation in the past, that he could threaten and could use physical violence to compel you to either give him the information he wants, or to hurt you to \u2014 through hurting you, hurt your mother and sister.\n[25] I find that you do not have a viable internal flight alternative. As noted by the CIA World Fact Book, Tab 1.3, Barbados is a very small nation. It is geographically small. It has got a small population. You have testified and I accept that everyone knows everyone. There is nowhere where you could relocate to, where you would not be able to find you easily. And of course, if he is able to find you, he would be able to travel to and reach you. It all comes down to his motivation, and there is no reason that \u2014 to believe that he will not be as motivated to continue the persecution as he was in the past. There is no reason to believe that his behaviour has changed or will change.\n[26] I also note at Tab 5.3, the report on the country gender assessment for Barbados, that occupations \u2014 work in Barbados is highly differentiated by sex, and the \u2014 this differentiation has only been growing since 1996. That women make up the majority of workers who earn less than 500 dollars a week, and men make up the majority in all income brackets, earning more than 500 dollars a week. Women are statistically at the very bottom of the pay scale. Female headed households the reports states, poverty is concentrated among female headed households in Barbados.\n[27] The CIA World Fact Book notes that unemployment overall is 10 percent as of 2017. That is one (1) in 10 people. But for youths, it is as high as 26 percent overall, and more than 20 percent for young women. That is more than one (1) in five (5). Given the evidence about work, about earnings, there is a serious risk that if you were to return and relocate, you would face poverty, because of your gender as independent women. I therefore find you do not have a viable internal flight alternative.\n[28] Finally, I find that you would not receive adequate state protection. The US DOS report and other reports do note that Barbados has legally made steps to increase the laws protecting women from violence. However, considering all of the evidence, I find that these not \u2014 these are not practically enforced. Going back to that article I referred to, where the chief magistrate correctly notes that domestic violence is hurting everyone. He then goes on to say that the police are \u201ctoo much involved\u201d in domestic matters.\n[29] You have provided another article in Exhibit 6, from January 2020, about a recent domestic violence case where the report quotes the president of the National Organization for Women, stating that domestic violence is not taken seriously by the courts, and particularly by the police. At Tab 2.4, the UN compilation, it states in regards to domestic violence and court response to domestic \u2014 \u201cthe committee was however, concerned about the insufficient resources allocated to the justice system, the overly burdened procedural rules, considerable backlogs and lengthy delays in processing cases, the limited capacity of the police and courts to address complaints from women about gender-based violence in a gender sensitive manner, and the absence of a specialized court on family laws.\u201d\n[30] At Tab 5.5, report by the research directorate states that police are slow and reluctant to respond to calls about domestic violence, and their response is by and large, inadequate. That is also consistent with the objective evidence about patriarchal norms in Barbados and society. The police are members of society and are presumed reasonably, to share those same opinions in the absence of evidence of effective training to combat these patriarchal attitudes. There are reports that there have been some attempts to provide this evidence, but the police are still reluctant to respond to domestic violence and see it as a domestic matter.\n[31] Despite the laws in place or coming soon, I find that the police and the courts do not provide a practical adequate response to issues of domestic violence. That the police response is slow, it is inadequate, the court system is slow and inadequate, and this not only leads to a tolerance of domestic violence, a impunity for offenders, it is also consistent with and reinforces the patriarchal beliefs that say that men have control. That men are allowed to use violence to exert that control, and that women should know their place, because the police and the courts are not acting in a way to say anything different. For all of these reasons, I find that each of you is a Convention refugee under section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, and I accept your claims for protection.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013\n\n",

Throughout this hearing and in this decision, I have considered and applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 4 on gender considerations in proceedings before the Immigration and Refugee Board as these claims include allegations of a risk of gender-based violence. I have also applied and considered the Chairperson\u2019s Guidelines on child refugee claimants\u2019 procedural and evidentiary issues as it relates to the claim of the minor claimant.\nDETERMINATION\n[3] I find that the claimants are Convention refugees pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA based on their well-founded fear of persecution in Ukraine.\nALLEGATIONS\n[4] The specifics of their claims are stated in the claimants\u2019 Basis of Claim forms and narratives in evidence. The principal claimant is a 33-year-old XXXX and the minor claimant is a 13-year-old girl. And they are both from Kharkiv, Ukraine. The claimants are Russian speakers and the principal claimant\u2019s cousin and her family live Saint Petersburg, Russia. Starting in 2014 the claimants began to experience discrimination in Kharkiv as they had Russian relatives who came to visit them often. The threats they received began to escalate in 2021 when the claimants\u2019 home was vandalized and they received written threats on a few occasions. When they went to the police, the police did not assist them or offer them protection. As the war began at the end of February 2022, the claimants began to fear for their lives and fled to western Ukraine to Lviv in early XXXX 2022 where they attempted to rent a house. They were informed that they could only rent a home if they spoke Ukrainian and if the principal claimant\u2019s husband fought for Ukraine. They were told to leave when the principal claimant informed the landlord that her husband would not fight for Ukraine. The claimants then fled from Ukraine to Poland and then to Canada where the claimant\u2019s cousin lives in Montreal at the end of XXXX 2022. The claimants fear they will be persecuted due to their imputed political opinion in Ukraine as they are Russian speakers who have Russian family numbers. And they also fear being persecuted by the Russian military as Ukrainian women or girls by the invading Russian troops or killed by the ongoing missiles and bombs. The claimants made their refugee claim in April 2022.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[5] I am satisfied with the identity of the claimants as citizens of Ukraine which is established by their testimonies and the copies of their passport with Canadian visas in evidence.\nCredibility\n[6] According to Maldonado, when a claimant swears the truth of their allegations, this creates a presumption that those allegations are true unless there is reason to doubt their truthfulness. I find no reason to doubt the truthfulness of the claimants. They testified in a straightforward, forthright, detailed and candid manner and there were no material inconsistencies, omissions or contradictions between the claimants\u2019 testimonies and the other evidence in their case. They did not exaggerate or tailor their evidence. And in summary, their testimonies were consistent with the other evidence on the central aspects of their claims. I find the claimants provided ample details to expand upon their allegations. And although the claimants did not provide additional corroborating documents, I do not draw a negative inference on their overall credibility. I find that the objective evidence before me as well as the claimants\u2019 identification documents and credible testimony establish on a balance of probabilities the facts alleged in their claims. Including that the claimants are Ukrainian women or girls from Kharkiv and Russian speakers. In addition, I accept, on a balance of probabilities, that they were threatened and received written threats to their home on multiple occasions. Therefore, I accept the subjective fear they have of returning to Ukraine now as they have nowhere to live and no protection there. And in sum, I find the claimants to be credible witnesses and therefore, I believe what they have alleged in support of their claims.\nNexus\n[7] To qualify for refugee status under the Refugee Convention, an individual must demonstrate that they have a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion. The allegations establish a nexus to the Convention ground for the claimants based on their membership in a particular social group as women or girls facing a risk of gender-based violence in a situation of war. In addition, the allegations support a nexus to the Convention ground for the claimants based on their imputed political opinion as they have relatives who are Russian family and who often visited them in Kharkiv from Russia. And therefore, the claimants experienced repercussions in the form of discrimination which escalated to threats due to their imputed pro-Russia political opinion. I will, therefore, assess their claims under section 96.\nWell-founded Fear of Persecution and Risk of Harm\n[8] I find that the claimants have established a well-founded fear of persecution based on their gender due to the war. The claimants testified that they were fearful for their lives prior to leaving Ukraine due to the threats they received as well as the escalating violence from the war in Kharkiv and throughout Ukraine. Country condition evidence from the most recent update of the National Documentation Package for Ukraine. In particular, an independent legal analysis of the Russian Federation\u2019s breaches of the Genocide Convention in Ukraine and the duty to prevent by the New Lines Institute for Strategy and Policy at NDP Item 1.13. Establishes that there are one (1), reasonable grounds to believe Russia is responsible for direct and public incitement to commit genocide. And a pattern of atrocities from which an inference of intent to destroy the Ukrainian national group, in part, can be drawn. And two (2), the existence of a serious risk of genocide in Ukraine, triggering the legal obligation of all states to prevent genocide. This report provides examples of what it describes as a genocidal pattern of destruction targeting Ukrainians. The examples include mass killings, deliberate attacks on shelters and humanitarian routes, deliberately inflicting life-threatening conditions by targeting vital infrastructure, indiscriminate bombardment of residential areas, rape and sexual violence and forcible transfer of Ukrainians.\n[9] One (1) second. Okay. In regards to the claimants\u2019 risk of being persecuted as Ukrainian women or girls, a rapid gender analysis by Care International and UN Women at NDP Item 5.6 states that women constitute the majority of those displaced within and outside of the country. And they face significantly increased safety and protection risks, incidents of gender-based violence, particularly domestic violence and conflict-related sexual violence. Since the war began, women\u2019s care burden has increased significantly with the lack of access to education facilities due to security risks, women\u2019s engagement in volunteer activities, and men\u2019s absence due to engagement in the armed forces. The war will increasingly impact unemployment rates among all categories of the population and will likely continue to push women into the unprotected informal sectors of the economy, poverty and dependency on social payments, especially among female headed households, will be expected to increase. This report, the rapid gender analysis, further states that staying in Ukraine can, however, have negative impacts on women and children\u2019s security and can mean a lack of access to basic services. There are also accounts of family separation at the border. When women and children choose to leave, they face family separation and anxiety about the well-being of those left behind. This article further delves into the challenges for women of all ages to access aid and services in the war-torn areas of eastern Ukraine such as Kharkiv, where the claimants lived before coming to Canada. Many have fled and face further hurdles in accessing safe shelters in the western region of the country. This article states that, \u201cFor many respondents, financial and social support including pensions, child benefits and disability benefits is their only source of income. And many are concerned about whether they will be able to access these benefits. This is especially true for female headed households, families with persons with disabilities and families of pensioners. Moreover, this issue disproportionately affects women, who make up 72 percent of social protection recipients and the majority of older people and caregivers in Ukraine.\u201d\n[10] Women and girls are also more at risk of conflict-based sexual assault. NDP Item 5.6 states that there is increasing and concerning media reports of conflict-related sexual violence emerging in Ukraine, and many interviewees raised gender-based violence as a safety concern. Interviewed women CSOs highlight the particular risk of gender-based violence in occupied war affected areas. And the executive director of UN Women, Sima Bahous, noted in her speech to the UN Security Council, that this increasing information on sexual violence committed by the Russian forces is raising all the red flags. NDP Item 5.3 states that Kharkiv has been the site of heavy fighting between Russian and Ukraine forces since the start of the Russian invasion and continues to be one (1) of the front lines of the war. As a result, there is currently limited evidence available for what is happening in Kharkiv up to date. Based on the evidence before me and the circumstances of this claim, I find the claimants have demonstrated a well-founded fear of persecution on both a subjective and objective basis. I also find that the claimants would face a serious possibility of persecution in Ukraine based on their profiles as women or girls who would be at risk of gender-based violence by the Russian military who have invaded the country of Ukraine.\nState protection\n[11] The claimants faced threats and vandalism due to their Russian language and their relationship with their relatives who were Russian in the past between 2014 and 2021. When these threats were reported to the police, the police did not assist the claimants, and the police are no longer in a position to help civilians due to the war in Ukraine. While states are presumed to be capable of protecting their citizens, it is the obligation of the claimants to demonstrate on a balance of probabilities that their home country is unable or unwilling to provide adequate state protection. And I find that while Ukraine has done all it can to protect its citizens, it is currently unable to provide them with adequate protection because the enemy they face is better armed and has sheer numbers of weapons and soldiers that are more than the Ukrainians have at their disposal. NDP Item 5.6 states that women constitute the majority of those displaced within and outside of the country and they face significantly increased safety and protection risks. Incidents of gender-based violence, including domestic violence and conflict-related sexual violence, are increasing, but services for survivors are not provided in full. And in many parts of Ukraine, the police are no longer responding to such cases of domestic or conflict-related sexual violence. Furthermore, drivers, mostly women, feel it has become dangerous to drive a car in Ukraine now because traffic lights are not working, and there are no police on the streets. Based on all the country condition evidence available, it is evident that the current ability of Ukraine to defend itself is entirely reliant on the military contributions from other countries. And therefore, whatever protection is being offered to its citizens is actually a form of surrogate protection. In considering the totality of the information available to me, including the most up to date publicly available news report and all the objective evidence before me, I find the claimants have rebutted the presumption of state protection with clear and convincing evidence.\nInternal Flight Alternative or IFA\n[12] I will now consider a two (2) prong test in order to determine the viability of an internal flight alternative location for the claimants. First, I must be satisfied that, on a balance of probabilities, the claimants would not face a serious possibility of persecution or risk to life or of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or danger of torture in the proposed IFA. Second, I must be satisfied that the conditions in the suggested IFA are not such that it would be objectively unreasonable, in all the circumstances including those particular to the claimants, for them to relocate and reside there. In the circumstances of this claim, I find that the risk the claimants face would exist throughout entire territory of Ukraine if they were to return now. The forces of the Russian Federation have shown the ability and willingness to strike each and every city in Ukraine from land, sea or air. They have also shown a willingness to indiscriminately rain artillery and missile fire on civilian infrastructure, bomb shelters, train stations, maternity hospitals and shopping malls. They have shown a willingness to summarily execute unarmed civilians, starve them of food, water and medical supplies and deprive them of basic necessities and sanitation.\n[13] And this is reflected in the March 2022 UNHCR report on return to Ukraine found at NDP Item 1.23, that describes the situation in Ukraine as volatile and uncertain. The UNHCR report calls on states to suspend the return of nationals to the country. It states that in view of the volatility of the situation in the entire territory of Ukraine, UNHCR does not consider it appropriate to deny international protection to Ukrainians and former habitual residents of Ukraine on the basis of an internal flight or relocation alternative. A June 2022 report at NDP Item 1.10 indicates that there are more than 8 million internally displaced persons in Ukraine. The report highlights numerous challenges in Ukraine facing internally displaced persons,ncluding the lack of accommodation, shortages of food, water and energy supplies, and barriers to accessing financial, social support and health services. In addition, the claimants did make \u2013 take steps to relocate within Ukraine. However, due to their Russian language as well as the fact that the principal claimant\u2019s husband did not agree to join the war, they were not invited to stay longer at their place of residence in western Ukraine. The Ukrainian government has made some efforts to counter the Russian aggression and provide protection to its citizens. But in sum, its operational effectiveness falls short of adequacy. And this state of affairs exists throughout the entire country of Ukraine. Therefore, I find there is no location within Ukraine that the claimants could relocate to now and not face a serious possibility of persecution on the Convention ground of being a woman and a girl.\nCONCLUSION\n[14] For these reasons, I find the claimants are Convention refugees under section 96 of the Act and I accept their claims.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

The spouse provided no objection to this appointment. The designated representative was provided with the opportunity to testify about any risks faced by the minor claimant in India.\n[4] In conducting the hearing and rendering these reasons, I have considered and applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 4 which offers guidance on the gender-specific aspects of this claim.[iii] I have applied this guideline when offering procedural accommodations for sensitive testimony, in not questioning the spouse regarding details of the sexual assault she faced, and in assessing the spouse\u2019s limited testimony. The minor claimant did not attend the hearing. The claimants agreed to inform me if they wished, at any point, to testify without the presence of their child, the associate claimant; the claimants did not inform me at any point of the hearing that they desired this accommodation, and the associate claimant was present throughout the testimonies of all claimants. I have also considered and applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 3 regarding child refugee claimants.[iv] I note that the incidents outlined in the claimants\u2019 allegations are sensitive and occurred when the associate claimant was a child. I therefore considered that, as per this guideline, he may have limited knowledge of the risks facing him and his family in India.\nALLEGATIONS\n[5] The full allegations are set out in the claimants\u2019 BOC forms.[v] The claimants\u2019 immediate family consists of the principal claimant, who is the husband\/father; the spouse, who is the mother\/wife; the minor claimant; the associate claimant; and two daughters who are not part of their claim for refugee protection. These daughters are named XXXX and XXXX. The spouse, associate, and minor claimants stated that they wished to rely on the narrative provided by the principal claimant, their respective husband and father. In summary, the claimants fear the Punjab police who accused the principal claimant of being associated with militants and the drug mafia, detained and beat him, and detained and sexually assaulted the spouse. The claimants also fear the XXXX XXXX who kidnapped the associate claimant and extorted the claimants.\n[6] The principal claimant was born in West Bengal, but later moved to Bhilai, Chhattisgarh after he finished school, as he had an opportunity to work in XXXX XXXX XXXX and wished to support his family. The claimants lived together with their children in Bhilai, where the principal claimant had a XXXX XXXX. In 2012, the associate claimant was kidnapped by an unknown person claiming to be a member of the XXXX XXXX. The claimants were forced to pay a ransom to have their son released. They knew that they would then be on the XXXXlist of people to extort, so the principal claimant had to close his business and they moved to XXXX in Punjab in 2013.\n[7] The principal claimant joined his son-in-law, XXXX XXXX XXXX (his daughter XXXX husband) XXXX XXXX XXXX. In XXXX 2016, the principal claimant and a driver from XXXX XXXX were stopped by the police. He was questioned about drugs, the police beat him, and they took him to an unknown location where he was kept for two days, beaten, and questioned about XXXX who was accused of being involved in the drug mafia. While he was detained, his house was searched, and the spouse was mistreated. His family paid a bribe for his release with the assistance of the village council, and his fingerprints, photos, and signature were taken by police. Police continued to harass him and his family. He and the spouse were detained in XXXX 2016. They were separated at the station; the principal claimant was beaten, questioned, and kept for two days, while the spouse was beaten, sexually assaulted, and released the next day. He was told to report to police every month and to bring XXXX. The claimants soon went to live with relatives in Chandigarh.\n[8] In Chandigarh, the claimants hired an agent to help them get their visas and tickets to Canada. The police continued looking for them, beat the principal claimant\u2019s mother in Chhattisgarh, and raided their relatives\u2019 home in Chandigarh. The claimants arrived in Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2017. The police continued to look for them after they arrived in Canada. While in Canada, the claimants extended their visitor visas, and claimed refugee protection in XXXX 2018.\nDETERMINATION\n[9] I find that the claimants are Convention refugees as per s. 96 of IRPA, as they have each established a serious possibility of persecution if they were to return to India.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[10] I find that the identities of the claimants as nationals of India have been established through their testimonies and the copies of their passports in evidence, which contain Canadian visas.[vi]\nNexus\n[11] I find that the allegations establish a nexus to a convention ground for each claimant. The principal claimant has a nexus to an imputed political opinion, as the Punjab police have accused him of supporting pro-Khalistan militant groups. The spouse, associate, and minor claimants have a nexus to a particular social group, specifically that of a family member, as their risk arises from their association to the principal claimant and the allegations made against him. Further, the allegations and profiles of the spouse and minor daughter relating to their gender speak to a nexus of particular social group by way of them being women. For these reasons, all claims will be analyzed under s. 96 of IRPA.\nCredibility\n[12] A claimant\u2019s sworn testimony is presumed truthful unless there are reasons to doubt the veracity of their allegations.[vii] In this case, the claimants\u2019 testimony appeared emotional and genuine. However, the spouse had difficulty testifying at times, and the principal claimant and spouse often required redirecting back to the question at hand. The associate claimant\u2019s testimony was more straightforward, and he provided testimony regarding the incidents that he directly experienced in the past. Despite lacking knowledge of details regarding his forward-facing risk from police, I find that the associate claimant\u2019s testimony corroborated aspects of the principal claimant and spouse\u2019s testimony. I also find his limited knowledge of the risk he faces from police to be reasonable given the considerations outlined in the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 3. The principal claimant also spoke of the personal risk to the minor claimant in India. The claimants\u2019 testimonies were generally consistent with the information provided in their BOC forms and narrative, aside from that outlined below, and I find that sufficient explanations were provided for all material inconsistencies and omissions.\nRisk from the XXXX XXXX\n[13] I find the allegations that the principal claimant was raised in a region where XXXX XXXX were active to be credible, as he was raised in West Bengal and later moved to Chhattisgarh. The country documentation in the Indian NDP confirms that XXXX groups are active in these regions of India.[viii] I find that the principal claimant was raised with fear of these groups. I also find the allegation that the associate claimant was kidnapped by a XXXX XXXX as a young child to be credible. I find that the claimants moved to the Punjab region due to extortion and threats from the XXXX XXXX that kidnapped the associate claimant. However, I find that the claimants failed to credibly establish that a forward-facing risk from the XXXX XXXX exists for any of the claimants, as none of them have heard from a member of this group since sometime in 2013 when they moved to Punjab and the principal claimant changed his phone number. The principal claimant also testified that while they were living in Punjab, they did not experience any problems from the XXXX XXXX. The principal and associate claimants testified that they had a future risk from this group; however, they stated that their fear arises from the fact that XXXX XXXXare active in cities where they kidnap individuals for ransom and that they are a powerful terrorist group. They did not testify to any threat since 2013 or any individual, forward-facing risk to any of the claimants from a particular XXXX XXXX. While the principal claimant testified that these XXXX XXXXoperate in somewhere between 9-12 provinces in India,[ix] and the NDP documentation confirms that they operated as of 2016 in 11 states within India, the claimants have failed to establish with sufficient credible evidence that any member of a XXXX XXXXhas continued to pursue them for the past 9 years or that they would come to the attention of a member of the XXXX XXXXin any part of India if they were to return. Consequently, I find that the claimants\u2019 forward-facing risk is that arising from the Punjab police as discussed below.\nRisk from Punjab police\n[14] The principal claimant testified that he felt responsible and that he was unable to protect his family from the police and the suffering they experienced. He stated that he feared he would be detained again upon returning to India and sentenced to many years in prison, leaving his wife and children unable to survive. He stated that that when the claimants first moved to Punjab, they had a peaceful life for three years, despite struggling with the language, as they spoke Hindi, not Punjabi. He stated that when he was first arrested, the police stopped his truck and accused him of drug trafficking and involvement with the drug mafia and ex-militants, and that his son-in-law XXXX, who was his business partner in his XXXX XXXX, was also involved in the same work. He stated that he struggled to understand the police\u2019s words and answer their questions due to the language barrier, but he repeatedly heard the term \u201cKhalistan\u201d, leading him to believe he was accused of working with pro-Khalistan militants. He stated that he had never been involved in or had any interest in being involved in any of the activities or ideologies he was accused of, and no person in his immediate family was involved in these activities either. He stated that he knew XXXX was involved with the SAD-B political party, but he did not know anything about his activity with this group. He also stated that XXXX father used drugs and was likely involved in some of the alleged activities, as he was arrested multiple times and put in jail. The principal claimant stated that his relationship with this man never developed due to his drug use. The principal claimant testified to the beatings he, and his wife during the second arrest, suffered from police and details of their experience when detained, along with the trauma he experiences when thinking about those events.\n[15] The spouse also testified to the long-term effects of the beatings from the police, including an impact on her ability to work due to an injury in her hand that was worsened from these beatings. She stated that the police arrested her because she was questioning why they were beating her husband, and that when she was detained, she did not understand them, as they were speaking Punjabi, but that she repeatedly heard the word \u201cdrug\u201d. She stated that after she was sexually assaulted by police, she was fearful of telling anyone, and the only person that she told was her husband. She stated that when she sought medical attention, it was her husband only who spoke with the doctor, and she did not tell the doctor about this sexual assault.\n[16] I find that the claimants\u2019 testimonies establish, on a balance of probabilities, that the principal claimant was accused by the Punjab police of involvement in drug trafficking and supporting militants in their fight for Khalistan, and that he was not politically or criminally involved in any of these activities. I also find, on a balance of probabilities, that both the principal claimant and the spouse were detained, assaulted, and questioned in relation to these accusations.\nDocuments\n[17] I find that the claimants\u2019 allegations are corroborated by the following documents that they provided at exhibits 4, 5, 7, and 8:\nAn affidavit from the claimants\u2019 host in Chandigarh stating that they lived with her for two months in 2016, that the claimants told her about their circumstances, that the spouse was depressed, and that after they had moved, the police came to her residence looking for the claimantsAn affidavit from the principal claimant and spouse\u2019s daughter XXXX, who continues to live in India, stating that her father was illegally detained in 2016, that she tried to get him out of detention on her own but could not, and that she sought the assistance of the village sarpanch to get him released. She also stated that both of her parents were detained in October 2016, and afterwards her parents lost their reputation in the village, and it was hard for her siblings at school. She confirms the claimants then went to ChandigarhMultiple treatment reports and prescriptions from the principal claimant and spouse\u2019s treatments at the hospital following their detentions, along with individual letters for each of those claimants from the medical doctor who treated them confirming the treatment that he gave themI find no reason to doubt the genuine nature of these documents and give them significant weight in establishing that the claimants were illegally detained by police, physically harmed, received medical treatment, went to live in Chandigarh, and that police have continued to search for them after they left. The claimants also provided documentation relating to the principal claimant\u2019s XXXX XXXX in Chhattisgarh and his XXXX XXXX XXXX in Punjab;[x] I give these documents significant weight and find that they, along with the claimants\u2019 testimonies, establish that the principal claimant owned a XXXX XXXX in Chhattisgarh and a XXXX XXXX XXXX in Punjab.\nDelay in claiming\n[18] I note that the claimants arrived in Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2017 and stated that they renewed their visitor visas when they expired. They signed their Basis of Claim forms on May 8, 2018 and their claims were referred to the RPD on May 15, 2018. I asked the principal claimant why they did not claim refugee protection for the first nine months that they were in Canada, and he stated that as they had come with their daughter XXXX and her husband XXXXto Canada, they thought that they would receive assistance from them to establish themselves in Canada. Due to a falling out with XXXX, the claimants stopped talking to XXXX and XXXXand did not receive assistance from them. After this, the principal claimant stated that he shared the problems they were facing in India with others at the temple in Toronto, and he was told that he could claim refugee protection if he went to Montreal. The claimants then moved to Montreal and claimed protection. The spouse and associate claimants did not add further testimony regarding their delay in claiming. I find this explanation to be reasonable, as their delay of nine months is a reasonable amount of time for the claimants to have had their expectations of family support fall apart, to tell others about their problems, to resettle in Montreal, and to have found a lawyer to complete their claim. I, therefore, do not draw a negative inference about their credibility from their delay in claiming protection once they arrived in Canada.\n[19] Overall, I find the claimants to be credible witnesses regarding the allegations I have accepted above. Based on the totality of the evidence before me, I find that, on a balance of probabilities, the claimants have established the abovementioned personal facts alleged in their claims.\nObjective Basis\n[20] The objective evidence supports the claimants\u2019 fear of returning to India.\n[21] According to the objective evidence in the National Documentation Package (NDP) for India,[xi] last updated June 30, 2022, significant human rights abuses exist in the country including extrajudicial killings perpetrated by police; torture and cases of cruel, inhumane, or degrading treatment or punishment by some police and prison officials; arbitrary arrest and detention by government authorities; harsh and life-threatening prison conditions; the detention of political prisoners; lack of investigation into and accountability for violence against women; and widespread corruption at all levels in the government.[xii] The report also states that: \u201c[d]espite government efforts to address abuses, a lack of accountability for official misconduct persisted at all levels of government, contributing to widespread impunity.\u201d[xiii] A 2022 Human Rights Watch report at item 2.3 states that \u201callegations of torture and extrajudicial killings persisted with the National Human Rights Commission registering 143 deaths in police custody and 104 alleged extrajudicial killings in the first nine months in 2021.\u201d Further, this report states that the BJP \u201cgovernment\u2019s \u2018zero tolerance policy\u2019 on crime led to an increase in police killings\u201d and that \u201cthe authorities continued to use section 197 of the Criminal Procedure Code, which requires government approval to prosecute police officials, to block accountability even in cases of serious abuses\u201d.[xiv] Item 9.9. indicates that although India has strict laws and procedures to protect against police torture and ensure accountability, it is \u201cvery difficult\u201d to produce evidence against the police in cases of custodial crimes.[xv]\n[22] A 2018 report at item 10.8 on encounter killings describes the timeline of how they typically occur. The report states that:\n\u201cIn overwhelming majority of cases, the victims of fake encounter deaths are first targeted either as insurgent\/terrorist, sympathiser or supporter of insurgents\/ terrorists or as wanted criminals with bounty on their heads. The targets are detained or taken into custody, interrogated, and tortured to extract confession or leads, and thereafter, killed in a staged encounter, often by planting a weapon on the persons killed to show the firing in self defense or to prevent fleeing. Fake encounters are also carried out for revenge, settle rivalries or disputes, not giving bribe, promotion or gallantry awards or simply trigger-happy nature of the law enforcement personnel.\u201d[xvi]\nThe history of the principal claimant\u2019s interaction with the Punjab police largely follows this common structure. The principal claimant testified that after his first detention, he was forced to continue monthly reporting to the police, and after some time he was given the option to pay a bribe to stop reporting, which he did. After his second detention, he was told to continue his monthly reporting, to which he did not ever comply. Given the claimants\u2019 history with police and the country evidence above, I find that there is a reasonable chance that if the principal claimant returned to India, he would face persecution by the Punjab police, not only through his risk of further detention based on his imputed political opinion, but also through risk of a staged encounter killing from police due to revenge or a failure to provide a bribe for him to be able to stop reporting to police, which was a condition of his release when arrested for his political opinion.\n[23] With respect to gender-based violence, a 2019 OECD report at item 5.6 states that \u201cwomen in India face many barriers to their safety and protection from physical, sexual and psychological violence. Rape, domestic violence, dowry-related deaths, honor killings and sexual harassment pose serious threats to women\u2019s physical integrity in Indian society.\u201d[xvii] Sexual violence including rape is \u201cwidespread across the country\u201d in public and private spaces, and women are seen as vulnerable and \u201ceasy targets.\u201d[xviii] Rape by police officers is \u201cwidespread and conducted with impunity.\u201d[xix] NGOs stated that the number of rapes committed in police custody was underestimated, and \u201csome rape victims were unwilling to report crimes due to social stigma and the possibility of retribution, compounded by a perception of a lack of oversight and accountability, especially if the perpetrator was a police officer or other official.\u201d[xx] Further, this report confirms that \u201crape is\u2026underreported in India largely because of social stigma, victim-blaming, poor response by the criminal justice system, and lack of any national victim and witness protection law making them highly vulnerable to pressure from the accused as well as the police\u201d.[xxi] Survivors of rape are frequently blamed by the community and by authorities for the attack, and suffer shame and stigmatization as a result.[xxii] Thus, not only is the spouse at risk of further gender-based violence from police, as she experienced previously, she is at risk of suffering from the stigma and its affect that would follow her within Indian society.\n[24] While the claimants testified that they were unaware of any formal charges laid against them, the principal claimant testified that on both occasions of arrests, the police took his fingerprints, photographs, and signatures. The claimants also testified that they were in a high stress state after receiving beatings and being abused by police. The associate claimant, when asked if she saw the police enter any information about her in their digital system, stated that she did not see anything because she was scared and afraid and when they started beating her, her attention did not go anywhere else. When asked the same question, the principal claimant stated that the purpose of the Punjab police was to beat him, take money from him and make him scared, and that he kept requesting that they provide him with the evidence that they had against him, but they refused. Counsel submitted that with the signatures, fingerprints, and photographs the police took, they would be able to lay false charges against the claimants. In the claimants\u2019 documentary evidence at exhibit 7 there is an article from The Hindu stating that FIRs may be lodged or criminal proceedings may be initiated without a police diary entry\u2014essentially, without a corresponding entry of a civilian complaint or any information regarding the arrest of an individual. While I find that predicting the police\u2019s capacity or willingness to lay future false charges against the claimants is speculative, I have also considered the following findings: the allegations made against the claimants by police; the extensive documentary evidence regarding high levels of police corruption throughout India;[xxiii] that the police took the abovementioned claimant\u2019s fingerprints, photographs, and signatures; that the principal claimant was forced to continue reporting to the police station; that the police were monitoring either the claimants, their home, or their family members; and that the police were able to track the claimants to Chandigarh through unknown means. In light of these findings, I further find that the Punjab police, on a balance of probabilities, created an FIR against the principal claimant, after which the objective evidence at NDP item 10.2 indicates that his information would be entered into the national CCTNS database.[xxiv]\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution\n[25] The evidence presented in the associate claimant\u2019s testimony and the documentary evidence is less clear regarding the associate and minor claimants\u2019 forward-facing persecution from the Punjab police. Additionally, I previously found that there was insufficient credible evidence to establish that the XXXX XXXX presented a forward-facing motivation to find the associate claimant or to target any of the claimants for further extortion. The associate and minor claimants\u2019 BOC forms indicated that they wished to rely on the narrative and allegations outlined by their father, the principal claimant. The spouse and principal claimants testified that they feared the arrest, beatings, false allegations, and questioning that happened to them by the Punjab police would also happen to their children if they returned to India. They also testified that the minor claimant, if she were to become a victim of the police, would face the additional risk of gender-based violence at the hands of police.\n[26] The associate claimant testified that he had never received a direct threat from police, but he had witnessed the police coming to his home many times and saying abusive words to his parents. His knowledge of why the police had accused his parents of crimes, their arrest, and release was limited. I find that with respect to Guideline 3 this level of knowledge is in keeping with his profile, as he was 12 years old when these events occurred. I find that as the associate claimant is now an adult and his claim is based on a nexus to a particular social group by way of his association to the principal claimant, it is reasonable to conclude that his mother and the Punjab police\u2019s treatment of her as a result of her relationship to the principal claimant are reflective of a similarly situated person to the associate claimant. The Punjab police had no evidence against the spouse and the claimants testified that the police did not make any criminal allegations against her. Yet, they detained, beat, and sexually assaulted her merely due to her association with the principal claimant. Additionally, the claimants\u2019 allegations stated that the police were monitoring them and accused the principal claimant of involvement with drugs and militancy due to his association with his son-in-law. Similarly, I found the claimants\u2019 allegation that the police beat and questioned the principal claimant\u2019s mother to be credible. In light of these findings, I find that the associate and minor claimants in their current circumstances would reasonably be at risk of similar treatment by the Punjab police as that previously experienced by their mother, father, and grandmother. I also find that as the minor claimant is a woman, her risk if she were detained or questioned by police includes a risk of sexual violence, similar to that experienced by her mother. I, therefore, find that these claimants have established a well-founded fear of persecution.\n[27] Based on the totality of the evidence, I find that all the claimants have established a well-founded fear of persecution or forward-facing risk if they were to return to India. This finding is made based on all the evidence before me, including the claimants\u2019 testimony that the Punjab police have continued to search for them, as well as the objective evidence regarding police corruption, abuse, and treatment of those accused of involvement with drugs and militants in India.\nState Protection\n[28] The state is presumed capable of protecting its citizens except in situations where the state is in complete breakdown. To rebut this presumption, a claimant must establish on a balance of probabilities through clear and convincing evidence that their state\u2019s protection is inadequate. I find that the claimants have rebutted this presumption.\n[29] The agent of persecution in this claim is an agent of the state. The US Department of State report describes India as a parliamentary democracy where civilian authorities maintained effective control over security forces.[xxv] This report also indicates widespread corruption at all levels in the Indian government and extrajudicial killings and degrading treatment or punishment perpetrated by the police.[xxvi] A 2022 Freedom House report gives India a score of 2 out of 4 for both due process and protection against illegitimate use of force.[xxvii] The report indicates that due process rights are not consistently upheld, and corruption and bribery within the police remains a problem. The report also indicates that torture, abuse, and rape by law enforcement and security officials have been reported.[xxviii]\n[30] NDP item 10.12 indicates that the state of Punjab has a Vigilance department, a Police Complaints Authority, and a Human Rights Commission that are responsible for anti-corruption measures. Sources in the RIR indicate concerns with the adequacy of the various organizations. For example, the Human Rights Commission was described as having little credibility and being more or less defunct due to lack of proper infrastructure and staff to handle the complaints and notes that most of the complaints are against the Punjab police. Similarly, the report states that the Police Complaints Authority in 2017 disposed of 52 complaints against the police and that in all closed complaints no police officer was found at fault.[xxix]\n[31] The claimants did testify to the fact that their daughter XXXX, who remained in India, successfully sought police protection when she made a complaint after the police harassed her for information about the claimants. I asked the principal claimant why he had not complained about police if there were effective systems for police complaints in India, and he stated that the police had taken his fingerprints, signature, and photos along with accusing him of involvement with militants and drug traffickers; on the other hand, his daughter was not accused of anything, lived independently from the claimants, and the police had no documentation or evidence against her. Consequently, the particulars of her situation were different from those of the claimants, and given the actions the police had taken against them, he did not feel safe making a complaint about police. I find this explanation to be reasonable in the claimants\u2019 particular circumstances. Based on the country conditions noted above regarding evidence of widespread corruption, lack of adequate police oversight, and that an agent of harm is the Punjab police, I find that there is no operationally effective state protection available to the claimants in their circumstances.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[32] There is a two-part test to determine whether an internal flight alternative (IFA) exists. I must be satisfied (a) that there is no serious possibility of the claimant being persecuted on a Convention ground, or, on the balance of probabilities, being subject personally to a danger of torture or to a risk to their life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in the IFA and (b) that conditions in that part of the country, are such that it would be reasonable, in all the circumstances, including those particular to the claimant, for them to seek refuge there. Once an IFA is raised, the onus is on the claimants to show that they do not have an IFA. At the outset of the hearing, I proposed Mumbai and Bengaluru as potential IFAs. For the reasons below, I find that the claimants do not have an IFA available to them.\nMotivation\n[33] The principal claimant testified that after his first arrest, the second arrest occurred months later at the time that XXXXcame to visit their home. Counsel submits that this demonstrates that the police were monitoring the claimants\u2019 home. I find that the police entered the claimants\u2019 home and arrested the principal claimant and spouse on this occasion due to their monitoring of either the claimants\u2019 home or the claimants themselves or their close family members, including their son-in-law. Regardless of whether the police were monitoring the claimants, their home, or their family members, I find that this demonstrates that the Punjab police had a significant interest and motivation in tracking the claimants and their family. The principal claimant testified that after they left to Chandigarh, which he testified was 80 kms away from their village, the local police who had arrested them continued looking for them. I found that the claimants previously established this fact, including that the police raided the home of the individual they initially stayed with in Chandigarh after the claimants had left to stay in the Gurdwara. Further, I find that the claimants established that the police questioned and beat the principal claimant\u2019s mother, who lived in Chhattisgarh, when they came looking for the principal claimant. The principal claimant also testified that a friend who they continue to communicate with informed them that as recently as six weeks ago the police continued to look for them in their local village. I find this to be credible. The principal claimant stated that with the formation of a new government, the police are looking for them more diligently, as the police wish to close their open cases. An article published in the RF Issue Brief at exhibit 6 speaks to the increased war on drugs and crime arising from the region\u2019s current leadership since 2019. I find this testimony to be credible as there is no reason to doubt its veracity and it is objectively corroborated.\n[34] While I acknowledge that the claimants did not testify to having relatives in the proposed IFA locations of Mumbai or Bengaluru, I find that the Punjab police\u2019s efforts to locate the claimants through their relatives in multiple provinces in India is indicative of their desire to use the resources available to them to find the claimants throughout India, including Mumbai and Bengaluru if the claimants were to relocate there. As the Federal Court has established, \u201cthere is no onus on a claimant to personally test the viability of an IFA before seeking protection in Canada.\u201d[xxx] Thus, I find that the fact that the claimants did not previously attempt to live in Mumbai or Bengaluru, and consequently do not allege that the Punjab police attempted to find them in Mumbai or Bengaluru, is not indicative of the police\u2019s forward-facing motivation to find them in these IFA locations. I find that the fact that the police searched for the claimants while they were in India only through their previously known locations and family members does not place restrictions on where the Punjab police would be motivated to find the claimants if they were to return to India. Rather, I find that the efforts made to search for them in multiple locations, including multiple provinces, speaks to a high level of motivation to find the principal claimant and spouse throughout India.\n[35] The principal claimant also testified that the police harassed his daughter XXXX who remains living in India while asking for information about the claimants\u2019 whereabouts, but she then filed a complaint against the police, and they stopped bothering her. However, he later testified that the police continued coming to visit her home roughly every two weeks. I asked the principal claimant why he stated previously that the police no longer harassed his daughter after she effectively filed a complaint against them, and he stated that after she married, they believed that they could defame her and their family name, so they continued visiting her and asking questions about the claimants. I find that that this explanation does not reasonably explain the discrepancy in the principal claimant\u2019s testimony on this fact, and that the claimants failed to establish with credible evidence that the police continue to visit their daughter XXXX in India to ask about them. However, the totality of the evidence establishing the principal claimant and spouse\u2019s allegations that the Punjab police continue to look for them with other relatives in other cities and within their local village outweighs the insufficient, inconsistent evidence in establishing that the police continued to visit their daughter in India to ask about them. Consequently, I find that the documentary evidence and findings made regarding the police\u2019s attempt to locate the principal claimant and spouse in various locations throughout India, including their local village in Punjab, Chandigarh, and Chhattisgarh, establishes that the police remain motivated to find these claimants.\n[36] The associate claimant testified that he had not yet completed secondary school and continued to study. The minor claimant is also currently a student. The principal claimant and spouse testified to the fact that they would not be living apart from their children if they were to return to India, as both the associate and minor claimants remain dependent upon their parents. Consequently, I find that as I found the police remain motivated to find the principal claimant and spouse, and the associate and minor claimant would be living with the principal claimant and spouse, the associate and minor claimant would also be at risk of detention and mistreatment by police if they were to be found by police due to their association with their father. Further, the minor claimant\u2019s risk if her parents were arrested would increase from her profile as a young, vulnerable, single woman, which the Indian NDP largely demonstrates is a high-risk profile in India,[xxxi] and it would be unreasonable to expect her to live in India in these circumstances. Therefore, I find that while the police may not have expressed motivation to find the associate and minor claimants until today, their association with their parents\u2014the principal claimant and spouse\u2014makes them similarly at risk from the Punjab police if their parents were to be found, for which I find that the Punjab police have demonstrated motivation.\nMeans\n[37] The principal claimant testified that he no longer has an Indian national identity document (ID), that he could not rent accommodation in Bengaluru, Mumbai, or anywhere in India without this ID, that he could not find employment without this ID, and that he is unwilling to obtain a new identity document because the process of doing so would bring their location to the attention of the local Punjab police who are searching for them. The spouse and associate claimant stated that they agreed with his testimony and did not have anything further to add. Similarly, counsel submitted that the Punjab police would be able to locate the claimants when they went to rent accommodation through the tenant verification system using CCTNS. As I previously found that an FIR against the principal claimant was, on a balance of probabilities, created by the Punjab police and his information was consequently entered into a national database, I find that there is a reasonable chance the police would use this national database to find the claimants. The claimants also provided an extensive amount of documentary evidence regarding the rapidly expanding use of surveillance cameras throughout India, including information that Delhi, Chennai, and Mumbai are within the top 10 cities with the most surveillance in the world and that India is a policing superpower.[xxxii]\n[38] NDP item 10.13, indicates that India established the CCTNS system to connect the thousands of police stations across India for the purpose of collecting and sharing information on crime and criminals. The RIR quotes a source indicating that as of October 2020, 15,620 of the 16,098 police stations have had the CCTNS system deployed. The report also indicates that 81 percent of data for police stations is synced with the CCTNS system on the same day and that 91 percent of old information has been migrated to the system. The RIR also indicates that Punjab is listed as one of the top three states with most access to the CCTNS system. As of December 2020, police and law enforcement agencies across India can search details of any case registered. The DFAT report at item 1.5 indicates that \u201cif a person of interest is being sought by another state, the states would work together in securing the arrest of that person\u201d and that \u201cthere is a good degree of cooperation between state police services\u201d.\n[39] Additionally, item 10.13 states that one of the uses of the CCTNS system is with respect to the verification of tenants. The report notes that the state of Punjab is one of the states that often replies promptly to tenant verification requests.[xxxiii] Item 14.8 describes how the tenant registration process is being used with the CCTNS system to verify whether the person had any criminal involvement or is absconding from the police in another state in India.\n[40] As I previously found, the Punjab police have tried to locate the claimants through their associates and family in India\u2014in the village where the claimants used to reside in Punjab, in Chandigarh, and in the province of Chhattisgarh, where the principal claimant\u2019s family lives. The police were able to successfully track the claimants\u2019 location when they were in Chandigarh, along with contacting their family members in another province. It is well established in the Federal Court that a claimant does not have to cut themselves off from their family in order to live safely in an IFA.[xxxiv] Given the efforts of the Punjab police, I find that if the claimants were to return to India and stay in contact with their family, that there is a serious possibility that the Punjab police may be able to locate the claimants through both their family members and the surveillance systems throughout the country, including the CCTNS. For the abovementioned reasons, I find that the Punjab police have the means to locate the claimants throughout India.\n[41] Given the country condition documents indicating the widespread use of the CCTNS and surveillance systems, the corruption previously noted within the police in India, the continuing motivation to locate the claimants demonstrated by the Punjab police, including through the claimants\u2019 family, I find that the claimants would face a serious possibility of persecution in Mumbai, Bengaluru, and throughout India.\n[42] Since I have found that the claimants face a serious possibility of persecution in the proposed IFA locations and throughout India, I find it unnecessary to consider whether it would be objectively reasonable under the second prong. As such, I find that the claimants do not have a viable IFA.\nCONCLUSION\n[43] I find that the claimants are Convention refugees and accept their claims.\n(signed) Kylee Carreno\nDecember 13, 2022\n\n[i] Immigration and Refugee Protection Act,S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n[ii] Refugee Protection Division Rules, SOR\/2012-256.\n\n[iii] Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (IRB) Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 4: Gender Considerations in Proceedings before the Immigration and Refugee Board, updated July 18, 2022.\n\n[iv] Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (IRB) Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 3: Child Refugee Claimants: Procedural and Evidentiary Issues, effective September 30, 1996.\n\n[v] Exhibit 2.\n\n[vi] Exhibit 1.\n\n[vii] Maldonado v.

Sherritt\nCountry: Lebanon\nRPD Number: VC2-05006\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2022-01960\nATIP Pages: N\/A\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: This is the decision of the Refugee Protection Division in the claim of XXXX XXXX, a Lebanese national claiming protection in Canada pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] The claimant\u2019s allegations are contained in full in his Basis of Claim Form, his detailed narratives, and testimony at the hearing.\n[3] Summarized only briefly, the claimant alleges he faces persecution in Lebanon from Hezbollah due to his refusal to join or support the organization and the threats he faced from the organization as a result.\nDETERMINATION\n[4] I find the claimant is a Convention refugee. I find the claimant has established a nexus to the Convention ground of political opinion. I have, therefore, assessed this claim under section 96 of the Act.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[5] I find the claimant\u2019s identity is established on a balance of probabilities by his testimony and by the other evidence before me, which includes copies of his passports in Exhibit 1.\nCredibility\n[6] The claimant benefits from a presumption that his allegations are true. I found the claimant to be a credible witness today and I have no reason to doubt the claimant\u2019s truthfulness.\n[7] The claimant testified in a spontaneous, forthcoming, and detailed manner. The claimant did not embellish his claim. I identified no relevant inconsistencies, omissions, or contradictions between his testimony and the other evidence before me.\n[8] The claimant also provided documentary evidence that supports and corroborates various aspects of his claim. These documents can be found in Exhibits 4 and 5. This includes education and employment letters, including for employment in the UAE, and corroborating the cancellation of his work and status in that country, and numerous detailed supporting letters corroborating the claimant\u2019s allegations of harm. I have no reason to doubt the authenticity of any of these documents. I assign these documents weight as they help establish the material elements of the claimant\u2019s allegations.\n[9] I will just note that the claimant did reside in the UAE for a significant period of time and I have considered whether he has ever had status or access to status in the UAE that would be comparable to that of citizens of permanent residents of that country. I find he has not. The claimant was in the UAE on a work permit and his status was contingent on his employment. He has since lost his employment and his status has expired. While I note his wife remains in the UAE and is working, she, too, is a Lebanese national and in the UAE on temporary status of her own. I find the claimant\u2019s status, real or potential, has been at all times temporary and subject to cancellation.\n[10] Ultimately, I find the claimant has established that he has been and continues to be pursued by the Hezbollah in Lebanon. I find the claimant has established his subjective fears on a balance of probabilities.\nObjective basis\n[11] There is documentary evidence before me that supports the claimant\u2019s fears of persecution from Hezbollah in Lebanon, all of which can be found in the National Documentation Package (NDP) in Exhibit 3. I will go through a few.\n[12] According to Item 1.3 of the NDP for Lebanon, Hezbollah is a prominent political party and powerful player in Lebanon\u2019s economy, politics, and media. The armed component of Hezbollah is the most significant and heavily armed Lebanese militia. This document states that Hezbollah has the effective control over parts of South Lebanon, Southern Beirut, and The Beqaa Valley.\n[13] According to Item 7.9, Hezbollah is a Shia political and militant organization in Lebanon that has evolved from being a militant group fighting against Israel to an established political party in Lebanon with active political and military wings.\n[14] Also according to Item 7.9 of the NDP, Hezbollah has been deemed a terrorist group by the Canadian government and according to Item 7.8 Hezbollah is considered the most powerful force in Lebanon\u2019s parliament. Hezbollah maintains an excessive network of social services throughout Lebanon to build popular support. There are multiple articles regarding a number of people who have been targeted throughout 2019.\n[15] Item 1.3 of the NDP states that Hezbollah starts with societal pressure or persuasion and then moves to social marginalization and eventually resorting to direct threats and violence if they feel their power is genuinely threatened. Further, in areas under Hezbollah\u2019s control they are a defective government and Lebanese government are unable to enforce law and order. Sources also state that Shia community members, like the claimant, are not able to criticize Hezbollah without fear of consequences such as harassment, intimidation, financial pressure, and exclusion from Hezbollah services like health and education. This can all be found at Items 1.3 and 7.8.\n[16] Ultimately, I find the evidence before me regarding the issues with Hezbollah in Lebanon reasonably applies to the claimant\u2019s situation and establishes the claimant\u2019s allegations. On an objective basis, I find the claimant\u2019s fear of persecution in Lebanon is well-founded and forward-facing.\nState protection and internal flight alternative\n[17] In this case I find the presumption of state protection has been rebutted. There is political interference and bribery in the country which is a noted problem in the documents in the NDP.\n[18] According to Item 9.1 of the NDP, police do not provide adequate protection to those who receive death threats.\n[19] Items 1.3 and 7.8 of the NDP confirm that government forces are unable to enforce the law in areas controlled by Hezbollah.\n[20] The evidence before me in the NDP also confirms that Hezbollah is in part part of the state. Therefore, I find there is no reasonable state protection available to the claimant who continues to be relentlessly pursued and threatened by Hezbollah in Lebanon.\n[21] Further, I have also considered whether there is a viable internal flight alternative for the claimant in Lebanon. Sources in the NDP, including at Items 1.3, 7.8, 2.1, and 7.4, state that individuals identified as being opposed to Hezbollah, like the claimant, are unlikely to avoid societal discrimination through internal relocation. Hezbollah appears to have reached throughout all of Lebanon. Hezbollah uses various methods to obtain information about perceived adversaries, just like the claimant. They have informer networks. They engage in telephone and internet monitoring. Further, sources in the objective evidence state that Hezbollah are able to locate wanted individuals throughout all of Lebanon.\n[22] It is also worth noting at Item 1.3 the airport in Lebanon is located in South Beirut where Hezbollah has significant control and the airport itself is significantly controlled by Hezbollah.\n[23] Therefore, for these reasons noted above, I find there is no viable internal flight alternative for the claimant in all of Lebanon.\nCONCLUSION\n[24] Based on the above analysis, I find the claimant is a Convention refugee. His claim is, therefore, accepted.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

I have also reviewed and applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline on Gender Considerations and Proceedings Before the Immigration and Refugee Board.\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] The claimants fear a risk to their lives from the Russian army and Russian supporters if they were to return to Ukraine. Principal Claimant is 77 years old, and the associate claimant is 84. The claimants from Dnipro in Ukraine. On February 24th, 2022, Russia began a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The claimants\u2019 town was bombed at the start of the war. The claimants spent most of their time in a bomb shelter. The associate claimant became extremely ill due to the lack of water, food, and medicine. The claimants\u2019 home has been damaged in the conflict. On XXXX XXXX, 2022, the claimants took a refugee train from XXXX XXXX XXXX, Poland. On XXXX XXXX, 2022, the claimants flew to Canada because they have family here in Canada. The claimants both have significant health issues. For example, the principal claimant is taking medication for her high blood pressure and kidney problems. The associate claimant has problems breathing, significant mobility issues and is scheduled to have heart surgery on XXXX XXXX, 2022.\nDETERMINATION\n[3] I find that the claimants are Convention refugees.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[4] The claimants\u2019 identities as citizens of Ukraine has been established on a balance of probabilities by their Ukrainian passports located at Exhibit 1 as well as by their testimony.\nNexus\n[5] The claimants fear persecution from the invading Russian army due to their Ukrainian nationality. Counsel for the claimants provided a sanitized RPD decision from January 30th, 2022 that is located at Exhibit 7. That decision provides for a detailed argument for why the current situation in Ukraine demonstrates that the claimants have a nexus to the Convention ground based on their nationalities. While other RPD decisions are not binding on me, the Federal Court has directed that administrative decisionmakers and reviewing courts alike must be concerned with a general consistency of administrative decisions as those affected by administrative decisions are entitled to expect that like cases will be generally treated alike and that outcomes will not depend merely on the identity of the individual decisionmaker. I do find that the decision at Exhibit 7 is persuasive, and I adopt the reasoning with respect to nexus to the Convention grounds due to the claimants\u2019 Ukrainian nationality. And based on that analysis, I do find that the allegations before me support a nexus to the Convention grounds for the claimants based on their nationality as Ukrainians. In addition, the claimants\u2019 allegations also support a nexus to the Convention ground based on membership in a particular social group as elderly persons with chronic health issues. Further, the principal claimant\u2019s allegations also support a nexus to the Convention grounds based on their membership in a particular social group as a woman.\nCredibility\n[6] I find that the claimants are credible witnesses. In making that finding, I am relying on the principle that a claimant who affirms to tell the truth creates a presumption of truthfulness unless there are reasons to doubt their truthfulness. The principal claimant provided the majority of the testimony, and she was able to testify clearly about their fears of returning to Ukraine. The principal claimant explained their health issues and the associate claimant\u2019s mobility issues and how they have no support or family left in the country. The principal claimant described the mental difficulties she faced when living in the bomb shelter for almost a month and also the physical pain that caused them. The principal claimant described their fears in the Russian army and fascist groups and spoke in details about how their home was invaded, how food and clothing were stolen and how their dog was unfortunately killed. Finally, the claimants testified that their pensions were their only source of income. The associate claimant confirmed the principal claimant\u2019s testimony and also spoke about the risks to him from stress due to his health.\n[7] In addition, the claimant provided personal documents to support their claims, which are found at Exhibits 4 and 9. Personal documents consist of identity documents and documents related to the associate claimant\u2019s health conditions. I have no reason to doubt the genuineness of these documents. I find that given the claimants\u2019 credible testimony, documents and the country condition documents discussed below, that they have established on a balance of probabilities the facts alleged in their claims, including a subjective fear of returning to Ukraine.\nObjective Basis\n[8] The country condition documents for Ukraine in the National Documentation Package, which is found at Exhibit 3, supports the claimants\u2019 fears of returning to the country. For example, a report from May 2022 at Item 1.13 called an Independent Legal Analysis of the Russian Federation\u2019s Breaches of the Genocide Convention in Ukraine and the Duty to Prevent states that \u201c(1), reasonable grounds to believe Russia is responsible for direct and public incitement to commit genocide, and a pattern of atrocities from which an inference of intent to destroy the Ukrainian national group in part can be drawn and (2), the existence of a serious risk of genocide in Ukraine, triggering the legal obligation of all States to prevent genocide.\u201d The report provides examples of what I described says \u201cgenocidal pattern of destruction targeting Ukrainians\u201d. Those examples include mass killings, deliberate attacks on shelters and humanitarian routes, deliberate inflicting life-threatening conditions by targeting vital infrastructure, indiscriminate bombardment of residential areas, rape and sexual violence and the forcible transfer of Ukrainians.\n[9] With respect to gender-based violence, I find that the country condition documents indicate that the principal claimant would face an increased risk due to her gender. This finding is supported by an April 2022 report on sexual violence and the Ukraine conflict at Item 5.3 that states that since the Russian invasion in February 2022, there have been numerous reports of Russian soldiers sexually assaulting women. The report indicates that Russian soldiers have been deliberately targeting women and children after Ukraine did not surrender. In addition, there are reports that women including senior citizens were gangraped and, in some instances, killed. These reports of gender-based violence are also found in other parts of the National Documentation Package such as a Human Rights Watch report from April 3rd, 2022, which is found at Item 1.24 and the May 2022 CARE International Report at Item 5.6.\n[10] With respect to the claimants\u2019 age and health issues, a recent report in the National Documentation Package at Item 1.30 also indicates that there have been deliberate Russian attacks on health facilities in Ukraine. This report indicates that medical supplies across many parts of Ukraine are running low, especially in conflict-affected areas as access to many locations remain blocked. A report of social security and the war at Item 1.19 indicates that recipients of social security such as the claimants are in a vulnerable position. The report also indicates that Russia has been specifically targeting social infrastructure, particularly social care institutions. Finally, a report from the organization for security and cooperation in Europe, which is found at Item 2.7, indicates that there is evidence that Russian soldiers have targeted older persons intentionally. The report also notes that the destruction of social security system or the impossibility to get access to payment points constitutes a serious threat to the life for those such as the claimants who rely on their pension for income.\n[11] The claimant also provided country condition documents which are found at Exhibits 5 and 6. For example, Exhibit 6 contains nine (9) articles highlighting war crimes committed by Russia since the start of the invasion and reports an article as describing the Russian attacks as genocide against Ukrainians.\n[12] Based on the totality of the evidence, I find that the claimants have established a well-founded fear of persecution. Further, given the ongoing Russian invasion and that the claimants area has been attacked by Russia in the past, I find that the claimants face a serious forward-facing possibility of persecution if they were to return.\nState Protection\n[13] I have considered whether adequate state protection is available for the claimants, and I find that there is none. The claimants fear violence from the invading Russian army. While the Ukrainian state is attempting to provide protection from the Russian attack, there is great uncertainty about the level of protection a state will be able to provide. As such, I find that there is no operationally effective state protection available to the claimants in their circumstances.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[14] I have also considered whether the claimants would have a viable internal flight alternative available to them and I find that they do not. The principal claimant testified that there is nowhere in the country where they could go and be safe and how they have no family or anyone else in Ukraine to support them if they were to return. Given the ongoing crisis in Ukraine related to the Russian invasion that is affecting the entire country, I find it would be unreasonable for the claimants in these circumstances to try to seek refuge elsewhere in the country. This is reflected in the March 2022 UNHCR report on returns to Ukraine, which is found at Item 1.23, that states that \u201cIn view of the volatility of the situation in the entire territory of Ukraine, UNHCR does not consider it appropriate to deny international protection to Ukrainians and former habitual residents of Ukraine on the basis of an internal flight or relocation alternative.\u201d Further, a June 2022 report at Item 1.10 indicates that there are more than eight (8) million internally displaced persons in Ukraine. The report highlights numerous challenges facing the internally displaced persons, including the lack of accommodation, shortages of food, water and energy supplies, and barriers to accessing financial social support and house services. As such, I find that the claimants do not have a viable internal flight alternative available to them.\nCONCLUSION\n[15] For the reasons above, I determine that the claimants are Convention refugees pursuant to section 96 of the Act and the Board, therefore, accepts their claims. Given I am granting protection under section 96 of the Act, I find it unnecessary to consider their claims under section 97.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

The claimant intermittently worked as a XXXX XXXX in the United Arab Emirates from 2005 to 2018. During his time in the Emirates, the claimant was issued temporary work visas from his employer, and had no permanent status or residency in the Emirates.\n[4] In XXXX 2015, a violent incident between terrorists and the Punjab police took place in the claimant\u2019s home village. The claimant stated that the police arrested the claimant, who was not involved in the incident, as the police were aware of the claimant\u2019s work history in the Emirates. The claimant stated that since the Emirates is an Islamic nation, the police suspected that the claimant was involved in the attack. In custody, the claimant was beaten and had his fingerprints, photographs, and signatures taken by the police. The claimant was kept in custody for three days and was able to be released after the claimant\u2019s family provided the police with a bribe.\n[5] Following this incident, the claimant returned to Dubai and resumed his work as XXXX XXXX XXXX. In XXXX 2016, the claimant returned to India to visit his family. The claimant indicated that although he returned to India despite the incident in XXXX 2015 as he thought that the incident with the police was an isolated incident, and that the police would have had arrested the individuals responsible for the terrorist attack. The claimant indicated that he thought all suspicion surrounding him would have been cleared at that point.\n[6] However, in XXXX 2016, the claimant was arrested by the police again. The police detained the claimant from his home and made allegations that the claimant was assisting Sikh militants and that he was traveling to Pakistan using fake identity documents. The police further alleged that the claimant was assisting the Sikh militants financially. The police took the claimant\u2019s fingerprints, photographs, and signatures again. The claimant\u2019s family provided the police with another bribe, and the claimant was able to be released. Upon release, the claimant was instructed to report to the police before he travels out of India and again when he returns.\n[7] In XXXX 2016, the claimant returned to the Emirates to resume his employment. When in the Emirates, the claimant began to grow fearful of his eventual return to India as the nature of his employment in the Emirates was temporary. The claimant feared that should his employment be terminated in the Emirates, he would have to return to India as his status in the Emirates was dependent on his employment. The claimant contacted an agent in India, who began to prepare a Canadian visa for the claimant.\n[8] In XXXX 2018, the claimant was informed by his agent that in order to finalize his visa application, he would have to return to India. In the same month, the claimant traveled back to India and provided his agent with his passport, photographs, and payment in order to secure his visa. Upon return, the claimant presented himself at the police station as the police demanded.\n[9] On XXXX XXXX, 2018, the claimant was summoned to the police station. The police instructed the claimant that he will be sent to Pakistan to join a militant group, and to send all information he receives back to the Punjab police. The claimant reported this to the district commissioner in Kapurthala on XXXX XXXX, 2018, who promised the claimant that he would investigate the matter.\n[10] On XXXX XXXX, 2018, the police attended the claimant\u2019s home while the claimant was not present. The police stated that the claimant was making false allegations against them, and proceeded to threaten the claimant\u2019s wife in order to locate the claimant. When the claimant discovered that the police had attended his home, the claimant fled to his uncle\u2019s home in Delhi in order to hide. The claimant also contacted his agent who provided him with other hiding locations within Delhi. Eventually, the claimant fled India in XXXX 2018.\n[11] The claimant indicated that approximately five months after arriving in Canada, he has become a public supporter of Khalistan. The claimant stated that he has participated in pro-Khalistan rallies and referendums since his arrival in Canada.\nDETERMINATION\n[12] I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the Act.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[13] I find that the claimant\u2019s personal identity and his identity as a citizen of India has been established on a balance of probabilities by the claimant\u2019s testimony and a copy of his Indian passport on file.[iii]\nNexus\n[14] For a claimant to be considered a Convention refugee, the well-founded fear of persecution must be by reason of one or more of the five grounds enumerated under section 96 of the IRPA: race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion.\n[15] In this case, I find that the claimant\u2019s allegations establish a nexus to the Convention ground of political opinion, real or imputed, as the police allege that the claimant is affiliated with Khalistani militants. Therefore, I will assess this claim under section 96 of the Act.\nCredibility\n[16] The Federal Court has held in Maldonado that when a claimant swears to the truth of certain allegations, it creates a presumption that those allegations are true unless there is a reason to doubt their truthfulness.[iv] The presumption of truthfulness does not apply to inferences or speculation.\n[17] In this case, I have no reasons to doubt the truthfulness of the claimant. He testified in a straightforward and consistent manner, and answered all questions asked to him spontaneously. He did not appear to exaggerate or embellish his testimony.\n[18] Furthermore, the claimant submitted documentary evidence in support of his claim. The documents form parts of Exhibit 4, and contain the following:\nCorroborative affidavits from the claimant\u2019s wife, father, uncle in Delhi, and village decision-maker, all with accompanying identity documents;Medical report detailing the nature of the injuries and treatment given to the claimant in November 2015;The claimant\u2019s Khalistan Referendum voter registration card; andPhotographs of the claimant during a pro-Khalistan rally and photographs of the claimant\u2019s activities in a Sikh temple in Canada.[19] I have no reasons to doubt the genuineness of these documents and I accept them as genuine. As these documents relate to the central elements of the claimant\u2019s allegations, being that the Punjab police have targeted the claimant by alleging the claimant is affiliated with Khalistani terrorists, I assign significant weight to these documents in establishing the claimant\u2019s allegations as true.\n[20] Based on the claimant\u2019s straightforward testimony coupled with the documentary evidence noted above, I find the claimant to be a credible witness and accept the claimant\u2019s allegations in support of his claim to be true.\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution\n[21] Based on the claimant\u2019s testimony and the objective country conditions evidence as set out in the National Documentation Package (NDP), I find that the claimant has a well-founded fear of persecution from the police in India based on his imputed political opinion.\n[22] The claimant has suffered harm from the police due to his imputed political opinion as the Punjab police falsely alleged that the claimant was affiliated with Khalistani militants. The claimant indicated that these are false allegations, and that he has only begun to support the establishment of Khalistan after his arrival in Canada.\n[23] Country conditions documents in the NDP for India confirms that police corruption is widespread and that the police have broad arrest and detention rights. A report by the UK\u2019s Home Office[v] reports:\nThe USSD HR Report 2017 noted that \u2018Police may detain an individual without charge for up to 30 days, although an arrested person must be brought before a judge within 24 hours of arrest. Lengthy arbitrary detention remained a significant problem due to overburdened and under resourced court systems and a lack of legal safeguards. Arraignment of detainees must occur within 24 hours unless authorities hold the suspect under a preventive detention law.\n[24] A report by the US Department of State[vi] states the following regarding the prevalence of in-custody treatment:\nSignificant human rights issues included: unlawful and arbitrary killings, including extrajudicial killings perpetrated by police; torture and cases of cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment by some police and prison officials; arbitrary arrest and detention by government authorities; harsh and life-threatening prison conditions.\n\u2026 There were reports of abuse in prisons at the hands of guards and inmates, as well as reports that police raped female and male detainees.\n[25] Further, an RIR by the IRB[vii] on the treatment of perceived separatists or Khalistan supporters in and outside of the state of Punjab states the following:\n\u2026 the World Sikh Organization of Canada, an organization promoting the interests of Canadian Sikhs, stated that the \u201cgovernment, civil society and media vilify Sikhs advocating for Khalistan as extremists and militants by default\u201d \u2026 the government is \u201chostile\u201d to separatist movements.\nAccording to sources, the police \u201ckeep track of\u201d or \u201cmonitor\u201d Khalistan supporters\u2026 security services are more likely to focus on Sikh separatists because they represent \u201ca perceived political threat to the unity of India\u201d\u2026 Khalistan activists who participate in activities such as demonstrations, meetings or posting on social media will be monitored\u2026 individuals who move to another city will continue to be tracked since that information will be shared.\nAccording to the WSO representative, \u201csuspected supporters of Khalistan are not safe outside of Punjab, anywhere in India\u201d. The same source added that \u201cno Sikh can openly be an advocate for or support the creation of Khalistan\u201d and doing so results in harassment by police, false cases and also hatred of those who do not support Khalistan\u201d; the government portrays anyone supporting separatism as \u201can extremist or terrorist and as an \u2018anti-national\u2019 that can be legitimately targeted for violence\u201d.\n[26] I find that the claimant is an individual who has been falsely alleged and implicated by the police to be affiliated with extremists due to the claimant\u2019s frequent travel between India and the Emirates. Given the objective evidence listed above, which indicates that police in India act with impunity towards perceived Khalistan supporters, I find that the claimant would face a serious possibility of persecution should he return to India.\nState Protection\n[27] In all refugee claims, the state is presumed to be capable of protecting their citizens unless there is clear and convincing evidence to the contrary. A claimant who alleges that state protection is not available must persuade the Board, on a balance of probabilities, that the state would be unable or unwilling to offer protection.\n[28] Since the state is the agent of persecution in this case, I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant will not be able to access adequate state protection in his home country and that the presumption of state protection has been rebutted. I find that state protection would not be reasonably forthcoming for the claimant as the police are accusing the claimant of collaborating with militants, which resulted in the arrest, detention, and abuse of the claimant.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[29] The question then becomes whether the claimant could find safety in an internal flight alternative (IFA). At the outset of the hearing, I proposed Mumbai and Delhi as possible IFA locations.\n[30] Once the issue of an IFA has been raised, the onus is on the claimant to show that he or she does not have an IFA.[viii] To find a viable IFA, I must be satisfied that there is no serious possibility of the claimants being persecuted or, on the balance of probabilities, being subjected personally to a danger of torture or a risk to life or cruel and unusual punishment in the proposed IFA. Furthermore, the conditions in that part of the country are such that it would be reasonable in all the circumstances, including those particular to the claimants, to seek refuge there.\n[31] I find that the police still have continuing motivation to seek the claimant in India. It is the claimant\u2019s testimony, which I find to be true, that the police continue to visit the claimant\u2019s village and home in search of the claimant. Given the police\u2019s continued efforts to visit the claimant\u2019s home in search of the claimant despite the passage of time from the initial incident in XXXX 2015, I find that the police are still motivated to seek the claimant.\n[32] The question then becomes whether the police would have the means to locate the claimant in India should he return. Based on the objective evidence in the NDP, I find that the police would have the means to locate the claimant in India.\n[33] The objective evidence shows that anyone moving to another part of the country from their regular area of residence will have to undergo a background check when filling out an application for tenancy or lease. According to a Response to Information Request by the IRB,[ix] \u201csources describe tenant registration [or verification] as mandatory\u201d, and that \u201ctenant verification aims to detect criminal background, if any, and maintain a database on people living in a particular area\u201d. The report further states that \u201cthrough police verification, the history of any tenant can be verified whether the person had any criminal involvement or absconding from other states\u2019 police\u201d.\n[34] As part of the background checks used in verifying tenants, Indian authorities have access to a nationwide database known as the Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and Systems (CCTNS), which contains information on crime and criminals, police daily diary and general diary entries, as well as Integrated Investigation Forms (IIF).[x] It also interconnects police stations across the country.\n[35] According to an RIR, 97 percent of India\u2019s police stations are connected to the system. The CCTNS is also deployed in 95 percent of police stations nationwide; 81 percent of the data from police stations across India is synched with the CCTNS on the same day. Punjab, meanwhile, is among the states which report the most access to functioning CCTNS.[xi]\n[36] The claimant indicated that he was never presented with any formal paperwork from the police or has been informed by the police that an FIR has been lodged against him. However, according to an RIR[xii] by the IRB, the police \u201ckeep track of or monitor Khalistan supporters\u201d and that the \u201csecurity forces are more likely to focus on Sikh separatists because they represent a perceived political threat to the unity of India\u201d. The same RIR further mentions that individuals who move to another city will continue to be tracked since that information will be shared.\n[37] According to a researcher who studies digital policing in India, only a portion of the CCTNS records data come from FIRs; in addition, the system also captures the \u201c\u2018daily diary\u2019 or the \u2018general diary\u2019 (an account of the daily functioning of the police station).\u201d[xiii] Given such evidence, I find on a balance of probabilities that the claimant\u2019s encounters with the police in XXXX 2015, XXXX 2016, and XXXX 2018 were recorded as part of the police\u2019s daily or general diary, meaning they have a record of his stay there. As such, I find that it is more likely than not that the claimant\u2019s name would notify Punjab police should the claimant go through the tenant verification process in the proposed IFA locations.\n[38] Given the mandatory nature of tenant verification checks in India, coupled with the fact that personal information of Khalistan supporters, real or imputed, are tracked even to different cities, I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the police in India would have the means to locate the claimant in the proposed IFA cities.\n[39] Ultimately, I find that the IFA test fails on the first prong, and I find that no viable IFA exists for the claimant.\nCONCLUSION\n[40] For the foregoing reasons, I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the Act and I accept his claim.\n(signed) Kevin Kim\nOctober 11, 2022\n\n[i] Immigration and Refugee Protection Act,S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n\n[ii] Exhibit 2.\n\n[iii] Exhibit 1.\n\n[iv] Maldonado v.

His family belongs to the Chamar caste, which is a scheduled caste in India. He met a girl named XXXX at school in 2015 and they began to date. The two kept their relationship a secret because the claimant and his family are from a lower caste than XXXX and her family. The claimant traveled to Canada in XXXX 2017 for school and maintained a long-distance relationship with XXXX. When he returned in XXXX 2017, he decided to surprise XXXX at her workplace, however her brother caught them hugging. XXXX brother and his friends beat the claimant. The next day, the claimant and his mother went to XXXX house to convince her parents to allow the two to marry. Her family verbally and physically abused the claimant and he agreed to stop seeing XXXX.\n[5] On XXXX XXXX, 2017, XXXX came to the claimant\u2019s house alleging that her brother had seen intimate photos of them on her phone and that her family had beaten her. Shortly afterwards, XXXX family and the police arrived. When they discovered the claimant and XXXX together, the claimant was taken into custody. While in custody the police beat the claimant and threatened him to stay away from XXXX and her family. The claimant was released from custody on XXXX XXXX, 2017 after his mother paid a bribe. The claimant returned to Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2017.\n[6] In XXXX 2018, the claimant received a call from his mother stating that the police were looking for him; XXXX had disappeared, and they suspected that he was involved. At the start of the hearing, the claimant submitted a BOC amendment alleging that the police had started to accuse him of being anti-national and had visited his mother and relatives recently in search of him.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[7] I find that the claimant\u2019s identity as a national of India is established on a balance of probabilities by his sworn testimony and the copy of his Indian passport in evidence.[3]\nNexus\n[8] In order to satisfy the definition of a \u201cConvention refugee\u201d found in section 96 of the Act, a claimant must establish that he or she has a well-founded fear of persecution by reason of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion.\n[9] In this case, I find that the claimant\u2019s allegations have a connection to the Convention on the basis of ethnicity, as the claimant is a member of a scheduled caste, as well as political opinion, with relation to the police\u2019s current allegation that the claimant is anti-national. As such, I have assessed his claim pursuant to section 96 of the Act.\nCredibility\n[10] When a claimant affirms to tell the truth, this creates a presumption that his allegations are true unless there is reason to doubt their truthfulness. In this case I have found the claimant to be a credible witness. The claimant testified in a consistent and straightforward manner. While there were some concerns with material portions of his evidence at the outset of the hearing, I find that he was able to provide reasonable explanations for my concerns. I did however find the claimant to be speculative with regards to the reasons for the police\u2019s current search for him and their connection to XXXX and her family. I outline my findings in more detail below:\nSignificant Change to BOC\n[11] At the start of the hearing, the claimant submitted an addendum to his BOC stating that he was now wanted by the police because of allegations that he was anti-national. He also submitted affidavits from his mother, neighbour, cousin and uncle alleging that the police had been to their homes recently in search of the claimant and that they had alleged he was anti-national.[4] This is a significant change from the claimant\u2019s original BOC which focused on the threats that he faced due to his relationship with XXXX.\n[12] I questioned the claimant about the addendum. He told me that the police first made this accusation to his mother in XXXX 2022. Prior to this, they had approached his cousin in Rajasthan in XXXX 2021 and made the same allegation. The claimant does not know why the police are making this allegation. The police do not provide much detail other than saying that they believe he is an anti-national goon and that he has been instrumental in fights and riots. The claimant is not aware if the police have filed a First Instance Report against him or whether there is a warrant for his arrest.\n[13] I asked the claimant why he didn\u2019t update his BOC back in XXXX 2022 when he first found out about the situation. He indicated that he did not know that he had to mention this to his counsel, and thought it was something he would tell me about in the hearing. Given that the claimant testified that he did not mention this to his counsel earlier, I find it reasonable that he was not advised by his counsel that this was something that he should raise as soon as possible.\n[14] The claimant provided affidavits from his mother, neighbour, cousin and uncle in support of this allegation.[5] Each affidavit is consistent with the claimant\u2019s allegations, and I have no reason to doubt the credibility of these affidavits, so I give them significant weight in establishing the claimants\u2019 allegations. I also give the claimant\u2019s testimony in this regard significant weight as it was detailed and consistent. He did not exaggerate his claim, but rather confirmed that this was something that came out of the blue and that the police had never previously accused him of being anti-national when they were investigating XXXX disappearance. The claimant was also able to provide specific dates of when the police visited his mother including on Diwali and his birthday.\n[15] While I acknowledge that it is unclear why the police are now searching for the claimant on an entirely new basis, it would be speculative of me to set out what a \u201creasonable agent of persecution\u201d should do. The Federal Court has previously found that it is an error for the Board to \u201cspeculate as to the rational actions of reasonable agents of persecution.\u201d[6] Therefore, given all the foregoing and weighing all the evidence before me, I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the police are actively searching for the claimant across India and alleging that he is anti-national.\nPolice Search not connected to XXXX disappearance\n[16] The claimant testified that he believed the current search by the police was connected to his relationship with XXXX and instigated by her family. He testified that he has no proof of this but believes that it is a matter of honour for her family and that they manipulating the police with their connections. When asked about XXXX family\u2019s police connections, he stated that his mother learned about them from an unknown person at the jail when she came to bail the claimant out. This individual told his mother that XXXX father was a goon and people were scared of him. With regards to their political connections, he said that his mother told him about them, and she probably learned of them in the news. He did not submit any newspapers on this point into evidence. However, when the claimant spoke to XXXX about her father, she told him that he dealt with properties and never mentioned any illegal activity or connections.\n[17] The claimant testified that since his detention, XXXX family had never been to his house looking for him. He explained that people of XXXX caste do not like to associate with people of his caste. He testified that the police were regularly contacting his mother regarding XXXX disappearance, however, he later stated that he assumed this, and his mother hadn\u2019t told him anything to that effect. I find this to be speculative. Based on the evidence before me, there has been no involvement of the police or XXXX family in relation to XXXX disappearance since XXXX 2018. As such, there is insufficient credible evidence before me that the current searches by police are connected in any way to the claimant\u2019s relationship with XXXX or her disappearance.\nDocumentary Evidence\n[18] I have also considered the other documentary evidence the claimant submitted in support of his claim.[7] Of relevance is his Scheduled Caste Certificate, obtained by the claimant\u2019s mother from the Court in Haryana, which confirms that he belongs to the Chamar caste which is a scheduled caste.\nSubjective Fear\n[19] The claimant testified that when he returned to Canada at the end of 2017, he was still on a study permit. His study permit expired on XXXX XXXX, 2019, and afterwards he applied for a study permit extension which was rejected after 5-6 months. He was not aware at the time that he could apply for refugee protection. He testified that he did not become aware until he started going to a temple in Brampton where he was advised to submit an application for refugee protection. The claimant applied for refugee protection on January 20, 2020.\n[20] I find that the claimant\u2019s actions demonstrate that he has subjective fear on a balance of probabilities as he was always actively taking steps to secure his status in Canada and applied for refugee protection shortly after he was advised to do so by individuals at his temple.\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution\n[21] To be considered a Convention Refugee, the claimant must demonstrate that he has a well-founded fear of persecution which includes both subjective fear and an objective basis for that fear. Based on the claimant\u2019s BOC, testimony, documentary evidence and the National Documentation Package for India[8], I find that the claimant does face a serious possibility of harm in India.\nDalit Status\n[22] In reviewing the country condition documents in the NDP, it is clear that despite the fact that the Indian Constitution specifically prohibits discrimination on the grounds of caste, there are a number of troubling issues faced by members of the Dalit caste in India.[9] Dalits were historically associated with work seen as less desirable, including work involving cleaning or waste, and traditional taboos existed against members of the four castes touching them. Many Dalits continue to work in occupations that include scavenging, street cleaning and handling of human or animal waste, corpses or carcasses.[10] The evidence outlines that violence and discrimination against Dalits continues. Dalits have more limited educational and employment opportunities and face discrimination in health care and access to other essential services.[11]\n[23] Untouchability practices in India remain widespread in both urban and rural settings. These include dominant castes not touching Dalits, not letting them use the same mugs, utensils etc., not entering Dalit houses, not allowing their children to play with Dalits or to be in a relationship with a Dalit. There are thousands of variations of untouchability practices and the severity and prevalence vary depending on location.[12]\n[24] The claimant testified that he and his family have suffered serious and continued discrimination because of their Dalit status. His father used to work as a farmer but was never paid full price for his crops. This led him to seek other employment however he was frequently dismissed for minor mistakes. The claimants\u2019 father has been living and working in Italy since 2010 due to his inability to maintain employment in India because of his Caste. The claimant testified that he was discriminated against in school. The teacher would force children from lower castes to sit in the back seat, they were not allowed to travel in the school bus, play school sports, or drink from the same water cooler as higher caste students. The family had to buy groceries from a different store and attend a different temple because of their caste.\nHonour Crimes\n[25] The objective evidence supports that honour-based crimes are a problem in India, particularly in the provinces of Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh. The term \u201chonour killing\u201d or \u201chonour crime\u201d is used to describe incidents of violence and harassment caused to a couple who are together against the wishes of the community or family members. Such crimes can be linked to unapproved relationships.[13] Caste based violence additionally continues to persist in India, and unions between Dalit and non-Dalit individuals are some of the least socially accepted, especially where the male comes from an inferior or less dominant social group. They can give rise to serious violence including lynching and killings by family members or vigilante groups.[14]\nPolice Corruption\n[26] The objective evidence also supports that there is widespread corruption in India.[15] Officials frequently engage in corrupt practices with impunity.[16] Police officers routinely demonstrate brutal behaviour, including torture and extrajudicial killings with impunity.[17] Additionally, police effectiveness is undermined by inadequate training and equipment, and limited resources. Investigations are seriously hampered by some police officers refusing to register victims\u2019 complaints, poor quality of investigations, insufficient training and legal knowledge, inadequate and outdated forensic and cyber infrastructure and a lack of public trust.[18] A report from the Swadhikar \u2013 the National Dalit Movement for Justice suggests that police are accomplices in violence against Dalits through custodial torture and deaths, encounter deaths, raids of Dalit homes, and false arrets of Dalits among others. It recounts the story of a Dalit man who was abducted by police, tortured, abused using derogatory caste names and had a false charge filed against him.[19]\n[27] The objective evidence demonstrates that Dalits face serious violations of their fundamental rights that amount to persecution. These violations extend to all parts of their lives, including their relationships. The claimant has established on a balance of probabilities that he has experienced discrimination and harm due to his Dalit status throughout his childhood and most recently with regards to his relationship with a girl from a higher caste. Additionally, I find that the claimant has credibly established that he is being targeted by the police because of the belief that he is anti-national. While it is unclear why the police are suggesting this, the objective evidence corroborates the prevalence of police corruption as well as violence when it comes to Dalit individuals involved with the justice system. Given all of the foregoing, I find that the claimant would face a serious possibility of persecution in India.\nState Protection\n[28] There is a presumption that countries can protect their citizens. The claimant bears the burden of rebutting that presumption with clear and convincing evidence. I find that there is clear and convincing evidence that adequate state protection is not available to the claimant in this case given the state is one of the agents of persecution.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[29] I have considered whether the claimant has an internal flight alternative (\u201cIFA\u201d) in India and have concluded that he does not. To find a viable IFA, I must be satisfied that (1) there is no serious possibility of the claimant being persecuted or, on the balance of probabilities, in danger of torture or subjected to a risk to life or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in the IFA and (2) that conditions in that part of the country are such that it would be reasonable, in all the circumstances, including those particular to the claimant, for him to seek refuge there.\nFirst Prong: Risk in the IFA\n[30] On the evidence before me, I find that there is a serious possibility of the claimant being persecuted or, on the balance of probabilities, in danger of torture or subjected to a risk to life or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment anywhere in India.\nMeans and Motivation of the Agents of Persecution[31] There is insufficient credible evidence before me that either XXXX family or the police have continued to pursue the claimant in relation to XXXX disappearance since XXXX 2018. However, I do find that the police have demonstrated recent and continued means and motivation to pursue the claimant outside of their jurisdiction based on the belief that the claimant is anti-national. Starting at the end of 2021 and continuing to just a month prior to the hearing, the police have approached the claimant\u2019s mother and neighbour in Kurukshetra, his cousin in Rajasthan state and his uncle in Maharashtra state. Further, the claimant explained that it was the local police who visited his cousin in Rajasthan and his uncle in Maharashtra, indicating that information about the claimant has been passed along to different police forces across the country. Given the foregoing, I find that there is a serious possibility that the claimant\u2019s information is contained in national police databases and that the police across India are searching for the claimant.\nDalit Status[32] On the evidence before me, I find that there is a serious possibility of the claimant being persecuted because of his Dalit status. DFAT notes that Dalits in India face a high risk of official and societal discrimination including social segregation, exclusion, and compromised access to education and healthcare.[20] Violence against Dalits also continues, including killings, mob violence, assaults, and intimidation.[21] Further the objective evidence suggests that Dalits would have significant difficulty relocating to urban areas and are often denied accommodation and employment. A social network would be essential in finding employment and housing.[22]\n[33] While cities provide some limited level of anonymity, social networks would be essential in finding employment and housing in urban areas.[23] Those without social networks would face high discrimination in jobs and housing and often end up at the bottom of the social hierarchy. Although Dalits are reported to have increasing opportunities in cities, including a system of quotas to ensure employment of Dalits in certain sectors such as educational institutions and the federal public service, the quota system can generate hostility towards Dalits.[24] \u201cSevere inequalities persist, however, with Dalits making up a large proportion of those engaged in the urban informal labour sector as domestic workers, rickshaw-pullers, street vendors and other poorly paid sectors.[25] While the claimant has family outside of his village, including an uncle in Mahrashtra state where one of the proposed IFAs is located, the claimant would be unable to access these social networks due to the fact that the police are monitoring his relatives in search of him.\n[34] For the foregoing reasons I find that the claimant has demonstrated that the police have the means and motivation to pursue him to various parts of India. Further, I find that the claimant has demonstrated that he would face a serious possibility of persecution due to his Dalit status in other parts of India. As such, I do not need to consider the second prong of the test and find that there is no viable IFA for the claimant.\nCONCLUSION\n[35] For the forgoing reasons, I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee. The claim is therefore accepted.\n(signed) Katarina Bogojevic\nNovember 24, 2022\n\n[1] Immigration and Refugee Protection Act,S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n\n[2] Exhibit 2.\n\n[3] Exhibit 1.\n\n[4] Exhibit 5.\n\n[5] Exhibit 5.\n\n[6] Hernandez Cortez v Canada (Citizenship and Immgiration), 2021 FC 1392 (CanLII); Senadheerage v Canada (Citizenship and Immgiration), 2020 FC 968 (CanLII).\n\n[7] Exhibit 5.\n\n[8] Exhibit 3.\n\n[9] National Documentation Package, India, 30 June 2022, tab 2.1: \u200bIndia.

Mangat\nCountry: Pakistan\nRPD Number: VC2-01083\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2022-01960\nATIP Pages: N\/A\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: These are the reasons for the decision in the claim of XXXX XXXX, a citizen of Pakistan, who is claiming refugee protection pursuant to subsections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nDETERMINATION\n[2] For the reasons that follow, I find that you are a Convention refugee as you have established a serious possibility of persecution on account of a Convention ground, namely religion.\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] Briefly, you fear that you will be killed by your Sunni relatives and former Sunni colleagues, members of the XXXX and for the record, that is XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Pakistan, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, generally, and two (2) XXXX leaders, specifically, named XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. You also fear members of other anti-Shia extremist groups such as the XXXX, (inaudible), and the XXXX, as well as the political party, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and you fear them because you have converted to the Shia faith, because you XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and because you were actively supporting fellow Shia Muslims in Pakistan as a member of both the XXXX, which is a Shia Muslims religious and political party, and also a lawyers forum that provided legal assistant to Shia Muslims and other minorities.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[4] I find that your personal identity \u2013 an identity as a national of Pakistan is established by the documents provided, including a certified copy of your Pakistan passport.\nNexus\n[5] For a claimant to be a Convention refugee, the claimant must have a well-founded fear of persecution due to a Convention ground and I find that the harm you fear is by reason of the Convention ground of religion due to your conversion to the Shia faith.\nCredibility\n[6] When a claimant swears to the truth of certain allegations, this creates a presumption that those allegations are true unless there is a reason to doubt their untrue \u2014 or to doubt their truthfulness and I found you to be a credible witness. You testified in a straightforward manner, and you answered my questions, giving detailed answers without hesitation. There were no relevant inconsistencies in your testimony or contradictions between your testimony and the other evidence before me. I accept on a balance of probabilities that you converted to the Shia faith. You provided a lengthy Basis of Claim form, a narrative in Exhibit 6 detailing why you chose to convert and how you converted. In addition, you provided documentary evidence showing that you continue to follow your faith in Canada. You have also provided other documentary evidence to support your allegations, including letters from your mother and friend, letters regarding your membership in the XXXX and the lawyers forum in Pakistan, a copy of the fatwa issued against you by the SSP, a medical report showing the injuries that you sustained after you were attacked, the letter that you wrote to the police requesting that an FIR be registered, and a land registry document showing the land and the graveyard that you donated. In summary, you have provided extensive evidence of the threats and the attacks made against you.\n[7] You have also provided several photographs of yourself participating in protests in Calgary and copies of six (6) different newspapers from Pakistan, which reported the protest, and which contain your photograph and name. Upon a review of these items, I find no reason to doubt their authenticity and therefore, place significant weight on them as they serve to corroborate your allegations. I find that you have established on a balance of probabilities that you converted to the Shia faith in XXXX 2018. You joined the XXXX, a Shia political and religious party, in XXXX 2018 and participated in approximately seven (7) to eight (8) peaceful protests, rallies, and hunger strikes in Pakistan in support of Shias.\n[8] You joined the (inaudible) forum in XXXX 2018, an organization formed to provide legal support to Shias and other minorities in XXXX, your home city, and your particularly \u2014 you particularly helped three (3) or four (4) families who have been charged with blasphemy. You first began to receive threats in XXXX 2019 when you XXXX XXXX XXXX to a Shia neighbor for his XXXX. You received threats from XXXX XXXX XXXX, who arranged a group of people to attend and attempt to stop XXXX XXXX from happening. Mr. XXXX and his group called the Shias kafirs and infidels. The next day, your cousin who follows XXXX and also both \u2014 he also follows both the XXXX and the XXXX \u2014 he threatened you, telling you to revert to Sunni Islam and to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, or you will face the consequences. You receive more than one (1) threatening call from XXXX XXXX, a leader of the XXXX, who told you to revert to Sunni Islam and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX or it would be the cause of your death. In XXXX 2019, you were physically attacked by four (4) armed individuals shouting XXXX slogans, calling you \u2018Kafir\u2019 and said, \u2018If you wish to be alive,\u2019 to \u2018Revert to the Sunni faith and give back the land you donated.\u2019 Your neighbours took you to the hospital to tend to your injuries. You then went to the police station who took your complaint, but when you gave the name XXXX XXXX to the police, the police\u2019s attitudes changed and said that you were responsible for the attack and they did not issue an FIR, and you believe that the police told XXXX XXXX of the XXXX about your visit to the police because XXXX XXXX mentioned you in the phone calls.\n[9] In XXXX 2019, XXXX XXXX forcibly entered your home with members of the XXXX while you were not present and searched for you. In XXXX 2019, your XXXX XXXX XXXX of the XXXX in XXXX was murdered by Sunni extremists on his way to work. You arranged a protest and demanded the police to lodge a FIR. You received more threats. You left Pakistan in XXXX 2019 and first flew to the United States where you had intended to make a refugee claim, but you were advised that your claim would be refused in the United States due to President Trump\u2019s immigration policy, so you decided to come to Canada, and you arrived on the XXXX XXXX XXXX 2020 and made a refugee claim at the border. In your absence, the XXXX has posted a fatwa outside your residence, calling for your death as a blasphemer and apostate. You \u2013 friends \u2013 apostate. Your friends and family have stated that the XXXX continue to search for you.\nWell-Founded Fear\n[10] I find that you have established a subjective fear of persecution in Pakistan based on your conversion to the Shia faith. I also find that the objective evidence before me establishes that your fears of persecution are objectively well-founded. The country condition evidence as outlined in the National Documentation Package for Pakistan supports your allegations regarding the treatment of those who follow the Shia faith in Pakistan. Item 1.8 is the UNHCR guidelines for assessing religious minorities in Pakistan, and it indicates blasphemy is criminalized in Pakistan and can carry the death penalty. The addition of the blasphemy laws to the criminal penal code has \u201cContributed to the institutionalization of discrimination against religious minorities,\u201d and has been criticized for fueling extremist violence and targeted attacks. The report indicates that Shiites are the main target of sectarian, attacks and the number of blasphemy allegations against Shiites increased exponentially between 2012 and 2015. Extremist militant groups view the Shiites as heretics, infidels, and apostates who should be punished by death. A footnote in the UNHCR report \u2014 and for the record, that is footnote 369 \u2014 indicates the four (4) militant groups which are responsible for most of the attacks against Shiites in Pakistan: one (1) is the XXXX and another is the XXXX.\n[11] You have provided additional evidence regarding the treatment of Shias in Exhibit 5 that indicate sectarian violence has been rising in Pakistan. One (1) article from the Minority Rights Group describes a wave of online and offline campaigns against the Shia community in August and September 2020. Online hate speech was documented and there were major spikes in hate speech during that time period with the Urdu word for \u2018Infidel\u2019 being particularly prevalent in searches. Also in Exhibit 5 is an article from The Diplomat that shows at least six (6) large anti-Shia rallies took place by different Sunni groups in five (5) different cities, including Karachi. Another article he provided indicates that rallies were orchestrated on successive dates with at least 30,000 people attending, some chanting anti-Shia slogans, and there are also reports of Shias being killed in broad daylight by Sunni extremists.\n[12] In addition, the objective evidence indicates that 43 blasphemy cases, primarily targeting Shias, were registered in August 2020 alone. One (1) of those charged was a mourner who was only three (3) years old. Societal violence due to religious intolerance is also reported by the United States Department of State report, which is Item 2.1 of the NDP, and it reports Shia Muslim activists reported continuing instances of targeted killings and enforced disappearances in part of the country \u2013 in parts of the country. One (1) article he provided in Exhibit 5 suggests that either the state has acquiesced to anti-Shia hysteria or is wholeheartedly backing it. The New York Times article in Exhibit 5 indicates the new political party in Pakistan, the Tehreek-e-Labbaik, was approved to run on a platform of punishing those who blaspheme Islam, and the leader of the political party was also the leader of the banned anti-Shia group, ASWJ. I find that the country condition evidence establishes that Shia practitioners are targeted by militant groups such as the XXXX and LeJ and political parties, such as the Tehreek-e-Labbaik, and you have established on a balance of probabilities that you have been personally targeted for death by the XXXX. As such, I find that there is more than a mere possibility of persecution, should you return to Pakistan.\nState Protection\n[13] As a presumption that \u2013 absent a complete breakdown, states are capable of protecting their citizens, however, I find that presumption has been rebutted in your case as the agent of persecution is in part, the state. You have sought assistance from the police when you were attacked, and they have refused to register a FIR and said that you were responsible for the attack. Furthermore, the local authorities were unable to protect your mentor, the president of the (inaudible) unit of the political party you were part of. He was targeted and murdered on his way to work in XXXX of 2019. The UNHCR report at NDP 1.8 indicates analysists describe the state authorities as being \u201cIndifferent, incompetent, or even complicit in the violence and discrimination against Shiites.\u201d So accordingly, I find that you have rebutted the presumption of state protection and I find that there is no adequate state protection available to you.\nIFA\n[14] I find that there is no internal flight alternative for you in Pakistan. The objective country evidence indicated that attacks against Shiites occur throughout Pakistan. As already stated, large demonstrators against \u2014 demonstrations against Shias occurred in five (5) cities in succession in 2020. The XXXX is a group that operates throughout Pakistan and (inaudible) has issued a fatwa against you since you left Pakistan. And your family is still approached by members of the XXXX about you and they are keeping tabs on your activities as they had newspaper articles about you, concerning your \u2014 the protests that you attended in Calgary. One (1) of the largest militant authorization \u2014 organizations in the country has said that they want you killed for your conversion to the Shia faith. So, I find that there is no internal flight alternative available to you in Pakistan.\n[15] So, in conclusion, based on the analysis above, I find that you are a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 and I accept your claim. This hearing is now concluded.\n[16] COUNSEL: Thank you, ma\u2019am. Thank you very much.\n[17] CLAIMANT: Thank you so \u2014\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

The claimants are citizens of India and are seeking refugee protection pursuant to subsections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).\n[2] The principal claimant was appointed the Designated Representative for the minor claimant at the outset of the hearing.\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] The details of the claimants\u2019 allegations are fully set out in the Basis of Claim (BOC) forms and were supplemented by a BOC addendum and oral testimony.[1] In summary, the claimants fear persecution in India from goons associated with the Congress political party because the principal claimant is a supporter of the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX political party. In addition, the claimants fear the police because they have accused the principal claimant of financially supporting terrorists and because they believe the police work at the behest of the Congress party.\nDETERMINATION\n[4] I find that the claimants are Convention refugees as they have a well-founded fear of persecution for at least one Convention ground, namely membership in a particular social group, as the claimants are members of the \u201cBackward Caste\u201c XXXX, also known as Dalits. I therefore have not assessed the claimants\u2019 allegations regarding their fears of Congress party goons or the police.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[5] The Claimants\u2019 identities as nationals of India are established on a balance of probabilities by the sworn statements in their BOC forms and the copies of their Republic of India passports.[2]\nNexus\n[6] I find that there is a nexus between the claimants\u2019 allegations and the Convention ground of membership in a particular social group because the claimants are members of the XXXX Caste, or Dalits.\nCredibility\n[7] The Federal Court has held in Maldonado that when a claimant swears to the truth of certain allegations, it creates a presumption that those allegations are true unless there is a reason to doubt their truthfulness.[3] The presumption of truthfulness does not apply to inferences or speculation.\n[8] In this case, I have no reason to doubt the truthfulness of the claimants. The principal claimant testified in a straightforward manner and gave detailed answers to my questions about how he was treated as a Dalit in his village of XXXX, Punjab. The principal claimant provided spontaneous testimony about Dalits being forbidden to build a sports field in XXXX solely because they were Dalit, and how Dalits were not allowed to mingle with others in the community during celebrations because they were Dalit. Both the associate claimant and principal claimant testified about how they were treated at school due to being Dalit. The associate claimant testified other students refused to play with her and she was treated differently by teachers because she was Dalit. In addition, the claimants provided corroborating evidence including a \u201cBackward Caste Certificate for the principal claimant\u2019s father, indicating he is from the XXXX XXXX.[4]\n[9] I find that the claimants have established on a balance of probabilities that they are Dalits. I asked the principal claimant why he did not have a Certificate in his own name, and he testified that they issued only one certificate for the family, and that both of his parents were of the XXXX XXXX. The associate claimant testified she did not have a certificate; however, I accept on a balance of probabilities that she is of the same XXXX XXXX based on her credible testimony.\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution and Risk of Harm\n[10] I find that the claimants\u2019 subjective fear is objectively well-founded.\n[11] Regarding Dalits, Minority Rights Group International states the following:\nAmidst India\u2019s cultural traditions is a rigid caste structure, a continuing symbol of identification and social stratification. 16.6 per cent of the total population of India consists of the scheduled castes which includes \u2018Dalits\u2019 also known as Harijans, or \u2018Untouchables\u2019. The Indian Constitution requires the government to define a list or schedule of the lowest castes in need of compensatory programmes\u2026\nDalits in rural areas suffer from entrenched caste discrimination, including \u2018untouchability\u2019, violence and harassment. Violence against Dalits is widespread, driven by the persistent effects of India\u2019s caste system and the lack of justice for victims.\nThe constitutionally guaranteed affirmative action policies have had some positive impact in increasing the representation of Dalits in educational institutions, governmental jobs and elected positions. Notwithstanding this improvement, Dalits continue to remain the most underprivileged class of Indian society: the stigma they face remains evident to this day. Dalits in general continue to survive under inhumane, degrading conditions.[5]\n[12] The International Dalit Solidarity Network states:\n[u]ntouchability practices in India remain widespread in both urban and rural settings. These include dominant castes not touching Dalits, not letting them use the same mugs, utensils etc., not entering Dalit houses, not allowing their children to play with Dalits or to be in a relationship with a Dalit. There are thousands of variations of untouchability practices and the severity and prevalence vary depending on location.[6]\n[13] The Navsarjan Trust also states that untouchability \u201cis present in nearly every sphere of life and practiced in an infinite number of forms\u201d. Examples include Dalits being refused entry to barber shops or temples, being forbidden to use wells, and Dalit children may be asked to clean the toilets and to eat separately at schools.[7]\n[14] The treatment of Dalits has not improved in recent years. The 2015 National Dalit Movement for Justice report[8] provides a list of \u201cnew forms of atrocities\u201d against Dalits that were proposed additions to the Scheduled Castes and Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 (\u201cPOA Act\u201d). At the time, the POA Act had 22 offences listed as atrocities\nwhich include forcing to drink or eat any inedible or obnoxious substance; dumping excreta; parading naked; occupying or cultivating any SC\u2019s land; forcing or intimidating to vote or to vote to a particular candidate; instituting false, malicious or vexatious suit; insulting or intimidating to humiliate in any place within public view; exploiting a woman sexually; and mischief by fire or any explosive substance to cause damage to any SC\u2019s property; etc.\n[15] The National Dalit Movement for Justice report, however, states:\nnumerous new forms of caste-based atrocities have been identified in \u2026(and) perpetrated in both rural and urban regions. These forms are widespread and systemic in nature. The POA Amendments Bill introduced in the Lok Sabha in 2014 and pending before the Parliament has identified and included these additional forms of atrocities.\n[16] The new forms of atrocities listed in the POA Amendments Bill are extensive and numerous and divided into five categories. As an example, the first category of proposed amendments to the POA Act are offences related to assault on dignity such as:\nputting inedible or obnoxious substance into the mouth; garlanding with footwear, removing clothes, tonsuring of head, removing moustaches, painting face or body; compelling to dispose or carry human or animal carcasses, compelling to dig graves; manual scavenging; disrespecting any late persons held in high esteem to SCs\/STs; attempting to promote feelings of enmity and hatred against SCs\/ STs; and imposing social or economic boycott.\n[17] As the Navsarjan Trust, supra, succinctly relates, the objective evidence unanimously demonstrates that untouchability is \u201cpracticed in an infinite number of forms\u201d which are rightfully labelled \u2018atrocious\u2019.\n[18] I find Dalits face systemic serious violations of their fundamental rights that amount to persecution. I find the claimants have established on a balance of probabilities that they have experienced discrimination since childhood as Dalits. I find there is a serious possibility the claimants will face continued discrimination as Dalits if they were to return to India and that the treatment cumulatively amounts to persecution.\nState Protection\n[19] There is a presumption that, unless in complete breakdown, states are capable of protecting their citizens. I find that that the claimants have rebutted the presumption of state protection and I find there is no adequate state protection for the claimants.\n[20] The Australian DFAT, quoted in the UK Home Office Country Policy and Information Note, reports:\nRegistration, investigation and prosecution of cases may be affected by bias in relation to the class, caste, ethnicity and religion of a victim or offender. Ethnic and religious minorities complain that police lack sensitivity, suspicions about which sometimes lead to communal violence. Local sources report that police, along with other agencies including the courts, public servants, judiciary and prosecutors, have an inherent bias when dealing with Dalit victims of crime in particular.[9]\n[21] In the most recent \u201cStatus of Policing in India Report\u201d, 32 percent of those interviewed in conflict-affected regions believed the police would favour an upper caste person in a criminal investigation over a Dalit.[10]\n[22] The Australian DFAT country report indicates:\ncorrupt practices such as facilitation payments and bribes persist in India, with corruption particularly prevalent in the judiciary, police, public services and public procurement sectors\u2026Since 2014, India has consistently ranked low on the (World Justice Project Rule of Law) indices measuring absence of corruption across government. Similarly, India ranked 80 out of 198 countries on Transparency International\u2019s Corruption Index, 2019 (down from 78th place in 2018).[11]\n[23] I find that the claimants have established on a balance of probabilities that adequate state protection for them in India is not available because the police, judiciary and other government agencies are reported to be not only corrupt, but also biased against Dalits.\nInternal Flight Alternative (IFA)\n[24] The Federal Court of Appeal in Rasaratnam,[12] developed a two-prong test when assessing IFA, which entails a consideration of two matters: (1) whether there is a serious possibility of the claimant being persecuted or, on the balance of probabilities, in danger of torture or subjected to a risk to life or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in the IFA and (2) whether conditions in the IFA are such that it would be reasonable, in all the circumstances, including those particular to the claimant, for him to seek refuge there. The onus is on the claimants to demonstrate they do not have a viable IFA.\n[25] Based on the evidence before me, I find that the claimants would face a serious possibility of persecution throughout India and there is no IFA available to them.\n[26] The persecution suffered by Dalits is widespread and systematic and occurs in both rural and urban areas. I note that the objective evidence, reviewed above, regarding the persecutory treatment of Dalits in India is not location specific. While cities provide some limited level of anonymity, social networks would be essential in finding employment and housing in urban areas.[13] Those without social networks would face high discrimination in jobs and housing and often end up at the bottom of the social hierarchy. Although Dalits are reported to have increasing opportunities in cities, including a system of quotas to ensure employment of Dalits in certain sectors such as educational institutions and the federal public service, the quota system can generate hostility towards Dalits.[14] \u201cSevere inequalities persist, however, with Dalits making up a large proportion of those engaged in the urban informal labour sector as domestic workers, rickshaw-pullers, street vendors and other poorly paid sectors\u201d.[15]\n[27] There is no evidence before me to indicate that the claimants have a social network in the proposed IFAs of Delhi or Mumbai.\n[28] I find that the claimants face a serious possibility of persecution in either Delhi or Mumbai because they are Dalits and as such the IFA fails on the first prong of the Rasaratnam test. I find that there is no IFA available to the claimants.\nCONCLUSION\n[29] When I consider the claimants\u2019 personal profiles, the objective country evidence, the lack of state protection and lack of a viable IFA, I find that the claimants are Convention refugees and I accept their claims.\n(signed) Alannah Hatch\nJuly 27, 2022\n\n[1] Exhibits 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 and 4.\n\n[2] Exhibit 1.\n\n[3] Maldonado v.

The RPD granted the Rule 21 Application. In the said Rule 21 Application, the Minister notified the parties that it wishes to intervene by making observations and submitting evidence in all claims.\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] The claimant\u2019s full allegations are contained in his Basis of Claim form, additional narrative, and were supplemented by his testimony at the hearing.[iv] Summarized only briefly, the claimant fears persecution in Uganda on the basis of his political opinion. The claimant has been an active supporter of the National Unity Party (the NUP) and has held roles within the party. As a result of the claimant\u2019s political involvement, he has been targeted by the state and its agents, assaulted, harassed and threatened. The claimant fears similar or worse treatment in Uganda on the basis of his political opinion should he return.\nDETERMINATION\n[4] After considering the claimant\u2019s testimony and the documentary evidence, I find the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to s. 96 of the Act. My reasons are as follows.\nANALYSIS\nNexus\n[5] The claimant\u2019s allegations establish a nexus to the Convention on the ground of political opinion. I have therefore analyzed the claim pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA.\nIdentity\n[6] The claimant\u2019s identity is established, on a balance of probabilities, by the documentary evidence before me, including a copy of his Ugandan passport in Exhibit 1.\nCredibility\n[7] Pursuant to the Maldonado principle, the claimant benefits from a presumption of truthfulness. I find, on a balance of probabilities, the claimant is credible.\n[8] The claimant\u2019s testimony was direct, spontaneous, and consistent. The claimant was able to respond to questions in a forthcoming manner. I asked numerous questions about the claimant\u2019s past involvement in politics in Uganda. The claimant was able to provide ample description about all of his roles within the NUP and his aspirations for running as a candidate for the party. The claimant provided very detailed and spontaneous testimony about his past political passions, including running for perfecter positions in elementary, primary and high school, his official roles as a speaker and later president of a student group at Kampala International University, and his previous support for the FDC and why he ultimately transitioned his support from FDC to the NUP. To these and many other questions, the claimant gave responses which were materially consistent with his narrative, and responses which provided further detail about the claimant\u2019s allegations. I find the claimant was a credible witness, on a balance of probabilities, relating to his allegations of political involvement and risk in Uganda.\n[9] In addition, the Claimant submitted documentary evidence to corroborate his claim, all of which can be found in Exhibits 6, 7 and 9, including medical records from injuries sustained in attacks by state agents, a copy of his NUP membership card, NUP documents corroborating the claimant\u2019s official roles within the organization and the risk he has faced on the basis of his involvement with the NUP, a letter from the claimant\u2019s spouse corroborating that the authorities continue to be motivated in harming the claimant. I do not doubt the authenticity of these documents, and I assign them significant weight as they corroborate the claimant\u2019s central allegations.\n[10] The Minister raised various credibility concerns including (i) the similarities between the claimant and the other claimants relating to the basis of their TRV applications to Canada and their contact information in Canada (with no claimant referencing this connection) and (ii) the striking similarity in the Basis of Claim form between the claimant and the other Rule 21 Application claimants. Specifically, the Minister submits that because none of the claimants made reference to one another in their applications, their arrival to Canada was likely facilitated by the same agent who helped them fabricate their information, including their similarly drafted Basis of Claim forms and narratives made in their applications for protection. These concerns will be addressed below.\nTRV Application Issues \u2013 Rule 21 Application\n[11] Based on the Rule 21 Application which was granted by the RPD, the TRV applications between all 16 claimants were cross disclosed. The TRV applications were based on the same conference attendance and contained similar supporting documentation to facilitate the obtaining of a visa to Canada.\n[12] I asked the claimant to explain how he obtained his visa to Canada. In testimony, the claimant explained that he relied on the assistance of an agent, organized by the NUP party, for obtaining the visa. The claimant provided only his passport to the agent. When I asked the claimant how the agent would have gotten access to some of the other supporting evidence (i.e. educational documents, certificates, employment letters, etc) the claimant advised that all of these documents had already been provided to the NUP and it is possible the agent obtained them from the NUP directly. The claimant advised that he never saw the application for a visa before it was submitted, did not sign the forms included in the application, and was entirely unaware of the contents of the application, including the fact that it was for a TRV to attend a conference. The claimant also explained in testimony that he was unaware of the contents of the visa application until the RPD cross-disclosed the TRV applications pursuant to the Rule 21 application.\n[13] I accept that the claimant relied entirely on an agent facilitated by the NUP to obtain the visa, and that he was not privy to the contents of the visa application as a result. I find this to be a reasonable explanation.\n[14] I agree with the Minister that these cases demonstrate, on a balance of probabilities, that these claimants used the same agent for facilitating their travel to Canada. I do not find, however, that this undermines the claimant\u2019s allegations that he relied on an NUP agent to obtain a visa to Canada. I find it is a reasonable to believe that there are agents in Uganda who facilitate the travel of multiple claimants at the same time, using the same basis for travel, without the knowledge of those accessing the agent\u2019s services. The actions of the agent would be outside of the control or knowledge of the claimant. I also find it reasonable to believe that the NUP as a party may use the same agent, throughout Uganda, to facilitate the flight of numerous people at the same time from Uganda. I find the claimant\u2019s explanation to be reasonable.\n[15] I also asked the claimant about the other claimants living at the same address. The claimant stated that he did not know any of the other claimants living at his address until after he had arrived in Canada. He stated that the agent advised him to talk to no one, including those at his home, and to tell no one about his reasons for being in Canada. As a result, the claimant did not discuss with the other claimant the reasons for being in Canada, and that it was not until the RPD disclosed the Basis of Claim forms that the claimant became aware of the reason for the other claimant\u2019s travel to Canada. Again, I find this explanation to be reasonable. The claimant did not mention these other claimants when he filed his own claim for protection because, when he filed his claim, he was not aware of the reason why the other claimants were in Canada, and unaware of the connections related to the use of the same agent in Uganda. I find the claimant\u2019s explanation to be reasonable.\nSimilarity in the Basis of Claim forms \u2013 Rule 21 Application\n[16] Based on the Rule 21 Application, it is notable that the Basis of Claim forms are written in a remarkably similar manner, including the use of capital letters and short sentences in the Basis of Claim form itself, and in the format of the majority of the written additional narratives.\n[17] The Panel acknowledges that similarities in narratives may service to undermine a claimant\u2019s credibility. As stated by the court in Ravichandran,[v] \u201ccourts have found that it is not unreasonable to draw a negative inference as to credibility from unwarranted similarities between a refugee claimant\u2019s narrative and the narratives of other unrelated claimants (Liu v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2006 FC 695 at para 39; Shi v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2003 FC 1088 at paras 1, 19).\u201d[vi]\n[18] Nonetheless, the court went further to state that \u201c\u2026 while decision-makers may rely on their common sense in drawing negative credibility inferences from unwarranted and striking similarities between the testimony of applicants, it is equally true that they must use their common sense to determine whether, in the circumstances of the case, there is a valid reason for the similarity. If there is, it would not be appropriate to find that the similarity casts doubt on the applicant\u2019s credibility (Zhang v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2006 FC 550 at paras 25-28, [Zhang]).\u201d[vii]\n[19] I put to the claimant that there are remarkably similar formats in the Basis of Claims for each of the noted claimants that lead the Panel to believe that the forms were, in some way, completed using the same person\/person(s) for assistance, or the same template. The claimant stated he did not have anyone help in completing his Basis of Claim form, and that he is not sure why the other Basis of Claim forms are stylistically like his own. The claimant was adamant that he completed the document himself, with the help of searching for advice online on how to initiate a claim in Canada. The claimant also stated that he completed the form using a shared computer at the residence, and that the documents were saved to the desktop of that computer and would have been available to the other residents. In this way, the claimant submits it is possible that other claimants reviewed his form and completed their documents in a similar fashion.\n[20] The Minister submits that the similar formatting may indicate that the claimant\u2019s claim is fabricated. I find there is insufficient evidence before me to demonstrate this to be the case on a balance of probabilities. Instead, while I do not accept the claimant\u2019s testimony that no one assisted him in completing his forms, I do not find this credibility concern undermines the otherwise detailed and credible testimony presented by the claimant in support of his allegations of political persecution and risk. Although the claimant was not forthcoming in explaining who assisted him in completing his form, I find that receiving assistance or following a stylistic template does not necessarily indicate that a claim is fabricated. Given the claimant was able to credibly testify to the contents of his allegations, I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the assistance in completing his Basis of Claim and narrative was limited to the stylistic approach and not a fabrication of its contents.\n[21] Informing this finding is the observation that the similarities between the claimant\u2019s Basis of Claim and the other claimants\u2019 documents relates to the stylistic completion of the form and narrative. The style of the answers to the questions in the Basis of Claim form itself are all similar, in capital letters and with the same countries listed in question 6. In contrast, in my review of the Basis of Claim forms disclosed pursuant to the Rule 21 Application, the actual content of the Basis of Claim forms \u2013 in particular, the chronology of the risk alleged by the claimant in the case before me \u2013 is unique to the claimant and not reiterated by any other claimant. While other claimants express risk for their political opinion and association with the NUP, the claimant was able to credibly testify to his specific experiences in Uganda. Given the country documents do indicate that NUP supporters face persecution in Uganda, I do not find it surprising that a dozen or so supporters have made their way to Canada to seek protection at a similar time, in light of the evidence that such supporters would require protection.\n[22] For that reason, while I agree with the Minister that there are striking similarities in the format of narrative of the claimant as compared with the other claimants, I find the contents are unique and supported by the claimant\u2019s credible testimony.\nSummary of Credibility Determination\n[23] My role is to assess the evidence before me to determine what has been established, on a balance of probabilities. Although I accept the claimant was not truthful about assistance received in the preparation of his BOC, I do not find this to be determinative of the credibility of his allegations of risk. I find there is enough credible evidence before me to establish, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant has been subjected threats, assaults and harassment in Uganda on the basis of his political opinion.\n[24] I find the claimant has established his subjective fears on a balance of probabilities.\nObjective Basis\n[25] The claimant\u2019s allegations of fear of persecution on his political opinion are supported by the objective documentary evidence. The panel finds the claimant\u2019s claim that he fears imprisonment, torture and death if he is returned to Uganda, at the hands of the NRM ruling party on the grounds of his political opinion and membership in the NUP opposition party, to be objectively well-founded.\n[26] Pertaining specifically to political opponents, there is evidence in the National Documentation Package (NDP), for example at item 2.1, that the government committed significant human rights issues including arbitrary killings; forced disappearance; torture; harsh and life-threatening prison conditions; arbitrary arrest or detention; political prisoners or detainees; serious restrictions on free expression and free restrictions on political participations. Opposition activists, local media, and human rights activists reported that security forces killed individuals the government identified as dissidents and those who participated in protests against the government.[viii]\n[27] The government continued to target political dissidents subjecting them to intimidation, harassment, arbitrary arrest and detention. There were reports, for example at item 2.2, of restrictions on the rights to freedom of expression, association, and peaceful assembly of political opposition members, journalists, human rights defenders, and students.[ix]\n[28] According to item 2.3, violations of freedom of association, assembly, and expression continued in 2019 as authorities introduced new regulations restricting online activities and stifling independent media. The government arrested political opponents and blocks political and student rallies.[x]\n[29] Based on the documents evidence cited above, I find that the claimant will face a serious possibility of in Uganda on the basis of his political opinion and involvement. I find that the claimant\u2019s fears are objectively well-founded.\nState Protection and Internal Flight Alternative\n[30] States are presumed capable of protecting their citizens. In this case, given the state is an agent of persecution I find the presumption has been rebutted. I find there is no state protection available to the claimant in Uganda.\n[31] Further, since the state is an agent of persecution and is in control of the entirety of its territory, I find the claimant faces a serious possibility of persecution throughout Uganda. I find there is no viable internal flight alternative available to the claimant in that country.\nCONCLUSION\n[32] Based on the above analysis, I find the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to s. 96 of the Act.

He is seeking protection pursuant to section 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (\u201cIRPA\u201d).[i]\nAdministrative Matters\n[2] The Minister intervened regarding credibility, identity and program integrity on April 05, 2019.\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] The allegations are fully set out in the claimant\u2019s Basis of Claim form and his narrative. In summary, the claimant alleges that that he will be harmed and may be killed by a Youth Congress member, XXXX XXXX, whose sister the claimant got pregnant out of wedlock, and the family considered their honour tarnished by the incident. Furthermore, he alleges fear of the Punjabi police acting at the behest of XXXX XXXX.\n[4] The claimant met a lady by the name of XXXX XXXX XXXX during his 11th grade schooling. They became attracted to each other and started meeting even after leaving the school. While the claimant was away studying in Singapore, he kept in contact with XXXX. On return to India in XXXX 2016, the claimant and XXXX continued their relationship and began meeting at one of the motels in secret.\n[5] In XXXX 2016, XXXX became pregnant. She told her mother of her relationship with the claimant, and her mother took her to a doctor for abortion. When XXXX father and XXXX (the brother) became aware of what had happened, XXXX went with some of his friends to look for the claimant at home, but he was absent.\n[6] On XXXX XXXX, 2016, while the claimant was returning home in the evening, he was accosted by two men who were instructed by XXXX to kill him. The claimant was beaten with hockey sticks and an acid was used to remove the tattoo of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The claimant was left for dead and passerby that saw him called the claimant\u2019s father who came and took him to the doctor for treatment.\n[7] After being discharged from hospital, the claimant was taken by his father to a friend\u2019s place in Ludhiana because XXXX had returned with some men to the claimant\u2019s residence threatening to kill him for tarnishing the reputation of his family, socially and politically.\n[8] The claimant\u2019s friend in Ludhiana advised him that he could not stay in hiding all his life and that relocation within India would be difficult. When he was also advised by a lawyer that he should leave the country to avoid honour killing, the claimant\u2019s friend got him an agent to help facilitate leaving India.\n[9] In XXXX 2017, the agent took the claimant to New Delhi and kept him in hiding. The agent later misplaced the claimant\u2019s passport but promised he would get him out of India. On XXXX XXXX 2017, the agent put the claimant on a flight to Canada on a passport with the name of XXXX XXXX. On arrival in Canada, the claimant was met at Vancouver Airport by the agent\u2019s representative who took the false passport from him after the claimant had cleared customs. The claimant was thereafter introduced to someone else who promised to find him work as well as arrange a permanent residency in Canada.\n[10] When the claimant tried to stay legally in Canada through work and explained his circumstances as well as fear of honour killing to his employer, he was advised to seek legal support. The claimant thereafter made an application for refugee protection.\nDETERMINATION\n[11] The panel finds that the claimant is a person in need of protection, pursuant to section 97(1)(b) of the IRPA, because, on a balance of probabilities, he would be subjected personally to a risk to his life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, should he return to India.\nANALYSIS\nMinister\u2019s Intervention\n[12] The Minister of Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada (the Minister) intervened in-writing in this matter on April 05, 2019.[ii]\n[13] The Minister noted that the claimant only had the following identity documents with him when he made his refugee claim: a unique identification authority of India card; a card from the electoral commission of India; a Punjab senior secondary school certificate; and a birth certificate that had a translated photocopy without the translator\u2019s attestation. The Minister therefore submitted that the claimant has not proven his identity having failed to produce a copy of his passport, or a copy of the passport as well as other travel documents with which he travelled into Canada under a false identity of Gurpreet Singh.\n[14] On May 16, 2022, as part of disclosures made by the claimant, he submitted a copy of his Indian passport to verify his identity. Same disclosure was made to the Minister and the panel did not receive any objections to the disclosure from the Minister.\nIdentity\n[15] The claimant\u2019s identity as a national of India has been established on a balance of probabilities by the sworn statement in his BOC form,[iii] his testimony, his XXXX card and school certificate,[iv] as well as a copy of his Indian passport.[v]\n\nNexus\n[16] The panel finds that the claimant has not established a nexus with a Convention ground. The claimant\u2019s fears do not arise from his political opinion, religion, race or nationality or membership in a particular social group.\n[17] The claimant is a victim of crime or personal vendetta. Those who targeted the claimant have done so out of revenge to teach his family a lesson, while the Punjab police have acted against the claimant at the behest of the agents of harm. The Court has held that victims of crime, corruption or vendettas, including blood feuds generally cannot establish a link between their fear of persecution and one of the five Convention grounds.[vi] The panel finds that there is nothing particular about this case which takes it outside these general principles.\n[18] The principal claimant fears future criminality which is not connected to one of the five Convention grounds. The panel therefore assessed his claim pursuant to section 97(1) of IRPA.\nCredibility\n[19] When a Claimant swears to the truth of allegations, this creates a presumption that those allegations are true unless there is a reason to doubt their truthfulness.[vii] However, this presumption does not extend to inferences, which are conclusions from facts, or speculation, which are allegations without any evidentiary basis.\n[20] In assessing the Claimant\u2019s credibility, the Panel has considered potential difficulties that the Claimant may face in giving his testimony including:\nthe impact of trauma,cultural and social factors,the Claimant\u2019s age and educational background,the unfamiliar hearing environment and the high-stakes nature of refugee proceedings.[21] On a balance of probabilities, the panel accepts the claimant\u2019s allegations as credible. There were no relevant inconsistencies in his testimony or contradictions between his testimony and the other evidence before the panel which have not been satisfactorily explained.\n[22] The claimant submitted numerous documents to substantiate his claim.[viii] These include:\nAn affidavit from the claimant\u2019s parents explaining that XXXX XXXX with unknown members of his party, and the police, have kept coming to them seeking the claimant\u2019s whereabout. The affidavit further stated that the efforts by the claimant\u2019s parents to reconcile with XXXX XXXX and family have been a failure.Affidavit from the claimant\u2019s friend in Ludhiana where he was taken by his father after receiving medical treatment on XXXX XXXX 2016.A medical report from XXXX XXXX that confirmed the injury the claimant received on XXXX XXXX 2016 \u2013 \u201chand burnt with acid, injury on forehead and face swollen\u201d \u2013 and the treatment he was provided.Various media articles as objective evidence.Upon a review of these documents, the panel finds no reason to doubt their authenticity. The panel places significant weight on them as having probative values in substantiating the claimant\u2019s allegations.\n[23] The panel notes that the claimant first arrived in Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2017. He was asked why he did not make a claim then. The claimant testified that he knew very little about Canada and the immigration process. He stated that the agent that got him his visa arranged for someone to meet him in Vancouver who took the passport and documents he travelled with from him, and also arranged for him to start working at a company in Vancouver. He stated that he was told a permanent residence would be arranged for him. He testified that in XXXX 2018 when he asked his supervisor about his application for a permanent residence, and his passport was requested, he narrated how he came into Canada and was at that point advised that he had no legal status in Canada and should go to Montreal to seek advise.\n[24] The panel finds the claimant\u2019s explanation regarding his delay in claiming to be reasonable. The panel does not draw a negative inference regarding claimant\u2019s credibility.\nForward Facing Risk\n[25] The panel finds on a balance of probabilities that the claimant has been targeted by the Punjabi police at the behest of the family of XXXX XXXX XXXX who feels dishonored by the claimant\u2019s pre-marital relationship with their daughter that resulted in an aborted pregnancy.\n[26] According to Subsection 97(1)(b) of the IRPA, a person in need of protection is a person in Canada whose removal to their country or countries of nationality or, if they do not have a country of nationality, their country of former habitual residence, would subject them personally\nto a risk to their life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment ifthe person is unable or, because of that risk, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of that country,the risk would be faced by the person in every part of that country and is not faced generally by other individuals in or from that country,the risk is not inherent or incidental to lawful sanctions, unless imposed in disregard of accepted international standards, andthe risk is not caused by the inability of that country to provide adequate health or medical care.[ix][27] The risk to life, a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or death faced by the claimants is captured by subsection 97(1)(b) of the IRPA.\n[28] The initial basis for the risk arose from the claimant\u2019s pre-marital relationship family with XXXX XXXX XXXX whose family seek revenge against the claimant for dishonoring them.\n[29] The claimant has established on a balance of probability that he is personally at risk. The panel finds that the assault on the claimant in XXXX 2016 by two men who were instructed by XXXX to kill him, and the application of acid on the claimant\u2019s hand XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, indicates a high degree of the risk identified above.\n[30] Objective evidence corroborates the claimant\u2019s subjective fear of honor killing. It is reported that \u201c\u2018Honour killings\u2019 do take place in India in cases of alleged adultery, premarital relationships, rape or falling in love against family wishes\u201d.[x] Between 2014 and 2016, India\u2019s Supreme Court registered 288 cases of such killings.[xi] A report by the Law Commission of India indicates that honour-based violence are under-reported, and honour-related murders are often reported as suicides or as accidents. It is reported that the harmful traditional practise has remained persistent in the country.[xii]\n[31] Further objective evidence supports the claimant\u2019s fear of how the Indian police treat suspects. The prevalence of corruption within the Indian police and the judicial system is highlighted with bribery reported to be prevalent.[xiii] It is reported that unwarranted arrests and maltreatment during police detentions are regular occurrences in India.[xiv] All this documentary evidence serves as an objective basis for the claimant\u2019s fear and corroborates his allegations.\n[32] The panel finds that risk is not faced generally by other individuals in or from that country, as per section (97)(1)(b)(ii). The panel finds that the claimant has been targeted by XXXX XXXX XXXX family who has blamed the claimant for tarnishing the reputation of their family, socially and politically. They have gone further by influencing the Punjab police to seek the whereabout of the claimant. The panel finds that these circumstances change the nature of the claimant\u2019s risk from a generalized risk of indiscriminate crime or police harassment to a non-generalized risk particular to him.\n[33] Likewise, the panel finds that the risk faced by the claimant is neither inherent or incidental to lawful sanctions, as per section (97)(1)(b)(iii) since there is no evidence that he has committed a crime for which he is legally wanted, nor the risk the claimant faces caused by the inability of the country of reference to provide adequate health or medical care, as per section (97)(1)(b)(iv).\n[34] Based on the evidence before the panel, as well as the credible evidence of the claimant that he has been targeted by the police at the behest of XXXX brother and father, the panel finds that the claimant has established the objective basis of his claim and has further established on a balance of probabilities, that the risk he faces is one that is personal to him, and it is not a risk faced generally by the population of India.\nState Protection\n[35] The panel finds there is clear and convincing evidence that the state is unable or unwilling to provide the claimant with adequate protection.\n[36] States are presumed to be capable of protecting their citizens, except in situations where the country is in a state of complete breakdown. The responsibility to provide international (or surrogate) protection only becomes engaged when national or state protection is unavailable to the claimant. To rebut the presumption of state protection, a claimant must provide \u201cclear and convincing\u201d evidence of the state\u2019s inability to protect its citizens. A claimant is required to approach the state for protection if protection might reasonably be forthcoming. However, a claimant is not required to risk their life seeking ineffective protection of a state, merely to demonstrate that ineffectiveness.[xv]\n[37] The claimant testified that the Punjabi police have been to his parents\u2019 home to inquire about his whereabouts. He testified that he cannot live anywhere in India safely due to the quest by the family of XXXX to redeem their family dignity by killing him for impregnating their daughter, and their involvement of the Punjabi police in seeking his whereabouts. The claimant\u2019s parents attested in an affidavit, that the Punjab police are seeking the whereabout of the claimant under the influence of XXXX family. The panel has no evidence to indicate that the police search for the claimant, is consequent to his being charged with an offence relating to his relationship with XXXX.\n[38] Objective evidence indicates that the police, just like the judicial system, is riddled with corruption, with bribes and irregular payments exchanging hands in return for influencing the redress system and obtaining favourable court decisions.[xvi] It is reported that widespread human right abuses are conducted with impunity by the police. It is further reported these abuses include arbitrary detention, torture, kidnappings, and extra-judicial killings.[xvii]\n[39] Given the claimant\u2019s testimony, and the attestation from his parent, the panel concludes that on a balance of probabilities, the claimant faces persecution in the hands of the Punjabi police as agents of the state, at the behest of the family of XXXX XXXX XXXX.\n[40] The panel finds that the presumption of state protection is rebutted in this case. Since the state through the Punjabi police is an agent of persecution, the panel finds that it would be objectively unreasonable for the claimant to seek the protection of the state considering his particular circumstances.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[41] For a viable IFA to exist, two things must be the case. First, the claimants must not face a serious possibility of persecution or, on a balance of probabilities, a danger of torture, risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual punishment in the proposed IFA location. Second, it must not be objectively unreasonable in all the circumstances for the claimant to seek refuge there. Once an IFA has been proposed, the onus is on the claimant to establish that the proposed IFA is not viable. The standard of objective unreasonableness for a proposed IFA is high and requires proof of adverse conditions which would jeopardize the life and safety of the claimant in travelling to and in living in the proposed IFA location.[xviii]\n[42] The panel considered whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for the claimant in Dharamshala, Jaipur and New Delhi.\n[43] The panel finds that the claimant has established that on a balance of probabilities, he faces serious possibility of persecution in the proposed IFA.\nFirst Prong: Is it safe for the claimant to relocate in India?\n[44] The claimant was asked if he has been to Dharamshala, Jaipur or New Delhi before. He testified that he had been to New Delhi when the agent facilitated his exit from India. He was asked if either of the IFAs would be a safe location for him. The claimant testified that he fears that the XXXX family and the police will find him anywhere in India.\n[45] To assess whether the claimant would be at risk of harm in the IFA location, the panel considered whether the evidence indicates that the family of XXXX XXXX XXXX have the motivation and interest to continue pursuing the claimant.\n[46] The claimant was asked by why he believes that the XXXX brother and family would still be interested in harming him after more than three years, he testified that his parents told him the agents of harm went looking for him about three months ago. The claimant testified that XXXX family are politically active and influential. The claimant did not provide any evidence to establish how XXXX family would be able to influence the Youth Congress and the Congress Party in Dharamshala, Jaipur or New Delhi to harm him.\n[47] The panel further considered whether the agents of persecution have the means to locate the claimant. The claimant testified that if he were to move to any of the proposed IFAs, he would have to submit identifications before he is able to rent an accommodation and that such identification would be subjected to verification with the police in Punjab. He further testified that as soon as the local police receives information about his whereabout, XXXX family would be aware of his location. He stated that XXXX family would then utilise their connections with the Youth Congress and the National Congress Party to influence the police to arrest the claimant wherever he is.\n[48] The panel accepts the claimant\u2019s allegations that he has been targeted by Punjabi police at the behest of XXXX family. Although the claimant did not provide any evidence to establish that he is legally and officially wanted by the police, the panel is mindful of objective evidence that \u201cpolice authorities in India are able to track and locate persons of interest, depending on the heinousness of the crime and the pressure received from political authorities\u201d.[xix] It is reported that the police in India are susceptible to endemic corruption which results in the undue influence of the police by those able to afford bribes that may be demanded.[xx] Even though the tenant registration system is noted as limited in its effectiveness, it is reported that it can be used to verify the history of any tenant \u201cwhether the person had any criminal involvement or absconding from other states\u201d[xxi].\n[49] Based on the testimony that XXXX family together have been seeking the claimant\u2019s whereabout to redeem the perceived tarnished image of their family, the objective evidence already cited about honor killings in India, and the allegations that the Punjab police are seeking to know the claimant\u2019s whereabout at the behest of XXXX family, the panel finds that on a balance of probabilities, XXXX family have sufficient interest and motivation to continue to seek the claimant\u2019s whereabout in India.\n[50] Furthermore, the panel finds on a balance of probabilities that if the claimant\u2019s identity is verified through the tenant registration system with the Punjab police, the Punjab police under obligation to XXXX family may divulge knowledge of the claimant\u2019s location in India, thereby providing a means for XXXX family as agents of persecution to locate and harm the claimant in the proposed IFAs.\n[51] Based on the evidence before it, the panel finds that the claimant has provided sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the agents of persecution are motivated and have the capacity to locate and harm him in the proposed IFA. Accordingly, the panel finds that the claimant does face a serious possibility of persecution in India.\n[52] Given the findings on the first prong of the IFA test, the panel finds that there is no viable internal flight alternative for the claimant within his country, and there is no need to examine the second prong of the IFA test.\nCONCLUSION\n[53] Considering the preceding, the panel concludes that the claimant has established that he is a person in need of protection, pursuant to section 97(1)(b) of the IRPA. The panel therefore accepts his claim.\n(signed) Olukunle Ojeleye\nSeptember 27, 2022\n\n[i] Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n\n[ii] Exhibit 4.\n\n[iii] Exhibit 2.\n\n[iv] Exhibit 1.\n\n[v] Exhibit 5.\n\n[vi] Kang, Hardip Kaur v.

These are the reasons for the decision in the claim of XXXX XXXX, a citizen of Nepal, who is seeking protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. In rendering my reasons today, I have considered and applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guidelines on women refugee claimants fearing gender related persecution.\nAllegations\n[2] The claimant\u2019s allegations are contained in full in her Basis of Claim form and very detailed narrative which can be found in Exhibit 2. Summarized only briefly, the claimant alleges that she is at risk of persecution in Nepal from persons associated or affiliated with Maoist groups because of her involvement with and support of the Nepal Women\u2019s Association which is women network of the Nepali Congress Party. The claimant is a known women\u2019s rights activist in Nepal. The claimant alleges that she has been threatened, extorted and physically attacked by Maoist persons in the past and that the attackers continue to pursue her in that country.\nDetermination\n[3] I find the claimant is a Convention refugee. I find the claimant has established her claim has a nexus to the Convention ground of political opinion. I have therefore assessed this claim under section 96 of the Act.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[4] I find the claimant has established her identity on a balance of probabilities by her testimony and by the copy of her passport which can be found in Exhibit 1.\nCredibility\n[5] Pursuant to the Maldonado principle, the claimant benefits from a presumption that her allegations are true. In this case, I have no reason to doubt the truthfulness of the claimant. She testified in a straightforward manner and there were no relevant inconsistencies in her testimony or contradictions between her testimony and the other evidence before me. She was detailed, passionate, consistent, forthcoming. Overall, I found the claimant to be a compelling witness and I believe what she has alleged.\n[6] The claimant also supported her allegations with significant evidence, including plenty of identification documents, certificates for work and promoting the rights of women in Nepal and for her involvement in politics, photographs of the claimant at political events including events where she was receiving honours, membership documents for the Women Network of the Nepali Congress Party, a copy of a press release by the Nepali Congress Party relating to the claimant\u2019s work in Nepali, a threat letter from a communist party of Nepal, police report, medical records, and a supporting statement from the claimant\u2019s husband. I have no reason to doubt the authenticity of these documents. I assign them significant weight as they help establish the material elements of the claimant\u2019s allegations, namely her political opinion and the risks she faces in Nepal on the basis of this opinion.\n[7] I have considered whether the claimant\u2019s failure to claim in Canada and her subsequent twice return to Nepal undermines the credibility of the claimant\u2019s subjective fear and I find it does not. The claimant made two trips to Canada before her current trip where she made her claim for protection. She first arrived in Canada in XXXX 2018 and returned to Nepal in XXXX 2018. On the second trip, she arrived in Canada in XXXX 2019 and again returned to Nepal in XXXX 2020. The claimant finally fled for the last time in XXXX 2020.\n[8] The claimant testified that her first return was because her visa had run out in Canada and she was hopeful the situation would have tempered in Nepal after a period of time had passed. She states she was hopeful because there had been no indications that Maoist persons had been pursuing her since leaving Nepal. Further, the claimant testified that her second return was because her husband had been in a serious motorcycle accident and she had no choice but to return to care for him and her family. She also testified to having read about Maoist members being arrested by the state. During the last trip to Nepal, the claimant took efforts to minimize her movements. Unfortunately, it was during this second trip when the claimant herself was viciously assaulted and hospitalized by Maoist persons.\n[9] While it is disappointing that the claimant would return to a country that she fears, I find that ultimately the evidence before me does establish on a balance that the claimant subjectively fears a return to Nepal and that she has been targeted by Maoist factions for her political activism. On a balance of probabilities and in considering the circumstances of this case, I find it reasonable that the claimant would be hopeful that the situation would become safer in Nepal. I also accept that she believed, however misplaced, that her risk had subsided at the time that she returned for the first time. Obviously, for me it\u2019s clear that she\u2019s passionate about the work she does in Nepal. I also find that in the face of an exceptional family emergency, her return to care for her husband and her family was reasonable. I do not make a negative inference against the claimant for her failure to claim in Canada earlier or for her return to Nepal in light of the circumstances of this case.\n[10] I find the claimant has established her subjective fear and risk profile on a balance of probabilities. I find the claimant is a political activist in Nepal and a supporter of the Women\u2019s Association and vis-a-vie the Congress Party. I find she has a higher profile, given she has been publicly acknowledged for her political work. I find she has been targeted by Maoist persons threatened, assaulted and extorted. Further, I find these agents of persecution do continue to pursue and threaten the claimant in Nepal and that she fears persecution by these groups should she return.\nObjective Basis\n[11] The country condition evidence is outlined in the National Documentation Package (NDP) which is in Exhibit 3 and supports the claimant\u2019s allegations regarding the treatment of political members of the Nepal Congress such as the claimant herself. In Item 4.7 of the NDP, sources report that factions of Maoists described as a dissenting splinter group from the ruling Maoist party engaged in a pattern of kidnapping and extortion against various targets. Item 4.6 of the NDP likewise details instances of violence and extortion committed by a number of groups in Nepal, including the youth communist league which the claimant spoke about today and the Nepal Communist Party of Maoist individuals. It goes on to note that political pressure and corruption means that law enforcement is largely not able to serve the public or protect them. These attacks were often against supporters of the Nepali Congress Party like the claimant herself.\n[12] According to Item 4.4 of the NDP, political incidents were the primary driver of violent incidents in Nepal and also made up the majority of non-violent incidents. This report notes activities by Maoist splinter groups to attempt to disrupt the election processes. Moreover, as of 2019, the situation in Nepal is growing worse with an increase of both violent and non-violence incidents.\n[13] According to an RIR at Item 4.7 of the NDP, a hard line communist faction of Maoists have been involved in kidnapping and extortion. The faction of Biplav Maoists make coercive demands for donation. The extent is under-reported as victims do not seek \u2014 often do not seek the assistance of police out of fear of a violent backlash from the Maoist groups. Party cadres have made threatening visits, phone calls and sent letters and texts seeking funds. Biplav Maoists have also captured land from civilians and companies.\n[14] Given these country conditions and how they do corroborate material elements of the claimant\u2019s allegations herself, I find the claimant\u2019s fear of persecution because of her political opinion has an objective basis and is well-founded and forward facing.\nState Protection\n[15] There is a presumption that countries can protect their citizens unless there\u2019s clear and convincing evidence otherwise. In this case, based on the aforementioned objective evidence, I find that there is clear and convincing evidence that the state is unable or unwilling to provide the claimant with adequate protection. As another example, Item 1.6 of the NDP states \u201cpolice effectiveness is limited by a lack of resources, corruption, nepotism and a culture of impunity, particularly among low-level officers. Nepali police agencies are hindered by a lack of adequate transportation, training and equipment\u201d. NDP Item 1.6 also states that many Nepalese have only limited access to justice and that courts are vulnerable to political pressure, bribery and intimidation.\n[16] In light of the circumstances and based on the objective evidence, I find that the adequate state protection would not be forthcoming to the claimant in Nepal. I note that the claimant did seek state protection on a number of occasions and the country condition evidence that I\u2019ve already cited applied in her case as well. I find the presumption of state protection therefore has been rebutted.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[17] I have also considered whether there is a viable Internal Flight Alternative available to this claimant. Based on the evidence in this file including a lack of reasonable state protection persisting throughout the country and the Maoist influence that continues also throughout the country, I find the claimant faces a serious possibility of persecution throughout Nepal. Further, I find the agents of persecution have demonstrated an ongoing motivation to continue to pursue this claimant in Nepal. I find, therefore, that she does not have a viable IFA in that country.\nCONCLUSION\n[18] Based on the foregoing analysis, I find the claimant is a Convention refugee and I accept her claim.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

In summary, in 2004 she married a man named XXXX XXXX (XXXX) and had two daughters with him. However, through means such as recording his conversations, the claimant learned by 2013 that XXXX is gay. XXXX was threatened by this and told the claimant to move out, and he said that if the claimant told anyone about his sexuality, he would kill her.\n[4] XXXX divorced the claimant; the divorce was finalized in XXXX 2014, with XXXX having full custody of their children. The claimant continued receiving phone calls from XXXX threatening that he would kill her if she tried to come near their daughters or if she told anyone about his sexuality. In XXXX 2014, the claimant met a man named XXXX XXXX (XXXX) who lived in the United States of America (USA) and was visiting his father in Lebanon. They began dating.\n[5] In XXXX 2015, the claimant went to the USA, and soon her mother, brothers and sister also moved there. The claimant reconciled with XXXX, and in XXXX 2015 they were married. XXXX applied to sponsor the claimant as a US permanent resident, but this application was denied twice, in 2018 and in XXXX 2019. The second denial letter said that XXXX had gone on vacation with another woman. This notice ended their marriage, and the claimant returned to her parents\u2019 house in Michigan.\n[6] The claimant realized that she would be forced to return to Lebanon, and she was barred from making a refugee claim in the USA. She decided to come to Canada, and on XXXX XXXX, 2019, she entered Canada irregularly by boat. She alleges that she cannot return to Lebanon, as she fears violence and persecution by XXXX and his contacts, and because she would be at risk as a divorced woman in Lebanon.\nDecision\n[7] I find that the claimant is a refugee, pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA, as there exists a serious possibility of persecution, should she return to Lebanon, on account of being a member of a particular social group as a woman fearing gender-based persecution.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[8] I find that the claimant\u2019s identity as a national of Lebanon is established by the documents provided, particularly a certified true copy of her passport in Exhibit 1.\n[9] I note that the claimant lived in the USA from XXXX 2015 to XXXX 2019. However, this does not constitute a country of reference, considering the evidence that she only had temporary status in that country.\nCredibility\n[10] When a claimant swears to the truth of certain allegations, this creates a presumption that those allegations are true unless there be reason to doubt their truthfulness.[3] However this presumption does not apply to inferences or speculation.\n[11] I find the claimant to be a credible witness and therefore believe what she alleged in support of her claim. She testified in a straightforward manner, and there were no relevant inconsistencies in her testimony or contradictions between her testimony and the other evidence before me.\n[12] I note that the claimant did not seek asylum in the USA when she was there from XXXX 2015 to XXXX 2019. However, the claimant\u2019s evidence is that she married XXXX, an American citizen, in XXXX 2015, and he sponsored her for permanent residence as his spouse. By the time U.S. authorities denied their application for the second time, in XXXX 2019, the claimant was barred from making an asylum claim because more than one year had elapsed following her entry to the USA. This is consistent with my understanding of USA immigration law, so this explanation seems reasonable in the claimant\u2019s alleged circumstances, and therefore does not raise significant concerns with respect to subjective fear or credibility. I find it was reasonable for the claimant not to apply for asylum during this time, because she married a U.S. citizen and she had status while waiting for a decision about her application for permanent residence.\n[13] The claimant disclosed documents in support of her claim. These include, in Exhibit 5, a translated divorce certificate at pages 5-6, a translated letter from her sister XXXX at pages 48-51, a translated letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX at pages 52-54, a letter from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to XXXX at pages 8-15, and copies of counselling and psychotherapy records. In Exhibit 6, the claimant disclosed a photograph of herself with a translation of the handwritten caption. The divorce certificate corroborates the claimant\u2019s relationship with XXXX, and the two letters from XXXX and XXXX both corroborate the threats from XXXX to which the claimant was subjected. The U.S. immigration letter corroborates the claimant\u2019s activities in the USA and the reasons she left for Canada. The counselling and psychotherapy records also corroborate the claimant\u2019s account of her treatment by XXXX and her fear of returning to Lebanon, and the photograph corroborates the claimant\u2019s description of a threatening note that was left on her door in XXXX 2015. After reviewing the documents, I have no reasons to doubt their authenticity.\n[14] Considering the evidence, I find on a balance of probabilities that the claimant endured a history of mistreatment from XXXX including physical violence, and that he divorced the claimant while keeping custody of their children. I find that the claimant believes XXXXto be gay or bisexual, and that XXXXhas threatened the claimant multiple times, including threats to kill her, if she discusses his sexuality or if she tries to see their daughters.\nObjective basis\n[15] The objective evidence provides support for the allegation that XXXXfears being perceived as a gay man in Lebanon.\n[16] Item 6.4 in the National Documentation Package (NDP) notes how the LGBTQ community is ostracised in Lebanon. While there may be growing acceptance in Beirut, the report also describes police abuses against LGBTQ individuals, raids on LGBTQ establishments, and it states that LGBTQ individuals are unable to live openly in Beirut without facing severe harassment and discrimination. \u201cHomosexuality in Lebanon is illegal, and social stigma of same-sex relationships persists, especially in conservative areas.\u201d[4]\n[17] Item 6.5 in the NDP reiterates much of this and notes that LGBTQ individuals are highly vulnerable to both state and social violence because of their sexual orientation. This report also talks about the risk of individuals who are part of the LGBTQ community to face family violence, which may include death threats, physical abuse, or being shunned.\n[18] I find, based on the objective evidence, that the claimant has a well-founded fear of persecution based on her status as a woman in Lebanon. Gender-based violence in Lebanon is tolerated, ignored, and perpetuated in Lebanese society. The claimant\u2019s BOC and testimony referred to multiple incidents of verbal and physical abuse by XXXX, who also controlled other aspects of her life such as not wanting her to finish high school. XXXXthreats continued after they divorced, even when she changed her phone number, and the claimant fears that he will one day follow through with his death threats.\n[19] This past abuse demonstrates a prospect of continued violence that can be characterized as serious, sustained, and systematic human rights violations amounting to persecution. As the claimant\u2019s fear of persecution is based on her membership in a particular social group, her allegations form a nexus to the Convention. The objective evidence corroborates the fact that gender-based violence in Lebanon is a serious problem.\n[20] A Response to Information Request (RIR) cites an estimate that one woman a month is killed by a family member in Lebanon, usually her husband.[5] It goes on to state that gender-based violence is serious and widespread, and women are also victims of discrimination both in law and practice. Furthermore, women cannot depend on family to prevent violence as they rarely receive their family\u2019s support. Finally, the RIR finds that customs and beliefs have \u2018normalized\u2019 violence against women in Lebanon.\n[21] The RIR indicates that Lebanese women are victims of discrimination in both law and practice. It describes how there are no official statistics on domestic violence in Lebanon and cites a UN report stating that \u201cgender-based violence is prevalent in Lebanon in different forms, including domestic\/marital physical, sexual and psychological violence.\u201d The RIR quotes another source who states that \u201cthere was a broad consensus that domestic violence, including spousal abuse, was a serious and widespread problem in the country.\u201d[6]\n[22] The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) reports that until recently, discussion of gender-based violence was subject to strong taboos, considered to be private and a matter of concern only for religious courts.[7] It indicates that there are no official national statistics on the prevalence of gender-based violence and notes that the issue of violence against women is largely ignored by local and religious authorities. The report goes on to describe how \u201chonour crimes\u201d are difficult to measure, but 66 women were identified as being murdered in an \u201chonour crime\u201d over an 8-year period.[8]\n[23] The U.S. Department of State (DOS) reports that the law criminalizes domestic violence, calls for provision of shelters, gives women the ability to file a restraining order against the abuser, and assigns special units within the ISF to receive domestic violence complaints. However, although the law provides for a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison for battery, religious courts could cite personal status law to require a battered wife to return to a home shared with her abuser. Some police, especially in rural areas, treated domestic violence as a social, rather than criminal, matter.[9]\n[24] The Australia Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) states that according to international observers, despite many advantages and acquired rights, women in Lebanon continue to face discrimination at numerous levels.[10] It reports that a Domestic Violence Law was passed in 2014, but a March 2018 Human Rights Watch (HRW) report noted that the Domestic Violence Law did not require religious courts to adhere to civil court rulings relating to domestic violence, leaving women trapped in abusive marriages; and that some religious courts issue obedience and cohabitation rulings against women, requiring them to return to the marital home.\n[25] Documents disclosed by the claimant also support the risk to the claimant as a woman in Lebanon. One February 2021 article at pages 7-9 of Exhibit 5 notes that, according to the Internal Security Forces (ISF), \u201ccases of domestic violence against women skyrocketed by 96% during Lebanon\u2019s strictest lockdown.\u201d A December 2021 article at pages 10-15 of Exhibit 5 reported that figures shared by the ISF said that domestic violence reports in Lebanese homes doubled in the previous year. The article quoted one lawyer who said, \u201cWe have never witnessed this much violence against women.\u201d\n[26] The evidence reveals that domestic violence in Lebanon is widespread. Based on the past violence suffered by the claimant, the threats to harm her further and the treatment of women in Lebanon generally, I find that there is a serious possibility of persecution if she returns to her country.\nState Protection\n[27] I find that there is no operationally effective state protection for the claimant in Lebanon.\n[28] While the U.S. DOS report for Lebanon at item 2.1, indicates that Lebanon criminalizes domestic violence, the law provides for shelters and protections, and Lebanon is making progress in improving the police and judicial management of domestic cases, the report also states that \u201cNGOs and activists criticized the domestic violence law, claiming that it does not sufficiently protect victims or punish abusers, who they alleged often received disproportionately light sentences.\u201d[11]\n[29] The RIR at item 5.2 quotes a report that states that \u201cin most cases, police ignored complaints submitted by battered or abused women.\u201d Another source stated that \u201ceven tough\nwomen could theoretically go to a police station in order to submit a complaint against anyone who subjects them to violence, it rarely happens because women know that they do not have legal protection against domestic violence\u201d and that source goes on to indicate that police often do not take complaints of these women seriously.[12] This is consistent with the claimant\u2019s testimony that following one incident when XXXXhit and threatened her in about 2014, she went to the police to make a written complaint, but they made excuses and did not help.\n[30] The OECD report at item 5.3 indicates that while some shelters exist that are run by NGOs, overall capacity to house victims is limited. The report also indicates concerns with the lengthy process required for a woman to obtain a protection order in the country.[13]\n[31] The country condition documents indicate that the government in Lebanon has taken steps with respect to gender-based violence. I considered that state protection does not mean that the state must provide perfect protection or always be successful in providing protection, but that it must be adequate. However, the country conditions documents, as a whole, indicate that those steps have not translated to operationally effective state protection.\n[32] Given the country conditions, I find that the claimant has rebutted the presumption of state protection with clear and convincing evidence establishing that there is no operationally effective state protection available to her in Lebanon.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[33] I also examined whether a viable internal flight alternative (IFA) exists for the claimant. Potential IFA locations of Tripoli and Tyre were identified at the start of the hearing. The test is comprised of two prongs, both of which must be satisfied before an internal flight alternative can be found. The first is that the claimant is not at risk of persecution, torture, or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in the internal flight location; the second is that it is not objectively unreasonable for the claimant to relocate there.\n[34] The second prong of the IFA test may be stated as follows: would it be unduly harsh to expect the claimant to move to another, less hostile part of the country before seeking refugee status abroad? The courts have set a very high threshold for what makes an IFA unreasonable in all the circumstances. (Thirunavukkarasu [1994] 1 F.C. 589 (C.A.))\n[35] On the evidence before me, I find that it would be objectively unreasonable for the claimant, in all the circumstances, including those specific to her, to relocate to another place in Lebanon.\n[36] In North America the claimant worked XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, but as of the hearing date, she is a 39-year-old high school graduate who has never held a job in Lebanon. The only relative she has remaining in Lebanon is a sister, who is trying to leave the country. The claimant\u2019s ability to support herself in another city is therefore quite limited, particularly given income inequality and other disadvantages women experience.\n[37] The claimant testified that Lebanon is a small country and anywhere she went, XXXXwould find out. She said that XXXXhas acquaintances and contacts at the airport and in the government, and her counsel submits that eventually someone will recognize the claimant and tell XXXXof her whereabouts.\n[38] The 2021 World Factbook for Lebanon found at item 1.5 indicates that Lebanon is a small country, approximately 10K square KMs, which is described as one-third the size of the state of Maryland, and roughly 5.5M people with the majority living in the capital Beirut.[14]\n[39] The DFAT report referred to earlier considers the ability of single women such as the claimant to relocate:\nDFAT assesses that the ease with which an individual is able to relocate internally depends to a large degree on their individual circumstances, including whether they have family or community connections in the intended area of relocation, and their financial situation. Internal relocation is generally easier for men and family groups. Single women, particularly those fleeing family violence, are less likely to have access to sufficient support services and are likely to face societal discrimination in the form of harassment, particularly in rural and more conservative areas.[15]\n[40] Given the size of Lebanon, the threats against the claimant, the fact that the claimant and her ex-husband are still in contact with their children, the prevalence of violence against women, and the lack of state protection noted previously, I find that the claimant would face a serious possibility of persecution throughout Lebanon. Accordingly, I find that there is no internal flight alternative available to the claimant in Lebanon.\nConclusion\n[41] Having considered all the evidence, I conclude that the claimant is a refugee, pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA. Accordingly, I accept her claim.\n(signed) Douglas Armstrong\nAugust 23, 2022\n\n[1] Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n[2] Exhibit 2.\n[3] Maldonado v.

He also fears gang members who have threatened to kill him because his brother informed on them while he was in prison.\nDETERMINATION\n[3] I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the Act.\n[4] In making this determination, I have reviewed and applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9: Proceedings before the IRB Involving Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Expression, and Sex Characteristics.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[5] I find that the claimant\u2019s identity as a national of Morocco is established on a balance of probabilities by his sworn testimony and the copy of his Moroccan passport and identification in evidence.[3]\nCountry of Reference\n[6] There was a question at the start of the hearing concerning whether the claimant might have a right to Algerian citizenship. The claimant was born in Morocco, but his parents were both born in Algeria.\n[7] The Algerian Nationality Law Article 6 (1) states that an individual born to an Algerian father is considered a national by descent.[4] As such, I would need to know the claimant\u2019s father\u2019s nationality to confirm whether the claimant has a right to Algerian citizenship.\n[8] I questioned the claimant about his citizenship and that of his parents. The claimant indicated they are all Moroccan. He stated that his parents were born in Algeria but are Moroccan and during Algerian independence they were displaced and sent back to Morocco. He indicated that he does not know what their status was in Algeria or why they were there. He has only met one of his grandparents and she is Moroccan.\n[9] During his counsel\u2019s questioning, the claimant confirmed that his parents are not Algerian citizens. When I asked him how he knew this, he said that he had seen on his mother\u2019s ID card when he was younger that she was born in Algeria and at that time he had asked her whether she had nationality there or a passport or any papers and she said no. He said he asked his father the same thing.\n[10] The claimant has not provided any affidavits or information from his parents concerning their Algerian citizenship. However, given that his allegations identify his father as an agent of harm, I find this to be reasonable. I asked the claimant whether he had tried to go to the Algerian consulate to ask about his status and he said that he had not. The claimant was sent a copy of the Algerian Nationality Law prior to the hearing; thus he would have been aware the question of his Algerian citizenship was in issue. However, I acknowledge that this was only sent three days prior to the hearing of this matter and so I find it reasonable that the claimant did not take these steps prior to the hearing.\n[11] Having reviewed all the evidence before me, I find on a balance of probabilities that Algeria is not a country of reference. While the claimant does not know much about his parents\u2019 status in Algeria, he did testify that they told him when he was younger that they did not have any nationality there. He also testified that his parents were displaced by the Algerian government back to Morocco, suggesting that they did not have any form of permanent status in Algeria.\nNexus\n[12] In order to satisfy the definition of a \u201cConvention refugee\u201d found in section 96 of the Act, a claimant must establish that he or she has a well-founded fear of persecution by reason of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion.\n[13] The claimant has alleged three different risks in this case. However, I have found the claimant\u2019s sexual orientation to be determinative of his claim. As such, for the purposes of this decision I have focused solely on the claimant\u2019s allegation concerning his sexual orientation. This allegation is connected to the convention on the basis of membership in a particular social group, namely sexual minorities. As such, I have assessed his claim under section 96.\nCredibility\n[14] When a claimant affirms to tell the truth, this creates a presumption of truthfulness unless there is evidence to the contrary. A finding that the claimant lacks credibility may be based on the failure of the claimant\u2019s account to stand up to scrutiny, or unexplained inconsistencies, omissions or contradictions.\n[15] In this case, the claimant provided a very sparse BOC narrative in which he identified that his father wanted to harm him because he was no longer a practicing Muslim and was gay, and that he was threatened by a gang member due to his brother\u2019s involvement in the drug trade. In his narrative, he referenced back to a submission letter written by his former counsel. The letter provided by counsel was in the form of submissions and not written in the claimant\u2019s words, as such, it could not be adopted by the claimant as his BOC narrative or evidence.\n[16] Prior to the hearing, the claimant\u2019s counsel was sent a letter identifying that former counsel\u2019s letter would be considered advanced submissions and outlining the requirements of a BOC. The claimant did not submit an updated BOC statement prior to the hearing, and he did not indicate that he needed to make any amendments to the BOC at the start of the hearing.\n[17] Despite this, I have found the claimant to be a credible witness concerning his sexual orientation. Both myself and his counsel questioned the claimant on his sexual orientation and the claimant\u2019s testimony remained consistent throughout with no major omissions or contradictions. I have also relied on Guideline 9 in making my credibility findings.\n[18] The claimant testified credibly about having a difficult childhood filled with mocking and sarcasm because of the way he dressed and spoke. This is supported by an affidavit from the claimant\u2019s uncle (his mother\u2019s brother).[5] This bullying increased when he was around 15 or 16, after which time the claimant was involved in weekly fights. He tried to change the things about him that made him look gay and avoided talking about his sexual needs. The claimant had only two friends in school, and they were gay. One left school and the claimant lost communication with him and the other one had to change schools because of the bullying, fights, and mockery.\n[19] The claimant testified that he realized he was gay when he was around 14 or 15 years old. He had had feelings prior to this but was not sure. It was at this time that he noticed that he was attracted to another boy at his school and that he did not have the same feelings towards women that his friends did. The claimant was genuine when he described that the first impression that he had when he realized that he was gay was that there was something wrong inside of him. Later, when he came to Canada and saw how the LGBTQ community lived freely and happily, he realized that the problem was not with him but with his country and community.\n[20] The claimant also credibly testified about his same-sex relationships. The first occurring when he was about 15 years old. The claimant and his boyfriend at the time had a difficult time continuing their relationship and keeping it secret. They decided to separate after a short time because of the pressure on their relationship and the concern that they would be found out. The claimant was nervous to start any other relationships in Morocco because he felt that they would end the same way as his first.\n[21] The claimant had one relationship in Canada. He met this individual in the gym at the beginning of the pandemic. The relationship did not last because they were not able to meet very often, however they continue to be friends. The claimant credibility testified about how this individual did not know that he was gay when they first met and that he felt that their relationship was special because it helped him to realize his sexual orientation. I asked the claimant whether he had asked this individual to write an affidavit in support of his claim and he said he did not. He offered to obtain this affidavit post-hearing; however, I find that any weight that I could place on such evidence would be limited given it is being provided after the hearing has already been conducted.\n[22] Initially the claimant did have some difficulties answering his counsel\u2019s questions related to his sexual activities. He first stated that had not had sexual relationships with men, and then later said that he had. Then he stated that he was only able to meet with his boyfriend in Morocco during school hours and not outside of school. But he later said that they had sex at his boyfriend\u2019s house but were not able to go out in public. I acknowledge these inconsistencies; however, I rely on Guideline 9 section 3.3:\nMany SOGIESC individuals conceal their SOGIESC in their country of reference out of mistrust or fear of repercussion by state and non-stat actors, or due to previous experiences of stigmatization and violence. These circumstances may manifest themselves as an individual being reluctant to discuss or having difficulty discussing their SOGIESC with a member based on fear or general mistrust of authority figures, particularly where intolerance or punishment of SOGIESC individuals are sanctioned by state officials in an individual\u2019s country of reference.\n[23] In this case I found counsel\u2019s questioning about the claimant\u2019s sexual activity to be very direct and it appeared to make the claimant uncomfortable. The claimant comes from a background of having to hide his sexual orientation for fear of reprisal and physical harm. This is the first time that he was speaking openly to authority figures about his sexual orientation in a formal setting. The questions that he was being asked were very intimate. As such, I find on a balance of probabilities that the claimant\u2019s difficulty in answering questions concerning his sexual activity can be attributed to the reasoning identified above and does not negatively impact his credibility concerning his sexual orientation. Further, I find that the claimant\u2019s sexual activity is not determinative of his sexual orientation and that the claimant was credible concerning other elements of his relationships as outlined above.\n[24] I have also considered the claimant\u2019s documentary evidence which is corroborative of his claim. Particularly the letters from his brother-in-law, sister, and friends and neighbours here in Canada which all identify the claimant\u2019s sexual orientation.[6] I acknowledge that the claimant\u2019s uncle\u2019s letter does not explicitly state that the claimant is gay. I find that this is reasonable given the fact that the claimant hid his sexual orientation in Morocco. I have no reason to doubt the veracity of these support letters.\n[25] The claimant submitted two letters from a deputy Imam at his mosque.[7] In one of these letters the deputy Imam describes that the claimant told him that he was \u201calmost gay\u201d and says that he was convinced at that time that he was gay. I place no weight on these letters as I find on a balance of probabilities that they are fraudulent. When questioned about them the claimant first said that he got them personally from the deputy Imam. When it was pointed out to him that the letters were dated after he was in Canada, he said that he must have been mistaken and that his mom obtained these letters. I find it unreasonable that the claimant would have forgotten whether he was the one that personally obtained these letters from the deputy Imam. When I asked why there were two, he said that the deputy Imam gave them two letters to choose from and that his sister accidentally sent both in as part of his evidence. The claimant was not able to explain why the deputy Imam provided two letters. I find that this puts these letters further into question as the claimant had testified that he did not have a strong relationship with the deputy Imam.\n[26] For the foregoing reasons, I find that the letters are fraudulent and place no weight in them. However, while the claimant may have submitted these fraudulent letters to bolster his claim, I do not find that this alone is sufficient to rebut the presumption of credibility with regards to the claimant\u2019s sexual orientation. While these letters briefly mention the claimant\u2019s presumed sexual orientation, they mainly focus on the claimant\u2019s allegation regarding not being a practicing Muslim. I therefore find that the fraudulent nature of these letters speaks more to the claimant\u2019s credibility regarding his religion rather than his sexual orientation. There are several other supporting letters provided by the claimant from family, friends and neighbours in Canada that explicitly identify his sexual orientation which I find to be genuine. These letters are varied, each has a unique voice and uses different language, they are all signed and provide the contact information of the letter writer. Pursuant to Guideline 9 part 3, I find it reasonable that the claimant would be able to obtain more reliable information concerning his sexual orientation from individuals in Canada, given that he was concealing his sexual orientation in Morocco. Further the claimant\u2019s testimony regarding his sexual orientation was authentic and consistent throughout the hearing. As such, I find the claimant to be credible regarding his sexual orientation.\nSubjective Fear\n[27] The claimant went to visit his sister in Canada in 2016. It was at that time when he first realized that he could live freely as a gay man in Canada. However, he was still in school, so he returned to Morocco, but thought about going back to Canada once he finished school. The claimant fled Morocco at the time that he did because things came to a head with his father. The claimant had been getting in regular fights at school and the principle contacted his father and told him about the rumours that the claimant was gay. It was at this time that the claimant\u2019s father became convinced that the claimant was gay, and the claimant revealed his sexual orientation to his father. This resulted in a serious argument during which his father tried to beat him. He asked his sister for help, and she bought tickets for him and his mother (who was supportive of him) to come to Canada. The claimant did not try to leave earlier because he had not revealed his sexual orientation prior to this and was still trying to hide it to fit in with his community. I find the claimant\u2019s explanation regarding why he did not leave Morocco sooner to be reasonable and that it does not negatively impact his subjective fear. The claimant was young and trying to hide his sexual orientation.\n[28] When he came to Canada the claimant was not aware of the option to ask for asylum until he consulted with counsel sometime in 2019. The claimant\u2019s visitor status expired on XXXX XXXX, 2020. The claimant applied for refugee protection on XXXX XXXX, 2021. The claimant testified that he had the intention of staying in Canada permanently and that was why he was trying to extend his visitor visa in order to prepare for asylum. While the claimant did not specifically mention it in his answer, I take notice of the fact that the period between when the claimant\u2019s visitor status expired and when he applied for refugee protection as in the middle of the pandemic when a number of services were unavailable. Given this, I find the claimant\u2019s delay in seeking protection to be reasonable.\n[29] Ultimately, while I acknowledge issues with the claimant\u2019s evidence outlined above none of these issues rebut the presumption of credibility with regards to the claimant\u2019s sexual orientation and are insufficient to reject his assertions about his sexuality. Given my finding concerning the claimant\u2019s credible testimony and credible supporting letters from friends and family in Canada, I find on a balance of probabilities that the claimant is a gay man.\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution and Risk of Harm\n[30] To be considered a Convention Refugee, the claimant must demonstrate that he has a well-founded fear of persecution which includes both subjective fear and an objective basis for that fear. Based on the claimant\u2019s BOC, testimony, documentary evidence and the National Documentation Packages (\u201cNDP\u201d) for Morocco[8], I find that the claimant does have a well-founded fear of persecution in Morocco.\n[31] Morocco criminalizes same-sex sexual activity with a maximum sentence of three years in prison for violations. In 2019, 122 individuals were prosecuted under this law. Societally there are reports of overt discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity in employment, housing and health care.[9] The Danish Immigration services cites that \u201cparts of the population in Morocco are very hostile towards LGBTQ persons including public demonstrations, violent intrusions into private homes and public denunciations.\u201d Gay men, especially those who are perceived as effeminate are most likely to be victims of physical assaults. LGBTQ people report being cautious about how they walk, talk and behave in public places in order to avoid homophobic violence.[10] This is corroborative of the claimant\u2019s experiences as a gay man hiding his sexuality in Morocco.\n[32] Guideline 9 states, an individual\u2019s profile may be sufficient to demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution in their country of reference given conditions that may include discriminatory laws, or at atmosphere of intolerance and repression. It also states that being compelled to conceal one\u2019s sexual orientation constitutes a serious interference with fundamental human rights that may amount to persecution and a claimant cannot be expected to conceal their sexuality to avoid persecution.\n[33] I find on a balance of probabilities that LGBTQ people face a significant risk of violence, arrest and conviction in Morocco due to their sexuality and that these conditions would compel the claimant to conceal his sexual orientation in an attempt to protect his physical safety. For these reasons, I find the claimant faces a serious possibility of persecution for reason of his sexual orientation in Morocco.\nState Protection and Internal Flight Alternative\n[34] There is a presumption that countries can protect their citizens. The claimant bears the burden of rebutting that presumption.\n[35] In this case, the state is one of the agents of persecution and they have effective control over all their territory. The Danish Immigration service has identified that it is almost impossible for an LGBTQ person fearing for his or her safety to obtain efficient protection by police in Morocco and that they would face arrest or stereotypical questions and prejudice.[11] I therefore find that the presumption of state protection is rebutted and there is no viable internal flight alternative for the claimant.\nCONCLUSION\n[36] For the forgoing reasons, I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to s. 96 of the Act. The claim is therefore accepted.\n(signed) Katarina Bogojevic\nMay 11, 2022\n\n[1] Immigration and Refugee Protection Act,S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n[2] Exhibit 2.\n[3] Exhibit 1.\n[4] Exhibit 4.\n[5] Exhibit 7.\n[6] Exhibits 7 to 9.\n[7] Exhibit 7.\n[8] Exhibit 3.\n[9] National Documentation Package, Morocco, 31 May 2021, tab 2.1: Morocco.

Odigie\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Alastair Clarke\nCountry: Ghana\nRPD Number: VC1-06738\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2022-01960\nATIP Pages: N\/A\nREASONS FOR DECISION\nINTRODUCTION\n[1] This is the decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) in the claim of XXXX XXXX (the \u2018claimant\u2019) as a citizen of Ghana who is claiming refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (the \u201cAct\u201d)[1].\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] The specifics of the claim are stated in the claimant Basis of Claim (BOC) forms[2] and narrative in evidence.[3] The claimant alleges that he will be persecuted if he returns to Ghana because his stepmothers and half siblings have refused to share the inheritance with him and have accused him of witchcraft. The claimant was born in XXXX, Ashanti region of Ghana and grew up after his mother\u2019s death with his father. He attended elementary school and thereafter took up farming with his father. The claimant\u2019s mother was the 3rd wife to his father and, she died 3 months after Claimant\u2019s birth. In XXXX 2015, claimants father died, and this led to a property dispute.\n[3] The claimant left Ghana in XXXX 2015 after series of incidents instigated by his half siblings. The crop in his farm was cut down by his half siblings and he was threatened that he will be killed by his siblings. The claimant traveled from Takoradi ports with the help of his friend\u2019s father to Panama, he then traveled from Panama to the United States of America (US). The claimant arrived in the U.S. in XXXX of 2016 through California from Mexico and was detained till XXXX 2016. The claimant made an unsuccessful asylum claim in the U.S. The claimant arrived in Canada in XXXX of 2019.\nDETERMINATION\n[4] The panel finds that the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the Act.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[5] Identity is a determinative issue, in particular who the claimant is and what the country of nationality is. The claimant testified about his place, his religion and language. The claimant submitted copies documents as evidence of his identity which includes\nCopy of his birth certificate obtained in March 2017,Copy of marriage certificate for marriage held in Winnipeg, Manitoba on April 18, 2021,Copy of child\u2019s birth certificate dated July 12, 2021showing claimant\u2019s identity.[4]\n[6] The panel notes that the claimant had stated at the port of entry that his passport was missing in the US. Asked how he originally obtained the lost passport, the claimant testified that he had sent for his birth certificate through his friend\u2019s father in Ghana. With the birth certificate and filled application form, he applied for it in New York. He stated that his lawyer requested for the passport to enable him to apply for work permit. The panel finds that that this is reasonable and accepts the above listed document in evidence. Objective evidence indicates that certified copy of entry into registry of birth can be obtained by being computer generated since 2009 on Ghana\u2019s Birth and Death Registry (BDR).[5] The copy of the claimant\u2019s birth certificate attached as evidence is consistent with the Response to Information Request (RIR) sample. Objective documentation further states that an individual can apply for a passport in Ghana using an application form, birth certificate or any other proof of citizenship, 4 recent sized passports as well as the processing fee and two guarantors while the biometric passport can be obtained with the submission of an application form, birth certificate, old passport where available and bank receipt for processing fee. Ghanaians abroad can obtain a passport by providing an application form, passport sized photographs and an old passport where available.[6]\n[7] Based on the totality of the evidence, the panel finds that the claimant has established his identity as a Ghana national with his Ghana certified copy of registration of birth, marriage certificate as well as his oral testimony.[7]\nNexus\n[8] For a claimant to be a Convention refugee the fear of persecution must be by reason of one of the five grounds enumerated in the Convention refugee definition. The claimant must have a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\n[9] The claimant has made two allegations of fear in Ghana. First, he fears being targeted by his half siblings and stepmothers due to a property dispute after his father\u2019s death. The panel finds that this allegation of dispute with his half siblings and stepmothers is a personal vendetta and does not have a nexus to the Convention, as such, has assessed this allegation based on section 97(1) of the Act. Secondly, the claimant alleges that he will be targeted in Ghana due to his perceived practice of witchcraft. The panel finds that there is a nexus between his allegation and the refugee Convention ground of membership in a particular social group. As such, has assessed this claim under both sections 96 and 97(1) of the Act.\nCredibility\n[10] When a claimant swears to the truth of allegations, this creates a presumption that those allegations are true, unless there is reason to doubt their truthfulness.[8] The claimant testified in straightforward, forthright, detailed, and candid manner. There were no material inconsistencies, omissions, or contradictions between any of the claimant\u2019s testimony and the other evidence in this case. In summary, the claimant\u2019s testimony was consistent with the other evidence on central aspects of the claim.\n[11] The claimant testified that he was born in a polygamous home with his mother being the last wife of three wives. He stated that his mother died when he was three months old and, his father raised him while the other wives and children did not like him. He attended elementary school and upon completion joined his father in farming, after some years, his father gave him a portion of the land to farm. After his father\u2019s death in 2015, tension escalated as his siblings did not wish to share the properties according to the traditional and religious practice and proceeded to destroy his farm, threaten him and spread the rumours that he was a witch who had taken after his late mother\u2019s witchcraft. The claimant submitted a statutory declaration by an XXXX chief which corroborates his allegations that he was being targeted.\n[12] The claimant was able to speak clearly about his fears of returning to Ghana due to being accused of witchcraft by his half siblings, stepmothers and the community and how witches are treated in Ghana. The claimant was also able to answer the specific questions asked without embellishment. The panel finds that the claimant is a credible witness.\n[13] The claimant provided document to support his claim supporting the allegations of treatment of witches in Ghana.[9] The panel has no reason to doubt the genuineness of the documents provided by the claimant and since they relate to the claimant\u2019s allegations of being a victim of violence, threats and being a witch, the panel gives them great weight to support the claimant\u2019s allegations and overall claim.\nClaimant\u2019s travel history and claim in the United States\n[14] The claimant entered Canada in XXXX 2019. The claimant testified that he travelled from Takoradi port through his friend\u2019s father\u2019s help to Panama in XXXX 2015 through a ship, after which he went through central America until he crossed the border from Mexico into the United States in XXXX 2016. He was detained on arrival till XXXX 2016, after which he filed an asylum claim which was denied in XXXX 2018. This brings into question the issue of eligibility under section 101(1)(c.1) of the Act. A notice was sent out to the Minister abut a possible ineligibility on the claim, the Minister responded that the claimant is not ineligible due to his claim in the United States, and the Minister declined to intervene.[10]\n[15] Based on the overall credibility of the claimant\u2019s testimony, the presumption of truthfulness, and the corroborative evidence, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities that the claimant was a farmer, has half siblings and stepmothers, that there was a dispute regarding properties arising from the death of his father. The panel further finds that the claimant fled XXXX to Takoradi and thereafter left Ghana using a ship and travelled through central America to Mexico and crossed to the United States where he filed an asylum claim which was denied and thereafter to Canada where he filed a claim.\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution and Risk of Harm\n[16] In order to be found a Convention refugee under section 96 of the IRPA, a claimant must show that she or he has a well-founded fear of persecution by reason of race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular social group. Based on the information available before the panel, the panel finds that the claimant is a member of the particular social group of people who are perceived to be witches.\nLand dispute claim\n[17] The claimant alleges that his problems escalated after his father\u2019s death in 2015. According to the claimant, he is the youngest child and only child of his mother who died after 3 months of his birth. He has 4 older siblings who are from different mothers, he stated that it was the religion and culture to share these properties as they belong to all the children. When asked how many lands and houses, the claimant responded that he was not certain how many pieces, but the land was a large piece with one house.\n[18] Land ownership is not a core human right. The court has found that those who are able to make reasonable choices to free themselves of a risk of harm must be expected to pursue those options.[11] The claimant testified that his village has a chief and a meeting was summoned where the chief talked to them and there was nothing to show his half siblings had backed down. He further stated that the chief knew the nature of his half siblings and he was advised to go somewhere else if he valued his life. The panel asked if he reported the issue to the police, the claimant testified that in his society, no one bothers with the police as no action is taken unless money is given to them. He then stated that he took the chief\u2019s advise and with the help of his friend\u2019s father left Ghana through Takoradi.\n[19] The panel does not find it reasonable that the claimant would put his life at risk for property which he has in essence already given up since he left Ghana, as the half siblings and stepmothers continue to live there. As such, the panel does not find that there is sufficient evidence to establish that the claimant faces a danger of torture, a risk to his life or a risk to cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if he returns to Ghana.\nPerceived practice of witchcraft\n[20] Ghana constitution prohibits religious discrimination, stipulates that individuals are free to profess and practice their religion, and does not designate a state religion. The estimated population is 28 million with 71percent Christians, 18 percent Muslims and 5 percent practice indigenous or animistic religious beliefs and 6 percent belong to other groups or has no religious beliefs.[12] Even though this demography exists, objective documentation shows that most Ghanaians believe in juju (fetish), ghosts, black magic and evil spirits and will seek help from fetish priests or other spiritual specialists in their locality.[13] The report also indicates that, in certain areas in Ghana, many believe in witchcraft with many hamlets, villages, clans and towns seeking protection against witches or having gods and fetishes to spiritually kill witches.[14]\n[21] Objective documentation states that the constitution prohibits practices that dehumanize or are injurious to the physical and mental well-being of a person however the media has reported several killings and attempted killings for ritual purposes. In the Northern, North East, Upper East, and Upper West Regions, families or traditional authorities banished rural women and men suspected of \u201cwitchcraft\u201d to \u201cwitch camps.\u201d It further states that most of those accused of witchcraft were older women, often widows. Some persons suspected to be witches were killed. In July several individuals beat to death a woman aged 90 suspected of witchcraft in Kafaba, in Savannah Region.[15]\n[22] The claimant testified that he had been accused of witchcraft with villagers being told it was passed to him from his late mother through the various narratives by his half siblings and stepmothers. He further testified that in communicating with his friend in Ghana, that there\u2019s ongoing threat against him if he were to return as this information is now in the public domain. Based on the information before the panel, the panel finds that the claimant has established on a balance of probabilities, that he faces a serious possibility of persecution on the basis of his imputed practice of witchcraft in Ghana.\nState Protection\n[23] In all refugee claims, a state is presumed to be capable of protecting its citizens unless there is clear and convincing evidence that protection would not be forthcoming to a claimant.[16] The United States Overseas Security Advisory Council report states that the Ghana Police Service (GPS) is almost solely a reactive force and demonstrates only moderate proactive techniques and ability to deter crime. It states further that the Ghana Police often lack the equipment, resources, training, and personnel to respond to calls for assistance or other emergencies and that the police have a poor record of investigating and solving serious crimes.[17]\n[24] Further objective evidence states that in areas without a significant or permanent presence of public security officers, civil rights are often determined and protected based on traditional law, which does not necessarily follow the letter of public law. This specifically refers to individuals and groups who display socially unacceptable behavior or are accused of such (e. g. \u201cwitches\u201d).[18]\n[25] The claimants\u2019 testimony is consistent with the country reports referred to above, which report that Ghana police forces is mostly reactive and lack the equipment and resources to solve crimes. The panel notes that\u2019s there is an elevated fear and risk with the claimant being perceived a witch. In these circumstances, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant cannot avail himself of state protection in Ghana.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[26] In Rasaratnam v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), the Court of Appeal held that, with respect to the burden of proof, once the issue of an internal flight alternative was raised, the onus is on the claimant to show that she does not have an IFA.[19] The burden placed on a claimant is fairly high in order to show that the IFA is unreasonable. In the Federal Court of Appeal decision of Ranganathan v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) in 2001, it was stated that the test is to show that the IFA is unreasonable.[20] That test requires nothing less than the existence of conditions that would jeopardize the life and safety of the claimants in relocating to a safe area. Actual and concrete evidence of adverse conditions is required. The panel finds that that the claimant would face a serious possibility of persecution in either Tamale or Accra.\nFirst Prong \u2013 Serious Possibility of Persecution\n[27] At the hearing, the panel proposed Accra and Tamale as possible IFAs. The objective evidence, as found in the World Factbook for Ghana at item 1.3, indicates that Ghana is a country that\u2019s approximately 230K square kilometres and has a population of approximately 29M. Accra is the capital and it has approximately 2.5M people.[21] The claimant was residing in XXXX which is approximately 248kms from Accra and 375kms from Tamale.\n[28] The claimant testified that he fears his half siblings, stepmothers and the society at large. The claimant testified that his siblings are in the transportation industry and therefore he would not be safe as Ghana is not a big country and this is why he cannot live anywhere safely in Ghana. The panel finds that there is not sufficient evidence before it that the half brothers, even though in the transportation business, have the ability and means in harming the claimant any of the proposed IFAs.\n[29] The panel then considered the issue of the claimant being perceived a witch in Ghana. The panel notes that there is still ongoing threats about the claimant being a witch in the community. The evidence before the panel as noted above is that most Ghanaians still believe in traditional practices and in the powers of witchcraft. The claimant\u2019s half brothers are into transportation business and therefore have the opportunity to be in different cities with different people.\n[30] The Federal Court has repeatedly held that a refugee claimant cannot be expected to live in hiding in order for a proposed IFA to be reasonable. The evidence indicates that the claimant\u2019s half siblings have continued spreading news about him being a witch and as they are truck and taxi drivers, they have, on a balance of probabilities, disseminated this information across several routes. As such, the panel finds that if the claimant returns to Ghana and tries to relocate to either proposed IFA, he would face more than a mere possibility of persecution from the community and general populace as he may be killed for being a witch unless he chooses to live in hiding. It is more than merely speculative that people in Accra or Tamale would learn that he is a witch and harm him.\n[31] Based on the totality of the evidence, the panel finds that the claimant would not be safe nor would it be reasonable to relocate to the proposed IFAs , therefore, he would face a serious possibility of persecution in either proposed IFA location and as such there is no viable internal flight alternative available to the claimant.\nCONCLUSION\n[32] For the foregoing reasons, the panel determines that the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to s. 96 of the Act, and therefore accepts the claim.\n(signed) Osehise L.

The following is a brief summary. You never agreed with the sexism and the lack of freedom under Islam in Iran. Your family sent you to Canada to study and you converted to Christianity here in Canada. You fear persecution on the basis of your conversion if you return.\n[5] The presumption before me is that your testimony is true; however, this can be rebutted in appropriate circumstances such as inconsistencies, contradictions, omissions or undetailed testimony. The presumption does not apply to inferences or speculation for which there is no evidentiary basis. You have provided several credible documents to support your claim in Exhibit 4.1. There is a letter from lead pastor XXXX XXXX of the XXXX XXXX XXXX confirming your participation from XXXX 2020 and stating that as of XXXX XXXX, 2021, you were taking the 12-week baptism course and the pastor supplied his contact information and invited me to contact him if he can be of further assistance.\n[5] In Exhibit 4.2, you were baptized on XXXX XXXX, 2022. There is a certificate to this effect. This was at the XXXX XXXX XXXX. A second letter from Pastor XXXX XXXX dated XXXX XXXX of 2022 confirms that you completed the baptism course and were baptized as well as your participation in church classes, activities, and Sunday worship services. Pastor XXXX XXXX states \u201cI believe he is sincere in his new faith.\u201d\n[6] Your testimony was consistent and compelling. You were straightforward and forthcoming. You did not appear to embellish your description of events or actions, and I find you to be a credible witness and therefore believe what you have alleged in support of your claim. Your narrative and your testimony corresponds to the ample objective evidence about conditions in Iran pertaining to those who disavow Islam and convert to Christianity. Accordingly, I have no reason to doubt the central elements underpinning your claim for protection. I accepted that you have converted from Islam to Christianity and given the foregoing, I accept that you subjectively fear persecution in Iran.\nNEXUS\n[7] I find the persecution you face has a nexus to the Geneva Convention, that of religion, due to your disavowal of Islam and your conversion to Christianity and therefore, I have assessed your claim under Section 96. I also note that you make some statements showing you hold a political opinion in opposition to that of the Iranian regime; however, I have found the previously mentioned nexus to be sufficient to determine your claim.\nWELL-FOUNDED FEAR\n[8] In order to be considered a Convention refugee, you have to demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution. This includes both a subjective fear which you have already established, and an objective basis for that fear and it must be forward looking.\n[9] Based on your testimony, supporting, documents, and the Country Condition documents, I find you have a well-founded fear of persecution for the following reasons: In testimony, you described the difficulties you had growing up. You wanted to listen to music but it wasn\u2019t allowed because it didn\u2019t conform to the Islamic requirements, you wanted to get together in mixed groups; once again, that wasn\u2019t allowed, you had to hide your own feelings, you weren\u2019t allowed to express yourself, your opinions, or your beliefs. You came to Canada to go to school and you found a degree of freedom that you hadn\u2019t experienced before; however, you ran into a time of difficulty. There were family members who died in Iran, you weren\u2019t able to return, you were alone here unable to work at home, and you spent a very difficult time of your life questioning the meaning of life. Then you told me that you had some acquaintance already with Christianity and its teachings and what happened was you found another meaning for your life and you found this through Christianity. You found the new meaning and tranquility and your life changed and you found that you could be happier and as you believed in your heart, everything improved in your life, you found peace of mind, a job, discipline in your life, and you attribute this all to Jesus Christ.\n[10] The country documentation is consistent with your allegations of the treatment of converts such as ourself in Iran. The law prohibits Muslim citizens from changing or renouncing their religious beliefs, Under Iranian law, a Muslim who leaves his or her faith or converts to another religion can be charged with apostacy and apostacy from Islam is a crime that can be punished by death.\n[11] Amnesty International stated the following in their June 2019 report entitled Iran Failing on all Fronts. Freedom of religion and beliefs continues to be systematically violated. The authorities impose, on people of all faiths as well as atheists, codes of conduct written in a strict interpretation of Shia Islam. The right to change or renounce religious beliefs continues to be violated with those converting from Islam at risk of arbitrary detention, torture, and the death penalty. The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade assesses that those accused of religiously based charges are also likely to face charges related to national security and they are unlikely to have adequate legal defence and they are likely to be convicted. So, I\u2019m satisfied that regardless of whether a convert faces the death penalty or imprisonment, the conditions and treatment are such that both amount to persecution. Accordingly, I find your fear of persecution in Iran is well-founded.\nSTATE PROTECTION AND INTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE\n[12] Except in situations where a state is in complete breakdown, states are presumed capable of protecting their citizens. To rebut this presumption, you have to establish on a balance of probabilities with clear and convincing evidence that your state\u2019s protection is inadequate. In this case, the agents of persecution is the states. The persecution you would face if you return to Iran is at the hands of the authorities. Accordingly, I find there is no state protection available to you. The presumption of state protection is rebutted. The states are in control of its territories and therefore, I find there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout Iran for you and there is no viable Internal Flight Alternative where you could safely relocate given your circumstances.\nCONCLUSION\n[13] Based on the totality of the evidence, I have concluded that you are a Convention refugee. Accordingly, I am accepting your claim.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n[1] This is the decision of the Refugee Protection Division in the claims of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (the \u201cprincipal claimant\u201d) and her spouse, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (the \u201cassociate claimant\u201d). The Claimants are citizens of Honduras and are seeking refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] The details of the Claimants\u2019 allegations are fully set out in their Basis of Claim (BOC) forms and were supplemented by their oral testimony.[1] In summary, the Claimants fear they will be killed by the Mara 13, also known as the MS13, in Honduras because they stopped paying the \u2018war tax\u201d that the Mara 13 had extorted from them weekly and because the Claimants filed a report against the Mara 13 with the Honduran police.\nDETERMINATION\n[3] I find on a balance of probabilities that the Claimants would be subjected personally to a risk to their lives or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, at the hands of the Mara 13 should they return to Honduras, for the following reasons.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[4] The Claimants\u2019 identities as nationals of Honduras are established by the sworn statements in their BOC forms and the certified copies of their Honduran passports contained in evidence.[2]\nNexus\n[5] For a claimant to be considered a Convention refugee, the well-founded fear of persecution must be by reason of one or more of the five grounds enumerated under s.96 of IRPA: race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion. Victims or potential victims of crime, corruption or personal vendettas generally cannot establish a link between fear of persecution and Convention reasons.[3]\n[6] The Claimants submit that there is a nexus in their case to the Convention ground of political opinion and allege they face persecution due to their imputed political opinion.\n[7] I find that there is nothing particular about this case which takes it outside the general principles as set out in Kang. I find the Claimants were victims of crime and their lives are at risk because they face retribution for ceasing to obey the Mara 13. As victims of crime who fear future criminality, I find that the Claimants have not established a nexus to one of the Convention grounds. I will therefore assess their claims under section 97(1) of IRPA.\nCredibility\n[8] The Federal Court has held in Maldonado that when a claimant swears to the truth of certain allegations, it creates a presumption that those allegations are true unless there is a reason to doubt their truthfulness.[4] The presumption of truthfulness does not apply to inferences or speculation.\n[9] In this case, I have found no reason to doubt the truthfulness of the Claimants. The principal claimant testified in a straightforward and convincing manner and was able to answer questions spontaneously and in detail about the extortion and the fear she felt on a daily basis. The Claimants provided corroborating evidence, found in Exhibit 5, to support their allegations including their business licence, photographs of the Claimants in their business, and a copy of the police report filed on XXXX XXXX, 2021.\n[10] I find that the following facts have been established on a balance of probabilities:\na) The Claimants owned an operated a XXXX XXXX, or \u201cXXXX\u201d, in Honduras. The XXXX was a profitable business and had a large clientele.\nb) In XXXX 2021, a masked man who identified himself as Mara 13 and who had XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX attended the XXXX and demanded the Claimants pay a \u201cwar tax\u201d of 5000 lempiras on a weekly basis. The man stated that he knew everything about the Claimants\u2019 family and their business and stated the Claimants would be killed if they did not pay the money.\nc) Based on the man\u2019s self identification as a member of the Mara 13 and because of his XXXX XXXX, I accept that the individual who extorted the Claimants was a member of the Mara 13 on a balance of probabilities.\nd) Between XXXX 2021 and XXXX 2021, the amount the Claimants were extorted to pay rose from 5000 lempira weekly to 30,000 lempira weekly. The Claimants used profits from the business, their savings, and ultimately sold their cars and some personal belongings in order to make the payments.\ne) The Claimants made one payment of 30,000 lempira on XXXX XXXX, 2021. The Claimants abandoned their home and business on XXXX XXXX, 2021, the day before the next payment of 30,000 lempira was due.\nf) The Claimants made a police complaint against the Mara 13 on XXXX XXXX, 2021 at a police station in a different town. The Claimants spent the night of XXXX XXXX, 2021 at the airport awaiting their flight out of Honduras on XXXX XXXX, 2021.\nRisk of Harm\n[11] In order to establish they are persons in need of protection under section 97(1)(b), the Claimants must show they would be subjected personally, on a balance of probabilities, to a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment which is not faced generally by others in Honduras.\n[12] When I consider the objective country evidence in relation to the Claimants\u2019 profile as small business owners who have been previously extorted by the Mara 13, I find that the Claimants have established on a balance of probabilities that they face a risk to their life at the hands of the Mara 13 if they returned to Honduras.\n[13] The National Documentation Package contains several articles and reports on the Mara 13. A report by Insight Crime, states that:\nThe Mara Salvatrucha (MS13) is one of the world\u2019s largest and arguably most violent street gangs. After relatively humble beginnings in Los Angeles in the 1980s, it has spread to more than a half-dozen countries and become a central focus of law enforcement in two hemispheres. In spite of these efforts, the MS13 remains a persistent threat and shows signs of expanding its criminal portfolio. The MS13 has between 50,000 and 70,000 members who are concentrated in mostly urban areas in Central America or locations outside the region where there is a large Central American diaspora. In Honduras and Guatemala, the gang is still largely urban. Violence is at the heart of the MS13 and is what has made it a target of law enforcement in the United States, Central America and beyond. It is central to the MS13\u2019s ethos, its modus operandi, and its evaluation and discipline of its own members. Violence also builds cohesion and comradery within the gang\u2019s cliques. This use of violence has enhanced the MS13\u2019s brand name, allowing it to expand in size and geographic reach, but it has undermined its ability to enter more sophisticated, money-making criminal economies.[5]\n[14] The US Department of State Travel Advisory for Honduras states:\nHondurans continue to be affected by MS-13 (Mara Salvatrucha) and Calle 18 gang activity in cities such as Tegucigalpa, Choloma, La Ceiba, Tela, and San Pedro Sula. Most crime victims are members of rival gangs, small business owners who resist gang extortion, passengers on public transportation, or those involved in land disputes. The MS-13 and Calle 18 gangs are the most active and powerful gangs present in Honduras. Gangs are not reluctant to use violence, and specialize in murder-for-hire, carjacking, extortion, and other violent street crime\u2026[6]\n[15] In addition, the objective evidence indicates organized crime groups, including the Mara 13, use extortion as one of their primary sources of income.[7] One clique of the MS 13 murdered approximately 40 people between 2016 and 2019 \u201cfor not paying extortions, or on suspicion that [the victims] were informants for authorities\u201d.[8]\n[16] Furthermore,\nClique leaders keep a close eye and strict control over who gets targeted for extortion, how much money is collected and how often. New targets can be proposed and accepted during meetings. Gang leaders may also discuss issues with collection during those meetings, including whether or not to discipline a target for not paying, not paying on time or absconding.[9]\n[17] One recent example of retribution against a pulperia owner occurred in October 2021. As reported in a Honduran newspaper, a pulperia owner refused to pay the extortion demands and was shot and killed on the street, presumably by gang members.[10]\n[18] The objective evidence discussed above establishes that MS13 is a prominent and highly violent gang operating throughout Honduras, which uses the extortion of small business owners as a primary source of income.\n[19] Given the Claimants have already been targeted by the Mara 13 and subsequently stopped making their regular extortion payments, I find, on a balance of probabilities, the Mara 13 are motivated to harm or kill the Claimants in retaliation for ceasing to pay them money, for reporting them to the police, and as a warning to others who refuse the Mara 13\u2019s demands.\nState Protection\n[20] I find that there is no adequate state protection for the Claimants in Honduras.\n[21] The principal claimant testified that when she and her husband filed the complaint with the police, the police told the Claimants that they would not be able to protect them as the police were understaffed and underfunded.\n[22] The objective evidence supports the principal claimant\u2019s testimony. As cited above, the Mara 13 has not been suppressed by state authorities; rather, the Mara 13 has been growing in both size and geographical reach. Objective evidence shows that police response to crime is unsatisfactory and undermined by lack of training and resources:\nThe government lacks resources to investigate and prosecute cases; police often lack vehicles\/fuel to respond to calls for assistance. Police may take hours to arrive at the scene of a violent crime or may not respond at all.[11]\n[23] Therefore, based on the evidence discussed above and the Claimant\u2019s own experience in seeking protection from the police in Honduras, I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the Claimants will not be able to access adequate state protection in Honduras, and that the presumption of state protection has been rebutted.\nInternal Flight Alternative (IFA)\n[24] I find that there is no viable IFA for the Claimants in Honduras. The agent of harm is motivated to pursue the Claimants for refusing to comply with their demands and for reporting them to the police. As stated above, the Mara 13 uses violence to ensure compliance with their demands of extortion. The Mara 13 is a widespread criminal organization with significant resources and have the means and presence throughout the country to pursue the Claimants anywhere in Honduras. As already discussed, the objective evidence shows targets are disciplined by the Mara 13 for not making their payments and for absconding, both of which the Claimants have done. Therefore, I find that the Claimants will not be able to live safely anywhere in Honduras and they do not have a viable IFA.\nCONCLUSION\n[25] When I consider the Claimants\u2019 personal circumstances, the objective country evidence, the lack of state protection and lack of viable IFA, I find that the Claimants have established on a balance of probabilities that they face a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment at the hands of the Mara 13 if they were to return to Honduras. I therefore find that the Claimants are persons in need of protection pursuant to section 97 of IRPA and accept their claim.\n(signed) Alannah Hatch\nJanuary 18, 2022\n\n[1] Exhibits 2.1 and 2.2.\n[2] Exhibits 1 and 5.\n\n[3] Kang v.

The Claimants spent the night of XXXX XXXX, 2021 at the airport awaiting their flight out of Honduras on XXXX XXXX, 2021.Risk of Harm\n[11] In order to establish they are persons in need of protection under section 97(1)(b), the Claimants must show they would be subjected personally, on a balance of probabilities, to a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment which is not faced generally by others in Honduras.\n[12] When I consider the objective country evidence in relation to the Claimants\u2019 profile as small business owners who have been previously extorted by the Mara 13, I find that the Claimants have established on a balance of probabilities that they face a risk to their life at the hands of the Mara 13 if they returned to Honduras.\n[13] The National Documentation Package contains several articles and reports on the Mara 13. A report by Insight Crime, states that:\nThe Mara Salvatrucha (MS13) is one of the world\u2019s largest and arguably most violent street gangs. After relatively humble beginnings in Los Angeles in the 1980s, it has spread to more than a half-dozen countries and become a central focus of law enforcement in two hemispheres. In spite of these efforts, the MS13 remains a persistent threat and shows signs of expanding its criminal portfolio. The MS13 has between 50,000 and 70,000 members who are concentrated in mostly urban areas in Central America or locations outside the region where there is a large Central American diaspora. In Honduras and Guatemala, the gang is still largely urban. Violence is at the heart of the MS13 and is what has made it a target of law enforcement in the United States, Central America and beyond. It is central to the MS13\u2019s ethos, its modus operandi, and its evaluation and discipline of its own members. Violence also builds cohesion and comradery within the gang\u2019s cliques. This use of violence has enhanced the MS13\u2019s brand name, allowing it to expand in size and geographic reach, but it has undermined its ability to enter more sophisticated, money-making criminal economies.[5]\n[14] The US Department of State Travel Advisory for Honduras states:\nHondurans continue to be affected by MS-13 (Mara Salvatrucha) and Calle 18 gang activity in cities such as Tegucigalpa, Choloma, La Ceiba, Tela, and San Pedro Sula. Most crime victims are members of rival gangs, small business owners who resist gang extortion, passengers on public transportation, or those involved in land disputes. The MS-13 and Calle 18 gangs are the most active and powerful gangs present in Honduras. Gangs are not reluctant to use violence, and specialize in murder-for-hire, carjacking, extortion, and other violent street crime\u2026[6]\n[15] In addition, the objective evidence indicates organized crime groups, including the Mara 13, use extortion as one of their primary sources of income.[7] One clique of the MS 13 murdered approximately 40 people between 2016 and 2019 \u201cfor not paying extortions, or on suspicion that [the victims] were informants for authorities\u201d.[8]\n[16] Furthermore,\nClique leaders keep a close eye and strict control over who gets targeted for extortion, how much money is collected and how often. New targets can be proposed and accepted during meetings. Gang leaders may also discuss issues with collection during those meetings, including whether or not to discipline a target for not paying, not paying on time or absconding.[9]\n[17] One recent example of retribution against a pulperia owner occurred in October 2021. As reported in a Honduran newspaper, a pulperia owner refused to pay the extortion demands and was shot and killed on the street, presumably by gang members.[10]\n[18] The objective evidence discussed above establishes that MS13 is a prominent and highly violent gang operating throughout Honduras, which uses the extortion of small business owners as a primary source of income.\n[19] Given the Claimants have already been targeted by the Mara 13 and subsequently stopped making their regular extortion payments, I find, on a balance of probabilities, the Mara 13 are motivated to harm or kill the Claimants in retaliation for ceasing to pay them money, for reporting them to the police, and as a warning to others who refuse the Mara 13\u2019s demands.\nState Protection\n[20] I find that there is no adequate state protection for the Claimants in Honduras.\n[21] The principal claimant testified that when she and her husband filed the complaint with the police, the police told the Claimants that they would not be able to protect them as the police were understaffed and underfunded.\n[22] The objective evidence supports the principal claimant\u2019s testimony. As cited above, the Mara 13 has not been suppressed by state authorities; rather, the Mara 13 has been growing in both size and geographical reach. Objective evidence shows that police response to crime is unsatisfactory and undermined by lack of training and resources:\nThe government lacks resources to investigate and prosecute cases; police often lack vehicles\/fuel to respond to calls for assistance. Police may take hours to arrive at the scene of a violent crime or may not respond at all.[11]\n[23] Therefore, based on the evidence discussed above and the Claimant\u2019s own experience in seeking protection from the police in Honduras, I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the Claimants will not be able to access adequate state protection in Honduras, and that the presumption of state protection has been rebutted.\nInternal Flight Alternative (IFA)\n[24] I find that there is no viable IFA for the Claimants in Honduras. The agent of harm is motivated to pursue the Claimants for refusing to comply with their demands and for reporting them to the police. As stated above, the Mara 13 uses violence to ensure compliance with their demands of extortion. The Mara 13 is a widespread criminal organization with significant resources and have the means and presence throughout the country to pursue the Claimants anywhere in Honduras. As already discussed, the objective evidence shows targets are disciplined by the Mara 13 for not making their payments and for absconding, both of which the Claimants have done. Therefore, I find that the Claimants will not be able to live safely anywhere in Honduras and they do not have a viable IFA.\nCONCLUSION\n[25] When I consider the Claimants\u2019 personal circumstances, the objective country evidence, the lack of state protection and lack of viable IFA, I find that the Claimants have established on a balance of probabilities that they face a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment at the hands of the Mara 13 if they were to return to Honduras. I therefore find that the Claimants are persons in need of protection pursuant to section 97 of IRPA and accept their claim.\n(signed) Alannah Hatch\nJanuary 18, 2022\n\n[1] Exhibits 2.1 and 2.2.\n[2] Exhibits 1 and 5.\n\n[3] Kang v.

The claimant is a 30-year-old Nigerian woman who fears persecution from her mother-in-law who is a member of the XXXX XXXX.\n[4] The claimant alleges that her mother-in-law has been targeting the claimant\u2019s son to be initiated into the XXXX XXXX, and that her mother-in-law has been attempting to forcefully take the claimant\u2019s son away.\n[5] After the claimant married her husband, she moved into his family home and lived with her husband and his family, including the husband\u2019s mother. Due to the husband\u2019s job, he traveled frequently for months at a time across Nigeria and was often unable to be contacted as he was out of cellular service. In 2016, the claimant and her mother traveled to Canada for vacation while the claimant was pregnant with her son. In XXXX 2016, the claimant gave birth to her son in Canada.\n[6] The claimant alleged that her relationship with her mother-in-law has always been tumultuous. On XXXX XXXX, 2018, at her family home, the claimant\u2019s mother-in-law and her husband\u2019s cousin insulted the claimant and pushed her, injuring the claimant\u2019s leg. In XXXX 2018, the mother-in-law made death threats to the claimant and stated that if the claimant did not surrender her son, she would send the \u201carea boys to attack her and kill her so that she will no longer be a problem for her\u201d. The claimant reported this incident to the police, but the claimant alleged that the police did not act as the mother-in-law was an influential member of the XXXX XXXXwith connections to the police. Although the mother-in-law was required to report to the police, she was let go within the same day. Furthermore, the claimant alleged that the police ignored this matter and dismissed it as a domestic dispute.\n[7] Feeling unsafe, the claimant fled to her cousin\u2019s house with her son in XXXX on XXXX XXXX, 2018. At her cousin\u2019s home, the claimant continued to receive threatening phone calls from her mother-in-law. The claimant changed her phone number, but she continued to receive threatening phone calls from her mother-in-law who said that she knows the claimant is hiding in XXXX and there was no point in hiding as she would eventually find her.\n[8] On XXXX XXXX, 2018, the claimant fled to her church in Lagos where she took shelter for 24 days. Although the threatening phone calls continued, the claimant\u2019s mother-in-law or anyone from the XXXX XXXXwas able to confront her directly. The claimant testified that she believes her mother-in-law knew the general vicinity of where she was, but not the precise location.\n[9] The claimant fled Nigeria with her son on XXXX XXXX, 2018 and made a claim in Canada on June 12, 2018.\nDETERMINATIONS\n[10] The panel finds that the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the Act for the reasons that follow.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[11] The panel finds that the claimant\u2019s personal identity and her identity as a citizen of Nigeria has been established on a balance of probabilities by a copy of her Nigerian passport.\nNexus\n[12] The panel finds that the claimant\u2019s allegations establish a nexus to the Convention ground of particular social group as a woman experiencing domestic violence in Nigeria. Therefore, the panel will assess this claim under section 96 of the Act.\nCredibility\n[13] When a claimant swears to the truth of his or her allegations, this creates a presumption that those allegations are true, unless there is reason to doubt their truthfulness. In this case, the panel has found no reason to doubt the claimant\u2019s truthfulness. The claimant testified in a straightforward manner that was consistent with all of the other documents on the file, including her Basis of Claim form and narrative. The claimant was able to answer all questions fully and provided all details that were requested of her. There were no relevant inconsistencies in her testimony or contradictions between her testimony and the other evidence before the panel, which have not been satisfactorily explained.\n[14] The claimant also provided documentary evidence in support of her claim. The documents form parts of Exhibit 4 and contain the following:\n1. XXXX XXXXcard of XXXX XXXX, the claimant\u2019s mother in law;\n2. Medical report for the claimant dated XXXX XXXX, 2018;\n3. Police report dated XXXX XXXX, 2018 in relation to the death threats made by the mother-in-law towards the claimant.\n[15] Although the panel initially had some concerns with the legitimacy of the medical report and the police report due to formatting and grammatical mistakes identified, the panel accepts the claimant\u2019s explanation of the mistakes to be typographical in nature and finds the documents to be genuine.\n[16] Ultimately, in terms of the claimant\u2019s allegations, the panel finds the following:\n1. The claimant\u2019s mother-in-law is a member of the XXXX XXXX;\n2. The claimant\u2019s mother-in-law has attacked her on XXXX XXXX, 2018 and made death threats to the claimant demanding that she surrenders her son in XXXX 2018;\n3. The claimant\u2019s mother-in-law continued to threaten her while the claimant hid at her cousin\u2019s home as well as her church;\n4. The claimant\u2019s mother-in-law was able to find her new phone number and knew of her general vicinity while the claimant was fleeing.\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution and Risk of Harm\n[17] Turning to the well-founded fear of persecution, the panel accepts that the claimant has a subjective fear of returning to Nigeria. Considering the totality of the evidence, the panel finds that the claimant\u2019s subjective fear is objectively well-founded and if she was to return, she would face a serious risk of persecution. Although the panel finds that the sphere of influence and the reach of the XXXX XXXXhas been diminishing in the recent years, as will be discussed below, the panel finds that the claimant\u2019s fears are objectively well-founded.\n[18] The objective evidence as set out in the National Documentation Package (NDP) confirms that the XXXX XXXXexists. According to the EASO Country of Information , the XXXXis the best-known but certainly not the only secret society in Nigeria. The XXXX XXXX is a caste of Yoruba priests who elected and controlled the Oba, the Oruba king. The XXXXhad great political and societal powers, and it used to be highly prestigious to become a member.\n[19] The same report indicates that the XXXX XXXXhad considerable influence in Nigerian society and government in the 1990s. Only members of the XXXX XXXXcould give access to an influential or government job. However, nowadays, the influence of the XXXX XXXXis declining although not totally disappeared. The report noted that in these days, money is a greater means to access political power.\n[20] The same report also indicates the general sphere of influence of the XXXX XXXX. It indicates that the XXXXare only influential in \u201cYoruba parts of Nigeria where they still have some real influence\u2026 [cities such as] Egba, Egbado, and Abeokuta parts of Nigeria (Ogun and Lagos States). Also, in some rural villages and small towns along in the borders of Ogun state with Oyo, Osun, and Ondo, they might still be able to intimidate pockets of people\u201d. However, the report also indicates that XXXXare often members of Nigerian society\u2019s elites working in the police, judiciary, and government institutions.\n[21] Turning to the refusal of membership in the XXXX XXXX, the report indicates that while membership in the XXXX XXXXis primarily voluntary, social pressure and intimidation can occur, especially when the person refusing has personal knowledge of the XXXX XXXX. The report indicates that \u201crefusal to join in such cases is very difficult\u201d.\n[22] The panel acknowledges that the evidence regarding the capacity and influence of the XXXX XXXXis mixed. The evidence appears to indicate that the XXXX XXXXis a well-known secret society that wielded considerable power in the 1990s but has been declining in the recent years. However, the panel finds that the claimant\u2019s fears are well-founded as the persecution she has experienced, such as the beatings and death threats from her mother-in-law, has been localized in Lagos and Ogun states, where the objective evidence indicates the XXXX XXXX still has a considerable amount of influence.\n[23] Based on the claimant\u2019s testimony regarding the sustained periods of domestic abuse suffered by the hands of her mother-in-law and other relatives, and due to the claimant\u2019s personal knowledge of the XXXX XXXXresulting from living in the same household as her mother-in-law, the panel finds that the claimant would face a serious risk of persecution should she return to Nigeria. Therefore, the panel finds that the claimant has a well-founded fear of persecution.\nState Protection\n[24] There is limited country conditions documents that directly reflect whether state agencies would protect individuals from the XXXX XXXX. According to the United States Department of State report , the government in Nigeria lacked effective mechanisms and sufficient political will to investigate and punish most security force abuse and corruption. Police remained susceptible to corruption, committed human rights violations, and operated with widespread impunity in the apprehension, illegal detention, and torture of suspects. This document raises serious concerns about the efficacy of state protection agencies in Nigeria.\n[25] The claimant also testified that she went to the police regarding the death threat her mother-in-law made in XXXX 2018. Although the police report provided by the claimant indicates that the mother-in-law was invited for an investigation, she was released on the same day and no further investigations were actioned by the police. The claimant testified that she was only let off with a warning, and the claimant believes that this is because of her influence in the XXXX XXXX.\n[26] Further, as mentioned earlier, some members of the XXXX XXXXare connected to or are members of the Nigerian elite, such as the police, judiciary, or politicians. The evidence indicates that some of the XXXX XXXXappears to be above the law. When the panel reviews the totality of the evidence, the limitations of the police and in general in Nigeria and the links between the XXXXand Nigerian authorities, the panel finds that there is clear and convincing evidence that state protection would not be reasonably forthcoming to the claimant. As such, the panel finds that there is no operationally effective state protection for the claimant in Nigeria.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[27] The final issue is whether the claimant has a viable internal flight alternative (IFA) in Nigeria. In order to determine whether an IFA exists, the panel must assess whether there is any location in Nigeria in which claimants would not face a serious possibility of persecution and whether it would be reasonable to expect them to move there. At the outset of the hearing, the panel proposed Abuja as a possible IFA. The panel finds that the claimant does not have a viable IFA because the panel finds that given the claimant\u2019s profile as a woman who would mostly travel and live alone without her husband, it would be unreasonable for the claimant to relocate within Nigeria.\nFirst prong \u2013 Means and motivations of mother-in-law and XXXX XXXX\n[28] Turning to whether the claimant\u2019s mother-in-law or the XXXX XXXXas a whole would have the means and the motivation to find the claimant in Abuja, the panel finds that they would not. The evidence about the XXXX XXXX seems to indicate that although they were powerful and well-known in the past, their capacity and their influence has been diminishing in the recent years. Furthermore, the sphere of influence of the XXXX XXXXappears to be localized in the Ogun and Lagos states which is in the southwest region of Nigeria. This sphere of influence does not include Abuja, which is in central Nigeria.\n[29] The claimant testified that she ran away to her cousin\u2019s home in XXXX and to her church in Lagos, where the objective evidence appears to indicate that the XXXX XXXXstill has a considerable amount of influence. Although the claimant\u2019s mother-in-law was able to find the claimant\u2019s new phone number, she was never able to precisely locate the claimant at the claimant\u2019s church or her cousin\u2019s home despite the fact that these locations are within the XXXX XXXXarea of influence.\n[30] The panel notes that the claimant\u2019s church and her mother in law\u2019s home are both located in Lagos, and that the claimant remained hidden in her church for 24 days prior to leaving Nigeria. However, despite being so close geographically, the claimant\u2019s mother-in-law was not able to precisely locate the claimant. The panel therefore finds that the XXXX XXXXlacks the means to locate an individual, even within their reported sphere of influence. Therefore, the panel finds that the claimant\u2019s mother-in-law or the XXXX XXXXwould have the means to locate the claimant in Abuja.\n[31] Turning to the motivations of the agents of persecution, the panel finds that the claimant\u2019s mother-in-law or the XXXX XXXXas a whole still has the motivation to locate the claimant. The claimant testified that ever since coming to Canada, the claimant never had any direct contact with her mother-in-law or any other members of the XXXX XXXX. The claimant also did not mention any threats made to her family or friends from the XXXX XXXX. The panel therefore finds that the agents of persecution in this specific case lacks the motivation to locate the claimant because of the lack of measures taken by the claimant\u2019s mother-in-law or the XXXX XXXX.\n[32] As such, the panel finds that there is no serious possibility that the claimant\u2019s mother-in-law or the XXXX XXXXas a whole would locate the claimant in Abuja.\nSecond prong \u2013 Reasonableness test, jeopardy to life or safety\n[33] Considering the totality of the evidence, the panel finds that the claimant would face jeopardy to her life or safety should she relocate to Abuja. In coming to this conclusion, the panel has considered the claimant\u2019s profile as a woman traveling with a young son whose husband is largely absent due to his work obligations.\n[34] The claimant wrote in her narrative and also testified that although she and her husband is still married and on good terms, there are times when she is left to support herself alone for extended periods of time. The claimant testified that she was not able to contact her husband to tell him about the attack on XXXX XXXX, 2018 and the threats in XXXX 2018 because he was out of cellular service, and that she was only able to contact him after she arrived in Canada. When asked if this kind of occurrence is common with her husband, the claimant testified that it is does happen from time to time and she has learned to deal with issues herself.\n[35] The documentary evidence is clear that women in Nigeria are subject to stereotypical beliefs and cultural norms that significantly restrict a woman\u2019s ability to participate in free and equal individuals.\n[36] The US Department of State report in the NDP indicates that women in Nigeria are subjected to considerable economic discrimination and that the culturally implemented restrictions on women prevent women from finding jobs in numerous industries. In a report at tab 5.1 , women are frequently restricted to work in the informal sectors, which carries a high level of uncertainty, a high risk of employment, lower wages, and in some cases an outright dangerous work environment.\n[37] Both the US Department of State report and the report at tab 5.1 indicates that it is commonplace for employers to request sexual favours from women in exchange for employment. Sexual violence is endemic both in the household and in the community at large.\n[38] At tab 5.9 , a report about female headed households, indicates that it is very difficult, or even potentially impossible, for women to live independently as a single woman, to relocate without a support network, and that it is \u201cvery difficult for women heads of households\u201d to survive in any place in Nigeria. Potential landlords suspect single women as working as prostitutes or may demand sexual favours for a place to live. The panel finds that there is a serious risk that the claimant could be left unemployed and homeless.\n[39] Should the claimant relocate to Abuja, she would be relocating without any family support and with only limited support from her husband, whose employment requires him to travel throughout Nigeria. Considering all of the circumstances, including the current situation in Nigeria as well as the claimant\u2019s personal circumstances, the panel finds that the claimant would face a serious risk of persecution should she relocate to Abuja as a single woman trying to establish her own household. Therefore, the panel finds that the claimant does not have a viable IFA in Nigeria.\nCONCLUSION\n[40] In conclusion, for the reasons above, the panel finds that the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the Act and the Refugee Protection Division acPSGcepts her claim.\n(signed) Kevin Kim\nFebruary 8, 2022\n\n",

Their claims were previously joined with the principal claimant\u2019s husband, however, due to allegations of domestic violence the claims were separated.\nALLEGATIONS\n[4] The claimant fled Mexico with her husband XXXXand son due to fears of the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (XXXX). The claimant\u2019s husband owned XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. He had been extorted for two years before the principal claimant learned about what was happening. The claimant\u2019s husband left Mexico on XXXX XXXX, 2019 and the claimants went to live with an Uncle in Pachuca. However, when they returned the principal claimant began receiving multiple threats. The XXXX asked about her husband\u2019s whereabouts and threatened to kill the claimants if the husband\u2019s debt was not paid. The claimants left Mexico on XXXX XXXX, 2019. The principal claimant has since been separated from her husband and has full custody of the minor claimant. She fears additional harm from him if she returns to Mexico.\nDETERMINATION\n[5] I find the claimants are Convention Refugees pursuant to s.96 of the Act, for the reasons that follow.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[6] The claimants\u2019 identities as nationals of Mexico are established through certified copies of their passports on file.\nCredibility\n[7] The claimant was a credible witness and I believe what she has alleged in support of their claims. The principal claimant testified in a direct and straightforward manner, even when asked to testify about difficult subjects. There were no material inconsistencies between her testimony and her Basis of Claim form. There were no attempts to embellish her evidence even when given the opportunity to do so. I have documentary evidence to support her claim. I accept that even though her initial reasons for fleeing Mexico were to escape the XXXX cartel due to her husband\u2019s activities, the claimant formulated an additional fear of domestic violence after initiating her refugee claim. It is clear from her testimony and the documents before me that she did not necessarily understand that she was a victim of domestic violence until arriving in Canada. Based on the totality of the evidence, I accept her allegations as credible.\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution\n[8] I find there is a nexus in this claim to the Convention Ground of membership in a particular social group, namely women fearing gender-based violence for the principal claimant, and family members of a persecuted person for the minor claimant.\n[9] The claimant testified that she became pregnant at a very young age and was essentially forced into a marriage with XXXXby her family and XXXXfamily, both who followed the Jehovah Witness faith. From the beginning of the marriage, XXXX, who is several years older than the claimant, was physically and emotionally abusive as well as unfaithful. The claimant told some members of her family about the abuse but had no recourse. She testified that she tried to tell her mother, who did not really listen to her.\n[10] She testified that the physical abuse stopped once she arrived in Canada, but only because XXXXappeared to understand that he could potentially face repercussions from authorities in this country, whereas he could act with relative impunity in Mexico. Indeed, in the transcript the claimant captured of a zoom call with XXXX, he states the following in response to the claimant\u2019s assertion that hitting XXXX as a form of discipline is violence:\n\u201cXXXX, that is not violence. That is not violence. Those are your rules and your laws as a Canadian, and honestly, well, you aren\u2019t even a Canadian. [3]\u201d\n[11] In other words, it appears that the only reason the claimants were not subjected to physical abuse here in Canada was due to the fact that XXXXwas aware the claimant could call the police. However, according to the claimant\u2019s testimony and witness affidavit before me, emotional abuse continued, as did the withholding of financial support for food and other necessities.\n[12] The objective evidence also supports the claimants\u2019 allegations. Sources report that gender-based violence is common in Mexico. In its Concluding Observations on the Ninth Periodic Report of Mexico, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) notes that \u201cthe persistence of high levels of insecurity, violence and organised crime in [Mexico] \u2026 is negatively affecting the enjoyment by women and girls of their human rights\u201d. Sources report that the average of 10 women who were killed per day in 2019 remained unchanged in [January] 2020. The New York Times also reports that an average of 10 women were killed each day in 2019 and adds that this rate represents an increase from 7 killed per day in 2017.[4]\n[13] The 2016 National Survey on the Dynamics of Household Relationships found that 42 percent of married women over 15 years old and 59 percent of separated, divorced, or widowed women have experienced situations of emotional or economic abuse, or physical or sexual violence in their current or previous relationship. The same source reports that 64 percent of the women victims of domestic violence have experienced severe or very severe violence at the hand of their spouse or partner.[5]\n[14] According to recent evidence provided by the Board in an RIR report, women are often seen by their intimate partners who are involved in organized crime as an accomplice and \u201cthey must participate to varying degrees in their illicit activities, [whether] it be actively in aiding and abetting crimes, or by keeping secrets and providing a minimal amount of support. Women in those situations do not tend to leave their partners unless they feel it is safe or necessary to do so because if they end up returning to them afterwards, the violence always escalates.[6]\n[15] Based on the totality of the evidence, I find the claimants would face a serious possibility of persecution in Mexico.\nState Protection\n[16] In terms of state protection, the federal penal code prohibits domestic violence and stipulates penalties for conviction of between six months\u2019 and four years\u2019 imprisonment. Of the 32 states, 29 stipulate similar penalties, although in practice sentences were often more lenient. Federal law criminalizes spousal abuse. However, state and municipal laws addressing domestic violence largely failed to meet the required federal standards and often were unenforced.[7] Despite passing laws to protect women in 2007, the situation for women in Mexico has worsened. The process of seeking state protection has been described as perpetual bureaucratization, politicization, and revictimization\u201d, and so far very few of the state\u2019s efforts have resulted in a reduction of gender-based violence.[8]\n[17] XXXXhas already demonstrated that while he is mindful of Canadian laws, he is aware that he can act with far more impunity in Mexico. I find that state protection would not be forthcoming to the claimants in this case.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[18] I also find that the claimants do not have an internal flight alternative in Mexico. Although the principal claimant has a temporary custody order from a Canadian court, there is no evidence that this would be valid in Mexico. XXXXhas told the claimant that if returned to Mexico he would \u2018fix things\u2019, which the claimant believes means he would take XXXX away or attempt to seek custody. A Response to Information Request (RIR) issued by the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB) also states the following with respect to family court legal proceedings:\nOnce a family law-related proceeding, including divorce, custody or guardianship, has been initiated before the court, if the address or location of the other parent is unknown and they fail to comply with their obligation to the child, the other parent can request that the judge issue an order to government institutions such as the Mexican Social Security Institute (Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social), the Tax Administration Service (Servicio de Administraci\u00f3n Tributaria), among others, to search in their respective databases on the estranged parent.[9]\n[19] I find that the agent of harm in this case has the means and motivation to track the claimants to another location.\n[20] Further, the claimant would be returning to Mexico as a young, uneducated single mother. Her father is deceased, and she has never worked outside the home. The objective evidence before me states that low-income single mothers with children under 15 years of age face limited access and enjoyment of the right to food, as well as economic, social and cultural rights due to, among others, the vulnerable income status in which they find themselves, the discrimination they have suffered in different sectors such as social, labour and family, unequal access to employment opportunities, as well as low-paid jobs.[10] I find it would be objectively unreasonable for the claimants to relocate in these circumstances.\nCONCLUSION\n[21] I find the claimants are Convention Refugees pursuant to s.96 of the Act and the Board therefore accepts their claims.\n(signed) Kari Schroeder\nJanuary 10, 2022\n[1] Immigration and Refugee Protection Act,S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n[2] Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (IRB) Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 4: Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution, November 13, 1996.\n[3] Exhibit 5.\n[4] National Documentation Package, Mexico, 29 September 2021, tab 5.10: \u200bDomestic violence, including treatment of survivors of domestic violence; legislation; protection and support services available, including psychological services, particularly in Mexico City and M\u00e9rida (2017\u2013September 2020).

The claimant fears persecution at the hands of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in Iraq. The claimant was a recent graduate from XXXX XXXX and was the XXXX XXXX, and working in the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, spelt XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. During his tenure there, he noted that there were fraudulent activities happening. He reported these fraudulent activities to his management, because he noted that there were fictitious contractors named in the invoices. After advising management about his concerns, the claimant was informed that his employment was terminated.\n[3] After that, the claimant went back to his manager and told him that he believed that he was being terminated because of his reporting of these fraudulent activities. He warned his manager that he would report the names, and the fact that he was terminated to the Iraq Commission of Integrity, which was tasked with preventing and investigating corruption at all levels of the Iraqi government. Shortly after the claimant\u2019s termination from his position, he was picked up by members who he believes to have been part of this XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. He was kidnapped, tortured, and beaten physically, and harmed, for three (3) days in total. The belief that these individuals who kidnapped him were part of this XXXX XXXX comes from knowledge with the \u2014 which the claimant did not have at the time of the reporting. Apparently, that he learned, that his manager and others within that department were members of this XXXX. And that the report of fraudulent activities would be considered perilous to their corrupt activities and being able to continue with them.\n[4] The claimant\u2019s father had some influence within the government, and he confronted the claimant\u2019s former manager about the claimant\u2019s whereabouts when he discovered that he was missing. The father was told that his son was being detained by them. And that the reason was that his son \u201ctalked too much\u201d. The manager then told him, the father, that the only way to resolve this was to provide a guarantee that the father and claimant would not report the matter to the Integrity Commission. Furthermore, the manager demanded a ransom from the father for the continued safety of the claimant and the father. The father managed to pay the ransom demanded, and in consultation with the claimant, it was decided that the claimant should leave Iraq and go to Lebanon.\n[5] The claimant stayed in Lebanon from 2016 until his arrival in Canada in 2019. He started out in Lebanon with a short-term visitor\u2019s visa, and then converted it to a one (1) year student visa once he enrolled in university. While living in Lebanon, the claimant met and married a young woman. She was not interested in having a religious ceremony and filing the necessary legal documents of marriage until she found out she was pregnant. For the interest of the child, both the claimant and the former spouse made attempts to legalize their marriage. However, the legalization process was fraught with administrative errors, particularly regarding proper dates. The claimant and his spouse at the time tried to fix the errors, but while doing so, (inaudible) to the intervene and the claimant came to Canada for refuge. The claimant and his spouse ended up to divorcing.\n[6] The claimant said he was never able to attach any resident status to this marriage. He did go through the motions of getting the paperwork corrected but did so only to legalize his daughter. In order to keep this visa active in Lebanon, the claimant had to travel to Iraq, and he did so twice. The first time he went back, he said that he was in hiding. Five (5) days after getting to Iraq, his father received a threatening text, saying that the agents of persecution knew that the claimant was back in Iraq. The second time the claimant went back to Iraq, he decided on his own to seek justice, and he went to the Integrity Commission, where he told them his story about the corruption, the violence, and the termination of his position.\n[7] On his way back to Lebanon, he was in a taxi interact, and it was hit by another car from behind. He was taken to hospital for treatment, and he believes that it was the persons who had kidnapped him, and who were no doubt his former managers that were at the root of this intentional hit to his vehicle. Shortly after that, the father received a letter under his door to the effect that the agents of harms knew that the claimant had broken the deal and that \u2014 for silence. And that death would be his destiny.\n[8] The claimant has also filed additional information from his parents about events that have happened to them since the claimant has been in Canada. There have been new \u2014 it is okay \u2014 there have been new threats which the parents had not shared due to their concerns about putting the claimant under pressure. The claimant believes that he has been targeted due to his whistleblowing, and is at risk of further violence, detention, and threats, and possibly assassination, if he returns to Iraq. My determination is that I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee. And my analysis is as follows.\n[9] First of all, I am satisfied that the claimant has established his identity on the balance the probabilities by providing his passport. In terms of country to reference and exclusion, at the outset of the hearing, I advised the claimant that I would be exploring his status in Lebanon, particularly as it pertains to his marriage. I am satisfied that his visitor visa and student visa did not constitute any engagement of these issues due to the temporary and limited nature of them. However, it was not clear to me why the claimant\u2019s marriage did not attract more permanent status. In reviewing the NDP, there is little if any mentioned about how to acquire citizenship in Lebanon.\n[10] I advised the claimant (inaudible) that I had done a Wikipedia search and it was indicated in that, that while non-Lebanese women can attain citizenship through marriage, the reverse was not the case for men. The claimant confirmed this information. He testified that he was told that the only way he could attach any residency to his spouse \u2014 his former spouse, was for a period of three (3) years, subject to renewal. He did try to do so initially when they \u2014 when he learned that they were having a child. However, due to the administrative wrangling he endured during this process, it took a long time. And by the time he was ready to file, he and his spouse had decided to divorce.\n[11] The claimant has filed his divorce certificate, which appears authentic on its face, since the claimant is no longer married and no longer has ties to the spouse, I find that the issues of country and reference and exclusions have not been engaged here. I am satisfied that the only country of reference for the purposes of this analysis is Iraq.\n[12] In terms of inclusion, and credibility, a claimant is presumed to tell the truth unless there is evidence to the contrary. In this case, I found the claimant to be articulate, and I find that there was consistency between his narrative and his testimony. In addition, the claimant has filed substantial corroborative evidence to support his claim. Most importantly, he has filed a statement from his father, which aligns with the narrative of the claimant. I have no reason to doubt the authenticity of this statement. Additionally, the claimant has provided statements from witnesses who had knowledge of the claimant\u2019s circumstances back in XXXX 2016. All of which align with the claimant\u2019s allegations.\n[13] And finally, the claimant has provided a notice and an investigation has been started by the Integrity Commission into the allegations made by the claimant. This in my view is solid evidence to support that the claimant had a story to tell about what he believed to be fraudulent activity. I am satisfied based on those documents and on the plethora of documents provided, and on the credible testimony that the claimant\u2019s allegations are true. That he quite rightfully as a legal consultant tried to report fraudulent activity, but due to the corruption at the higher levels in his department, that he was faced with violence and significant negative repercussions for disclosing these matters to persons that he initially trusted, but then had reason to learn that he should not have trusted them. I am satisfied that despite the claimant\u2019s reavailment to Iraq, that this has not negated his subjective fears based on the circumstances surrounding these redevelopments.\n[14] In terms of a nexus, I considered whether or not the claimant has a nexus, and I find that he does. His actions were perceived by the agents of persecution to be against the interests of the state, and it was the state that employed the claimant. I find this meets the ground for the claimant perceived as being acting against the state, thereby it being an imputed political opinion. I have therefore analyzed this claim under section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[15] In terms of the objective evidence, I have looked at NDP 10.4, which specifically talks about this particular XXXX that the claimant believes has been \u2014 which the claimant believes is the one that targeted him. In particular, I notice that this particular document talks about how the XXXX ask the victims to pay exorbitant ransoms, and that the victims despite paying these exorbitant ransoms, remains unknown whether their bodies are found dumped on the streets, or on the outskirts of cities, or near riverbanks. In some cases, even after the relatives pay ransoms. All of this is consistent with how the claimant and his father were treated.\n[16] I have also considered the claimant\u2019s subjective evidence provided in Exhibit 8. The articles talked about the power of the XXXX in Iraq, and how they are for example, killing protesters with impunity. In my view, the objective evidence and the subjective evidence all support that the claimant has a well-founded fear of persecution were he to have returned to Iraq.\n[17] In terms of state protection, the claimant worked for a government department, and the agents of persecution were part of that apparatus, Since the state is the agent of persecution, the claimant would not be able to access protection in an adequate manner. The same applies to an internal flight alternative. Since the state is the agent persecution, I find that he would not be safe anywhere in his country. And this is borne out by the violence he endured when he did try to reavail. Clearly, he was being surveyed and pursued.\n[18] So, my conclusion is that I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee and I therefore approve his claim.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

Summarized only briefly, the claimant is an elderly Sunni widowed woman from Syria. She fears risk of persecution in Syria on the basis of her gender as a woman. All of her children reside outside of the country and she has no immediate family remaining in the country apart from a sister-in-law who is also an elderly woman. She fears being targeted as a vulnerable elder woman. The claimant also fears persecution on the basis of her religion as Sunni and her political opinion.\nDETERMINATION\n[5] I find the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to Section 96 of the Act. I find the claimant has established a nexus to Convention grounds of membership in a particular social group as a woman and religion as Sunni. It\u2019s the intersections of these identities where I find the claimant faces a risk in Syria.\nANALYSIS\nIDENTITY\n[6] The claimant\u2019s identity is established on a balance of probabilities by her testimony and by the copy of her Syrian passport in Exhibit 1.\nCREDIBILITY\n[7] In refugee determination claims, there is a presumption that the claimants and their allegations are true. In this case, I find no reason to doubt the claimant\u2019s truthfulness. The claimant testified in a forthcoming and spontaneous manner.\n[8] The claimant is an 80 year old woman and despite obvious frailties, I found that she testified in a clear and compelling manner. There were no material inconsistencies or contradictions between her Basis of Claim form, her testimony, and the other evidence before me.\n[9] The claimant was also able to support her claim with some documentary evidence all of which can be found in Exhibits 4 through 6 which includes identity documents and a copy of her late husband\u2019s death certificate. I have no reason to doubt the authenticity of these documents and I assign them weight as they corroborate the material elements or the claimant\u2019s allegations, namely the fact that she is an elderly widowed woman from Syria. I find the claimant has established on a balance of probabilities that she is an elderly Sunni widowed Syrian woman who fears persecution by the state on the basis of her gender as a woman, her political opinion, and her religion as a Sunni Muslim. I find the claimant has established her subjective fears.\nWELL-FOUNDED FEAR OF PERSECUTION\n[10] The objective evidence supports the claimant\u2019s fears of returning to Syria, My reasons for this are as follows: The documents in the NDP, for example, at items 5.1, 5.2, and 5.3 indicate that gender-based violence against women and children is pervasive in Syria and it has increased due to the conflict. Rape and sexual violence are endemic, underreported, and uncontrolled and are used to terrorize women, men and children perceived to support the opposition. Regime officials perpetrated gender-based violence with impunity. Government forces have perpetrated rape and sexual abuse of women. When women try to file police reports, the police often do not investigate thoroughly if at all and sometimes responded themselves with abusing women. The risk of gender-based violence is exacerbated in this case because the claimant is an elderly widowed woman. The country evidence before me confirms that women with particularly vulnerable profiles including widowed women like the claimant herself, face a higher risk of gender-based violence.\n[11] At NDP item 5.1 of the NDP, it states that widowed women face a heightened risk of sexual exploitation and are highly stigmatized by the Syrian society. The combination of being both female and Sunni adds a further dimension of risk in this case.\n[12] According to NDP item 1.12, Sunnis are often targeted by the regime due to a perceived anti-government opinion and arrests may be based merely on a person having resided in an area associated with the opposition or associated with Sunni communities.\n[13] Item 5.2 states that sexual violence against women has been used as a tactic in the war and has an integral part to the regime policy of subjugation of the opposition. The regime has framed the conflict as a fight between Alawites and Sunnis instead of a struggle for democracy. This government\u2019s antagonism towards Sunnis in particular has led to sexual violence against Sunni women. Ultimately I found the country evidence before me does establish that Sunni elderly widowed women face a serious possibility of persecution in Syria on the basis of their religion and their gender. I find the claimant\u2019s subjective fears are therefore objectively well-founded.\nSTATE PROTECTION\n[14] Except in situations where a state is in complete breakdown, states are presumed capable of protecting their citizens. In this case, the primary agent of persecution is the state and the persecution the claimant would face if returned to Syria is at the hands of the authorities. Accordingly, I find there is no state protection available to the claimant.\nINTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE\n[15] Further, the state of Syria is the agent of harm and it is in control of most of its territories. Where it is not in control, other armed groups as discussed posed a threat to women such as the claimant herself. Ultimately the claimant faces a serious possibility of persecution as an elderly woman without family support in all parts of Syria. I therefore find there is no Internal Flight Alternative available to this claimant.\n[16] For the foregoing reasons, I find the claimant is a Convention refugee under Section 96 of the Act and I therefore accept her claim.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

In coming to this decision today, I have considered and applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guidelines on woman claimants fearing gender-related persecution.\nDETERMINATION\n[3] I find the claimants are Convention refugees within the meaning of section 96 of the Act, because there is a serious possibility they will be persecuted in Colombia by reason of their membership in a particular social group of women and girls who are victims of domestic and family violence.\nALLEGATIONS\n[4] The following is a brief synopsis of the allegations that the claimants put forth in their Basis of Claim forms and narratives in Exhibit 2.\n[5] The claimants allege they face persecution in Colombia at the hands of the Principal Claimant\u2019s ex-partner, XXXX (ph), who is also the father of the minor claimant. The principal claimant met XXXX when she was young. Shortly after their relationship began, XXXX became violent. The principal claimant wanted to leave him, but she then became pregnant, and believed she had to stay for the sake of the minor claimant. The abuse continued throughout their relationship, including the pregnancy, the abuse was emotional, psychological, physical, and sexual. XXXX would follow her to and from work, threaten the claimant and her family, and abuse her on a regular basis. He stalked her in person and online and contacted partners and family members. The claimant was able to separate from XXXX after the minor claimant was born. The principal claimant felt compelled to allow XXXX and his family access to the minor claimant. At times, he would take her without bringing her back and at other times, when the minor claimant returned, she was unwell and seemingly uncared for. The principal claimant does not know how XXXX earns money but would be advised that he was involved with the Medellin Cartel and narco traffickers. He would post photographs on social media with narco traffickers. He would also advise the claimant of these connections and threatened to have someone kill her.\n[6] Despite being separated from XXXX, the abuse continued. The principal claimant tried to seek state protection. She called, for example, the XXXX XXXX XXXX a number of times. XXXX would flee before they arrived, and the police would never follow up on the incident. This allowed XXXX to continue with his behaviour. The principal claimant also obtained a protective order, which is in evidence, but XXXX abuse continued. In XXXX 2017, the principal claimant met a Canadian citizen online named XXXX (ph). XXXX paid for the claimant\u2019s travel to Canada. On the first trip, in XXXX 2018, the principal claimant came alone because she did not know how to obtain XXXX authorization for the minor claimant\u2019s travel. The claimant returned to Colombia in XXXX 2018. She wanted to bring the minor claimant to Canada with her. She spoke to a lawyer, and ultimately, the principal claimant was able to make an agreement not to pursue support payment against XXXX in return for his agreement to allow the minor claimant to permanently leave Colombia. Again, a copy of this agreement is also in evidence.\n[7] The claimants entered Canada for the final time in XXXX 2019. The claimants were fearful of returning to Colombia. They believed XXXX was going to sponsor them in Canada. In the summer of 2019, the claimant contacted the office responsible for the sponsorship application and was advised that XXXX had put a stop to the process without advising her. In XXXX 2019, he left the home, which forced the claimant to move in with a friend. Both claimants, I should say. XXXX returned after a month and apologized. They again began the spousal sponsorship process with a new firm. In XXXX 2020, XXXX again left with \u2014 while the claimants were out. He did not return. At the end of the relationship, he also was abusive.\n[8] At the end of XXXX 2020, the claimants contacted a legal clinic. The principal claimant explained her situation in Colombia and was advised about the refugee process. She then initiated the claim in about XXXX 2021.\n[9] Over the years, XXXX has continued to threaten the claimants, including by contacting XXXX in Canada and other partners and family members in Colombia. The claimants fear ongoing domestic violence should they return to Colombia.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[10] I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the claimant\u2019s identities as nationals of Colombia are established by the copies of their passports in Exhibit 1 and also by the principal claimant\u2019s credible testimony today.\nCredibility and Well-Founded Fear of Persecution\n[11] The duty of this Panel is to find that there is sufficient, credible, or trustworthy evidence to determine that there is more than a mere possibility that these claimants would be persecuted if returned to Colombia. My role is to determine if there is a reliable and trustworthy evidence that can establish the claimant\u2019s allegations on a balance of probabilities. In this case, I find there is.\n[12] The principal claimant testified on behalf of her family. She testified in a voluntary, detailed, and straightforward manner. She testified to her personal history, including her abusive relationship, and the resulting threats that she and her daughter have faced. Her testimony was very detailed, spontaneous, and emotive, and the claimant also provided ample supporting evidence to corroborate their allegations, including identity documents, a copy of the minor claimant\u2019s birth certificate, a custody order, a permanent travel authorization for the minor claimant, numerous police and state documents relating to the abuse from XXXX, including police reports and a copy of the temporary protective order, numerous documents relating to the relationship with XXXX and the sponsor \u2014 spousal sponsorship application in Canada, copies of correspondence between the principal claimant and the airport authorities in Colombia requesting information on XXXX notification request. I have no reason to doubt the authenticity of any of these documents. I assign the documents significant weight, as they corroborate the central elements of the claimants\u2019 allegations.\n[13] I also find the principal claimant has satisfactorily explained her delay in making a claim for protection in Canada and her re-availments to Colombia, which were at the behest of her ex-partner, XXXX, who controlled her immigration status in Canada, and which were based on her understanding of the requirements of the sponsorship process in Canada, and given she was required to return to Colombia to pick up her daughter. The delay in re-availments do not diminish the claimant\u2019s overall credibility or the core of their story about domestic, physical, and sexual violence. I find that the claimant\u2019s delays in claiming or the returns to Colombia do not impact the credibility of the claimant\u2019s subjective fears, as I find she has provided reasonable explanations. I therefore make no negative inference against the claimants.\n[14] Overall, I identified no material contradictions, inconsistencies, or omissions between the claimant\u2019s allegations and the evidence before me. I find the principal claimant was a credible witness, and I believe what she has alleged both in testimony and in whole in her Basis of Claim form and narratives. I note the \u2014 I note further that the claimant\u2019s subjective fears are objectively well-founded and corroborated by the country evidence before me.\n[15] According to a report at Item 5.4 of the NDP, \u201csources indicate that violence against woman has become normalized to the point that it is invisible to authorities and society in general in Colombia. Although prohibited by law, rape, including spousal rape, remains a serious problem. In Cali, women only report domestic violence to the FGN\u2019s office. Family commissaries not properly trained to deal with domestic violence complaints, and the process for dealing with domestic violence complaints are slow and lack effectiveness. Women are revictimized at state institutions as their \u2014 as they are the object of offensive or inconsiderate comments by officials who lay the blame on these women for the violence they have experienced. Conciliation is often considered in domestic violence situations, which, in practice, makes women vulnerable, because it means they have to accept the violence from their partner, and leaves them in an even more dire position. The infrastructure and personnel, especially at the family commissiaries (sic), is insufficient.\n[16] I accept the principal claimant was a victim of intimate partner violence, and that the minor claimant was a victim of domestic violence in Colombia as she was used as leverage by XXXX to harm the principal claimant. I also accept the principal claimant\u2019s testimony that she is certain that XXXX would harm the minor claimant. I find this certainty is not speculative, but actually a valid inference which can be drawn from the evidence, and which is derived from her own firsthand experiences. I note the objective evidence supports the claimant\u2019s allegations of the tolerance and impunity perpetrators of violence experience in Colombia. I find the claimants have established, with reliable and credible evidence, that they would likely \u2013 more likely than not, continue to experience emotional and physical violence from XXXX in Colombia. I find the claimants face a serious possibility of persecution in that country.\nState Protection\n[17] States are presumed capable of protecting their citizens. In this case, I find the presumption has been rebutted. According to the country condition documents before me, the Colombian Government has passed legislation to address domestic violence. However, these efforts have not been effective on an operational level, and domestic violence continues to be a serious problem throughout the country. The US DOS report at Item 2.1 of the NDP states that although prohibited by law, rape, including spousal rape, remains a serious problem in the country. The report further states that violence against women and impunity for perpetrators continue to be a problem.\n[18] According to Item 5.4 of the NDP, as I said, violence against women has become normalized in Colombia to the point that it is invisible to authorities and society in general. A Colombian non-governmental organization that advocated for woman\u2019s rights reports that in many cases women prefer not to report domestic violence out of a fear of being stigmatized or revictimized by state institutions. According to the United Nations, institutions that deal with cases of domestic violence in Colombia have insufficient capacity, resulting in high levels of impunity. As an example, in 2015, Colombia\u2019s Attorney General\u2019s office received over 85,000 cases of intra-family violence, with charges laid in just 12 percent of the cases, and a conviction rate of only 24 percent. Ultimately, I find there is sufficient objective clear and convincing evidence to establish the claimants are unable to receive operationally effective protection from the state authorities in Colombia. In this case, the principal claimant herself has already attempted to seek state protection on numerous occasions, each without any meaningful follow up or protection provided, and even after contacting the state, XXXX continued to harm the claimants. I find in this case the presumption of state protection has been rebutted.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[19] the first prong of this assessment is to determine on a balance of probabilities if there is a serious possibility of persecution in the internal flight alternative or a risk to life, cruel and unusual treatment. In this case, I did identify Medellin as a potential IFA. However, the Panel notes the agent of harm in this case has remained motivated and capable in finding the claimants through families and friends. He has been able to find the principal claimant online and even contacted her ex-partners. I find the claimants would have to remain in hiding to not come to XXXX attention. Further, as the father of the minor claimant having a parental connection to the child in the case would allow him to use the courts or police to assist him in locating the claimants throughout Colombia. Although the Panel recognizes court injunctions on him knowing her whereabouts could potentially be put in place under legislation, as previously noted, the ineffectiveness and the conciliation used in these cases is simply not reasonable, and I find there is not sufficient evidence to conclude that they would be effective.\n[20] Ultimately, I find the claimants do face a series possibility of persecution throughout Colombia, and that there is no internal flight alternative available for the claimants as a result.\nCONCLUSION\n[21] For the above noted reasons, I find both of the claimants are Convention refugees pursuant to section 96 of the Act, and I accept these claims today.\n[22] So, as I said, that will conclude our hearing for today. Again, thank you, everybody, for your involvement. I will take us off the record now and wish you all the best. Okay?\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

Coulthard\nCountry: Yemen\nRPD Number: VC1-07100\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2022-01960\nATIP Pages: N\/A\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: I have considered all of the evidence in this case, and I am prepared to provide my decision orally. This is the decision of the Refugee Protection Division in the claim of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, as a citizen of Yemen who is seeking protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. In coming to this decision today, and including in the hearing, I have considered and applied the Chairperson\u2019s guideline on woman claimants fearing gender-related persecution.\nAllegations\n[2] The claimant\u2019s allegations are contained in full in her Basis of Claim form and attached narrative at Exhibit 2. Summarized only briefly, the claimant is an elderly divorced female, alleging fear of persecution in Yemen due to her Sunni religion, her perceived political opinion, and membership in a particular social group, namely, her gender as a woman.\nDetermination\n[3] I find the claimant is a Convention refugee. I find the claimant has established a nexus to the Convention ground of membership in a particular social group, namely, her gender as a woman. Therefore, I am assessing this claim under section 96. I do note that the claimant has also alleged persecution based on her political opinion and her religion, however, I found her claim to be established on her gender alone, and have therefore only analyzed this element of her claim as a result.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[4] I find the claimant\u2019s identity as a national of Yemen is established based on her testimony, and also a copy of her passport, which can be found in Exhibit 1.\nCredibility\n[5] Pursuant to the Maldonado principle, the claimant benefits from a presumption that her allegations are true. In this case, I have no reason to doubt the truthfulness of the claimant. I note that the claimant is an uneducated elderly woman. This vulnerable profile was taken into consideration when assessing her testimony, and in questioning today. Despite some obvious barriers, she did testify in a forthcoming and emotive way that I did find to be compelling. Her Basis of Claim and narrative were detailed and materially consistent with her testimony at the hearing, and the other evidence before me. I found the claimant to be a credible witness. Further, I find that the material elements of her profile, namely her profile as an elderly woman, are corroborated by the objective evidence before me, which includes a copy of her passport. I find she has established she is a national of Yemen who fears persecution in Yemen based on her gender as a woman.\nWell-founded Fear and Risk of Harm\n[6] For a claimant to be a convention refugee, the claimant must have a well-founded fear of persecution due to a Convention ground. In this case, I find the documentary evidence is clear and consistent that women in Yemen face significant pervasive discrimination that amounts to persecution. I note that in this particular case, the claimant\u2019s vulnerabilities are further exacerbated by the fact that she is an elderly, uneducated, and divorced woman. She has no family in Yemen, and I find that this puts her at a serious risk of persecution based on her gender in that country. As noted by the report at the human rights watch at Tab 5.8 of the NDP which is in Exhibit 3, laws in Yemen require women to be obedient to their husbands. Women are generally not allowed to leave the house without permission of men. Honour killings by men of women and girls are treated very leniently by the courts, if they are prosecuted at all. As noted by the US DOS report at Tab 2.1, a male relative\u2019s consent was often required before a woman could even be admitted to a hospital. The claimant has no male relatives in Yemen. Without even taking into consideration the ongoing conflict in which woman and children bear a heavier burden of negative consequences, the discrimination against woman and girls in Yemen is so significant and pervasive that a woman is not even able to reliably seek medical treatment or help without a man there to give her permission. The US DOS report notes that with the loss of many men from households in the conflict, this requirement for a man\u2019s consent before women can get medical treatment means that many women are simply not receiving any medical treatment because hospitals are refusing to deal with women alone. According to the report at 5.7, gender-based violence in Yemen has risen to alarming proportions, with an estimated 90 percent of woman facing sexual harassment in public spaces. A report at Tab 2.7 by the UN Human Rights Council notes \u201cin 2018 and 2019, new oppressive gender norms have proliferated, and women and girls are further marginalized\u201d. Women are marginalized by both state and non-state actors, and the conditions have only worsened in recent years. I am satisfied based on the evidence before me and the remaining evidence in the NDP that the claimant will face a serious possibility of persecution as a woman if she were to return to Yemen. I find the claimant\u2019s fears are well-founded and forward-facing.\nState protection and Internal Flight Alternative\n[7] Except in situations where the state is in complete breakdown, states are presumed to be capable of protecting their citizens. The objective evidence before me indicates that all sides to the conflict in Yemen continue to commit severe human rights abuses. Given this, along with the ongoing conflict, instability, and widespread violence, I find there is no adequate or operational state protection available to the claimant in her particular circumstances, including the circumstances of being a divorced, elderly woman without male support. I find the presumption of state protection has been rebutted.\n[8] Further, I find that it is not safe nor objectively reasonable in all of the circumstances, including those particular to this claimant, to relocate anywhere in Yemen. I find the claimant faces a serious possibility of persecution through Yemen on the basis of her gender and profile as an elderly divorced woman. I also find that her gender would make internal relocation entirely unreasonable, given that women in Yemen often require permission from men to even leave their house. Accordingly, I find there is no IFA available to this claimant.\nCONCLUSION\n[9] Based on the foregoing analysis, I find the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the Act, and I therefore accept her claim.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

This is the decision of the Refugee Protection Division in the claim of XXXX XXXX XXXX, a citizen of Ethiopia who is claiming protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, also known as the Act. In coming to my decision, I\u2019ve reviewed and applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline on woman refugee claimants fearing gender-related persecution.\nAllegations\n[2] The claimant is an Amhara woman who fears political, ethnic, and gender-based persecution in Ethiopia. The claimant\u2019s full allegations are contained in her Basis of Claim form and narrative in Exhibit 2 and are reproduced briefly below. In about XXXX 2017, the claimant and her daughter were traveling back to Ethiopia after visiting a relative in Germany. The claimant\u2019s daughter was interrogated at the airport and the authorities demanded that she appear at the police station the following morning. The claimant\u2019s daughter was arrested on about XXXX XXXX, 2017 and held for three days. While she was arrested, she was tortured, beaten, and raped. She was accused of supporting political dissidents abroad, meeting the opposition in the diaspora, and bringing funds into the country to help the opposition in Ethiopia. The claimant herself paid her daughter\u2019s bail of about 10,000 birrs to facilitate her release, with the conditions that her daughter did not leave Addis Ababa, and that she report to the police on the first Monday of every month. Fearing for her life and safety, the claimant\u2019s daughter fled Ethiopia on about XXXX XXXX, 2017 and came to Canada, where she has since been found to be a Convention refugee. The claimant herself assisted her daughter in getting out of Ethiopia. She did this even while she was afraid that doing so would cause repercussions.\n[3] After the claimant\u2019s daughter fled Ethiopia, security agents went to the claimant\u2019s house in about XXXX 2018 with a summons for her daughter. The police warned the claimant that if her daughter did not appear, they would detain the claimant in her place. At this time, the claimant\u2019s daughter had already left the country. After this, the claimant herself continued to fear for her life and safety. She started to look for ways out of Ethiopia. She applied for a visitor\u2019s visa to Canada but was denied. Her son, who was in the USA, invited her to that country on a visitor\u2019s visa. That visa was approved in about XXXX 2019. From XXXX 2018 (sic) until about XXXX 2019, the claimant lived in hiding. She went from place to place, from relative to relative, trying to evade security forces. She did not live at her home. The claimant then paid a bribe to exit the airport safely. She had to do this because she was afraid that if she went through airport security, she would be arrested. She arrived in the USA in about XXXX 2019. The claimant remained in the USA from about XXXX XXXX, 2019 to XXXX XXXX, 2019. She did not claim protection because her son advised her to wait and see what would happen in Ethiopia. The claimant applied again for a Canadian visa while she was in the USA, and it was granted. The claimant traveled to Canada in XXXX 2019.\n[4] Since arriving in Canada, the claimant says the situation in Ethiopia has deteriorated. She fears returning to Ethiopia because she\u2019s already been threatened by the authorities with arrest. This is exacerbated by her gender and by the fact that she is now in Canada with the daughter, and both have sought protection, despite the claimant and her daughter breaching the conditions of her daughter\u2019s release. The claimant also fears persecution as an Amhara, and religious persecution as an orthodox Christian.\nDETERMINATION\n[5] I find the claimant is a Convention refugee. I find claimant\u2019s allegations have a nexus to the Convention grounds of political opinion, ethnicity, and gender. I\u2019ve therefore assessed this claim under s. 96 of the Act.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[6] I find the claimant has established her identity on a balance of probabilities by a copy of her Ethiopian passport, which can be found in Exhibit 1, and by her testimony.\nCredibility\n[7] The claimant benefits from the presumption that her allegations are true. In this case, I find no reason to doubt the truthfulness of the claimant. She testified in a spontaneous, forthcoming and compelling manner. She was detailed in her answers, and her answers were consistent with the narrative and the narrative of her daughter. The claimant also provided supporting documentation to corroborate her allegations, including a copy of her daughter\u2019s Basis of Claim form and her refugee decision, a supporting letter from her church, a supporting letter from her cousin who she stayed with Ethiopia after she was threatened by the state, and her birth certificate, which identifies her as Amhara. I have no reason to doubt the authenticity of these documents and I assign them weight, as they corroborate central elements of the claimant\u2019s allegations. I have considered whether the claimant\u2019s failure to claim in the USA and her delay in claiming once in Canada negatively impact the credibility of her subjective fear, and I find they do not. The claimant was in the USA from about XXXX 2019 to about XXXX XXXX XXXX 2019. She was residing with her son, she did not claim protection. She\u2019s then obtained a visa to come to Canada and arrived in Canada XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 2019. She did not initiate her claim for protection in Canada until about XXXX 2020.\n[8] I note that the claimant is uneducated, and she\u2019s lived much of her life as a homemaker. In the USA, she resided with her son. Her son speaks English and had been in the USA for six years. He told her not to claim protection until they knew what was going to happen in Ethiopia. The claimant accepted that her son was more knowledgeable than she on asylum claims in the USA, and she accepted his advice. Indeed, she relied on him for her livelihood in the USA. I find it reasonable on a balance of probabilities that she would take the advice of her son, even if that advice was perhaps not the best advice. Further, I find it reasonable that the claimant would continue with this advice even while in Canada. I note that the claimant was on valid status that did not expire until about April 2021. At the time that she made her claim, she was not under imminent, immediate threat of removal. Instead, as her son suggested, when she came to Canada, she continued to see what would happen in Ethiopia. Unfortunately, the situation continued to deteriorate and eventually the claimant realized she needed to claim protection. She did this well before her status expired. I find the claimant\u2019s explanations reasonable, and in light of her personal profile and circumstances, I make no negative inference against the claimant for her failure to claim in the USA or her delay in claiming in Canada. Ultimately, I find the claimant has established that her daughter is wanted by the authorities in Ethiopia, that the claimant herself was involved in bailing her daughter out and agreeing to the conditions of her release, and that the claimant herself assisted her daughter in fleeing the country despite the state demanding that she not do that.\n[9] I find that the claimant has also established that she fears returning to Ethiopia because of her ethnicity as an Amhara person, and because of her religion. I find that she was also directly threatened by the state, and that the state advised her that if her daughter did not appear, they would detain her in her daughter\u2019s place.\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution and Risk of Harm\n[10] The objective evidence supports the claimant\u2019s fears of returning to Ethiopia and indicates that, \u201cSecurity forces used excessive and sometimes lethal force and carried out extra judicial executions. Hundreds of people were killed, and property destroyed in ethnically motivated violence by armed groups and milia. Opposition members and journalists were subjected to arbitrary arrests and detention.\u201d That can be found at NDP 2.2. This confirms there is recurrent unrest and violence along ethnic lines in Ethiopia. Ultimately, I find on a balance of probabilities that the NDP establishes that ethnic groups like the Amhara, which is the claimant\u2019s ethnicity, face risk of persecution from state and non-state agents in Ethiopia. Specific reports of targeted violence against Amhara people can be found throughout the NDP, for example, at 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, to name a few. At NDP Item 2.2, it states that, \u201cInter-communal violence intensified in Ethiopia. In November, at least 54 people from the Amhara ethnic group in Gawa Qanqa village were killed in an attack by suspected members of the Oromo Liberation army (sic). In the same month, an armed conflict erupted in the Tigray region, and scores of ethnic Amhara residents, likely hundreds, were massacred in Mai Kadra.\u201d There were numerous reports in Item 2.2 of the NDP of Amhara people being targeted and attacked, including in September 2020 by the Benishangul People\u2019s Liberation Front (sic), where 45 people were killed and thousands displaced, in October 2020, where 31 Amhara residents from Guraferda were killed by armed assailants, and in November 2020, when local militias and youth stabbed and hacked to death scores and likely hundreds of ethnic Amhara residents in the western part of the Tigray region.\u201d According to NDP 2.3, the security and human rights situation in Ethiopia has deteriorated. The landscape \u201cWas defined by ongoing abuses by government security forces, attacks on civilians by armed groups, deadly violence along communal and ethnic lines, and a political crisis.\u201d According to NDP Item 1.8, the government is struggling to contain the disconnect from Ethiopia\u2019s myriad ethnic groups, fighting the federal government and each other for greater influence and resources. Outbreaks of ethnic violence have displaced around 2.4 million people according to the UN in Ethiopia.\n[11] I find the claimant, on a balance (sic), faces a serious possibility of forward-facing risk in Ethiopia on the basis of her ethnicity as Amhara. I\u2019ve also considered the claimant\u2019s risk as the known mother of a fugitive of the state in Ethiopia. The claimant\u2019s daughter was arrested on XXXX 2017 after being accused of meeting with political opposition outside of Ethiopia. The claimant assisted in facilitating her daughter\u2019s release from detention, including paying her bail. Both the claimant and her daughter have fled Ethiopia against the demands of the authorities. The authorities directly threatened the claimant that they would detain her if her daughter was not brought for the summons. I find, on a balance, that the claimant, like her daughter, is perceived as a political opponent or political dissident in Ethiopia. According to NDP 4.16, \u201cIndividuals who are known dissidents are at a high risk of detention,\u201d on return to Ethiopia. According to Item 4.21, the state continues to direct violence at actual and imputed government opponents, including through continued detention at government re-education camps, where detainees endure brainwashing. Ultimately, I find that the claimant is viewed on a balance of probabilities as a political opponent and dissident in Ethiopia, and that these conditions where these people face risk of persecution apply to the claimant. I find the claimant faces a serious possibility of persecution based on her imputed political opinion.\n[12] Lastly, I note that the claimant alleges she faces persecution as a result of her religion, being orthodox Christian. According to NDP 1.5, attacks on places of worship have increased since 2018. \u201cAccording to the Amhara Professionals Union, a US-based advocacy group, 30 churches belonging primarily to Ethiopian orthodox church were attacked between July 2018 and September 2019. These attacks reportedly left hundred people dead, including priests and parishers (sic).\u201d This is echoed in NDP 2.2. However, while I recognize that there are reports of orthodox Christians facing risk in Ethiopia, I find the claimant has established her claim based on her ethnicity and political opinion, and therefore, I am making no finding on whether orthodox Christians face risk of persecution in Ethiopia. Therefore, on a balance of probabilities, I find the claimant has establishes that she faces a serious risk of possibility of persecution in Ethiopia based on her ethnicity as Amhara and based on her imputed political opinion given she\u2019s perceived, on a balance, by the state as a political dissident.\nState Protection and Internal Flight Alternative\n[13] Given that the state agents are the agents of persecution in this case, I find that there is no operationally effective state protection available to the claimant in her circumstances. Further, given that the state has the capacity to find the claimant throughout Ethiopia, and namely that the claimant would have to go through the state to even enter Ethiopia, I find that it is neither safe nor objectively reasonable in all of the circumstances, including those particular to the claimant, for her to relocate anywhere throughout Ethiopia. Accordingly, I find there is no viable IFA available to the claimant.\n[14] In conclusion, for the foregoing reasons, I find the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to s. 96 of the Act, and I therefore accept her claim. Mister Interpreter, just a very brief overview, please. Ma\u2019am, I wish you all the best, and I will take us off the record. Everyone have a wonderful day.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

This is the decision of the Refugee Protection Division, the RPD, in the claim of XXXX XXXX XXXX, the claimant, of Zimbabwe, who is claiming refugee protection pursuant to s. 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, the IRPA. I have considered and applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guidelines on Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution. I have also considered and applied the Immigration and Refugee Board\u2019s Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9 on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression and Sex Characteristics, the SOGIESC Guidelines.\nDETERMINATION\n[4] I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to s. 96 of the IRPA based on her well-founded fear of persecution in Zimbabwe.\n[5] The specifics of the claim are stated in the claimant\u2019s Basis of Claim form and narrative in evidence. The claimant is a 38-year-old woman who identifies as bisexual. She faced threats and physical harm in Zimbabwe from her family members and general society due to her sexual orientation and her relationship with a woman. She was physically harmed on many occasions in public and in her home, and her home was burned down while she was inside. She soon \u2014 after this incident, she soon decided to move to South Africa, which she did in 2009 and remained there until 2018, where she lived on a work permit, which she renewed annually or biannually. In South Africa, she was also in a same-sex relationship with a woman named XXXX (ph) for four years, who she met at XXXX XXXX in Cape Town. Their relationship ended when the claimant moved to the USA in 2018 for employment on a cruise ship. The claimant relocated to the USA on a temporary work permit in XXXX 2018 and remained there until the end of 2018. While working on the cruise ship, she met her current partner, XXXX XXXX (ph), who is from Belize. They have been in an exclusive relationship since this time and they communicate daily. The claimant moved to Canada in early XXXX 2019 and made her refugee claim at that time. The claimant fears returning to Zimbabwe and being harmed or killed due to her sexual orientation.\nIDENTITY\n[6] I\u2019m satisfied with the identity of the claimant as a citizen of Zimbabwe, which is established by her testimony and the copy of her passport with a USA visa, type C (inaudible) in evidence.\nCredibility\n[7] When a claimant swears to the truth of allegations, this creates a presumption that those allegations are true unless there is reason to doubt their truthfulness. I find no reason to doubt the truthfulness of the claimant. She testified in straightforward, forthright, detailed, and candid manner. There were no material inconsistencies, omissions, or contradictions between the claimant\u2019s testimony and the other evidence in this case that were not reasonably explained. She did not exaggerate or tailor her evidence. In summary, her testimony was consistent with the other evidence on central aspects of her claim.\n[8] I find the claimant also provided ample details to expand upon her allegations and she provided evidence in Exhibit 4 which included a letter from the XXXX, which is an LGBTQ+ support organization in Canada, a certificate of attendance at the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX from XXXX 2019 to XXXX 2020, a letter from her current partner, XXXX XXXX and as well as her identification document, and a letter of support from XXXX XXXX (ph) from XXXX 2021, and a letter of support from her partner in South Africa \u2014 her former partner in South Africa, XXXX XXXX (ph) as well as for identification document. During the hearing, the claimant was asked if she could provide any photographs or other evidence to substantially her relationship to her current partner. The claimant testified that she had photographs and spontaneously turned on her phone and pulled up multiple photographs of her and her partner, Janalie Cruz. She further testified in a candid manner that her partner was a female who considered herself to be male. However, she was not able to afford the gender-affirming surgery yet. She further testified that her and her partner speak daily over video chat and they have future plans to be together in person and even get married as they have been in a relationship since 2018.\n[9] The claimant lived in South Africa from 2019 \u2014 sorry, 2009 to 2018, and then relocated to the USA on a temporary work visa for employment on a cruise ship. While in the USA, the claimant met her current partner. However, she feared making a refugee claim in the USA due to the Trump administration\u2019s stringent policies on refugees. She therefore relocated to Canada in 2019 to make a refugee claim. Considering the particular circumstances of claimant, I find her explanation to be reasonable and I find that her failure to claim asylum in the USA is not indicative of her lack of subjective fear. As such, I do not draw a negative inference on her credibility.\n[10] Due to the pandemic, the claimant has participated intermittently in LGBTQ organizations and events in Canada. There\u2019s a support letter from the XXXX in Exhibit 4 which is a settlement organization, providing programs and services to the LGBTQ community, who confirm the claimant\u2019s participation, and she participated in a number of XXXX hosted events.\n[11] Given the claimant\u2019s careful testimony and supporting documents, I find the claimant has established on a balance of probabilities the facts alleged in her claim, including that she has been threatened and harmed by her family in Zimbabwe as well as general society, as well as the allegations that she\u2019s a bisexual woman who is currently in a relationship with someone named XXXX XXXX, and therefore the subjective fear she has of returning to Zimbabwe now. In sum, I find the claimant to be a credible witness and therefore believe what she has alleged in support of her claim.\nNexus\n[12] To qualify for refugee status under the Refugee Convention, an individual must demonstrate that they have a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. The allegations establish a nexus to the Convention ground for the claimant based on her membership in a particular social group as a bisexual woman facing violence due to her sexual orientation. I will therefore assess this claim under s. 96. I find the claimant has a well-founded fear of persecution based on her sexual orientation.\n[13] The claimant testified that she experienced frequent physical violence and threats in Zimbabwe due to her same-sex relationships. The country condition documents indicate that LGBTQI persons face societal and official harassment and discrimination, arbitrary detention, and sporadic violence in Zimbabwe. According to the National Documentation Package for Zimbabwe at Item 6.1, the atmosphere \u2014 it states that the atmosphere of severe sociopolitical hostility directed at sexual and gender minorities over the past year was described in the UK Home Office\u2019s 2018 report. In fact, former President Mugabe\u2019s anti-gay rhetoric has been backed up by many politicians, including a member of the Zimbabwe Human Rights Commission. This report further states that this is frequently reflected in the media where journalists report that it is risky if not deadly to be gay and lesbian in Zimbabwe, a country where such relations are beyond taboo. According to a source in the National Documentation Package at item 6.2, a report on laws applying to LGBT individuals in selected Southern African countries, OutRight Action International, it states that \u201cAn international LGBTIQ organization that seeks to advance human rights and opportunities for LGBTIQ people around the world,\u201d and similarly states that in Zimbabwe, although the criminal law and Codification and Reform Act does not explicitly extend to homosexual women, in practice, lesbians are subjected to the same victimization, censure, and police harassment as gay men.\n[14] Additionally, one of the UN Human Rights Council stakeholder submissions for the forthcoming 2016 universal periodic review stated that \u2014 GALZ stated that homophobia permeates Zimbabwean society unchecked and manifests itself in different forms, ranging from verbal and physical assault (inaudible) discrimination of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex people on the basis of their sexual orientation or gender identity. NDP Item 6.3 states that refusal by duty-bearers and policymakers to address this issue has resulted in the public intolerance of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex persons becoming deeply ingrained in the community and reinforces the general stigmatization of sexual minorities in society. With respect to treatment by state actors, the DFAT report from 2016 stated that the authorities more commonly harassed LGBTI persons using loitering, indecency, and public order statutes, although violations are underreported because of the stigma attached to the LGBTI community. In 2014, Gays and Lesbians of Zimbabwe, the GALZ, reported that \u2014 41 cases of arbitrary arrest, violence, harassment, unfair dismissal, and forceful displacement involving LGBTI persons.\n[15] The claimant has identified as a bisexual woman who has already experienced physical violence in Zimbabwe on the basis of her sexual orientation. The objective evidence indicates that she faces a well-founded fear of persecution. Therefore, I find the claimant has demonstrated a well-founded fear of persecution on both a subjective and objective basis. I also find the claimant would face a serious possibility of persecution in Zimbabwe based on her profile as a bisexual woman.\nState Protection\n[16] In all refugee claims, a state is presumed to be capable of protecting its citizens unless there is clear and convincing evidence to the contrary. In this case, I find that this presumption has been rebutted. To rebut this presumption, a claimant must establish on a balance of probabilities through clear and convincing evidence that their state\u2019s protection is inadequate, and the onus is on the claimant to do this. According to NDP Item 6.3, there is a high level of official discrimination against LGBTI persons in Zimbabwe. Authorities continue to violate rights of LGBT people. A Zimbabwe Human Rights Commission report published in July showed continued hostility and systematic discrimination by police and politicians against LGBT people, driving many to live underground. At NDP Item 6.2, LGBTI individuals face arbitrary detention and torture at the hands of law enforcement officials. Police reportedly detained and held persons suspected of being gay for up to 40 hours before releasing them. LGBTI activist groups also reported police using extortion, threats, frequent beatings, mocking, and forced to pay bribes in order to escape custody. Where agents of the state are persecutors, a claimant\u2019s effort to seek state protection need not exhaust all avenues and recourse. In light of the country condition evidence regarding the availability of state protection to those who are similarly situated, I find that the claimant\u2019s efforts in this regard were reasonable and that on a balance of probabilities the state will not afford her adequate protection, and I find she has rebutted the presumption of state protection.\nInternal Flight Alternative, or IFA\n[17] The test for a viable IFA has two prongs, and I must be satisfied of both on a balance of probabilities in order for there to be a viable IFA. First, I must be satisfied that the claimant would not face a serious possibility of persecution and that she would not be personally subjected to a risk to life of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or a danger of torture in the IFA. Second, I must be satisfied that it would not be unreasonable in all the circumstances, including those particular to the claimant, for her to seek refuge there. Once an IFA has been proposed, the onus is on the claimant to show that the IFA is unreasonable. As the Zimbabwean state is involved with the harm and is therefore the agent of persecution and is in effective control of all of its territory, I find there is no viable internal flight alternative for the claimant within Zimbabwe as she would face a serious possibility of persecution throughout the country.\n[18] For these reasons, I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee under s. 96 of the Act, and I accept her claim. Thank you.\n[19] CLAIMANT: Thank you.\n[20] COUNSEL: Thank you very much.\n[21] MEMBER: You\u2019re welcome. Thank you for sharing your experiences with me today, and congratulations.\n[22] CLAIMANT: Thank you.\n[23] MEMBER: Have a nice afternoon, everyone. That is it for today.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

I have heard these claims jointly pursuant to rule 55 of the RPD Rules.\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] The full allegations are set out in the claimants\u2019 Basis of Claim forms found at Exhibit 2. However, I will summarize the allegations briefly. The principal claimant is a 52-year-old woman who has converted to Christianity. She was born into a Muslim family in Tehran. Her father was strict with Islam and imposed many of the rules on her. However, her mother was more liberal. The principal claimant was injured in a car accident when she was about 30 and was in a coma. An elderly Christian neighbour who is friends with her mother provided prayer and spiritual support for the principal claimant\u2019s recovery. Once she had recovered from the coma, she began to think of Christianity as benevolent. Unfortunately, her neighbour passed away.\n[4] The principal claimant then came to Canada in XXXX 2019 with her stepson, the associate claimant, where she continued to explore the Christian faith. She began to attend XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and gained knowledge from the church leaders. She states that she has formally converted in XXXX 2020. She also has a sister in Canada, who accidentally advised another Muslim sister in Iran of the principal claimant\u2019s conversion. Her sister in Iran then informed her work, and she was fired. The principal claimant alleges that her conversion to Christianity places her at risk of persecution in Iran from both the state and her family. She believes that she is in danger if she returns to Iran.\n[5] The associate claimant is a 19-year-old man and the stepson of the principal claimant. He came to Canada in order to study. He feels that Shia Islam is superstitious and restrictive. He disagrees with practices that he feels are outdated and has been exploring Christianity also. At the time of his initial claim, he did not yet consider himself to identify as a Christian but stated that his beliefs and lifestyle are un-Islamic and that he has renounced Islam. In addition to being considered an apostate, he also fears an imputed religious conversion, as his stepmother has converted formally to Christianity. Moreover, his allegations note that he fears conscription to the military in Iran.\nDECISION\n[6] I find that the claimants are Convention refugees in accordance with section 96 of the Act.\nIdentity\n[7] I find that the claimants\u2019 national identities as nationals of Iran is established through their testimony and the supporting documentation filed, including their passports found at Exhibit 1.\nNexus\n[8] I find that the persecution feared by the principal claimant has a nexus to the Convention by reason of religion, as she has converted to Christianity. For the associate claimant, I also find there is a nexus to the Convention by way of religion, as his renunciation of Islam is considered apostasy.\nANALYSIS\nCredibility\n[9] The determinative issue in this claim is the credibility of the allegations. Pursuant to the Maldonado principle, it is presumed that sworn testimony is true, unless there is sufficient reason to doubt its truthfulness. In these cases, I find there to be no such reasons. Overall, the principal and associate claimants testified with authenticity and without embellishment at the hearing, and I find them both to be credible. Further, there was sufficient corroborative documents provided which supported the testimony and which I will discuss. I therefore accept what they have alleged in support of their claims. And specifically, I accept that the principal claimant is a Christian convert who subjectively fears persecution in Iran and that the associate claimant has also renounced Islam and is in the process of converting to Christianity and therefore subjectively fears persecution, as he is considered apostate.\n[10] The principal claimant was asked about her conversion to Christianity and baptism. She stated that she attended classes for about 10 months in addition to regular services before being baptized. Her family in Canada also attended her baptism ceremony. And she testified that after, when her sister in Canada sent photos of another family birthday event, she also accidentally attached the baptism photos. This caused an issue with the principal claimant\u2019s family in Iran, and they have not had positive relations since then. On the other hand, both she and the associate claimant testified that her husband and the father of the associate claimant, while remaining Muslim, does not take issue with her conversion. Additionally, her job had allowed her leave of absence, but once the year was up, they contacted her family in Iran to inquire about her return and were told she would not return and that she had converted to Christianity. She was then fired. She also spoke briefly about being interested in Christianity while in Iran but not having the option to attend church there, as it was not allowed. She articulated that she chose Christianity because she wanted peace of mind and tranquility, and due to the interpretation of Islam in Iran that women are not considered equal to men. She stated that she tried different churches, but that her church has Farsi interpretation available, and therefore, she is able to understand the content.\n[11] The associate claimant also expressed that since coming to Canada and attending church with his stepmother, he now identifies as Christian, and he has plans to be baptized in the next few weeks. He testified that he is attending classes on Tuesdays to learn about Christianity and that he also attends services on Sundays. He was able to demonstrate knowledge of Christianity beyond a basic understanding, speaking about the mechanics of a service in particular. The associate claimant was asked to expand on what he disagrees with in Islam, and he stated that he does not like the constant bloodshed and war that he feels exists in the religion. He noted that there is a lot of sadness and limitations in the Islamic traditions in Iran.\n[12] There is persuasive documentary evidence submitted in the claims, which are found at Exhibits 4 and 5. Regarding her conversion to Christianity, the principal claimant submits both confirmation and baptism certificates from Holy Trinity Catholic Church in North Vancouver. She also has a support letter on file from the priest of the church, and copies of text and email communications between herself and other church leaders and attendees, as well as a copy of her dismissal letter from her employer in Iran. There is also some limited documentary evidence regarding the associate claimant. He is also named in the support letter from the church, and there is some evidence of email communication between the church and himself.\n[13] Overall, I find that both claimants are credible and have established a subjective fear of persecution in Iran.\nWell-Founded Fear\n[14] To establish one\u2019s status as a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection, claimants must show that there is a serious possibility that they would be persecuted or, on a balance of probabilities, be subjected to a risk to life, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or a danger of torture, if removed to their country of origin, in these claims, Iran. I find that the claimants have met that burden. The risk that the claimants allege is corroborated by the objective country conditions evidence provided in the National Documentation Package before me at Exhibit 3. Several documents speak to this. Found at 2.1 is the US Department of State report, which describes Iran as an authoritarian, theocratic republic with a governmental human rights record that is extremely poor. Islam is the official state religion. The law prohibits Muslim citizens from changing or renouncing their religion. The country conditions evidence found in Exhibit 3 at Tabs 12.11, 12.14, and 12.15 clearly indicates that religious freedom is virtually nonexistent in Iran, with the government engaged in systematic and ongoing egregious violations of religious freedom, including prolonged detention, torture, and execution. Regarding their religious beliefs or absence of belief, their rejection of Islam may be understood as both a religious and, by extension, even political opinion that is against the theocratic regime in Iran.\n[15] The principal claimant has fully converted to Christianity, which puts her at risk of persecution as apostate from Islam. The associate claimant has been involved with the church in Canada, and given his relationship to his stepmother, who has now fully converted, a perception that he is a convert to Christianity could also be imputed to him. Either way, he rejects Islam, which is considered apostasy and subject to grievous punishment in Iran. I find on a balance of probabilities that the claimants have established a well-founded fear of persecution in Iran with a nexus to the Convention ground of religion. They fear the state and the principal claimant\u2019s family, both. Apostasy is punishable by death, according to Iranian law.\nState Protection and Internal Flight Alternative, IFA\n[16] In these claims, the claimants\u2019 religion as converts to Christianity, or in the process of converting to Christianity, and rejection of Islam is grounds of persecution. There is more than a mere possibility of persecution for both the claimants if they were to return to Iran. I find that it would be objectively unreasonable for the claimants to seek the protection of the state. As the state is feared as an agent of persecution, the claimants would not be able to avail themselves of the protection of the authorities of Iran, and the presumption of state protection has been rebutted.\n[17] Furthermore, as the claimants fear persecution at the hands of the state, they would not be able to relocate to escape the risks that they face, and there is no viable internal flight alternative. I find there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout the entire country of Iran.\nCONCLUSION\n[18] Based on the totality of the evidence, I find that the claimants are Convention refugees under section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. Accordingly, I accept their claims.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

I note for the record that the principal claimant has been designated as the representative for the minor claimants.\nDETERMINATION\n[2] For the reasons that follow, I find that the principal claimant, associate claimant, and minor claimant, XXXX XXXX, are Convention refugees as they have each established a serious possibility of persecution on account of at least one Convention ground in Afghanistan. In the case of the minor claimant, XXXX XXXX, in order for claim for refugee protection to be successful, the Act requires that the claim must establish a claim against each of their countries of nationality. In this case, no claim was advanced against the United States by the minor claimant or on her behalf. Indeed, there is no evidence before me that the minor claimant faces a risk of persecution or of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or of torture in the United States. Accordingly, it\u2019s unnecessary to examine the risks she faces in Afghanistan, and her claim for protection must be rejected.\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] You each fear persecution at the hands of the Taliban in Afghanistan due to the principal claimant\u2019s previous employment as a XXXX XXXX XXXX with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, in which he XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in the United States at the XXXX XXXX XXXX in New York. The associate and minor claimants alleged persecution as members of a particular social group as the family members of the principal claimant.\n[4] The former Afghan government collapsed on August 15, 2021, resulting in the principal claimant\u2019s job being terminated and with it, any status as a government employee. After monitoring the situation for a couple of weeks and watching evacuations of Afghans that had previously worked with the US Government, the claimants chose to travel to Canada XXXX XXXX, 2021, and submit claims. They were deferred until XXXX XXXX, 2021, due to border restrictions as a result of the pandemic. The claimants submit that they did not submit claims in the US as they have a family member in Vancouver and due to a long and uncertain asylum process in the USA. It is again noted that the youngest family member, Elina, was born in the USA and thus holds US citizenship.\n[5] The claimants allege that the Taliban targets anyone who has XXXX XXXX XXXX and especially Americans and that they are considered a kafir or infidel. The principal claimant notes that as the Taliban has taken over the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, where he was once employed, that they will have access to his information and, certainly, he and his family will be marked for harm and\/or death. He notes that he has publicly stated his political opinion, which is opposite to that of the Taliban, on social media and that this will further incite persecution from the Taliban. The claimants have also submitted that the female claimants will face gender-based persecution and harm from the Taliban due to their membership in a particular social group as females.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[6] I find that your identities as nationals of Afghanistan have been established by the documents provided at Exhibit 1, namely your Afghan passports. In the case of the female minor claimant, I am satisfied of her identity and citizenship in the United States by her USA passport as well as her citizenship in Afghanistan as per her parents, who are Afghanis, and this is also found at Exhibit 1.\nCredibility\n[7] Pursuant to the Maldonado principle, a claimant\u2019s testimony is presumed to be true unless there is valid reason to doubt their truthfulness, such as with inconsistencies, contradictions, or implausibilities. In these cases, I have no such reason to doubt the testimony of the claimants. There were no relevant inconsistencies in the evidence or contradictions between the evidence and other evidence before me.\n[8] The principal claimant has testified regarding his occupation that he was employed from XXXX 2019 until XXXX 2021 in the USA XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. He explained that they were not offered assistance to remain in the US by the US government and that he did not seek out assistance in the US as it did not appear that, as Afghan employees, the US government would assist. He fears the Taliban to due to his employment in this capacity and especially as someone who worked with the Americans as the Taliban specifically targets people in those positions. The associate claimant also testified to the same fear and additionally testified emotionally regarding her fear for herself and the minor female claimant of having no rights as females in Afghanistan under the Taliban.\n[9] The claimants have provided ample supporting documentations to support their allegations. These are found at Exhibit 5 and include photographs of the principal claimant at various official events in his capacity as an Afghan government representative, copies of his social media posts, and, at Exhibit 1 again, service passports for the principal, associate, and minor male claimant. Upon a review of these documents, I find no reason to doubt their authenticity and therefore place significant weight on them as they serve to corroborate the allegations. I find that the claimants are credible and have established a subjective fear of persecution in Afghanistan.\nWell-Founded Fear\n[10] For equipment to be a Convention refugee, they must have a well-founded of persecution due to a Convention ground. The Convention grounds are race, religion, nationality, membership, in a particular social group, and political opinion. I find that the harm these claimants fear is by reason of multiple intersecting factors, including their actual or perceived political opinion, as the principal payment was an employee of the previous government as well as having been posted to North America, and in the case of the associate and male minor claimants, their membership in a particular social group as members of an employee of the former Afghan national government. As well, the harm feared by the associate claimant is due to her membership in a particular social group as woman.\n[11] I also find that the objective evidence in the National Documentation Package, the NDP, for Afghanistan supports the allegations, including at Items 1.5 and 2.1 as follows. Civilians associated with or perceived to be supporting the former Afghan government, civil society, and the international community in Afghanistan, including the international military forces and international humanitarian and development actors, have been subject to intimidation, threats, abduction, and targeted attacks by anti-government elements, including the Taliban. This may include returnees from Western countries. The Taliban continues to commit human rights abuses, including killings and kidnappings against those who oppose them, and maintains illegal detention centres. The Taliban and other insurgents continue to kill security personnel and civilians using indiscriminate tactics, such as improved explosive devices, IEDs, suicide attacks, and rocket attacks, and to commit disappearances and torture. The Taliban referred to their attacks as martyrdom operations.\n[12] Violence against women remains a widespread, common, and undeniable reality in Afghanistan. Impunity in relation to such violence is reportedly common, despite the previous government\u2019s efforts to promote gender equality. Women who are perceived as transgressing social norms continue to face social stigma and gender discrimination and threats to their safety, particularly in rural areas and areas controlled by anti-government entities or the Taliban. At Item 1.20, the report notes regarding recent political situations that the Taliban states that women\u2019s rights will be permitted within the limits of Islamic sharia. Such norms include a strict dress code as well as requirements that restrict a woman\u2019s freedom of movement, such as the requirement to be accompanied by a male relative chaperone when appearing in public. The level of discrimination that women such as the associate claimant face is sufficiently serious to constitute persecution. The recent withdrawal of international troops from Afghanistan has increased this risk. This is supported by Item 1.14 of the NDP as follows.\n[13] In the wake of the withdrawal of international troops from Afghanistan, there has been rapid deterioration in the security and human rights situations in large parts of the country. Reports emerged from Taliban-held areas of the imposition of restrictions on personal and social freedoms and the erosion of women\u2019s rights and access to services, including education. The Taliban has taken control of a rapidly increasing number of districts, with their advance accelerating in August 2021 to capturing 33 out of 34 of Afghanistan provincial capitals in the space of 10 days, ultimately taking control of the presidential palace and capital. Again, this is at 1.14 in the NDP. This upsurge of violence has had a serious impact on civilians, including women and children. At Item 1.28, we have a UNHCR report that notes that it is concerned about the risk of human rights violations against civilians, including women and girls, and against Afghans who are perceived by the Taliban to have a current or past association with the Afghan government or with the international military forces in Afghanistan or with international organizations in the country. It advises against returns to Afghanistan of those who have fled, including those whose asylum claims have failed.\n[14] I find that the country evidence noted above establishes that those associated with the government and\/or international agents and women who do not abide by traditional Islamic criteria, such as the associate claimant before me and the principal claimant, face persecution by the Taliban in Afghanistan. I therefore find that three claimants, the principal, associate and male minor claimants have established a serious risk of persecution, including death by the Taliban, should they return to Afghanistan.\n[15] Regarding the female minor claimant, as I\u2019ve mentioned, there is no claim advanced against the United States, of which she is a citizen, and therefore, I find her not to have established a well-founded fear persecution in the United States. I find that she\u2019s neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection with respect the United States. Consequently, I need not examine her claim against Afghanistan as she can safely return to the USA.\nState Protection and Internal Flight Alternative\n[16] Based on the objective evidence just discussed, I find that there\u2019s not adequate or operationally effective state protection available in Afghanistan. The former Afghan government pardon has collapsed, turning the entire country, effectively, over to the Taliban. The agents of persecution govern most, if not all of the country. Given the specific circumstances of the principal, associate, and male minor claimants and the very recent occurrences in the country and that the Taliban control most of the country, I also find that there is no viable internal flight alternative for these claimants in Afghanistan.\nCONCLUSION\n[17] I find that the principal, associate, and male minor claimants, are Convention refugees pursuant to s. 96 of the IRPA, and I accept their claims. I find that the female minor claimant is not a Convention refugee pursuant to s. 96 of the IRPA or a person in need of protection pursuant to s. 97 of the IRPA. I therefore reject her claim, and that is the end of decision and reasons for the transcription records.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

You owned XXXX XXXX, which were forced to close because members of Hezbollah and other religious extremist groups were accusing you of pulling women away from Islam. You did this by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and this is contrary to some people\u2019s beliefs, that women should stay at home and wear the niqab when outside. On XXXX XXXX in 2021, you are at your client\u2019s house in Beirut. You heard gunfire. You looked outside and you recognized one (1) of the members of Hezbollah who was a high-ranking official. When you called out to him, he was shocked that someone actually recognized him. He and his accomplices ran after you and fired gunshots towards you, but you are able to lock yourself and shelter in a building. 10 hours later when the clash ended, you were rescued by some police. The day following this clash, you received a threatening phone call from this Hezbollah member. He said he knew where your family was. He asked you to provide information about the people who sheltered you. He thought that you had taken a cellphone video of him. Out of fear, you did not return home, this based on the advice your father gave you. You fled to the United States before coming to Canada to make your refugee claim.\n[3] INTERPRETER: Excuse me, sir?\n[4] MEMBER: You fled to the United States before coming to Canada to make a refugee claim.\n[5] This is a case where we consider the Chairperson\u2019s gender guidelines. I did not have to make any particular application in relation to credibility. I considered the guidelines throughout.\n[6] At the beginning, we listed the issues. Let us go through them now. Do you meet the definition of a Convention refugee or a person who is in need of protection? A Convention refugee is a person by reasons of a well-founded fear of persecution and for the following reasons. Race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or for political opinion as outside of your country of nationality, in this case, Lebanon, and that you are unable or by reason of your fear unwilling to avail yourself of the protection of the state. The definition for a person in need of protection does not apply here, so I will go over that.\n[7] This is my decision. I find that you are a Convention refugee as you have established that you have a serious possibility of persecution if you return to Lebanon. This is based on your nexus to the Convention grounds. You belong to a particular social group, someone who fears gender-related persecution and for imputed political opinion because members of Hezbollah think that you could harm them. They think you have a video showing their violent actions.\n[8] Next question. Have you established your identity, and do you possess acceptable documentation establishing your identity? I find that your identity as a national of Lebanon is established by your credible testimony and by the documents you provided. There is a certified photocopy of your passport in Exhibit 1.\n[9] Is your claim credible? When you affirmed that you would tell the truth, this created a presumption that your allegations are true unless there are serious reasons to doubt their truthfulness. I had no reason to doubt your truthfulness. Your testimony today was consistent with what you wrote in your narrative. It is corroborated by documentary evidence, including letters of support from your father and your husband, especially.\n[10] Is your fear to your return to your country well-founded? There must be both a subjective and an objective basis for your fear. What we mean by subjective fear is that your behaviour or your actions should be consistent with somebody who fears return to their country. In this case, the incident happened in Beirut and your family warned you not to return to your village. You stayed in hiding until very shortly afterwards you fled your country. These actions are consistent with somebody who would have a subjective fear of return. Is there objective evidence? The answer is yes based on your credible testimony and current country condition reports that you provided in Exhibit 4. Exhibit 3, the National Documentation Package, contains the evidence that people who fear Hezbollah, that Hezbollah has the resources to track people they are seeking. They have the ability to exercise control outside of the traditional legal system in Lebanon and they control large portions of Lebanon. This is described in Item 1.3, the Department of Foreign Affairs report for Australia and Item 7.8, which is a Response to Information Request that shows the extent and reach of Hezbollah.\n[11] Have you provided evidence which establishes on a balance of probabilities that the authorities in your country cannot provide you with adequate protection? There is a presumption that states can protect their own citizens. This can be rebutted in a claimant\u2019s individual circumstances. In this case, there is evidence that Hezbollah has harassed your husband and your immediate family over the months. There is evidence that the clash that you were speaking of, that there were approximately 30 people killed that day. Hezbollah has a reach and an influence that goes beyond Lebanon security forces. And like some other groups, Hezbollah has not given up their weapons. When you read these two (2) documents that I mentioned earlier, it is clear and convincing evidence that the state has an inability to protect from people who fear Hezbollah.\n[12] Concerning the treatment of women in Lebanon, the Department of Foreign Affairs report that I referred to earlier mentions that Lebanon ranks I think 133 out of 144 for treatment of women in the world. This document summarizes that women generally face discrimination. In your own case, you face direct persecution, in that you had to shut down XXXX XXXX because religious extremists did not agree XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. And it is obvious in your case that the police did not offer you adequate protection in this case.\n[13] Finally, we ask the question, would it be unreasonable for you to seek refuge in a different part of your country? Although not mentioned specifically throughout the hearing, Beirut is likely the most viable place that a person could flee to and live there. This is where you faced your own persecution, so it would be unreasonable for you to relocate to Beirut. There is a two-pronged test or two (2) tests. Could you live anywhere without a serious possibility of being persecuted? Since I find that there is inadequate protection for you in Lebanon, I find that there is no viable internal flight alternative.\n[14] These are all the reasons that make you a Convention refugee under section 96 of the Act, and these are the reasons your claim is accepted.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

Gayda\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Annie N O\u2019Dell\nCountry: Nigeria\nRPD Number: TB8-20107\nAssociated RPD Number(s): TB8-20130, TB8-20131, TB8-20132\nTB8-20491\nATIP Number: A-2022-00210\nATIP Pages: 000001-000034\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] XXX XXXX XXXX (the \u201cprincipal claimant\u201d) and her four daughters, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (the \u201cminor claimants\u201d), and XXXX XXXX XXXX (the \u201cassociated claimant\u201d), citizens of Nigeria and Italy, claim refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (\u201cIRPA\u201d).1\n[2] These claims were heard jointly pursuant to Rule 55 of the Refugee Protection Division Rules.2 The principal claimant was appointed as the Designated Representative for the minor claimants. She and the associated claimant, who is her 18-year-old daughter, testified on behalf of all the claims.\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] The claimants allege a fear of gender-based persecution resulting from domestic violence at the hands of the principal claimant\u2019s ex-common-law husband, XXXX XXXX XXXX (\u201cKO\u201d) the biological father of her two youngest children. The principal claimant survived domestic violence at KO\u2019s hands in Italy, where the family resided, and the associated claimant also experienced physical violence at his hands. The claimants allege that all her children, the associated claimant and the minor claimants, witnessed her being abused at the hands of KO in Italy for several years. The claimants used to live with KO in XXXX Italy, a city in north-west Italy, west of XXXX.\n[4] In Italy, the claimants allege that state protection is not adequate for them, given their personal circumstances and given their particular past experiences in attempting to obtain adequate state protection. One of the principal claimant\u2019s attempts to obtain protection resulted in KO being charged and eventually convicted in 2018 for physically harming her in 2015. While these charges were pending, he continued to reside, by law, with the claimants and he continued his physical abuse. The principal claimant alleges that KO was sentenced to over a year of \u201chouse arrest\u201d and that this was to occur with him living with the claimants in their shared family home. Fearing this situation would lead to further abuse, the claimants fled to Canada.\n[5] The claimants also allege a fear of gender-based persecution in Nigeria in the form of continued violence from her ex-husband in Nigeria. The principal claimant also alleges that she believes that KO is a member of a transnational criminal gang, the Black Axe Fraternity, and that this heightens the claimants\u2019 risk of harm and their ability to be located in both Italy and Nigeria, by KO himself, KO\u2019s family members and his associates. The claimants also allege to fear that the three minor female claimants would also face gender-based persecution in the form of female genital mutilation (\u201cFGM\u201d) at the hands of members of her family in Nigeria.\nDETERMINATION\n[6] I find, for the reasons that follow, that the claimants have established that they would face a serious possibility of persecution in Italy and Nigeria and hence that they are Convention refugees pursuant to section 96 of IRPA. I therefore accept their claims.\nANALYSIS\nCredibility\n[7] In making this assessment, I have considered all the evidence before me, including the claimants\u2019 oral testimony over three sittings, the evidence as set out in the Consolidated List of Documents, counsel\u2019s submissions, as well as the Chairperson\u2019s Guidelines, specifically Guideline 4 \u2013 Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution3 which highlight that women refugee claimants may face special problems in demonstrating that their claims are credible and trustworthy. Factors that may affect their ability to provide evidence include difficulty in providing testimony on sensitive matters, cross-cultural misunderstandings as well as social, religious and economic differences.\n[8] I have also considered the psychological assessment before me from a registered psychologist for the principal claimant4 in assessing the principal claimant\u2019s testimony. This psychologist provided a report from an in-person assessment in January 2019 with the principal claimant that consisted of a 4.5-hour visit, involving a semi-structured interview and three psychological screening measures. The psychologist found that the principal claimant\u2019s description of symptoms and answers to questions indicated that she was dealing with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, was consistent with her described experience of traumatic events and met the provisional criteria for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX\n[9] I found the claimants\u2019 testimony to be generally credible with respect to the core allegations of their claim. The principal claimant and associated claimant testified consistently with their BOC forms and their corroborating evidence and provided elaborative details in a natural manner about their circumstances and the incidents that led them to flee Italy and why they believe they would face risks in Nigeria. They provided a good deal of corroborating documentation, and reasonable and knowledgeable responses about this documentation when asked. Their responses to my questions were reasonable and did not appear to be evasive or to embellish their fears.\n[10] I find the claimants to be credible with respect to their core allegations of fearing persecution for themselves and the minor claimants in Italy and Nigeria, and that they have credibly established, on a balance of probabilities, that violence and continued threats of violence from the principal claimant\u2019s ex-husband, KO, have caused this fear. Moreover, they have also credibly established the core allegation of fearing gender-related persecution for the minor claimants in Nigeria, in them being subjected to FGM by the principal claimant\u2019s family. The claimants also provided corroborating evidence with respect to core elements of their claim, and this assists in establishing their allegations, on a balance of probabilities. I will refer to some of this corroborating evidence in my analysis below.\nIdentity\n[11] I am satisfied that the personal and national identities of the claimants have been established on a balance of probabilities through the principal and the associated claimants\u2019 testimony and the certified true copies of the claimants\u2019 Italian and Nigerian passports, the originals having been seized by the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) upon the claimants\u2019 arrival in Canada.5 I find on a balance of probabilities that the claimants are dual citizens of Italy and Nigeria and do not hold citizenship or permanent residence in any other country.\nNexus\n[12] The nexus to a Convention refugee ground for the claimants is that of their membership in the particular social group of women and girls fearing gender-based persecution. The claimants fear domestic violence from KO and those who may associate with him in the Black Axe criminal group, or other individuals that KO may hire to harm them in Nigeria and Italy. The principal claimant has also set out a fear of FGM, another form of gender-based persecution, for the minor claimants in Nigeria, at the hands of members of her own family who support this practice and believe that girls in the family should have it done, even though the principal claimant, their mother, does not want them subjected to this cutting.\n[13] I also note that the claimants\u2019 experiences in Italy, and particularly the principal claimant\u2019s experiences in attempting to obtain protection from Italian state authorities, are also impacted by their race, as Black individuals with dual Nigerian citizenship. Race is an enumerated ground in the Refugee Convention. I have considered how both the immutable characteristics of race and gender intersect and affect the risks alleged by the claimants and this includes their experiences in attempting to obtain adequate state protection, and in attempts they would make to relocate in Italy. Since l have found a nexus in these claims, I have analyzed and accepted these claims pursuant to section 96 of IRPA.\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution\nSubjective Fear\n[14] I find that the claimants have established through their credible testimony and reliable corroborating evidence that they are subjectively fearful of returning to Italy and Nigeria. They fled Italy for Canada on XXXX, 2018 and initiated their claims for refugee protection at the airport in Toronto. I find that the claimants\u2019 actions including in the principal claimant\u2019s brief visits to Nigeria at particular points in time prior to them leaving Italy on XXXX, 2018, are consistent with a genuine subjective fear of persecution, in light of their personal circumstances.\nObjective Basis for the Risks alleged\nItaly\nDomestic Violence\n[15] The claimants fear domestic violence in Italy from KO or violence directed at them by his associates in Italy. The country conditions evidence indicates that there are significant concerns with respect to domestic violence against women in Italy. The United State Department of State Report for Human Rights Practices for 2020 in Italy notes that 535 women were killed by domestic partners in the first six months of2020 alone.6 The New York Times in 2018 cites a Eures study that noted that 150 women were killed in Italy each year by abusive partners and that this number makes it one of the highest death tolls in Europe for domestic violence deaths.7 The Eures study also notes that in one third of the fatalities of women at the hands of their domestic partners in Italy, the victims had already complained to the police.8 A 2021 news article notes that one woman is killed every three days in Italy, and that societal attitudes in Italy, even based on a very recent survey, continue to condone and accept violence against women as a normal part of intimate relationships.9 Based on the sum of the country conditions evidence before me, I find that there is a well-founded objective basis for the risks to the claimants of domestic violence from KO in Italy.\nNigeria\nDomestic Violence\n[16] Sources indicate that domestic violence remains \u201cwidespread\u201d and \u201cprevalent\u201d in both urban and rural areas of Nigeria,10 and many viewed it as \u201csocially acceptable.11\u201d It has been attributed to the ongoing power imbalance between women and men in Nigerian society, and deeply engrained societal attitudes about women\u2019s subordination to men, though there is some evidence that these attitudes are changing.12\n[17] I find that the principal claimant has credibly established, on a balance of probabilities, that she survived repeated instances of domestic violence from KO in Italy. I also find that her eldest daughter (the associated claimant) faced physical assaults from KO and witnessed a good deal of the domestic violence suffered by the principal claimant at KO\u2019s hands. The minor claimants were also in the household and witnessed this domestic violence. I find that the claimants have credibly established that KO has sought the claimants out in Nigeria, and that others in his family and those he associates with, have threatened and physically harmed her mother in Benin City, Edo state. I also find that she has credibly established that KO has spoken in a hostile and threatening manner about her and her role in him having been charged and convicted in Italy, as mutual acquaintances in Nigeria, have contacted the principal claimant in Canada to warn her of KO\u2019s statements.13\nThe Black Axe criminal group in Nigeria and its trans-national reach, including in Italy\n[18] I also accept that the claimants have credibly established hat KO is affiliated with a criminal group, and on a balance of probabilities, that it is the Black Axe cult or gang. The principal claimant testified about why she believes KO is involved with this gang, based on his behaviour, the type of music and videos he watched and the number of connections he had in many different places in Italy, other European countries as well as in Nigeria. She also testified about how he would boast that he was able to send his \u201cboys\u201d to deal with persons in Italy and also in Nigeria; in fact, he was able to command his brother as well as his \u201cboys\u201d to go to her mother\u2019s home in Benin City, Nigeria where they physically assaulted her mother and threatened her with more harm if she did not contact the principal claimant. She did not appear to embellish her evidence in testimony, admitting that KO never directly acknowledged his involvement in the Black Axe to her. I find that this is consistent with what is known about the Black Axe gang, in that its origins in Nigeria close to Benin City where the principal claimant and the KO both hail from, is described as a secretive, cult-like society. I find the principal claimant\u2019s testimony to be credible.\n[19] Documentary evidence before me indicates that the Black Axe cult tends to be secretive and began as a fraternity-type organization but has evolved into a criminal gang that has a strong presence in Benin City, which is regarded as the gang\u2019s \u201cheadquarters.\u201d14 The violence and crimes perpetrated by the Black Axe cult or gang in Nigeria and other countries, including the trans-national scale of this gang\u2019s operations that include human trafficking and smuggling, prostitution and money laundering, is set out in the documentary evidence.15 The trans-national nature and the evolution of the criminal operations of this Black Axe gang is also detailed in recent sources provided by counsel.16 I find this reliable and credible evidence. This evidence indicates that there is a heightened risk posed by the principal claimant\u2019s ex-husband to herself and the other claimants, from KO. This heightened risk comes from his affiliation with the Black Axe gang, and his ability to call on others in the gang to do his bidding. The claimant testified that she believes that he has this power and ability to call his \u201cboys\u201d to harm her and her daughters in Nigeria, just as he has called on them, as well as his own brothers, to harm her mother in Nigeria who was beaten by them in XXXX 2018.\n[20] Therefore, I find that the claims with respect to Nigeria, for the principal claimant and her eldest daughter, the associated claimant, are objectively well-founded. I find that they would face a serious possibility of continued violence at the hands of her former husband\/ the associated claimant\u2019s stepfather, and those who are associated with him and act on his behalf, in Nigeria.\nFemale Genital Mutilation (FGM)\n[21] I also find that the claims of the principal claimant\u2019s other three daughters, the minor claimants, are objectively well-founded with respect to Nigeria. The objective country conditions evidence indicates that FGM remains prevalent in Nigerian society.17 The principal claimant is from the Edo ethnic group and from the area of Benin City in south-central Edo state; Edo state is noted to have a FGM prevalence rate of 35.5% of women ages 15-49 in Nigeria\u2019s National Population Commission\u2019s 2018 Demographic and Health Survey.18 The principal claimant alleges that she underwent FGM as an infant and that this is customary in her ethnic group and family.\n[22] The Edo ethnic group is reported to be one of the groups that continue to perform FGM. The European Asylum Support Office (EASO) Guidance report from 2019 found that the Edo ethnic group was one of the ethnic groups with the highest prevalence rates of FGM in Nigeria, between 69 to 77 percent of women and girls having had FGM performed.19 The documentary evidence also notes that some rituals and specific customs are family, village or community\u00ad specific and therefore generalizations concerning the specific aspects of such customs and traditions are difficult to make.20\n[23] She also alleges that her family members had FGM performed on her eldest daughter, the associated claimant, when she was 4 years old. She and her daughter were visiting Nigeria and the principal claimant had left her alone with her family. This was done without the principal claimant\u2019s consent, and she alleges that since that time she has been scared to leave her other daughters, the minor claimants, alone with her family in Nigeria for any reason. The principal claimant testified that she believes an elder sister, XXXX, was responsible for subjecting the associated claimant to FGM, but she is not sure to what degree her mother and other eider sisters who remain in Nigeria (the claimant has five eider sisters residing in Nigeria21) were involved in this. She testified that her mother and her sisters are supportive of FGM, it has been a tradition in her family for herself and her sisters to have it done, and that they believe that the minor claimants should be subjected to FGM.\n[24] She alleges a fear for the three minor claimants in Nigeria of being subjected to FGM against her wishes and that this is a serious infringement on their bodily security as this is not something she had wanted for her eldest daughter, given the health and other risks and implications of this mutilation. The principal claimant alleges that she is fearful that members of her family, particularly her eider sisters in Nigeria, would take her daughters and have this done to them without her consent as their parent. The claimants provided medical documentation, namely confirmation from a registered nurse at the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, who examined the associated claimant and confirmed she had undergone FGM.22 Also, the associated claimant testified credibly and briefly about the fact that she had had this done to her body and had experienced health problems associated with it.\n[25] The documentary evidence about FGM in Nigeria describes that the practice remains rooted in discredited and gender discriminatory customary beliefs, for example that the cutting of the genitals of girls and women will stop them from \u201cpromiscuous\u201d behaviour, including being unfaithful to their husbands, and that uncut girls and women are somehow \u201cunclean\u201d.23 In communities and families where FGM is prevalent, the practice is closely tied to concepts of family honour and girls\u2019 marriageability. Sources note that girls \u201cmay be ostracized, shunned or assaulted by their family or community if they have not undergone FGM\u201d and could face stigma and social exclusion if they do not undergo FGM.24\n[26] The NDP notes sources that indicate that the final decision to subject a girl to FGM is \u201cmost often\u201d up to the parents but that there is \u201cconsiderable variation both individually and among different ethnic groups.\u201d25 Amongst family and ethnic groups that have girls and women undergo FGM, there is often societal and economic pressure put on parents and the threat of social exclusion or alienation from their families or local communities, to induce them to have FGM performed on their daughters.26 FGM is considered a \u201cfamily issue\u201d and parents who refuse to have their girls undergo FGM when other family elders expect it to be done, are those who are \u201cwell off\u201927 [financially] and girls who do not have it done when their family or group expect it, can be \u201costracized, shunned or assaulted by their family or community\u201d if they have not undergone FGM.28\n[27] The 2021 Response to Information Request (RIR) references the 2019 EASO report that notes a \u201cfew cases of relatives disregarding the parents\u2019 decision and subjecting the girl to FGM\/C [have been] reported, although it is considered to be very unusual.\u201d29 Other sources in this 2021 RIR however note that is not unusual for relatives to take a girl to have her cut, amongst groups that continue to practice FGM, and it is particularly elder female members of the family who ensure that FGM is performed on a young girl, even when a parent is opposed to this practice:\n\u2026older [family members] such as grandmothers are keepers of these practice[s] and ensure that new girls in the family are cut\u201d; even if the mother does not want her daughter to undergo FGM\/C, she is \u201calmost helpless\u201d to refuse and FGM\/C \u201cwill most likely\u201d be performed if older family members \u201csupport the practice\u201d (Research Analyst 9 July 2021). The Executive Director of SDI noted that the grandmother will travel to the girl\u2019s home to ensure FGM\/C is performed (SDI 18 Oct. 2021). According to the Executive Director of Value Female Network,\ngrandparents will do everything to make sure their granddaughter is cut. They do not want traditions to end. They will travel from a very far community, pay for accommodation, pay for everything. They will go the extra mile. They will ensure the girl is cut. They will keep it in their mind for years and wait until they can do it. (Executive Director of Value Female Network 7 Oct. 2021)\nAccording to the Program Officer, if a mother refuses FGM\/C for her daughter, the child can be taken by force by the woman\u2019s family (Program Officer 1 July 2021).30\n[28] I therefore find that the principal claimant\u2019s fear for the minor claimants in Nigeria is objectively well-founded. I find that the minor claimants would face a serious possibility of persecution on account of their gender, namely FGM, and being subjected to this at the hands of older relatives, namely their older aunts (the principal claimant\u2019s older sisters), as was experienced by the associated claimant, their own sister, when she was a young girl at the hands of members of the principal claimant\u2019s family when she and the principal claimant visited Nigeria.\nState protection\nItaly\n[29] For the reasons that follow, I find that the claimants have rebutted the presumption of state protection in Italy. I find that the claimants have presented clear and convincing evidence that given their particular circumstances, adequate state protection would not be available to them in Italy. This includes the principal claimant\u2019s own previous experiences in attempting to obtain protection from the state, as well as the objective documentary evidence before me with respect to serious gaps in the implementation of Italy\u2019s domestic violence laws, evidence of the inconsistent and arbitrary implementation of Italy\u2019 s domestic violence laws, partially caused by continuing societal attitudes rooted in discredited myths and stereotypes about sexual assaults and violence against women, and documentary evidence about widespread anti-Black racism in the country.\nThe principal claimant \u2018s own experiences in trying to obtain state protection\n[30] The principal claimant testified about her experiences in seeking protection from the Italian police due to KO\u2019s domestic violence. Prior to 2015, she called the police \u201cmore than four or five times\u201d. She testified that each time she called them, the police came but then just gave KO advice or a warning, saying things like \u201cif you do that next time, we will have to arrest you\u201d, \u201cyou have to stop beating her\u201d, \u201ctake it easy, don\u2019t beat her, she\u2019s pregnant\u201d and then would leave, without investigation or charging her ex-husband. She recalled the police\u2019s visits as brief\u00ad only a matter of minutes, and she remembered one time she called the police, and they did not come at all. She also testified that on one of these occasions she had been clearly injured with blood coming from her mouth and nose, and still the police did not intervene in a serious or effective manner. She testified that she believed that the way police treated her in this manner, in not offering her meaningful protection and viewing what she was going through as something that was \u201cnormal\u201d amongst Nigerian men and women, was impacted by her race, as a Black woman of Nigerian descent. She described that there was a great deal of racism in Italy towards Black persons like herself, and that she had heard of such similar ineffective and racist experiences from another Black female friend in Italy who had previously contacted the police for protection from domestic violence.\n[31] The principal claimant described feeling further discouraged by the police response after the October 2015 assault against her when the police did charge KO and took him in for questioning, holding him for a few hours. She testified that she believes the police did something on this occasion because it was one of the minor claimants, XXXX who called them for help and also because a medical examination and MRI confirmed that had received a XXXX XXXX XXXX. The police released KO while this assault charge was pending, and the police knew he was returning to reside with her and the other claimants. She testified that the police told her that since he was the only financial provider for the family, he was being released. The principal claimant described in her testimony that the police did not offer her any referrals or assistance in contacting a women\u2019s shelter or any other kind of support, despite her request about whether these options were available for her. They also did not offer that any kind of protection or barring order (from him returning to the family residence) was an option for her.\n[32] With this release arrangement, the principal claimant testified that the police called her each day for about one month to check on her to see if she was being beaten by KO. The principal claimant testified that KO noticed when the police stopped calling, and his violence against her resumed when the calls stopped. She testified that KO understood how ineffective the police were and was far from deterred and in fact felt emboldened by his ability to continue to harm her without any real repercussions. He was dismissive about the police response, saying to her: \u201cThey gave me a paper and that is it- they didn\u2019t hold me; this is all they can do.\u201d She testified to learning at one point about KO\u2019s past criminal record in a different district for beating his first wife, and in 2015 when she was questioned by police, it was clear to her that the police knew about KO\u2019s violent criminal record as well, yet this criminal history did not change the police\u2019s response to releasing him to reside with the claimants while the 2015 charges were pending. She testified as well that KO seemed to start exhibiting a particular anger towards the minor claimant, XXXX for her role in calling the police, and the principal claimant testified that she was frightened of him harming her, as well as her other daughters, the other claimants.\n[33] The corroborating documents provided by the claimants from the Italian court and public prosecutor\u2019s office indicate that KO weas sentenced to a XXXX XXXX XXXX imprisonment for assaulting the principal claimant,31 and also that in consideration of a previous offence for domestic violence against his first wife, a one-year, ten-month sentence was also being considered as a sentence.32 The sentencing document from the public prosecutor\u2019 s office from XXXX XXXX 2018 indicates that enforcement of the sentence could be stayed while the offender applied for certain \u201calternative measures to detention\u201d such as \u201chome detention\u201d.33\n[34] The principal claimant testified that KO told her that his lawyer was working towards him getting a sentence of house arrest, so that he would not have to serve time in prison. She testified that KO\u2019s lawyer, the police, and then a social worker asked for her consent to this house arrest, and that she was never asked this question privately on her own, when KO was not there with her. She testified to feeling terrified and helpless, as KO was threatening her that he would kill her if she did not agree to the house arrest. Within this context, the principal claimant indicated that she signed some a letter with KO\u2019s lawyer, indicating that she had forgiven him, and that she agreed to the house arrest. The principal claimant described that the idea of KO having to be home with her and the minor claimants scared her deeply, as did the expectation that she was to inform the police if KO left the home for an unauthorized purpose. The principal claimant testified that she feared that reporting on him would have put her and the minor claimants at increased risk of harm at his hands. She believed that he would also likely take out his stress through violence on all of them while they lived together in this house arrest situation. In her BOC narrative she stated, \u201cI was his victim and the Italian government wanted me to be his jailer.\u201d34\n[35] The principal claimant also provided corroborating documents about KO\u2019s sentencing hearing that took place on July 18, 2018.35 She testified that she did not have a copy of the letter that KO\u2019s lawyer had her sign, as she was scared to ask for this and raise KO\u2019s suspicions and possible retaliatory violence, for thinking that she was going to withdraw her consent. The principal claimant testified that she began to make her plans to flee Italy with the minor claimants when she was informed about this sentencing hearing and after KO and his lawyer had asked her to sign her consent to the house arrest proposal.\n[36] The principal claimant testified that to the best of her knowledge KO\u2019s house arrest is now completed. She heard from mutual acquaintances in Nigeria that KO had travelled to Nigeria in around XXXX to XXXX of 2021. She testified that her sister who resides in Italy informed her that KO was previously seen in the community in XXXX, Italy at parties during the time of him sentence, not apparently following the conditions of his house arrest, but the police did not find out about this. She testified that her sister went to her home after she came to Canada to try and get some of the claimants\u2019 belongings, and that KO did not allow her to enter the apartment, saying in an accusatory way to her sister, that the principal claimant had \u201ccaused\u201d his house arrest.\n[37] She also testified that she believes that KO continues to live in XXXX, Italy, as her sister told her that she saw KO at a bus stop in XXXX a few months ago. The principal claimant also testified that to her knowledge, while KO\u2019s criminal convictions may have caused him problems in obtaining Italian citizenship, he continues to have permanent residence in Italy, giving him the ability to remain living and working in that country.\nRacism in society and from state authorities in Italy\n[38] I find that the principal claimant\u2019s ability to access adequate state protection in Italy is impacted by the intersecting, immutable characteristics of her race and gender. She is an Italian citizen who is also a Black woman of Nigerian descent. The documentary evidence indicates that racism remains a serious problem in Italy, with very real consequences for visible minorities and those of African descent, specifically. In recent years, sources such as the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, in its 2019 Report entitled, Mission to Italy on Racial Discrimination, notes serious concerns that Italy \u201cis experiencing an increase of intolerance, racial and religious hatred, and xenophobia, which in some cases is allowed or even encouraged by political leaders and members of Government.\u201d36 This report also addresses serious shortcomings in Italian police accountability and reporting of racially biased statements and actions of state law enforcement related to migrants and other persons of colour.37\n[39] Based on the evidence before me, discrimination based on race and racially-based incitements to violence are increasing and remain a widespread problem in Italy.38 Sources also report that Italian state officials, elected and those running for office, are implicated in fueling anti-migrant and racist views, and that in addition to increasing acts of racist violence, systemic racism exists in Italy towards those viewed as immigrants and\/or persons of colour.39 This includes attitudes, perceptions and actions of Italians that accept and promote racist policies and outwardly racist statements and treatment of persons of colour40, with one recent study noting that more than half of Italians surveyed responded that racist acts were either always or sometimes \u201cjustifiable\u201d.41\n[40] A 2016 report from the United Human Rights Council, Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent- Mission to Italy, found that despite some efforts of the Italian state, \u201cracial discrimination, Afrophobia and racism persists and people of African descent continue to be the least integrated, most marginalized victims of racial profiling.\u201d42 The authors of this report further found that written legislation and policy measures to combat racial discrimination were not being adequately implemented by the state of Italy.43 Further in this report it is noted: \u201cAfrophobia and racial discrimination are manifest in the lack of protection afforded to people of African descent, a vulnerable group; in the difficulty that people of African descent have in gaining access to justice; and in the failure to prosecute and provide reparation and remedy.\u201d44 This report also notes with concern the frequent racist discourse in Italy\u2019s political system, targeting public figures and politicians of African descent, as well as the immunity that has shielded parliamentarians who make racist remarks.45 The Working Group further reported that: \u201c[t]oo often immunity and impunity for racism creates an enabling environment for racist abuse to be perpetrated at all levels of society, even if some ad hoc punitive measures have been adopted.\u201d46\n[41] I find therefore that the objective country conditions evidence is consistent with the principal claimant\u2019s experiences of racism in Italy, in her encounters with police and in other aspects of her life there as well. I find that the continued systemic nature of racism in Italy impacts and intersects with the principal claimant\u2019s lived experiences as a woman who could not attain adequate state protection in Italy from her abusive husband. I find that as an Italian citizen, she is also a Black woman of Nigerian descent, and based on her own experiences, she did not receive adequate state protection in the past. Based on her personal circumstances that include the immutable characteristics of her race and gender, as well as the country conditions evidence before me, I find that adequate state protection would also not be forthcoming to her in the future in Italy.\nState\u2019s Response to Domestic Violence in Italy\n[42] I note that Italy is making many efforts to address gender-based violence. Domestic violence is criminalized in Italy, and perpetrators are prosecuted. Italy is a sophisticated liberal democracy. Rebutting the presumption of state protection is a heavy burden. Italy ratified the Council of Europe Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence against Women and Domestic Violence, (CETS No. 210), known as the \u201cIstanbul Convention\u201d in 2013.47 Thereafter, Italy is noted by the Council of Europe\u2019s Group of Experts on Combatting Violence against Women and Domestic Violence (GREVIO), an independent group that is responsible for monitoring the implementation of the Istanbul Convention, to have has taken a \u201crange of measures to implement the Istanbul Convention\u201d, including legislative reforms and an extensive set of rules and mechanisms aimed at concrete actions to stop violence against women.48 Highlighted in the GREVIO 2020 Report is Italy\u2019s legislation that has expanded the law on criminal stalking and increased and expanded legislative sanctions for crimes of gender-based violence, and increased national funding for specialist support and protective services to assist women and children fleeing domestic violence.49\n[43] However, despite these efforts, I find that the country conditions evidence indicates that there are some critical shortcomings and problems in the implementation of the domestic violence legislative framework in Italy, including serious gaps with respect to urgent protection order mechanisms. I find these serious deficits in the implementation of Italy\u2019s domestic violence laws are compounded with the impact of racism for these particular claimants. Such serious shortcomings in the state response were illustrated in the claimants\u2019 own attempts to obtain actual protection from domestic violence from the Italian state.\n[44] State protection need not be perfect, and I acknowledge that the Italian state did make an attempt to protect the claimants on one occasion through the prosecution of KO. However, based on the claimants\u2019 particular circumstances and evidence before me, I find that attempt was far from adequate. The claimants were put at increased risk of physical harm through the manner in which the Italian state prosecuted these charges, including the lack of effective and timely protective or restraining orders in Italy for victims of domestic violence while charges are pending, such that KO returned to live with and physically abuse the claimants for over two and a half years while his charges were pending; the state also did not consult with the principal claimant privately about acquiring her consent for KO to serve his sentence under house arrest with her and the other claimants. I find that the way in which state officials acted with respect to this final issue demonstrates a clear misunderstanding or disregard for the imbalance of power in domestic violence situations and the real-world reality faced by victims: asking a woman in the presence of her abusive spouse to agree to a detention arrangement that would have the real possibility of increasing her and her children\u2019s risk of harm is essentially asking her to make this choice under duress without a true opportunity to voice her concerns with such an arrangement: this was not a meaningful or voluntary \u201cchoice\u201d for the principal claimant.\n[45] The evidence before me points to a serious problem of gender-based violence in the country-the United State Department of State Report for Human Rights Practices for 2020 in Italy notes that 535 women were killed by domestic partners in the first six months of 2020 alone.50 Another source from 2018 noted that approximately 150 women are killed by abusive partners each year, and that in one-third of fatal cases, the victims had already complained to the police.51 Advocates for women and critics of the Italian system have noted that tougher legislation is not necessarily the solution; existing laws are adequate, but arbitrarily applied.52 This inconsistency in the domestic violence law\u2019s application is fueled by patriarchal socio\u00ad cultural attitudes in Italy that justify or excuse violence against women, police officers not believing women, those in the investigatory process (police officers, social workers and judges) being unprepared, and a very long judicial process that can take several years to come to a final decision.53 I find that the objective country conditions evidence before me is consistent with the principal claimant\u2019s described experiences of her many calls to the police over the years prior to KO being charged in 2015, in that these interactions with the police did not result in anything more than her abuser being told to treat her better.\n[46] Moreover, I find that there are critical problems with the state\u2019s mechanisms with respect to delays and the inconsistent issuance of protection or barring orders for alleged perpetrators of domestic violence to vacate a shared residence when charges are laid. Such orders are noted to be ineffective by GREVIO in their January 2020 Report entitled, GREVIO Baseline Evaluation Report Italy (\u201cGREVIO report\u201d).54 Sources note that the Italian law does not automatically require that the alleged abuser leave the home when charged with abuse.55 The GREVIO report notes serious shortcomings in a domestic violence victim\u2019s ability to obtain meaningful restraining orders, citing research that Italian authorities do not have measures in place for an immediate response if a victim calls in to report a violation of a protection order. GREVIO stresses that \u201can instant response to these calls is pivotal in light of the well-documented fact that a violation of a protective measure is a strong indicator of a potentially high-risk situation. [emphasis added]\u201d56 The report notes the concern that criminal courts did not collect data on the issuance of restraining and protection orders (termed \u201cprecautionary measures\u201d) and that this impacted the ability of GREVIO to report on the effectiveness of such measures to protect women. Women\u2019s organizations and legal practitioners shared with GREVIO that there were problems for women in obtaining such measures in the first place, noting instances of victims\u2019 requests for such measures remaining \u201cunheeded and the risk they are exposed to is underestimated, leading to courts\u2019 reluctance to issue precautionary measures (particularly where there is no physical violence), delays in their issuance, negligence in their enforcement and minimization of the risks signaled by a breach of such measures\u201d.57\n[47] As further noted in the GREVIO report, a protection order from a criminal court in Italy must be requested by a prosecutor, and as set out above, even if one is in place, there is no process in place of immediate action in case of a reported breach by an abuser. With respect to civilly obtained protection orders, GREVIO notes that the state is also not keeping data with respect to these orders, which represents an obstacle in effectively monitoring their use. Women\u2019s organizations, however, have indicated that these types of civil protection orders can take \u201cseveral months\u201d to be granted and that there exists \u201cuneven and restrictive court practices in assessing the conditions under which protection orders apply and can be extended\u201d.58 GREVIO notes with concern that this undermines women\u2019s protection and that some civil courts take the approach of seeking to reach a compromise between the victim and the perpetrator rather than taking a position on the request for a protection order, an approach which, according to GREVIO, \u201cwould reflect a severe misunderstanding of the dynamics of violence against women.\u201d59 The impact of these problems on the protection of women facing domestic violence in Italy is described in this report:\nthe lack of an automatic reaction on the part of statutory agencies to violations of protection orders sends the message that infringements are tolerated. Once the offender realises he can get away with his misbehaviour, the deterrent potential of protection orders is significantly diminished. This can not only provoke future violations, but it can also seriously discourage the victim, who should not be left alone in having to ensure that protection orders are enforced.60\n[48] The GREVIO report also refers to a 2018 Italian government report, noting the concern about a lack of consistency with the police response to domestic violence in Italy, including that the police arbitrarily conducted risk assessments in domestic violence situations, noting that in \u201cmany cases of gender-based violence, risk assessments are totally omitted, while in others, police officials assess risks based on their experience and intuitive skills instead of structured and standardized parameters.\u201d61 The GREVIO report also reflects findings of a 2018 Italian Judiciary report that \u201cless than 20% of prosecutorial offices and only 8% of adjudicating offices had adopted risk-assessment criteria to enable law enforcement agencies, prosecuting authorities and criminal or civil courts to prevent reoffending and the escalation of violence.\u201d62 GREVIO notes that a \u201cserious underestimation of the risk\u201d in situations of domestic violence was at the heart of the European Court of Human Rights\u2019 judgment in the Talpis v. Italy decision.63 This decision noted several serious shortcomings in the Italian state response to responding to domestic violence, including the inadequate assessment of the victim\u2019s risk, the delayed response to the victim, and that no emergency protection order was issued.64\n[49] The police and state\u2019s dismissive response to violence against women was also illustrated in a recent Toronto Star article from January 2022 describing a Canadian woman in Italy who was seriously beaten in public by a taxi driver. The initial response and actions of the police and hospital staff was to not take the matter seriously. She was visibly injured and there were witnesses to the attack. The police took the man\u2019s statement, and then allowed him to drive off in his taxi. The victim describes the indifference of hospital staff towards her, telling her she was not facing an emergency because she was hit by a man, and that because they were dealing with COVID, they had \u201cbigger issues than a girl crying over a man who hit her.\u201d After a video of this assault was posted on Twitter, there was a large outpouring of support for the woman and state officials have publicly condemned the assault.65\n[50] Also noted in the sources before me is the continued acceptance of \u201churt feelings\u201d defenses by the courts in domestic violence cases in Italy, including in cases of serious bodily injury and femicide, resulting in reduced sentences because the crime is viewed as somewhat understandable due to emotions or passion taking over the aggressor in situations where a victim is viewed as having brought on such violence through her own behaviour.66 While it is laudable that the prime minister in 2019 publicly criticized such reasoning by the courts67, I find that the fact that this kind of reasoning continues to be used by the judiciary on some occasions in recent years, is further indication of the inconsistent and what has been described in other sources as the \u201carbitrary\u201d implementation of the domestic violence laws in Italy by police officers, as well as the judiciary.\n[51] For example, another source from 2018 speaks of two foreign students who accused police officers of rape were themselves accused of being drunk and being dressed inappropriately.68 A further 2018 article describes a woman\u2019s account of a police officer asking her whether she wasn\u2019t \u201cjust having an argument\u201d with her husband, when she had called the police for protection from her husband\u2019s violence.69 An appeal court\u2019s 2017 ruling, condemned by protesters and which was later overturned by Italy\u2019s highest court, was that a woman\u2019s story of being raped was not credible because she looked \u201ctoo masculine\u201d and it was improbable that the accused men would have wanted to rape her.70\n[52] I find that such discriminatory and discredited understandings about gender-based violence as displayed by the police and courts in Italy reflect the information in other sources about socio-cultural attitudes in Italy that show a level of acceptance of certain levels of violence against women in intimate partner relationships as normal and assumptions about sexual violence and intimate relationships that are rooted in gender discrimination and myths and stereotypes about gender-based violence: a 2021 Italian survey presented to the Italian senate indicated that 40 percent of men and 20 percent of women did not consider it violence to \u201cslap a partner in the face if she has flirted with another man\u201d, and that four out of ten men and 3 out of 10 women did not consider it violence to \u201cforce a partner to have sexual intercourse if she does not feel like it\u201d.71\n[53] I also note that the sources indicate that there is a serious shortage of women\u2019s shelters and that this is viewed as being a barrier to women leaving violent partners. One women\u2019s advocate in 2018 noted that Italy\u2019s 100 shelters was woefully inadequate to serve Italy\u2019s population of 60 million. The advocate indicated that six times this number was needed.72 Italy is reported to have provided a good deal of funding in recent years for shelters and \u201canti-violence\u201d centres for women, however, the exact number of shelters as set out in the GREVIO report is noted to be \u201cuncertain\u201d with the government claiming that there are 228 shelters and women\u2019s organizations estimating a considerably lower number of 79 shelters.73 This lack of availability of women\u2019s shelters, compounded with the principal claimant\u2019s described first-hand experiences in her testimony of racism in the past in searching for housing on her own as a Black woman, heightens the claimants\u2019 risk in this claim. This factor is a further way which the state\u2019 s response to her as a Black Italian female citizen requiring protection from domestic violence is inadequate.\n[54] Counsel submitted a great deal of country conditions evidence that points to serious gaps and ineffective implementation of Italy\u2019s laws and policies aimed at protecting women from violence. I have set out some of it in the above paragraphs. I accept that these laws may be adequate for some; and that the country conditions evidence shows that the state has made serious efforts to combat domestic violence in recent years. However, the test that I must consider is whether there is clear and convincing evidence of adequate state protection for these particular claimants. I have therefore considered whether state protection in Italy would be operationally effective for these particular claimants, taking into account their personal circumstances, and this includes the responsiveness of the state and their treatment by Italian authorities as Black women and girls. I find that for these claimants, in light of what the principal claimant experienced in her attempts to obtain state protection in Italy, and in light of the intersectional factor of race, as Black Italian citizens of Nigerian descent, that state protection would not be adequate. The claimants have therefore rebutted the presumption of state protection.\nNigeria\n[55] I also find that the claimants have rebutted the presumption of state protection in Nigeria. I find that there is clear and convincing evidence that adequate state protection would not be available to them in Nigeria. The claimants fear violence from KO himself, his family and his associates within the Black Axe gang. The principal claimant provided evidence that her mother had been physically assaulted and threatened by KO\u2019s brother and KO\u2019s associates in XXXX\n2018 who were demanding that her mother contact the principal claimant, and that KO\u2019s family continued to contact her family in Nigeria after this point. The principal claimant also fears that members in her family, in particular her elder sisters, will forcibly take the three minor claimants to have them undergo FGM without her consent.\n[56] Documentary evidence before me indicates that women in Nigeria rarely tum to the police for assistance in domestic violence matters, and those who do are often turned away by officers who consider it a private or family issue.74 The United States Department of State Report on Human Rights Practices in Nigeria for 2020 states that, \u201c[p]olice often refused to intervene in domestic disputes or blamed the victim for provoking the abuse. In rural areas courts and police were reluctant to intervene to protect women who formally accused their husbands of abuse if the level of alleged abuse did not exceed local customary norms.\u201d75 A number of sources indicate that both implementation and enforcement of laws prohibiting violence against women are lacking throughout Nigeria.76\n[57] Sources indicate that while the level of response depends on the victim\u2019s level of education and the individual police officer taking the report, complainants are sometimes blamed for provoking the abuse, or otherwise mistreated during the intake process. According to other sources, if both parties are present, the male is believed over the female making the complaint.77\n[58] Nigeria\u2019s legal system is a mix of common law, sharia law, and customary law. Sources indicate that there is no comprehensive national law applied throughout the country to combat domestic violence or violence against women.78 Certain sections of Nigerian law also permit men to use \u201ccorrective\u201d force against their partners.79 The 2015 Violence Against Persons (Prohibition) Act (VAPP) was a positive development, prohibiting gender-based violence, including domestic violence and harmful traditional practices such as FGM. However, sources report that as a federal law, the VAPP is only effective in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) of Abuja; only the high court of the FCT has jurisdiction to hear and grant applications, including restraining orders.80 While some states have their own domestic violence and\/or FGM legislation, only a third of states have ratified the VAPP.81\n[59] With respect to FGM, while the VAPP prohibits FGM, the documentary evidence suggests that this prohibition is rarely, if ever, enforced in Nigeria.82 Even with the passing of these laws, FGM in Nigeria remains \u201cwidespread, with low rates of reporting and prosecution\u201d83 Sources note that the Nigeria police are reluctant to provide protection to persons who refuse to undergo family traditional practices, including FGM. Reasons for this lack of enforcement and reluctance from the police include cultural beliefs held by police officers themselves, in that the police have difficulty recognizing the criminal nature of ritual practices, respect for these traditions and customs by the police and the discriminatory treatment and attitude towards women in Nigerian society.84\n[60] Other evidence notes that it \u201cremains extremely difficult for women and girls to obtain protection from FGM\u201d despite the enactment of anti-FGM laws in the FCT and anti-FGM legislation in many states, as community support for the practice of FGM and the traditional attitude of the police help to support such practices.85 The report by the British non\u00ad governmental organization, 28 Too Many, of June 2018 confirms that \u201cknowledge of the [FGM] law and enforcement is generally weak across Nigeria\u201d and that there have been no reported arrests, cases, prosecutions or convictions for FGM in Nigeria.86\n[61] Corruption in the Nigerian government is also reported to be pervasive and widespread, affecting all levels of government including the security forces, with government employees frequently engaging in corrupt practices with impunity.87 Sources note that high levels of corruption, as well as a lack of sufficient funding and training and a culture of impunity and weak oversight, have seriously undermined the effectiveness of the police in responding to violent crimes, including violence against women from intimate partners or former intimate partners.88 A report from the Africa Centre for Strategic Studies describes that Nigerian police commonly demanded bribes in everyday encounters with citizens, and that norms of professionalism and ethics are further weakened in the police through politicized, non-merit based appointments.89\n[62] Therefore, based on the documentary evidence before me, I do not find that claimants would have adequate state protection in Nigeria from either further violence from KO, his family or associates, or from the principal claimant\u2019s family abducting the minor claimants to subject them to FGM, against the principal claimant\u2019s wishes. While the introduction of legislation such as the VAPP that addresses gender-based violence is a positive step by the Nigerian state, the existence of legislation alone is not enough to support a finding of state protection. I find that the that the implementation of the state\u2019s laws with respect to gender-based violence in Nigeria is ineffective, and that therefore the claimants would not have adequate state protection in Nigeria.\nInternal Flight Alternative\nMotivation of KO ta locate the claimants in Italy and Nigeria\n[63] For the reasons that follow, I find that the claimants do not have a viable internal flight alternative (IFA) in either Italy or Nigeria. KO is a citizen of Nigeria and he has status akin to a permanent resident in Italy. I find that KO has a continuing motivation to locate the claimants if they attempt to relocate in either country, and that based on his past violence towards the claimants, I find that he poses a serious risk to their safety. He is the biological father of the two youngest minor claimants, ages 5 and 9, and the principal claimant previously resided with him as his common-law spouse for seven years. KO\u2019s motivation is also demonstrated through his continued, attempted contacts with the principal claimant90 and with at least one minor claimant since they have been in Canada via social media, as well as the claimants\u2019 testimony and evidence that KO has contacted mutual acquaintances in Nigeria in the recent past and that such contact indicated that KO remained angry at the principal claimant, blamed her for his conviction and arrest in Italy and wanted to find her whereabouts.91\n[64] The principal claimant also testified that KO was hostile and blamed her for his conviction and house arrest when he had an encounter with her sister in Italy. Moreover, since she left Italy, KO sent his brother and men to threaten the principal claimant\u2019s mother in Nigeria to discover the claimants\u2019 contact information, and her mother was physically assaulted.\nItaly\nAbility of KO to find the claimants in other locations in Italy\n[65] With respect to Italy, the cities of Rome and Naples were raised as possible IFA locations for these claimants; Rome is about 600 km south and Naples is about 800 km south of the city of XXXX, Italy in the northwest of the country where the claimants formerly lived, and where they believe KO to be living at this point. I find that the IFA test fails on the first prong of the test, in that the proposed IFA locations will not be safe for the claimants, and that KO would likely be able to find them should they return to Italy and attempt to relocate.\n[66] The principal claimant and the 18-year-old associated claimant testified about the social media use of the associated claimant and the eldest minor claimant who is 16 years old. The principal claimant noted that she was not well versed with technology and social media, and that she knew her daughters used social media, but she did not know a great deal about their presence online. The associated claimant testified about how she and her sister use various social media applications such as Instagram, SnapChat and TikTok to communicate with their friends and that she sometimes posts photographs of herself with friends or out doing activities. She testified that she estimated that her 16-year-old sister uses social media a fair bit, and that she and her sister do not tell their mother, the principal claimant, about their online posts and social media use. I find that the testimony of principal and associated claimant is credible about the 18- and 16-year- old\u2019s social media use: it did not appear to exaggerate their use of social media, and details came naturally and spontaneously to the claimants.\n[67] While the social media use of teenagers communicating online for social purposes may not involve political opinion or expression which is necessarily core to one\u2019s human rights, I note that it has become a standard and prevalent way of obtaining information, socializing and starting and maintaining friendships and community networks for young people in society today. Generally, I find that requiring adults, and even young adults, to be cautious with social media use and to do so with heightened precautions and privacy settings, so that an agent of persecution would not be able to locate their whereabouts, would be a reasonable expectation with respect to IFA. However, in the particular circumstances of this claim, I note that with two teenagers ages 16 and 18, and a third daughter about to turn 10 years of age, and with the evidence that KO has already connected with his 16-year-old daughter through social media online for a period of time without the principal claimant knowing of it, that the circumstances before me in this claim are such that the principal claimant would not be able to monitor and control all the content that her daughters (the associated claimant, the 16- year-old claimant, and in the near future one of the other minor claimants) post online or in which they are \u201ctagged\u201d by others online.\n[68] I find that a consideration of reasonable precautions must be assessed in light of the claimants\u2019 ages and maturity and the particular factual circumstances in this claim which include that the agent of persecution had contact with one of the minor claimants via social media without the principal claimant\u2019s knowledge. Upon learning of that contact, the principal claimant had the minor claimant block KO, and that KO has changed his username on at least one occasion and attempted to again contact the claimants. For these teenage claimants, and in these particular circumstances, I find that the associated claimant\u2019s and the minor claimants\u2019 social media use is something that the principal claimant will not be able to fully control and that such social media use is one way in which their location could become known to KO. I also find, on a balance of probabilities, that KO has shown that he has the motivation and ability to reach the claimants online via social media and that in the future, he could find the claimants\u2019 whereabouts from online content that is from or connected to the social media profiles and accounts of the associated claimant and the minor claimants.\n[69] Next, I have accepted that the principal claimant has credibly established, on balance of probabilities, her allegation that KO is involved with the Nigerian criminal gang, the Black Axe. The principal claimant acknowledged that KO never admitted his involvement in this group to her, but that she believed him to be involved in this group for several reasons, including that he would boast that he had \u201cboys\u201d he could use to kill anyone in Nigeria, that on one occasion she knew of he had paid someone to bring a car into Nigeria who then demanded more money and he sent his \u201cboys\u201d to Nigeria to deal with the matter. She also testified that KO had told her in Italy if anyone ever offended her to let him know, as he would send his \u201cboys\u201d to their house. The principal claimant testified that KO seemed to have many Nigerian friends and contacts in many different places in Italy and that he travelled frequently to see them.\n[70] I find that the claimants have also submitted reliable country conditions evidence as to the Black Axe criminal group\u2019s presence and reach in Italy. Documentary sources describe that the Black Axe criminal group as one that employs brutal violence and has become trans-national, involved in crimes such as prostitution, international human trafficking and money laundering.92 Sources note that the Black Axe criminal group has a strong presence in Italy93 and is regarded as \u201cquite powerful\u201d94, with \u201ccells throughout Italy\u201d95 and to be operating in \u201cmany regions of the country\u201d.96 Nigerian criminal networks in Italy are reported to have as many as 1,500 members across the country, and in some locations, they pay a cut to the Italian mafia to allow them to do business, and in other locations they encroach on Italian mafia territory and business.97 Italian police have attempted to curb the criminal activities of the Black Axe organization with arrests in 2016 of between 15-18 Black Axe leaders, and again in 2021, arresting 30 members.98\n[71] I have found the principal claimant credible in her testimony about why she believes KO is a part of, or affiliated with, this group. She testified that KO appeared to have many friends and connections throughout Italy and his friends were mainly Nigerian. She testified about how he would boast that he had \u201cboys\u201d who could take care of anyone who had offended her and that she saw that he would regularly speak with people she did not herself know from Rome, Turin, and Milan. She testified he used to visit Rome about twice a year and for Naples, he travelled there about once a year, but not always every year.\n[72] I find that KO\u2019s affiliation with the Black Axe group means that he poses a heightened risk to the claimants. This heightened risk comes from his ability to call on others in the gang to do his bidding, including in searching for the claimants and reporting back if they are located in another place in Italy. The claimant testified that she believes that he has this power and ability to call his \u201cboys\u201d to locate her, and cause her and her daughters harm, just as he has called on such thugs to harm her mother in Nigeria in XXXX 2018. I also note the principal claimant\u2019s testimony that her sister in XXXX, Italy saw KO at a bus stop there a few months ago, and he attempted to speak with her sister, but she was able to avoid him. I find on a balance of probabilities that KO continues to reside in XXXX Italy, and that his house arrest sentence is now completed.\n[73] Therefore, based on their particular circumstances, I find that the claimants would not be able to safely relocate within Italy and the IFA test fails on the first prong. I find that it is more likely than not that if the claimants were to move at a new location in Rome or Naples, it would become known to KO, through a combination of factors such as the associated claimant and minor claimants\u2019 social media use, and\/or through his connections and ability to use other associates of the Black Axe criminal group to locate the claimants. I find that the serious shortcomings with respect to the Italian state\u2019s response to violence against women and domestic violence specifically, compounded by systemic issues of racism, as set out above, mean that the claimants would not have adequate state protection in the IFA locations if they were located by KO in these locations, or anywhere else in Italy.\nNigeria\n[74] I also find that the claimants do not have a viable IFA in Nigeria. I proposed the large urban centre of Lagos, as a possible IFA location for the claimants. I have set out above my reasons for finding that KO continues to have a strong motivation to locate the claimants, including in Nigeria. The principal claimant testified about KO\u2019s ability to locate her in Lagos, stating that his brother who works as a driver for a rich and well-known traditional chief of Edo state, travels throughout Nigeria with this man and could use such connections to find her. She testified that through either his brother or through his connections with the Black Axe gang, he would be able to learn of their whereabouts in Lagos. She also testified that she and KO had many mutual friends and friends of each of their families who are in Lagos, and that KO knows her eider sister\u2019s address in Lagos having been there many times before. She believes that her sister would resist in telling KO her whereabouts, but that their network of mutual acquaintances would be susceptible to providing information about her whereabouts for payment by KO, who she testified would return to Nigeria and flaunt and spend his Euros.\n[75] The principal claimant acknowledged in testimony that this eider sister in Lagos supports FGM, and that she believes that this sister at least condoned another eider sister who was behind having FGM performed on her eldest daughter, the associated claimant, when they visited Nigeria when the associated claimant was about four years old. Residing with this sister in Lagos would therefore not be something that the principal claimant could do without risking the safety of the minor claimants.\n[76] I have set out, above, my reasons for finding that KO has the continuing motivation to locate and harm the claimants. I have found the principal claimant credible in her testimony about how acquaintances in Nigeria have told her that KO has recently been there, angrily asking about her. I find on a balance of probabilities that he has completed his sentence from 2018 for assaulting the principal claimant and that he is someone with the ability and desire to return to Nigeria, including that he has the financial resources to do so.\n[77] I find that the claimants\u2019 personal circumstances and the particular background of KO also contribute to his ability to locate the claimants in Lagos, and that the claimants would face a serious possibility of persecution in Lagos, as well as throughout Nigeria. These personal circumstances are relevant to both prongs of the IFA test, and I find that in considering them, the first prong of the test fails. First, I note the possibility about KO being able to determine their location via the associated claimant\u2019s and the minor claimants\u2019 social media use, for the reasons I have already set out above.\n[78] Secondly, the principal claimant is a single mother to four female children ranging in age from 5 years old to 18 years old and she would be returning to a new city where she does not have the amount of familiarity and support network as she did in the area where she grew up and where her mother and other siblings (but for the one eider sister in Lagos and another sister in Italy) live, Benin City in Edo state. She testified that the associated claimant and the minor claimants do not speak any local languages, and that the associated claimant and the next eldest, 16-year-old XXXX, speak English and Italian, whereas the younger two minor claimants now only speak English. The principal claimant testified that the associated claimant and minor claimants will be easily identifiable as people of Nigerian descent who have lived abroad for quite some time, as the girls speak English in a particular way and have a European mentality with respect to things such as a personal safety and everyday understandings of customs. The principal claimant noted that her four daughters have only ever visited Nigeria a handful of times (fewer occasions for the younger minor claimants), and that they grew up as Italian Europeans, and now as Canadians since mid-2018. This makes them very unfamiliar with Nigerian ways of life, and this would make them stand out as foreigners and increase their vulnerability. She also testified that she also is less familiar with the Nigeria of today, having moved to Italy in 1997 to work at the age of 21 and resided there since that time, only returning to Nigeria herself for a few visits over the years, although she is more familiar than her daughters are with the country.\n[79] I find that given these personal characteristics and circumstances, that these particular claimants will likely be more visible amongst neighbours and the community in a new location such as Lagos, and that the principal claimant would likely need to call upon one of their mutual friends for help and support in Lagos if they were to attempt to relocate there. In this situation, I find that KO would likely be able to locate them through his family and network of acquaintances in Nigeria or through his associates with the Black Axe criminal group. Sources describe that the Black Axe criminal group has a presence in Lagos99, with one source noting it has a national reach and that \u201c[i]n each community, these groups have leaders that [are] as ruthless as their coordinators at the state and national levels.\u201d100\n[80] I find that while the situation with respect to state protection for women and girls facing violence from a former intimate partner may be better in Lagos than the rest of the country, since in Lagos some sources note that there are improving attitudes amongst the community in not condoning or accepting domestic violence, and that the police in Lagos were better trained to deal with domestic violence and had a more responsive attitude with a dedicated gender desk to receive domestic violence complaints,101 I find that the bulk of the country conditions evidence for Nigeria indicates that adequate state protection would not be available for the claimants in Lagos. The serious problems with police corruption and ineffectiveness in Nigeria mean that KO could use his financial resources and connections in Nigeria to bribe the police anywhere, including Lagos. I find that the weight of the documentary evidence before me does not support a finding that conditions in Lagos with respect to the treatment of women, and with respect to police effectiveness, are different to the extent that it would render state protection adequate in Lagos, given their personal circumstances, and the particular factors involved in their claim. For these reasons, I find that the claimants do not have a viable IFA in Lagos, or anywhere else in Nigeria.\nCONCLUSION\n[81] Based on the above analysis, I determine that the claimants are Convention refugees pursuant to section 96 of IRPA. I therefore accept their claims.\n(signed) Melinda Gayda\nApril 29, 2022\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27, as amended, sections 96 and 97(1)\n2 Refugee Protection Division Rules, (\u201cRPD Rules\u201d), SOR\/2012-256, Rule 55\n3 Guideline on Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution: Guidelines Issued by the Chairperson pursuant to section 65(3) of the Immigration Act, IRB, Ottawa, March 9, 1993, Update: November 1996, as continued in effect by the Chairperson on June 28, 2002 pursuant to section 159(l)(h) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n4 Exhibit 6, pages 46-52\n5 Exhibit 1, Package of information from the CBSA on referral of refugee claim.\n6 Exhibit 3, National Documentation Package for Italy (September 29, 2021), Item 2.1, Italy- Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2020, United States, Department of State, 30 March 2021, page 14.\n7 Exhibit 7, For Italy\u2019s Abused Women, a Legal Labyrinth Compounds the Wounds, New York Times, Gala Pianigiani, 11 August 2018, page 11.\n8 Exhibit 7, Ibid, page 11.\n9 Exhibit 14, Italy draws up plan to fight violence against women, Wanted in Rome, November 24, 2021, pages 323- 324;- Exhibit 12, Italy Survey reveals shocking attitudes towards violence against women, Wanted in Rome, November 25, 2021, page 303; Domestic violence against women escalating in Italy, independent Australia, June 3, 2021, Francesco Bertolucci, page 308.\n10 Exhibit 4, National Documentation Package for Nigeria (November 30, 2021 version) Item 5.3: Domestic violence, including legislation; protection and support services offered to victims (2016-November 2019).
