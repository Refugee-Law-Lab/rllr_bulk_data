        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2022 RLLR 31\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: February 3, 2022\nPanel: Siobhan Yorgun\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Jacques Beauchemin\nCountry: Sudan\nRPD Number: VC1-06798\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2022-01960\nATIP Pages: N\/A\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: I have considered your testimony and the other evidence in the case, and I am ready to render my decision orally.\nINTRODUCTIONS\n[2] These are the reasons for the decision in the claim of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, a citizen of Sudan who is claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refuge Protection Act.\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] The claimant\u2019s allegations were fully set out in his Basis of Claim form. To briefly summarize, the claimant is a 41-year-old citizen of Sudan and no other country. The claimant is a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX for a contracting company, was working on a road project for local government in South Sudan starting in 2009. In XXXX 2010, he received a substantial payment in cash for completion of the project from XXXX XXXX. He requested XXXX XXXX office manager XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to keep the money for him, as there was fighting in the area at the time, until it was safe for him to travel with the payment back to his company in Khartoum. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX failed to return the money to the claimant. After the claimant complained that he would take the matter up with XXXX XXXX, he was assaulted at his home and threatened not to approach XXXX XXXX office and to keep his mouth shut.\n[4] The claimant returned to Khartoum and explained the situation to his boss. His boss was disbelieving and threatened to file a suit against the claimant. The claimant said his manager could follow the matter up with the governor in question. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX then called the claimant saying he had only himself to blame for failing to keep his mouth shut. The claimant was informed by a neighbor that two (2) men came looking for him at his house, whereupon he fled to his uncle further north in Atbara, after which he fled to Egypt and then on to Oman when his uncle told him three (3) men had come looking for him at his uncle\u2019s house in Atbara. When his job was terminated in Oman, and the claimant could not find another to prevent the cancellation of his work visa, he fled to Canada via the US, where he had a visa to attend an international civil engineering conference. The claimant fears for his life at hand of security forces under the influence of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.\nDETERMINATION\n[5] I find the claimant is a Convention refugee the pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[6] I find the claimant\u2019s personal identity and identity as a national of Sudan has been established on a balance of probabilities by his Sudanese passport and birth certificate.\nNexus\n[7] I find the claimant\u2019s allegations establish a nexus to the conventional ground of imputed political opinion because he claims to fear persecution (inaudible) his conflict with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, the next spokesperson for the ruling Military Transition Council, will be considered or construed as opposition to the government. Opposition to corruption or criminality may constitute a perceived political opinion when it can be seen to challenge the state apparatus, and indeed the claimant\u2019s personal knowledge of the wrongdoing of a senior political and military figure has been identified as a challenge to the state apparatus, and the state apparatus engaged in addressing this perceived threat. As such, I have examined this claim under section 96 of the IRPA.\nCredibility\n[8] When a claimant swears to the truth of certain allegations, this creates presumptions that those allegations are true unless there is reason to doubt their truthfulness. Claimant\u2019s testimony was forthright, and he provided spontaneous detail and testimony that was fulsome and consistent with his BOC and supported by the documentary evidence submitted. Which included, the letters confirming his employment in Sudan and Oman, and educational qualifications as a civil engineer. Birth certificates of his immediate family, supporting letters from family and friends attesting to their knowledge of certain events, and information on the conference for which he received a US visa. The claimant also submitted two (2) news articles from 2019, which include reference to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX as a spokesperson for the Transitional Military Council. Having assessed these documents, I have no reason to doubt their authenticity and find on a balance of probabilities that they and are genuine and give them full weight as they corroborate the claimant\u2019s narrative.\n[9] In light of the claimant\u2019s credible testimony and the corroborative evidence, I therefore find that the claimant entrusted a considerable sum of money to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, then XXXX XXXX for the local government for safekeeping while in Malakal and the south of Sudan during a period of fighting. That this money was intended as payment for XXXX XXXX to the claimant\u2019s company for completion of the (inaudible) project. And that when the claimant asked XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to return the funds so that he could deliver it to his company in the north, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX failed to do so. When the claimant threatened to report the matter to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX superior, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX threatened him and had two (2) men dressed in local suits assault the claimant.\n[10] I find the claimant on return to Khartoum had a court case initiated against him by his company for the loss of money. A company which the claimant testified was owned by the brother of then President, al-Bashir. I find the claimant was warned by his neighbour in Khartoum that two (2) men not in uniform, but in smart suits, the neighbor understood as indicating they were government security, had been looking for him. After the claimant had fled from his uncle further north in Sudan in Atbara to Egypt, his uncle called him with a similar description of three (3) men wearing suits, who appeared to be government security, looking for the claimant.\n[11] I find XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is both a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and currently in a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, described by the claimant as XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in Sudan. I find that the claimant has established on a balance of probabilities that he has personal knowledge of threatening behavior of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and that official\u2019s theft of monies from local government intended for a politically connected company. And I find the claimant has been personally threatened twice by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to silence him, and is on balance of probabilities, being sought by security apparatus of the state at the instigation of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. And that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX has a continued interest in the claimant remaining silent, as his reputation and influence grow.\nWell-founded Fear of Persecution\n[12] The claimant fears returning to Sudan as he alleged he will be on a wanted list and immediately captured by security and made to disappear to maintain the security and reputation of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. As well as having a subjective fear of persecution, I also find that the objective evidence before me establishes that the claimant\u2019s fear of by persecution by security agents of the state are objectively well-founded.\n[13] The country condition evidence has outlined in the National Documentation Package for Sudan supports the claimant\u2019s allegations regarding the treatment of perceived opponents to the state in Sudan by state agents. Corruption is endemic throughout Sudan and occurs with impunity. Those who speak out against it are punished. US Department of State report from the NDP for Sudan states that the World Bank rates corruption as a severe problem in the country. Officials found guilty of corrupt acts could often avoid jail time if they returned ill-gotten funds.\n[14] Journalists who reported on government corruption were sometimes intimidated, detained, and interrogated by security forces. Freedom House similarly reports that citizens who exposed public malfeasance faced arrest. And the rule of law is increasingly perceived as conditional on political connections. According to the US Department of State, the Sudanese government engages in arbitrary or unlawful killings, including of detainees. There are disappearances by or on behalf of the government authorities. Security forces continue to beat and torture detainees. Even without torture, prison conditions in Sudan are harsh, overcrowded, and life threatening. Arbitrary arrest and detention is common and for extended periods.\n[15] I find that the country conditions evidence establishes that those who have evidence of government corruption and perceived opponents of the state are arrested, tortured, and killed, amounted to persecution. I find that this threat remains ongoing for any person such as the claimant identified as a political reputational risk. As such, I find that there is more than a mere possibility of persecution should the claimant return to Sudan.\nState Protection\n[16] There is a presumption that unless in complete breakdown, states are capable of protecting their citizens. However, I find that presumption has been rebutted in this case, as the agent of persecution in this case is the state, and the NDP is clear on a politically dependent inability to take action against corruption. Accordingly, I find that there is no effective state protection available to the claimant.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[17] I find that the claimant does not have a viable internal flight alternative, that there is nowhere within Sudan that the claimant will be able to relocate without fear of persecution. The state of Sudan has effective control over its territory. The claimant would not be able to enter into or move within Sudan without coming to the state\u2019s attention. There is no evidence before me to suggest that there are adequately independent state authorities in Sudan who claimant could approach for protection in any part of the country. The claimant does not have an area within Sudan safe from persecution, and so does not have an internal flight alternative.\nCONCLUSION\n[18] Based on the analysis of both, I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA. and I accept this claim.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n",

        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2022 RLLR 30\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: November 28, 2022\nPanel: Nick Bower\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Tiffani Frederick\nCountry: Barbados\nRPD Number: VC2-07212\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2022-01960\nATIP Pages: N\/A\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: These are my reasons for decision in the claims for protection of XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, citizens of Barbados who seek protection under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act as Convention refugees under section 96 and as persons in need of protection under section 97(1).\n[2] I have heard your testimony and considered all of the evidence before me in this matter. As an initial matter, and I mean no disrespect by using your first names, but XXXX, you are the designated representative for XXXX XXXX XXXX who is still a minor.\n[3] I have considered and applied the chairperson\u2019s guideline 4 regarding claims of gender-based persecution.\n[4] I specifically note as a starting point at paragraph 11.2.1, the guideline states that the Convention refugee ground of membership in a particular social group includes individuals fearing gender-based persecution.\n[5] At paragraph 4.3 and paragraph 4.4, the guideline states that Members should avoid the application of myths, stereotypes, and incorrect assumptions when making findings of fact and law and when making decisions. Specific examples of these incorrect myths and stereotypes include assumptions that survivors of gender-based violence can be expected to behave in a particular manner, including pursuing criminal complaints, that a person in an abusive relationship will seek to leave at the first opportunity, that a person who has experienced gender-based violence once in Canada will automatically seek out counselling or assistance in overcoming trauma, that well-educated women or women with a capacity for self-sufficiency are less likely to experience gender-based violence, and that a person who is a victim of gender-based violence will necessarily know before arriving in Canada that they possess basic human rights, that what has happened is an infringement of those rights, and that there may be avenues of recourse available to them.\n[6] At paragraph 8.2.1, the guideline talks about corroborating evidence and notes that survivors of gender-based violence may not have access to any corroborating evidence, any independent evidence. And that of course makes sense when one (1) considers that the allegations are of domestic violence, violence that happens in the home, in a very personal and private setting, that other people in the community are not likely to see or not \u2014 in any event, not likely to see the full extent of.\n[7] At paragraphs 11.3.1 through 11.3.3, the guidelines discuss persecution. The guideline states that an individual\u2019s experience of gender-based violence may not necessarily amount to persecution in every case. It is \u2014 it needs to be analyzed on a case-by-case basis. But discrimination amounts to persecution if the consequences are substantially prejudicial, such as the right to earn a livelihood, rights to private and family life, freedom of movement, or the right to an education, and that harassment that is sufficiently serious and occurs over a period of time of time such that the person\u2019s physical or moral integrity is threatened may constitute persecution.\n[8] Having considered all of the evidence, I find that each of you is a Convention refugee under section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[9] Very briefly, you allege that you have in Barbados been living in a household with long standing domestic violence, physical and emotional. The worst of the physical violence was directed against you, XXXX, but all three (3) of you did suffer threats of physical violence at the very least, as well as ongoing psychological, emotional violence. The agent of persecution, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, is still alive, well, still living in the family household in Barbados.\n[10] Turning to analysis, the first issue is identity. I have copies of your current passports in Exhibit 1 and copies of your birth certificates in Exhibit 5. I am satisfied that each of you is a citizen of Barbados. I have heard your testimony and reviewed all of the evidence.\n[11] I find that each of you is a credible witness, and I accept your testimony. There are no significant inconsistencies or omissions between your testimony and the other evidence before me. Your allegations are at the very least not inconsistent with objective evidence about current conditions in Barbados. You both testified in a spontaneous and forthright manner. You did not exaggerate or tailor your evidence.\n[12] You have provided some corroborating documents in Exhibit 5, but I accept your testimony. I find that you are credible witnesses and specifically accept your evidence that you have all survived a long standing violent domestic home at the hands of XXXX XXXX in Barbados. (Inaudible) that you have all suffered psychological harm, and that you have all been victims of \u2014 threats of, or actual physical violence from XXXX. Now, there is \u2014 I find XXXX, that you are not excluded from protection under article 1(f)(b) of the Convention. There is no evidence that \u2014 well, that XXXX XXXX XXXX father, XXXX, has consented to her coming to stay in Canada. It is potentially the crime of abduction under the Canadian criminal code, which does have a maximum penalty of 10 years, and so is presumed serious.\n[13] However, section 285 of the Canadian criminal code provides a full defense if the person who removes the child from the other parent does so to either protect the child from imminent harm, or is him or herself escaping a danger of imminent harm. As I will explain, I find that you were escaping a danger of imminent harm, as well as protecting XXXX XXXX XXXX from danger of imminent harm. You therefore have access to the full defence under section 285, and so there is no serious reason to consider that you would be excluded from protection because you might have committed a serious non-political crime outside Canada before arriving in Canada to seek protection.\n[14] There is a nexus between the persecution alleged and the particular social group of women in Barbados. The UN compilation at the NDP Exhibit 3, Tab 2.4, note that patriarchal attitudes in Barbados for example, prevent women from among other things, participating in governmental decision making. The country gender assessment at Tab 5.3 notes that very high levels of overall human development in Barbados have not been accompanied by a correlating and an expected gender equality, and that these patriarchal norms are used to justify violence against women who do not \u201cknow their place\u201d, and support male control over women and girls\u2019 bodies, including use of violence to get access to sex.\n[15] I find that women and girls in Barbados do constitute a particular social group for the purposes of the refugee Convention in section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. Further, XXXX XXXX XXXX, I find that there is also a particular social group (inaudible) your case as the family member of a person who fears persecution under section 96. You testified that if you were to return a loan, you may face a harm or at the very least ongoing pressure from XXXX to get information from you about your mother and sister that \u2014 in addition to potentially pursuing you \u2014 to pursue you, he would also pursue you to get after your family members who allegedly face gender-based persecution, and so, there is this additional particular social group in your circumstances.\n[16] Turning to the well-founded fear of persecution, that has two (2) parts. A subjective fear and an objective basis. I have heard your testimony and I accept that each of you does have a subjective fear of persecution if you were to return to Barbados today. In the case of XXXX XXXX XXXX, I note guideline 3, dealing with child refugee claims \u2014 notes that due to a child\u2019s age, the child might not be able to testify or give evidence themselves about specific issues in their claim, which can include whether or not they are afraid to return. But the Panel, the Division, as the deciding member, I can consider all of the evidence, and I can infer details of XXXX XXXX XXXX claim from all of the evidence provided. And based on the evidence, I can certainly infer, and I accept that she also has a subject subjective fear of persecution if she were to return to Barbados today.\n[17] Considering all of the evidence, I find that your subject fear is objectively well-founded, and that you would face a serious risk of persecution if you were to return to Barbados today. Specifically, based on the evidence I have, I am satisfied that each of you would face at the very least, a serious risk of threats of physical violence, physical violence, and ongoing psychological violence causing psychological injury from XXXX, if you were to return.\n[18] As the guideline notes, persecution can and should be considered to include threats to a person\u2019s moral integrity. And the law is quite clear that psychological health is also health. Psychological harm is harm, just the same as physical harm. Threats of violence that cause psychological harm is as persecutory as threats and violence that cause physical harm. And it is analytically wrong to require an element of actual physical violence or harm if a person faces a serious risk of psychological harm. The evidence is that the physical violence has mostly \u2014 largely been directed against you, XXXX. But there have been threats of physical violence, and there has been, I find, on the evidence demonstrated, psychological harm to all three (3) of you.\n[19] XXXX XXXX XXXX, you and XXXX XXXX XXXX have both sought out psychological treatment for the harm you have suffered. XXXX, you have looked into the availability of psychological treatment. XXXX XXXX XXXX in particular has \u2014 you have seen \u2014 shown very concerning signs of serious psychological harm that has led her to cut herself to inflect physical harm, just to demonstrate the depth of her psychological harm. If you were to return, there is a serious risk that XXXX would continue to act as he has done in the past. That he would continue to threaten you, that he would continue to manipulate you, that he would continue to use violence or threats of violence to control you, down to the level of what you can spend for groceries, something that is not even in your control. And that these threats of violence and violence would cumulatively, seriously threaten your physical and your moral integrity, would threaten your physical and your psychological health, and amounts to persecution.\n[20] This is consistent with the objective evidence about conditions in Barbados. At Tab 2.2, the report by Freedom House notes that violence against women in Barbados remains widespread, and laws addressing domestic violence are not well enforced. At Tab 5.11, the report notes that rates of domestic violence have increased with the COVID-19 pandemic, which has forced families to remain at home.\n[21] At Tab 5.3, the report notes that Barbados has a very high rate of gender violence with 27 percent of women and girls, or more than one (1) in four (4) reporting having experienced domestic violence. At Exhibit 6, there is an article from April 2022, where the chief magistrate correctly observes that domestic violence is harmful to everyone in the family. The chief magistrate notes that \u2014 states that domestic violence around children creates war zones in households, that unleash terrorists on society. It is a recognition that domestic violence has serious ongoing long-lasting harm, whether or not that instant of physical violence is directed against that individual or someone else in the family. I will come back to that article in a moment.\n[22] If you were to return, Barbados is a very small country with a very small population. It is about 400 square kilometres, and has a population of just over 300,000 people. You would either be living with the agent of persecution again, or in the same community. There is simply not enough physical space or population to not be either living with him or living near him. If you are living with him, there is a serious risk that the same circumstances are simply going to continue, and you are going to continue to experience physical violence and psychological violence. If you were to live independently, out \u2014 away from him in another household, that would be \u2014 there would be a serious risk that would be seen as a loss of his face in the community.\n[23] The reports note that \u2014 sorry, let me just find it \u2014 that \u2014 lethal violence against women. Murders of women in Barbados have increased. They did dip for one (1) year, but have remained well, far too high. And so, simply removing yourself from the same household does not reduce the risk of ongoing violence, and maybe an inciting incident, a triggering event that can lead to an increase in violence. If you were to return based on all of the evidence, I am satisfied that each of you would face a serious \u2014 persecution.\n[24] XXXX XXXX XXXX, you are an adult. If you were to return, then it is possible that you could live outside the same home as the agent of persecution. However, you have testified, and I accept that there is a serious risk. He would still continue to pursue you either to continue to exert his control over you, as he is the man of the house, and you are therefore one (1) of (inaudible) \u201chis women in the house to control.\u201d But there is also a serious risk he would continue to pursue you to force you to give information about your mother, his wife, about your sister, his child daughter. And there is a serious risk given his use of violence in the home in the past, in a domestic situation in the past, that he could threaten and could use physical violence to compel you to either give him the information he wants, or to hurt you to \u2014 through hurting you, hurt your mother and sister.\n[25] I find that you do not have a viable internal flight alternative. As noted by the CIA World Fact Book, Tab 1.3, Barbados is a very small nation. It is geographically small. It has got a small population. You have testified and I accept that everyone knows everyone. There is nowhere where you could relocate to, where you would not be able to find you easily. And of course, if he is able to find you, he would be able to travel to and reach you. It all comes down to his motivation, and there is no reason that \u2014 to believe that he will not be as motivated to continue the persecution as he was in the past. There is no reason to believe that his behaviour has changed or will change.\n[26] I also note at Tab 5.3, the report on the country gender assessment for Barbados, that occupations \u2014 work in Barbados is highly differentiated by sex, and the \u2014 this differentiation has only been growing since 1996. That women make up the majority of workers who earn less than 500 dollars a week, and men make up the majority in all income brackets, earning more than 500 dollars a week. Women are statistically at the very bottom of the pay scale. Female headed households the reports states, poverty is concentrated among female headed households in Barbados.\n[27] The CIA World Fact Book notes that unemployment overall is 10 percent as of 2017. That is one (1) in 10 people. But for youths, it is as high as 26 percent overall, and more than 20 percent for young women. That is more than one (1) in five (5). Given the evidence about work, about earnings, there is a serious risk that if you were to return and relocate, you would face poverty, because of your gender as independent women. I therefore find you do not have a viable internal flight alternative.\n[28] Finally, I find that you would not receive adequate state protection. The US DOS report and other reports do note that Barbados has legally made steps to increase the laws protecting women from violence. However, considering all of the evidence, I find that these not \u2014 these are not practically enforced. Going back to that article I referred to, where the chief magistrate correctly notes that domestic violence is hurting everyone. He then goes on to say that the police are \u201ctoo much involved\u201d in domestic matters.\n[29] You have provided another article in Exhibit 6, from January 2020, about a recent domestic violence case where the report quotes the president of the National Organization for Women, stating that domestic violence is not taken seriously by the courts, and particularly by the police. At Tab 2.4, the UN compilation, it states in regards to domestic violence and court response to domestic \u2014 \u201cthe committee was however, concerned about the insufficient resources allocated to the justice system, the overly burdened procedural rules, considerable backlogs and lengthy delays in processing cases, the limited capacity of the police and courts to address complaints from women about gender-based violence in a gender sensitive manner, and the absence of a specialized court on family laws.\u201d\n[30] At Tab 5.5, report by the research directorate states that police are slow and reluctant to respond to calls about domestic violence, and their response is by and large, inadequate. That is also consistent with the objective evidence about patriarchal norms in Barbados and society. The police are members of society and are presumed reasonably, to share those same opinions in the absence of evidence of effective training to combat these patriarchal attitudes. There are reports that there have been some attempts to provide this evidence, but the police are still reluctant to respond to domestic violence and see it as a domestic matter.\n[31] Despite the laws in place or coming soon, I find that the police and the courts do not provide a practical adequate response to issues of domestic violence. That the police response is slow, it is inadequate, the court system is slow and inadequate, and this not only leads to a tolerance of domestic violence, a impunity for offenders, it is also consistent with and reinforces the patriarchal beliefs that say that men have control. That men are allowed to use violence to exert that control, and that women should know their place, because the police and the courts are not acting in a way to say anything different. For all of these reasons, I find that each of you is a Convention refugee under section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, and I accept your claims for protection.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013\n",

Throughout this hearing and in this decision, I have considered and applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 4 on gender considerations in proceedings before the Immigration and Refugee Board as these claims include allegations of a risk of gender-based violence. I have also applied and considered the Chairperson\u2019s Guidelines on child refugee claimants\u2019 procedural and evidentiary issues as it relates to the claim of the minor claimant.\nDETERMINATION\n[3] I find that the claimants are Convention refugees pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA based on their well-founded fear of persecution in Ukraine.\nALLEGATIONS\n[4] The specifics of their claims are stated in the claimants\u2019 Basis of Claim forms and narratives in evidence. The principal claimant is a 33-year-old XXXX and the minor claimant is a 13-year-old girl. And they are both from Kharkiv, Ukraine. The claimants are Russian speakers and the principal claimant\u2019s cousin and her family live Saint Petersburg, Russia. Starting in 2014 the claimants began to experience discrimination in Kharkiv as they had Russian relatives who came to visit them often. The threats they received began to escalate in 2021 when the claimants\u2019 home was vandalized and they received written threats on a few occasions. When they went to the police, the police did not assist them or offer them protection. As the war began at the end of February 2022, the claimants began to fear for their lives and fled to western Ukraine to Lviv in early XXXX 2022 where they attempted to rent a house. They were informed that they could only rent a home if they spoke Ukrainian and if the principal claimant\u2019s husband fought for Ukraine. They were told to leave when the principal claimant informed the landlord that her husband would not fight for Ukraine. The claimants then fled from Ukraine to Poland and then to Canada where the claimant\u2019s cousin lives in Montreal at the end of XXXX 2022. The claimants fear they will be persecuted due to their imputed political opinion in Ukraine as they are Russian speakers who have Russian family numbers. And they also fear being persecuted by the Russian military as Ukrainian women or girls by the invading Russian troops or killed by the ongoing missiles and bombs. The claimants made their refugee claim in April 2022.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[5] I am satisfied with the identity of the claimants as citizens of Ukraine which is established by their testimonies and the copies of their passport with Canadian visas in evidence.\nCredibility\n[6] According to Maldonado, when a claimant swears the truth of their allegations, this creates a presumption that those allegations are true unless there is reason to doubt their truthfulness. I find no reason to doubt the truthfulness of the claimants. They testified in a straightforward, forthright, detailed and candid manner and there were no material inconsistencies, omissions or contradictions between the claimants\u2019 testimonies and the other evidence in their case. They did not exaggerate or tailor their evidence. And in summary, their testimonies were consistent with the other evidence on the central aspects of their claims. I find the claimants provided ample details to expand upon their allegations. And although the claimants did not provide additional corroborating documents, I do not draw a negative inference on their overall credibility. I find that the objective evidence before me as well as the claimants\u2019 identification documents and credible testimony establish on a balance of probabilities the facts alleged in their claims. Including that the claimants are Ukrainian women or girls from Kharkiv and Russian speakers. In addition, I accept, on a balance of probabilities, that they were threatened and received written threats to their home on multiple occasions. Therefore, I accept the subjective fear they have of returning to Ukraine now as they have nowhere to live and no protection there. And in sum, I find the claimants to be credible witnesses and therefore, I believe what they have alleged in support of their claims.\nNexus\n[7] To qualify for refugee status under the Refugee Convention, an individual must demonstrate that they have a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion. The allegations establish a nexus to the Convention ground for the claimants based on their membership in a particular social group as women or girls facing a risk of gender-based violence in a situation of war. In addition, the allegations support a nexus to the Convention ground for the claimants based on their imputed political opinion as they have relatives who are Russian family and who often visited them in Kharkiv from Russia. And therefore, the claimants experienced repercussions in the form of discrimination which escalated to threats due to their imputed pro-Russia political opinion. I will, therefore, assess their claims under section 96.\nWell-founded Fear of Persecution and Risk of Harm\n[8] I find that the claimants have established a well-founded fear of persecution based on their gender due to the war. The claimants testified that they were fearful for their lives prior to leaving Ukraine due to the threats they received as well as the escalating violence from the war in Kharkiv and throughout Ukraine. Country condition evidence from the most recent update of the National Documentation Package for Ukraine. In particular, an independent legal analysis of the Russian Federation\u2019s breaches of the Genocide Convention in Ukraine and the duty to prevent by the New Lines Institute for Strategy and Policy at NDP Item 1.13. Establishes that there are one (1), reasonable grounds to believe Russia is responsible for direct and public incitement to commit genocide. And a pattern of atrocities from which an inference of intent to destroy the Ukrainian national group, in part, can be drawn. And two (2), the existence of a serious risk of genocide in Ukraine, triggering the legal obligation of all states to prevent genocide. This report provides examples of what it describes as a genocidal pattern of destruction targeting Ukrainians. The examples include mass killings, deliberate attacks on shelters and humanitarian routes, deliberately inflicting life-threatening conditions by targeting vital infrastructure, indiscriminate bombardment of residential areas, rape and sexual violence and forcible transfer of Ukrainians.\n[9] One (1) second. Okay. In regards to the claimants\u2019 risk of being persecuted as Ukrainian women or girls, a rapid gender analysis by Care International and UN Women at NDP Item 5.6 states that women constitute the majority of those displaced within and outside of the country. And they face significantly increased safety and protection risks, incidents of gender-based violence, particularly domestic violence and conflict-related sexual violence. Since the war began, women\u2019s care burden has increased significantly with the lack of access to education facilities due to security risks, women\u2019s engagement in volunteer activities, and men\u2019s absence due to engagement in the armed forces. The war will increasingly impact unemployment rates among all categories of the population and will likely continue to push women into the unprotected informal sectors of the economy, poverty and dependency on social payments, especially among female headed households, will be expected to increase. This report, the rapid gender analysis, further states that staying in Ukraine can, however, have negative impacts on women and children\u2019s security and can mean a lack of access to basic services. There are also accounts of family separation at the border. When women and children choose to leave, they face family separation and anxiety about the well-being of those left behind. This article further delves into the challenges for women of all ages to access aid and services in the war-torn areas of eastern Ukraine such as Kharkiv, where the claimants lived before coming to Canada. Many have fled and face further hurdles in accessing safe shelters in the western region of the country. This article states that, \u201cFor many respondents, financial and social support including pensions, child benefits and disability benefits is their only source of income. And many are concerned about whether they will be able to access these benefits. This is especially true for female headed households, families with persons with disabilities and families of pensioners. Moreover, this issue disproportionately affects women, who make up 72 percent of social protection recipients and the majority of older people and caregivers in Ukraine.\u201d\n[10] Women and girls are also more at risk of conflict-based sexual assault. NDP Item 5.6 states that there is increasing and concerning media reports of conflict-related sexual violence emerging in Ukraine, and many interviewees raised gender-based violence as a safety concern. Interviewed women CSOs highlight the particular risk of gender-based violence in occupied war affected areas. And the executive director of UN Women, Sima Bahous, noted in her speech to the UN Security Council, that this increasing information on sexual violence committed by the Russian forces is raising all the red flags. NDP Item 5.3 states that Kharkiv has been the site of heavy fighting between Russian and Ukraine forces since the start of the Russian invasion and continues to be one (1) of the front lines of the war. As a result, there is currently limited evidence available for what is happening in Kharkiv up to date. Based on the evidence before me and the circumstances of this claim, I find the claimants have demonstrated a well-founded fear of persecution on both a subjective and objective basis. I also find that the claimants would face a serious possibility of persecution in Ukraine based on their profiles as women or girls who would be at risk of gender-based violence by the Russian military who have invaded the country of Ukraine.\nState protection\n[11] The claimants faced threats and vandalism due to their Russian language and their relationship with their relatives who were Russian in the past between 2014 and 2021. When these threats were reported to the police, the police did not assist the claimants, and the police are no longer in a position to help civilians due to the war in Ukraine. While states are presumed to be capable of protecting their citizens, it is the obligation of the claimants to demonstrate on a balance of probabilities that their home country is unable or unwilling to provide adequate state protection. And I find that while Ukraine has done all it can to protect its citizens, it is currently unable to provide them with adequate protection because the enemy they face is better armed and has sheer numbers of weapons and soldiers that are more than the Ukrainians have at their disposal. NDP Item 5.6 states that women constitute the majority of those displaced within and outside of the country and they face significantly increased safety and protection risks. Incidents of gender-based violence, including domestic violence and conflict-related sexual violence, are increasing, but services for survivors are not provided in full. And in many parts of Ukraine, the police are no longer responding to such cases of domestic or conflict-related sexual violence. Furthermore, drivers, mostly women, feel it has become dangerous to drive a car in Ukraine now because traffic lights are not working, and there are no police on the streets. Based on all the country condition evidence available, it is evident that the current ability of Ukraine to defend itself is entirely reliant on the military contributions from other countries. And therefore, whatever protection is being offered to its citizens is actually a form of surrogate protection. In considering the totality of the information available to me, including the most up to date publicly available news report and all the objective evidence before me, I find the claimants have rebutted the presumption of state protection with clear and convincing evidence.\nInternal Flight Alternative or IFA\n[12] I will now consider a two (2) prong test in order to determine the viability of an internal flight alternative location for the claimants. First, I must be satisfied that, on a balance of probabilities, the claimants would not face a serious possibility of persecution or risk to life or of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or danger of torture in the proposed IFA. Second, I must be satisfied that the conditions in the suggested IFA are not such that it would be objectively unreasonable, in all the circumstances including those particular to the claimants, for them to relocate and reside there. In the circumstances of this claim, I find that the risk the claimants face would exist throughout entire territory of Ukraine if they were to return now. The forces of the Russian Federation have shown the ability and willingness to strike each and every city in Ukraine from land, sea or air. They have also shown a willingness to indiscriminately rain artillery and missile fire on civilian infrastructure, bomb shelters, train stations, maternity hospitals and shopping malls. They have shown a willingness to summarily execute unarmed civilians, starve them of food, water and medical supplies and deprive them of basic necessities and sanitation.\n[13] And this is reflected in the March 2022 UNHCR report on return to Ukraine found at NDP Item 1.23, that describes the situation in Ukraine as volatile and uncertain. The UNHCR report calls on states to suspend the return of nationals to the country. It states that in view of the volatility of the situation in the entire territory of Ukraine, UNHCR does not consider it appropriate to deny international protection to Ukrainians and former habitual residents of Ukraine on the basis of an internal flight or relocation alternative. A June 2022 report at NDP Item 1.10 indicates that there are more than 8 million internally displaced persons in Ukraine. The report highlights numerous challenges in Ukraine facing internally displaced persons,ncluding the lack of accommodation, shortages of food, water and energy supplies, and barriers to accessing financial, social support and health services. In addition, the claimants did make \u2013 take steps to relocate within Ukraine. However, due to their Russian language as well as the fact that the principal claimant\u2019s husband did not agree to join the war, they were not invited to stay longer at their place of residence in western Ukraine. The Ukrainian government has made some efforts to counter the Russian aggression and provide protection to its citizens. But in sum, its operational effectiveness falls short of adequacy. And this state of affairs exists throughout the entire country of Ukraine. Therefore, I find there is no location within Ukraine that the claimants could relocate to now and not face a serious possibility of persecution on the Convention ground of being a woman and a girl.\nCONCLUSION\n[14] For these reasons, I find the claimants are Convention refugees under section 96 of the Act and I accept their claims.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n",

The spouse provided no objection to this appointment. The designated representative was provided with the opportunity to testify about any risks faced by the minor claimant in India.\n[4] In conducting the hearing and rendering these reasons, I have considered and applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 4 which offers guidance on the gender-specific aspects of this claim.[iii] I have applied this guideline when offering procedural accommodations for sensitive testimony, in not questioning the spouse regarding details of the sexual assault she faced, and in assessing the spouse\u2019s limited testimony. The minor claimant did not attend the hearing. The claimants agreed to inform me if they wished, at any point, to testify without the presence of their child, the associate claimant; the claimants did not inform me at any point of the hearing that they desired this accommodation, and the associate claimant was present throughout the testimonies of all claimants. I have also considered and applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 3 regarding child refugee claimants.[iv] I note that the incidents outlined in the claimants\u2019 allegations are sensitive and occurred when the associate claimant was a child. I therefore considered that, as per this guideline, he may have limited knowledge of the risks facing him and his family in India.\nALLEGATIONS\n[5] The full allegations are set out in the claimants\u2019 BOC forms.[v] The claimants\u2019 immediate family consists of the principal claimant, who is the husband\/father; the spouse, who is the mother\/wife; the minor claimant; the associate claimant; and two daughters who are not part of their claim for refugee protection. These daughters are named XXXX and XXXX. The spouse, associate, and minor claimants stated that they wished to rely on the narrative provided by the principal claimant, their respective husband and father. In summary, the claimants fear the Punjab police who accused the principal claimant of being associated with militants and the drug mafia, detained and beat him, and detained and sexually assaulted the spouse. The claimants also fear the XXXX XXXX who kidnapped the associate claimant and extorted the claimants.\n[6] The principal claimant was born in West Bengal, but later moved to Bhilai, Chhattisgarh after he finished school, as he had an opportunity to work in XXXX XXXX XXXX and wished to support his family. The claimants lived together with their children in Bhilai, where the principal claimant had a XXXX XXXX. In 2012, the associate claimant was kidnapped by an unknown person claiming to be a member of the XXXX XXXX. The claimants were forced to pay a ransom to have their son released. They knew that they would then be on the XXXXlist of people to extort, so the principal claimant had to close his business and they moved to XXXX in Punjab in 2013.\n[7] The principal claimant joined his son-in-law, XXXX XXXX XXXX (his daughter XXXX husband) XXXX XXXX XXXX. In XXXX 2016, the principal claimant and a driver from XXXX XXXX were stopped by the police. He was questioned about drugs, the police beat him, and they took him to an unknown location where he was kept for two days, beaten, and questioned about XXXX who was accused of being involved in the drug mafia. While he was detained, his house was searched, and the spouse was mistreated. His family paid a bribe for his release with the assistance of the village council, and his fingerprints, photos, and signature were taken by police. Police continued to harass him and his family. He and the spouse were detained in XXXX 2016. They were separated at the station; the principal claimant was beaten, questioned, and kept for two days, while the spouse was beaten, sexually assaulted, and released the next day. He was told to report to police every month and to bring XXXX. The claimants soon went to live with relatives in Chandigarh.\n[8] In Chandigarh, the claimants hired an agent to help them get their visas and tickets to Canada. The police continued looking for them, beat the principal claimant\u2019s mother in Chhattisgarh, and raided their relatives\u2019 home in Chandigarh. The claimants arrived in Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2017. The police continued to look for them after they arrived in Canada. While in Canada, the claimants extended their visitor visas, and claimed refugee protection in XXXX 2018.\nDETERMINATION\n[9] I find that the claimants are Convention refugees as per s. 96 of IRPA, as they have each established a serious possibility of persecution if they were to return to India.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[10] I find that the identities of the claimants as nationals of India have been established through their testimonies and the copies of their passports in evidence, which contain Canadian visas.[vi]\nNexus\n[11] I find that the allegations establish a nexus to a convention ground for each claimant. The principal claimant has a nexus to an imputed political opinion, as the Punjab police have accused him of supporting pro-Khalistan militant groups. The spouse, associate, and minor claimants have a nexus to a particular social group, specifically that of a family member, as their risk arises from their association to the principal claimant and the allegations made against him. Further, the allegations and profiles of the spouse and minor daughter relating to their gender speak to a nexus of particular social group by way of them being women. For these reasons, all claims will be analyzed under s. 96 of IRPA.\nCredibility\n[12] A claimant\u2019s sworn testimony is presumed truthful unless there are reasons to doubt the veracity of their allegations.[vii] In this case, the claimants\u2019 testimony appeared emotional and genuine. However, the spouse had difficulty testifying at times, and the principal claimant and spouse often required redirecting back to the question at hand. The associate claimant\u2019s testimony was more straightforward, and he provided testimony regarding the incidents that he directly experienced in the past. Despite lacking knowledge of details regarding his forward-facing risk from police, I find that the associate claimant\u2019s testimony corroborated aspects of the principal claimant and spouse\u2019s testimony. I also find his limited knowledge of the risk he faces from police to be reasonable given the considerations outlined in the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 3. The principal claimant also spoke of the personal risk to the minor claimant in India. The claimants\u2019 testimonies were generally consistent with the information provided in their BOC forms and narrative, aside from that outlined below, and I find that sufficient explanations were provided for all material inconsistencies and omissions.\nRisk from the XXXX XXXX\n[13] I find the allegations that the principal claimant was raised in a region where XXXX XXXX were active to be credible, as he was raised in West Bengal and later moved to Chhattisgarh. The country documentation in the Indian NDP confirms that XXXX groups are active in these regions of India.[viii] I find that the principal claimant was raised with fear of these groups. I also find the allegation that the associate claimant was kidnapped by a XXXX XXXX as a young child to be credible. I find that the claimants moved to the Punjab region due to extortion and threats from the XXXX XXXX that kidnapped the associate claimant. However, I find that the claimants failed to credibly establish that a forward-facing risk from the XXXX XXXX exists for any of the claimants, as none of them have heard from a member of this group since sometime in 2013 when they moved to Punjab and the principal claimant changed his phone number. The principal claimant also testified that while they were living in Punjab, they did not experience any problems from the XXXX XXXX. The principal and associate claimants testified that they had a future risk from this group; however, they stated that their fear arises from the fact that XXXX XXXXare active in cities where they kidnap individuals for ransom and that they are a powerful terrorist group. They did not testify to any threat since 2013 or any individual, forward-facing risk to any of the claimants from a particular XXXX XXXX. While the principal claimant testified that these XXXX XXXXoperate in somewhere between 9-12 provinces in India,[ix] and the NDP documentation confirms that they operated as of 2016 in 11 states within India, the claimants have failed to establish with sufficient credible evidence that any member of a XXXX XXXXhas continued to pursue them for the past 9 years or that they would come to the attention of a member of the XXXX XXXXin any part of India if they were to return. Consequently, I find that the claimants\u2019 forward-facing risk is that arising from the Punjab police as discussed below.\nRisk from Punjab police\n[14] The principal claimant testified that he felt responsible and that he was unable to protect his family from the police and the suffering they experienced. He stated that he feared he would be detained again upon returning to India and sentenced to many years in prison, leaving his wife and children unable to survive. He stated that that when the claimants first moved to Punjab, they had a peaceful life for three years, despite struggling with the language, as they spoke Hindi, not Punjabi. He stated that when he was first arrested, the police stopped his truck and accused him of drug trafficking and involvement with the drug mafia and ex-militants, and that his son-in-law XXXX, who was his business partner in his XXXX XXXX, was also involved in the same work. He stated that he struggled to understand the police\u2019s words and answer their questions due to the language barrier, but he repeatedly heard the term \u201cKhalistan\u201d, leading him to believe he was accused of working with pro-Khalistan militants. He stated that he had never been involved in or had any interest in being involved in any of the activities or ideologies he was accused of, and no person in his immediate family was involved in these activities either. He stated that he knew XXXX was involved with the SAD-B political party, but he did not know anything about his activity with this group. He also stated that XXXX father used drugs and was likely involved in some of the alleged activities, as he was arrested multiple times and put in jail. The principal claimant stated that his relationship with this man never developed due to his drug use. The principal claimant testified to the beatings he, and his wife during the second arrest, suffered from police and details of their experience when detained, along with the trauma he experiences when thinking about those events.\n[15] The spouse also testified to the long-term effects of the beatings from the police, including an impact on her ability to work due to an injury in her hand that was worsened from these beatings. She stated that the police arrested her because she was questioning why they were beating her husband, and that when she was detained, she did not understand them, as they were speaking Punjabi, but that she repeatedly heard the word \u201cdrug\u201d. She stated that after she was sexually assaulted by police, she was fearful of telling anyone, and the only person that she told was her husband. She stated that when she sought medical attention, it was her husband only who spoke with the doctor, and she did not tell the doctor about this sexual assault.\n[16] I find that the claimants\u2019 testimonies establish, on a balance of probabilities, that the principal claimant was accused by the Punjab police of involvement in drug trafficking and supporting militants in their fight for Khalistan, and that he was not politically or criminally involved in any of these activities. I also find, on a balance of probabilities, that both the principal claimant and the spouse were detained, assaulted, and questioned in relation to these accusations.\nDocuments\n[17] I find that the claimants\u2019 allegations are corroborated by the following documents that they provided at exhibits 4, 5, 7, and 8:\n\nAn affidavit from the claimants\u2019 host in Chandigarh stating that they lived with her for two months in 2016, that the claimants told her about their circumstances, that the spouse was depressed, and that after they had moved, the police came to her residence looking for the claimantsAn affidavit from the principal claimant and spouse\u2019s daughter XXXX, who continues to live in India, stating that her father was illegally detained in 2016, that she tried to get him out of detention on her own but could not, and that she sought the assistance of the village sarpanch to get him released. She also stated that both of her parents were detained in October 2016, and afterwards her parents lost their reputation in the village, and it was hard for her siblings at school. She confirms the claimants then went to ChandigarhMultiple treatment reports and prescriptions from the principal claimant and spouse\u2019s treatments at the hospital following their detentions, along with individual letters for each of those claimants from the medical doctor who treated them confirming the treatment that he gave themI find no reason to doubt the genuine nature of these documents and give them significant weight in establishing that the claimants were illegally detained by police, physically harmed, received medical treatment, went to live in Chandigarh, and that police have continued to search for them after they left. The claimants also provided documentation relating to the principal claimant\u2019s XXXX XXXX in Chhattisgarh and his XXXX XXXX XXXX in Punjab;[x] I give these documents significant weight and find that they, along with the claimants\u2019 testimonies, establish that the principal claimant owned a XXXX XXXX in Chhattisgarh and a XXXX XXXX XXXX in Punjab.\nDelay in claiming\n[18] I note that the claimants arrived in Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2017 and stated that they renewed their visitor visas when they expired. They signed their Basis of Claim forms on May 8, 2018 and their claims were referred to the RPD on May 15, 2018. I asked the principal claimant why they did not claim refugee protection for the first nine months that they were in Canada, and he stated that as they had come with their daughter XXXX and her husband XXXXto Canada, they thought that they would receive assistance from them to establish themselves in Canada. Due to a falling out with XXXX, the claimants stopped talking to XXXX and XXXXand did not receive assistance from them. After this, the principal claimant stated that he shared the problems they were facing in India with others at the temple in Toronto, and he was told that he could claim refugee protection if he went to Montreal. The claimants then moved to Montreal and claimed protection. The spouse and associate claimants did not add further testimony regarding their delay in claiming. I find this explanation to be reasonable, as their delay of nine months is a reasonable amount of time for the claimants to have had their expectations of family support fall apart, to tell others about their problems, to resettle in Montreal, and to have found a lawyer to complete their claim. I, therefore, do not draw a negative inference about their credibility from their delay in claiming protection once they arrived in Canada.\n[19] Overall, I find the claimants to be credible witnesses regarding the allegations I have accepted above. Based on the totality of the evidence before me, I find that, on a balance of probabilities, the claimants have established the abovementioned personal facts alleged in their claims.\nObjective Basis\n[20] The objective evidence supports the claimants\u2019 fear of returning to India.\n[21] According to the objective evidence in the National Documentation Package (NDP) for India,[xi] last updated June 30, 2022, significant human rights abuses exist in the country including extrajudicial killings perpetrated by police; torture and cases of cruel, inhumane, or degrading treatment or punishment by some police and prison officials; arbitrary arrest and detention by government authorities; harsh and life-threatening prison conditions; the detention of political prisoners; lack of investigation into and accountability for violence against women; and widespread corruption at all levels in the government.[xii] The report also states that: \u201c[d]espite government efforts to address abuses, a lack of accountability for official misconduct persisted at all levels of government, contributing to widespread impunity.\u201d[xiii] A 2022 Human Rights Watch report at item 2.3 states that \u201callegations of torture and extrajudicial killings persisted with the National Human Rights Commission registering 143 deaths in police custody and 104 alleged extrajudicial killings in the first nine months in 2021.\u201d Further, this report states that the BJP \u201cgovernment\u2019s \u2018zero tolerance policy\u2019 on crime led to an increase in police killings\u201d and that \u201cthe authorities continued to use section 197 of the Criminal Procedure Code, which requires government approval to prosecute police officials, to block accountability even in cases of serious abuses\u201d.[xiv] Item 9.9. indicates that although India has strict laws and procedures to protect against police torture and ensure accountability, it is \u201cvery difficult\u201d to produce evidence against the police in cases of custodial crimes.[xv]\n[22] A 2018 report at item 10.8 on encounter killings describes the timeline of how they typically occur. The report states that:\n\u201cIn overwhelming majority of cases, the victims of fake encounter deaths are first targeted either as insurgent\/terrorist, sympathiser or supporter of insurgents\/ terrorists or as wanted criminals with bounty on their heads. The targets are detained or taken into custody, interrogated, and tortured to extract confession or leads, and thereafter, killed in a staged encounter, often by planting a weapon on the persons killed to show the firing in self defense or to prevent fleeing. Fake encounters are also carried out for revenge, settle rivalries or disputes, not giving bribe, promotion or gallantry awards or simply trigger-happy nature of the law enforcement personnel.\u201d[xvi]\nThe history of the principal claimant\u2019s interaction with the Punjab police largely follows this common structure. The principal claimant testified that after his first detention, he was forced to continue monthly reporting to the police, and after some time he was given the option to pay a bribe to stop reporting, which he did. After his second detention, he was told to continue his monthly reporting, to which he did not ever comply. Given the claimants\u2019 history with police and the country evidence above, I find that there is a reasonable chance that if the principal claimant returned to India, he would face persecution by the Punjab police, not only through his risk of further detention based on his imputed political opinion, but also through risk of a staged encounter killing from police due to revenge or a failure to provide a bribe for him to be able to stop reporting to police, which was a condition of his release when arrested for his political opinion.\n[23] With respect to gender-based violence, a 2019 OECD report at item 5.6 states that \u201cwomen in India face many barriers to their safety and protection from physical, sexual and psychological violence. Rape, domestic violence, dowry-related deaths, honor killings and sexual harassment pose serious threats to women\u2019s physical integrity in Indian society.\u201d[xvii] Sexual violence including rape is \u201cwidespread across the country\u201d in public and private spaces, and women are seen as vulnerable and \u201ceasy targets.\u201d[xviii] Rape by police officers is \u201cwidespread and conducted with impunity.\u201d[xix] NGOs stated that the number of rapes committed in police custody was underestimated, and \u201csome rape victims were unwilling to report crimes due to social stigma and the possibility of retribution, compounded by a perception of a lack of oversight and accountability, especially if the perpetrator was a police officer or other official.\u201d[xx] Further, this report confirms that \u201crape is\u2026underreported in India largely because of social stigma, victim-blaming, poor response by the criminal justice system, and lack of any national victim and witness protection law making them highly vulnerable to pressure from the accused as well as the police\u201d.[xxi] Survivors of rape are frequently blamed by the community and by authorities for the attack, and suffer shame and stigmatization as a result.[xxii] Thus, not only is the spouse at risk of further gender-based violence from police, as she experienced previously, she is at risk of suffering from the stigma and its affect that would follow her within Indian society.\n[24] While the claimants testified that they were unaware of any formal charges laid against them, the principal claimant testified that on both occasions of arrests, the police took his fingerprints, photographs, and signatures. The claimants also testified that they were in a high stress state after receiving beatings and being abused by police. The associate claimant, when asked if she saw the police enter any information about her in their digital system, stated that she did not see anything because she was scared and afraid and when they started beating her, her attention did not go anywhere else. When asked the same question, the principal claimant stated that the purpose of the Punjab police was to beat him, take money from him and make him scared, and that he kept requesting that they provide him with the evidence that they had against him, but they refused. Counsel submitted that with the signatures, fingerprints, and photographs the police took, they would be able to lay false charges against the claimants. In the claimants\u2019 documentary evidence at exhibit 7 there is an article from The Hindu stating that FIRs may be lodged or criminal proceedings may be initiated without a police diary entry\u2014essentially, without a corresponding entry of a civilian complaint or any information regarding the arrest of an individual. While I find that predicting the police\u2019s capacity or willingness to lay future false charges against the claimants is speculative, I have also considered the following findings: the allegations made against the claimants by police; the extensive documentary evidence regarding high levels of police corruption throughout India;[xxiii] that the police took the abovementioned claimant\u2019s fingerprints, photographs, and signatures; that the principal claimant was forced to continue reporting to the police station; that the police were monitoring either the claimants, their home, or their family members; and that the police were able to track the claimants to Chandigarh through unknown means. In light of these findings, I further find that the Punjab police, on a balance of probabilities, created an FIR against the principal claimant, after which the objective evidence at NDP item 10.2 indicates that his information would be entered into the national CCTNS database.[xxiv]\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution\n[25] The evidence presented in the associate claimant\u2019s testimony and the documentary evidence is less clear regarding the associate and minor claimants\u2019 forward-facing persecution from the Punjab police. Additionally, I previously found that there was insufficient credible evidence to establish that the XXXX XXXX presented a forward-facing motivation to find the associate claimant or to target any of the claimants for further extortion. The associate and minor claimants\u2019 BOC forms indicated that they wished to rely on the narrative and allegations outlined by their father, the principal claimant. The spouse and principal claimants testified that they feared the arrest, beatings, false allegations, and questioning that happened to them by the Punjab police would also happen to their children if they returned to India. They also testified that the minor claimant, if she were to become a victim of the police, would face the additional risk of gender-based violence at the hands of police.\n[26] The associate claimant testified that he had never received a direct threat from police, but he had witnessed the police coming to his home many times and saying abusive words to his parents. His knowledge of why the police had accused his parents of crimes, their arrest, and release was limited. I find that with respect to Guideline 3 this level of knowledge is in keeping with his profile, as he was 12 years old when these events occurred. I find that as the associate claimant is now an adult and his claim is based on a nexus to a particular social group by way of his association to the principal claimant, it is reasonable to conclude that his mother and the Punjab police\u2019s treatment of her as a result of her relationship to the principal claimant are reflective of a similarly situated person to the associate claimant. The Punjab police had no evidence against the spouse and the claimants testified that the police did not make any criminal allegations against her. Yet, they detained, beat, and sexually assaulted her merely due to her association with the principal claimant. Additionally, the claimants\u2019 allegations stated that the police were monitoring them and accused the principal claimant of involvement with drugs and militancy due to his association with his son-in-law. Similarly, I found the claimants\u2019 allegation that the police beat and questioned the principal claimant\u2019s mother to be credible. In light of these findings, I find that the associate and minor claimants in their current circumstances would reasonably be at risk of similar treatment by the Punjab police as that previously experienced by their mother, father, and grandmother. I also find that as the minor claimant is a woman, her risk if she were detained or questioned by police includes a risk of sexual violence, similar to that experienced by her mother. I, therefore, find that these claimants have established a well-founded fear of persecution.\n[27] Based on the totality of the evidence, I find that all the claimants have established a well-founded fear of persecution or forward-facing risk if they were to return to India. This finding is made based on all the evidence before me, including the claimants\u2019 testimony that the Punjab police have continued to search for them, as well as the objective evidence regarding police corruption, abuse, and treatment of those accused of involvement with drugs and militants in India.\nState Protection\n[28] The state is presumed capable of protecting its citizens except in situations where the state is in complete breakdown. To rebut this presumption, a claimant must establish on a balance of probabilities through clear and convincing evidence that their state\u2019s protection is inadequate. I find that the claimants have rebutted this presumption.\n[29] The agent of persecution in this claim is an agent of the state. The US Department of State report describes India as a parliamentary democracy where civilian authorities maintained effective control over security forces.[xxv] This report also indicates widespread corruption at all levels in the Indian government and extrajudicial killings and degrading treatment or punishment perpetrated by the police.[xxvi] A 2022 Freedom House report gives India a score of 2 out of 4 for both due process and protection against illegitimate use of force.[xxvii] The report indicates that due process rights are not consistently upheld, and corruption and bribery within the police remains a problem. The report also indicates that torture, abuse, and rape by law enforcement and security officials have been reported.[xxviii]\n[30] NDP item 10.12 indicates that the state of Punjab has a Vigilance department, a Police Complaints Authority, and a Human Rights Commission that are responsible for anti-corruption measures. Sources in the RIR indicate concerns with the adequacy of the various organizations. For example, the Human Rights Commission was described as having little credibility and being more or less defunct due to lack of proper infrastructure and staff to handle the complaints and notes that most of the complaints are against the Punjab police. Similarly, the report states that the Police Complaints Authority in 2017 disposed of 52 complaints against the police and that in all closed complaints no police officer was found at fault.[xxix]\n[31] The claimants did testify to the fact that their daughter XXXX, who remained in India, successfully sought police protection when she made a complaint after the police harassed her for information about the claimants. I asked the principal claimant why he had not complained about police if there were effective systems for police complaints in India, and he stated that the police had taken his fingerprints, signature, and photos along with accusing him of involvement with militants and drug traffickers; on the other hand, his daughter was not accused of anything, lived independently from the claimants, and the police had no documentation or evidence against her. Consequently, the particulars of her situation were different from those of the claimants, and given the actions the police had taken against them, he did not feel safe making a complaint about police. I find this explanation to be reasonable in the claimants\u2019 particular circumstances. Based on the country conditions noted above regarding evidence of widespread corruption, lack of adequate police oversight, and that an agent of harm is the Punjab police, I find that there is no operationally effective state protection available to the claimants in their circumstances.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[32] There is a two-part test to determine whether an internal flight alternative (IFA) exists. I must be satisfied (a) that there is no serious possibility of the claimant being persecuted on a Convention ground, or, on the balance of probabilities, being subject personally to a danger of torture or to a risk to their life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in the IFA and (b) that conditions in that part of the country, are such that it would be reasonable, in all the circumstances, including those particular to the claimant, for them to seek refuge there. Once an IFA is raised, the onus is on the claimants to show that they do not have an IFA. At the outset of the hearing, I proposed Mumbai and Bengaluru as potential IFAs. For the reasons below, I find that the claimants do not have an IFA available to them.\nMotivation\n[33] The principal claimant testified that after his first arrest, the second arrest occurred months later at the time that XXXXcame to visit their home. Counsel submits that this demonstrates that the police were monitoring the claimants\u2019 home. I find that the police entered the claimants\u2019 home and arrested the principal claimant and spouse on this occasion due to their monitoring of either the claimants\u2019 home or the claimants themselves or their close family members, including their son-in-law. Regardless of whether the police were monitoring the claimants, their home, or their family members, I find that this demonstrates that the Punjab police had a significant interest and motivation in tracking the claimants and their family. The principal claimant testified that after they left to Chandigarh, which he testified was 80 kms away from their village, the local police who had arrested them continued looking for them. I found that the claimants previously established this fact, including that the police raided the home of the individual they initially stayed with in Chandigarh after the claimants had left to stay in the Gurdwara. Further, I find that the claimants established that the police questioned and beat the principal claimant\u2019s mother, who lived in Chhattisgarh, when they came looking for the principal claimant. The principal claimant also testified that a friend who they continue to communicate with informed them that as recently as six weeks ago the police continued to look for them in their local village. I find this to be credible. The principal claimant stated that with the formation of a new government, the police are looking for them more diligently, as the police wish to close their open cases. An article published in the RF Issue Brief at exhibit 6 speaks to the increased war on drugs and crime arising from the region\u2019s current leadership since 2019. I find this testimony to be credible as there is no reason to doubt its veracity and it is objectively corroborated.\n[34] While I acknowledge that the claimants did not testify to having relatives in the proposed IFA locations of Mumbai or Bengaluru, I find that the Punjab police\u2019s efforts to locate the claimants through their relatives in multiple provinces in India is indicative of their desire to use the resources available to them to find the claimants throughout India, including Mumbai and Bengaluru if the claimants were to relocate there. As the Federal Court has established, \u201cthere is no onus on a claimant to personally test the viability of an IFA before seeking protection in Canada.\u201d[xxx] Thus, I find that the fact that the claimants did not previously attempt to live in Mumbai or Bengaluru, and consequently do not allege that the Punjab police attempted to find them in Mumbai or Bengaluru, is not indicative of the police\u2019s forward-facing motivation to find them in these IFA locations. I find that the fact that the police searched for the claimants while they were in India only through their previously known locations and family members does not place restrictions on where the Punjab police would be motivated to find the claimants if they were to return to India. Rather, I find that the efforts made to search for them in multiple locations, including multiple provinces, speaks to a high level of motivation to find the principal claimant and spouse throughout India.\n[35] The principal claimant also testified that the police harassed his daughter XXXX who remains living in India while asking for information about the claimants\u2019 whereabouts, but she then filed a complaint against the police, and they stopped bothering her. However, he later testified that the police continued coming to visit her home roughly every two weeks. I asked the principal claimant why he stated previously that the police no longer harassed his daughter after she effectively filed a complaint against them, and he stated that after she married, they believed that they could defame her and their family name, so they continued visiting her and asking questions about the claimants. I find that that this explanation does not reasonably explain the discrepancy in the principal claimant\u2019s testimony on this fact, and that the claimants failed to establish with credible evidence that the police continue to visit their daughter XXXX in India to ask about them. However, the totality of the evidence establishing the principal claimant and spouse\u2019s allegations that the Punjab police continue to look for them with other relatives in other cities and within their local village outweighs the insufficient, inconsistent evidence in establishing that the police continued to visit their daughter in India to ask about them. Consequently, I find that the documentary evidence and findings made regarding the police\u2019s attempt to locate the principal claimant and spouse in various locations throughout India, including their local village in Punjab, Chandigarh, and Chhattisgarh, establishes that the police remain motivated to find these claimants.\n[36] The associate claimant testified that he had not yet completed secondary school and continued to study. The minor claimant is also currently a student. The principal claimant and spouse testified to the fact that they would not be living apart from their children if they were to return to India, as both the associate and minor claimants remain dependent upon their parents. Consequently, I find that as I found the police remain motivated to find the principal claimant and spouse, and the associate and minor claimant would be living with the principal claimant and spouse, the associate and minor claimant would also be at risk of detention and mistreatment by police if they were to be found by police due to their association with their father. Further, the minor claimant\u2019s risk if her parents were arrested would increase from her profile as a young, vulnerable, single woman, which the Indian NDP largely demonstrates is a high-risk profile in India,[xxxi] and it would be unreasonable to expect her to live in India in these circumstances. Therefore, I find that while the police may not have expressed motivation to find the associate and minor claimants until today, their association with their parents\u2014the principal claimant and spouse\u2014makes them similarly at risk from the Punjab police if their parents were to be found, for which I find that the Punjab police have demonstrated motivation.\nMeans\n[37] The principal claimant testified that he no longer has an Indian national identity document (ID), that he could not rent accommodation in Bengaluru, Mumbai, or anywhere in India without this ID, that he could not find employment without this ID, and that he is unwilling to obtain a new identity document because the process of doing so would bring their location to the attention of the local Punjab police who are searching for them. The spouse and associate claimant stated that they agreed with his testimony and did not have anything further to add. Similarly, counsel submitted that the Punjab police would be able to locate the claimants when they went to rent accommodation through the tenant verification system using CCTNS. As I previously found that an FIR against the principal claimant was, on a balance of probabilities, created by the Punjab police and his information was consequently entered into a national database, I find that there is a reasonable chance the police would use this national database to find the claimants. The claimants also provided an extensive amount of documentary evidence regarding the rapidly expanding use of surveillance cameras throughout India, including information that Delhi, Chennai, and Mumbai are within the top 10 cities with the most surveillance in the world and that India is a policing superpower.[xxxii]\n[38] NDP item 10.13, indicates that India established the CCTNS system to connect the thousands of police stations across India for the purpose of collecting and sharing information on crime and criminals. The RIR quotes a source indicating that as of October 2020, 15,620 of the 16,098 police stations have had the CCTNS system deployed. The report also indicates that 81 percent of data for police stations is synced with the CCTNS system on the same day and that 91 percent of old information has been migrated to the system. The RIR also indicates that Punjab is listed as one of the top three states with most access to the CCTNS system. As of December 2020, police and law enforcement agencies across India can search details of any case registered. The DFAT report at item 1.5 indicates that \u201cif a person of interest is being sought by another state, the states would work together in securing the arrest of that person\u201d and that \u201cthere is a good degree of cooperation between state police services\u201d.\n[39] Additionally, item 10.13 states that one of the uses of the CCTNS system is with respect to the verification of tenants. The report notes that the state of Punjab is one of the states that often replies promptly to tenant verification requests.[xxxiii] Item 14.8 describes how the tenant registration process is being used with the CCTNS system to verify whether the person had any criminal involvement or is absconding from the police in another state in India.\n[40] As I previously found, the Punjab police have tried to locate the claimants through their associates and family in India\u2014in the village where the claimants used to reside in Punjab, in Chandigarh, and in the province of Chhattisgarh, where the principal claimant\u2019s family lives. The police were able to successfully track the claimants\u2019 location when they were in Chandigarh, along with contacting their family members in another province. It is well established in the Federal Court that a claimant does not have to cut themselves off from their family in order to live safely in an IFA.[xxxiv] Given the efforts of the Punjab police, I find that if the claimants were to return to India and stay in contact with their family, that there is a serious possibility that the Punjab police may be able to locate the claimants through both their family members and the surveillance systems throughout the country, including the CCTNS. For the abovementioned reasons, I find that the Punjab police have the means to locate the claimants throughout India.\n[41] Given the country condition documents indicating the widespread use of the CCTNS and surveillance systems, the corruption previously noted within the police in India, the continuing motivation to locate the claimants demonstrated by the Punjab police, including through the claimants\u2019 family, I find that the claimants would face a serious possibility of persecution in Mumbai, Bengaluru, and throughout India.\n[42] Since I have found that the claimants face a serious possibility of persecution in the proposed IFA locations and throughout India, I find it unnecessary to consider whether it would be objectively reasonable under the second prong. As such, I find that the claimants do not have a viable IFA.\nCONCLUSION\n[43] I find that the claimants are Convention refugees and accept their claims.\n(signed) Kylee Carreno\nDecember 13, 2022\n\n[i] Immigration and Refugee Protection Act,S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n[ii] Refugee Protection Division Rules, SOR\/2012-256.\n\n[iii] Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (IRB) Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 4: Gender Considerations in Proceedings before the Immigration and Refugee Board, updated July 18, 2022.\n\n[iv] Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (IRB) Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 3: Child Refugee Claimants: Procedural and Evidentiary Issues, effective September 30, 1996.\n\n[v] Exhibit 2.\n\n[vi] Exhibit 1.\n\n[vii] Maldonado v.

Sherritt\nCountry: Lebanon\nRPD Number: VC2-05006\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2022-01960\nATIP Pages: N\/A\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: This is the decision of the Refugee Protection Division in the claim of XXXX XXXX, a Lebanese national claiming protection in Canada pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] The claimant\u2019s allegations are contained in full in his Basis of Claim Form, his detailed narratives, and testimony at the hearing.\n[3] Summarized only briefly, the claimant alleges he faces persecution in Lebanon from Hezbollah due to his refusal to join or support the organization and the threats he faced from the organization as a result.\nDETERMINATION\n[4] I find the claimant is a Convention refugee. I find the claimant has established a nexus to the Convention ground of political opinion. I have, therefore, assessed this claim under section 96 of the Act.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[5] I find the claimant\u2019s identity is established on a balance of probabilities by his testimony and by the other evidence before me, which includes copies of his passports in Exhibit 1.\nCredibility\n[6] The claimant benefits from a presumption that his allegations are true. I found the claimant to be a credible witness today and I have no reason to doubt the claimant\u2019s truthfulness.\n[7] The claimant testified in a spontaneous, forthcoming, and detailed manner. The claimant did not embellish his claim. I identified no relevant inconsistencies, omissions, or contradictions between his testimony and the other evidence before me.\n[8] The claimant also provided documentary evidence that supports and corroborates various aspects of his claim. These documents can be found in Exhibits 4 and 5. This includes education and employment letters, including for employment in the UAE, and corroborating the cancellation of his work and status in that country, and numerous detailed supporting letters corroborating the claimant\u2019s allegations of harm. I have no reason to doubt the authenticity of any of these documents. I assign these documents weight as they help establish the material elements of the claimant\u2019s allegations.\n[9] I will just note that the claimant did reside in the UAE for a significant period of time and I have considered whether he has ever had status or access to status in the UAE that would be comparable to that of citizens of permanent residents of that country. I find he has not. The claimant was in the UAE on a work permit and his status was contingent on his employment. He has since lost his employment and his status has expired. While I note his wife remains in the UAE and is working, she, too, is a Lebanese national and in the UAE on temporary status of her own. I find the claimant\u2019s status, real or potential, has been at all times temporary and subject to cancellation.\n[10] Ultimately, I find the claimant has established that he has been and continues to be pursued by the Hezbollah in Lebanon. I find the claimant has established his subjective fears on a balance of probabilities.\nObjective basis\n[11] There is documentary evidence before me that supports the claimant\u2019s fears of persecution from Hezbollah in Lebanon, all of which can be found in the National Documentation Package (NDP) in Exhibit 3. I will go through a few.\n[12] According to Item 1.3 of the NDP for Lebanon, Hezbollah is a prominent political party and powerful player in Lebanon\u2019s economy, politics, and media. The armed component of Hezbollah is the most significant and heavily armed Lebanese militia. This document states that Hezbollah has the effective control over parts of South Lebanon, Southern Beirut, and The Beqaa Valley.\n[13] According to Item 7.9, Hezbollah is a Shia political and militant organization in Lebanon that has evolved from being a militant group fighting against Israel to an established political party in Lebanon with active political and military wings.\n[14] Also according to Item 7.9 of the NDP, Hezbollah has been deemed a terrorist group by the Canadian government and according to Item 7.8 Hezbollah is considered the most powerful force in Lebanon\u2019s parliament. Hezbollah maintains an excessive network of social services throughout Lebanon to build popular support. There are multiple articles regarding a number of people who have been targeted throughout 2019.\n[15] Item 1.3 of the NDP states that Hezbollah starts with societal pressure or persuasion and then moves to social marginalization and eventually resorting to direct threats and violence if they feel their power is genuinely threatened. Further, in areas under Hezbollah\u2019s control they are a defective government and Lebanese government are unable to enforce law and order. Sources also state that Shia community members, like the claimant, are not able to criticize Hezbollah without fear of consequences such as harassment, intimidation, financial pressure, and exclusion from Hezbollah services like health and education. This can all be found at Items 1.3 and 7.8.\n[16] Ultimately, I find the evidence before me regarding the issues with Hezbollah in Lebanon reasonably applies to the claimant\u2019s situation and establishes the claimant\u2019s allegations. On an objective basis, I find the claimant\u2019s fear of persecution in Lebanon is well-founded and forward-facing.\nState protection and internal flight alternative\n[17] In this case I find the presumption of state protection has been rebutted. There is political interference and bribery in the country which is a noted problem in the documents in the NDP.\n[18] According to Item 9.1 of the NDP, police do not provide adequate protection to those who receive death threats.\n[19] Items 1.3 and 7.8 of the NDP confirm that government forces are unable to enforce the law in areas controlled by Hezbollah.\n[20] The evidence before me in the NDP also confirms that Hezbollah is in part part of the state. Therefore, I find there is no reasonable state protection available to the claimant who continues to be relentlessly pursued and threatened by Hezbollah in Lebanon.\n[21] Further, I have also considered whether there is a viable internal flight alternative for the claimant in Lebanon. Sources in the NDP, including at Items 1.3, 7.8, 2.1, and 7.4, state that individuals identified as being opposed to Hezbollah, like the claimant, are unlikely to avoid societal discrimination through internal relocation. Hezbollah appears to have reached throughout all of Lebanon. Hezbollah uses various methods to obtain information about perceived adversaries, just like the claimant. They have informer networks. They engage in telephone and internet monitoring. Further, sources in the objective evidence state that Hezbollah are able to locate wanted individuals throughout all of Lebanon.\n[22] It is also worth noting at Item 1.3 the airport in Lebanon is located in South Beirut where Hezbollah has significant control and the airport itself is significantly controlled by Hezbollah.\n[23] Therefore, for these reasons noted above, I find there is no viable internal flight alternative for the claimant in all of Lebanon.\nCONCLUSION\n[24] Based on the above analysis, I find the claimant is a Convention refugee. His claim is, therefore, accepted.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n",

        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2022 RLLR 25\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: October 25, 2022\nPanel: David Jones\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): James Hill Lawson\nCountry: Ukraine\nRPD Number: VC2-04081\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2022-01960\nATIP Pages: N\/A\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: So, this is the decision of the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada for the claims of the principal claimant, XXXX XXXX and her husband, the associate claimant, XXXX XXXX who are citizens of Ukraine seeking refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. I have also reviewed and applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline on Gender Considerations and Proceedings Before the Immigration and Refugee Board.\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] The claimants fear a risk to their lives from the Russian army and Russian supporters if they were to return to Ukraine. Principal Claimant is 77 years old, and the associate claimant is 84. The claimants from Dnipro in Ukraine. On February 24th, 2022, Russia began a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The claimants\u2019 town was bombed at the start of the war. The claimants spent most of their time in a bomb shelter. The associate claimant became extremely ill due to the lack of water, food, and medicine. The claimants\u2019 home has been damaged in the conflict. On XXXX XXXX, 2022, the claimants took a refugee train from XXXX XXXX XXXX, Poland. On XXXX XXXX, 2022, the claimants flew to Canada because they have family here in Canada. The claimants both have significant health issues. For example, the principal claimant is taking medication for her high blood pressure and kidney problems. The associate claimant has problems breathing, significant mobility issues and is scheduled to have heart surgery on XXXX XXXX, 2022.\nDETERMINATION\n[3] I find that the claimants are Convention refugees.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[4] The claimants\u2019 identities as citizens of Ukraine has been established on a balance of probabilities by their Ukrainian passports located at Exhibit 1 as well as by their testimony.\nNexus\n[5] The claimants fear persecution from the invading Russian army due to their Ukrainian nationality. Counsel for the claimants provided a sanitized RPD decision from January 30th, 2022 that is located at Exhibit 7. That decision provides for a detailed argument for why the current situation in Ukraine demonstrates that the claimants have a nexus to the Convention ground based on their nationalities. While other RPD decisions are not binding on me, the Federal Court has directed that administrative decisionmakers and reviewing courts alike must be concerned with a general consistency of administrative decisions as those affected by administrative decisions are entitled to expect that like cases will be generally treated alike and that outcomes will not depend merely on the identity of the individual decisionmaker. I do find that the decision at Exhibit 7 is persuasive, and I adopt the reasoning with respect to nexus to the Convention grounds due to the claimants\u2019 Ukrainian nationality. And based on that analysis, I do find that the allegations before me support a nexus to the Convention grounds for the claimants based on their nationality as Ukrainians. In addition, the claimants\u2019 allegations also support a nexus to the Convention ground based on membership in a particular social group as elderly persons with chronic health issues. Further, the principal claimant\u2019s allegations also support a nexus to the Convention grounds based on their membership in a particular social group as a woman.\nCredibility\n[6] I find that the claimants are credible witnesses. In making that finding, I am relying on the principle that a claimant who affirms to tell the truth creates a presumption of truthfulness unless there are reasons to doubt their truthfulness. The principal claimant provided the majority of the testimony, and she was able to testify clearly about their fears of returning to Ukraine. The principal claimant explained their health issues and the associate claimant\u2019s mobility issues and how they have no support or family left in the country. The principal claimant described the mental difficulties she faced when living in the bomb shelter for almost a month and also the physical pain that caused them. The principal claimant described their fears in the Russian army and fascist groups and spoke in details about how their home was invaded, how food and clothing were stolen and how their dog was unfortunately killed. Finally, the claimants testified that their pensions were their only source of income. The associate claimant confirmed the principal claimant\u2019s testimony and also spoke about the risks to him from stress due to his health.\n[7] In addition, the claimant provided personal documents to support their claims, which are found at Exhibits 4 and 9. Personal documents consist of identity documents and documents related to the associate claimant\u2019s health conditions. I have no reason to doubt the genuineness of these documents. I find that given the claimants\u2019 credible testimony, documents and the country condition documents discussed below, that they have established on a balance of probabilities the facts alleged in their claims, including a subjective fear of returning to Ukraine.\nObjective Basis\n[8] The country condition documents for Ukraine in the National Documentation Package, which is found at Exhibit 3, supports the claimants\u2019 fears of returning to the country. For example, a report from May 2022 at Item 1.13 called an Independent Legal Analysis of the Russian Federation\u2019s Breaches of the Genocide Convention in Ukraine and the Duty to Prevent states that \u201c(1), reasonable grounds to believe Russia is responsible for direct and public incitement to commit genocide, and a pattern of atrocities from which an inference of intent to destroy the Ukrainian national group in part can be drawn and (2), the existence of a serious risk of genocide in Ukraine, triggering the legal obligation of all States to prevent genocide.\u201d The report provides examples of what I described says \u201cgenocidal pattern of destruction targeting Ukrainians\u201d. Those examples include mass killings, deliberate attacks on shelters and humanitarian routes, deliberate inflicting life-threatening conditions by targeting vital infrastructure, indiscriminate bombardment of residential areas, rape and sexual violence and the forcible transfer of Ukrainians.\n[9] With respect to gender-based violence, I find that the country condition documents indicate that the principal claimant would face an increased risk due to her gender. This finding is supported by an April 2022 report on sexual violence and the Ukraine conflict at Item 5.3 that states that since the Russian invasion in February 2022, there have been numerous reports of Russian soldiers sexually assaulting women. The report indicates that Russian soldiers have been deliberately targeting women and children after Ukraine did not surrender. In addition, there are reports that women including senior citizens were gangraped and, in some instances, killed. These reports of gender-based violence are also found in other parts of the National Documentation Package such as a Human Rights Watch report from April 3rd, 2022, which is found at Item 1.24 and the May 2022 CARE International Report at Item 5.6.\n[10] With respect to the claimants\u2019 age and health issues, a recent report in the National Documentation Package at Item 1.30 also indicates that there have been deliberate Russian attacks on health facilities in Ukraine. This report indicates that medical supplies across many parts of Ukraine are running low, especially in conflict-affected areas as access to many locations remain blocked. A report of social security and the war at Item 1.19 indicates that recipients of social security such as the claimants are in a vulnerable position. The report also indicates that Russia has been specifically targeting social infrastructure, particularly social care institutions. Finally, a report from the organization for security and cooperation in Europe, which is found at Item 2.7, indicates that there is evidence that Russian soldiers have targeted older persons intentionally. The report also notes that the destruction of social security system or the impossibility to get access to payment points constitutes a serious threat to the life for those such as the claimants who rely on their pension for income.\n[11] The claimant also provided country condition documents which are found at Exhibits 5 and 6. For example, Exhibit 6 contains nine (9) articles highlighting war crimes committed by Russia since the start of the invasion and reports an article as describing the Russian attacks as genocide against Ukrainians.\n[12] Based on the totality of the evidence, I find that the claimants have established a well-founded fear of persecution. Further, given the ongoing Russian invasion and that the claimants area has been attacked by Russia in the past, I find that the claimants face a serious forward-facing possibility of persecution if they were to return.\nState Protection\n[13] I have considered whether adequate state protection is available for the claimants, and I find that there is none. The claimants fear violence from the invading Russian army. While the Ukrainian state is attempting to provide protection from the Russian attack, there is great uncertainty about the level of protection a state will be able to provide. As such, I find that there is no operationally effective state protection available to the claimants in their circumstances.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[14] I have also considered whether the claimants would have a viable internal flight alternative available to them and I find that they do not. The principal claimant testified that there is nowhere in the country where they could go and be safe and how they have no family or anyone else in Ukraine to support them if they were to return. Given the ongoing crisis in Ukraine related to the Russian invasion that is affecting the entire country, I find it would be unreasonable for the claimants in these circumstances to try to seek refuge elsewhere in the country. This is reflected in the March 2022 UNHCR report on returns to Ukraine, which is found at Item 1.23, that states that \u201cIn view of the volatility of the situation in the entire territory of Ukraine, UNHCR does not consider it appropriate to deny international protection to Ukrainians and former habitual residents of Ukraine on the basis of an internal flight or relocation alternative.\u201d Further, a June 2022 report at Item 1.10 indicates that there are more than eight (8) million internally displaced persons in Ukraine. The report highlights numerous challenges facing the internally displaced persons, including the lack of accommodation, shortages of food, water and energy supplies, and barriers to accessing financial social support and house services. As such, I find that the claimants do not have a viable internal flight alternative available to them.\nCONCLUSION\n[15] For the reasons above, I determine that the claimants are Convention refugees pursuant to section 96 of the Act and the Board, therefore, accepts their claims. Given I am granting protection under section 96 of the Act, I find it unnecessary to consider their claims under section 97.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n",

The claimant intermittently worked as a XXXX XXXX in the United Arab Emirates from 2005 to 2018. During his time in the Emirates, the claimant was issued temporary work visas from his employer, and had no permanent status or residency in the Emirates.\n[4] In XXXX 2015, a violent incident between terrorists and the Punjab police took place in the claimant\u2019s home village. The claimant stated that the police arrested the claimant, who was not involved in the incident, as the police were aware of the claimant\u2019s work history in the Emirates. The claimant stated that since the Emirates is an Islamic nation, the police suspected that the claimant was involved in the attack. In custody, the claimant was beaten and had his fingerprints, photographs, and signatures taken by the police. The claimant was kept in custody for three days and was able to be released after the claimant\u2019s family provided the police with a bribe.\n[5] Following this incident, the claimant returned to Dubai and resumed his work as XXXX XXXX XXXX. In XXXX 2016, the claimant returned to India to visit his family. The claimant indicated that although he returned to India despite the incident in XXXX 2015 as he thought that the incident with the police was an isolated incident, and that the police would have had arrested the individuals responsible for the terrorist attack. The claimant indicated that he thought all suspicion surrounding him would have been cleared at that point.\n[6] However, in XXXX 2016, the claimant was arrested by the police again. The police detained the claimant from his home and made allegations that the claimant was assisting Sikh militants and that he was traveling to Pakistan using fake identity documents. The police further alleged that the claimant was assisting the Sikh militants financially. The police took the claimant\u2019s fingerprints, photographs, and signatures again. The claimant\u2019s family provided the police with another bribe, and the claimant was able to be released. Upon release, the claimant was instructed to report to the police before he travels out of India and again when he returns.\n[7] In XXXX 2016, the claimant returned to the Emirates to resume his employment. When in the Emirates, the claimant began to grow fearful of his eventual return to India as the nature of his employment in the Emirates was temporary. The claimant feared that should his employment be terminated in the Emirates, he would have to return to India as his status in the Emirates was dependent on his employment. The claimant contacted an agent in India, who began to prepare a Canadian visa for the claimant.\n[8] In XXXX 2018, the claimant was informed by his agent that in order to finalize his visa application, he would have to return to India. In the same month, the claimant traveled back to India and provided his agent with his passport, photographs, and payment in order to secure his visa. Upon return, the claimant presented himself at the police station as the police demanded.\n[9] On XXXX XXXX, 2018, the claimant was summoned to the police station. The police instructed the claimant that he will be sent to Pakistan to join a militant group, and to send all information he receives back to the Punjab police. The claimant reported this to the district commissioner in Kapurthala on XXXX XXXX, 2018, who promised the claimant that he would investigate the matter.\n[10] On XXXX XXXX, 2018, the police attended the claimant\u2019s home while the claimant was not present. The police stated that the claimant was making false allegations against them, and proceeded to threaten the claimant\u2019s wife in order to locate the claimant. When the claimant discovered that the police had attended his home, the claimant fled to his uncle\u2019s home in Delhi in order to hide. The claimant also contacted his agent who provided him with other hiding locations within Delhi. Eventually, the claimant fled India in XXXX 2018.\n[11] The claimant indicated that approximately five months after arriving in Canada, he has become a public supporter of Khalistan. The claimant stated that he has participated in pro-Khalistan rallies and referendums since his arrival in Canada.\nDETERMINATION\n[12] I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the Act.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[13] I find that the claimant\u2019s personal identity and his identity as a citizen of India has been established on a balance of probabilities by the claimant\u2019s testimony and a copy of his Indian passport on file.[iii]\nNexus\n[14] For a claimant to be considered a Convention refugee, the well-founded fear of persecution must be by reason of one or more of the five grounds enumerated under section 96 of the IRPA: race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion.\n[15] In this case, I find that the claimant\u2019s allegations establish a nexus to the Convention ground of political opinion, real or imputed, as the police allege that the claimant is affiliated with Khalistani militants. Therefore, I will assess this claim under section 96 of the Act.\nCredibility\n[16] The Federal Court has held in Maldonado that when a claimant swears to the truth of certain allegations, it creates a presumption that those allegations are true unless there is a reason to doubt their truthfulness.[iv] The presumption of truthfulness does not apply to inferences or speculation.\n[17] In this case, I have no reasons to doubt the truthfulness of the claimant. He testified in a straightforward and consistent manner, and answered all questions asked to him spontaneously. He did not appear to exaggerate or embellish his testimony.\n[18] Furthermore, the claimant submitted documentary evidence in support of his claim. The documents form parts of Exhibit 4, and contain the following:\n\nCorroborative affidavits from the claimant\u2019s wife, father, uncle in Delhi, and village decision-maker, all with accompanying identity documents;\nMedical report detailing the nature of the injuries and treatment given to the claimant in November 2015;\nThe claimant\u2019s Khalistan Referendum voter registration card; and\nPhotographs of the claimant during a pro-Khalistan rally and photographs of the claimant\u2019s activities in a Sikh temple in Canada.[19] I have no reasons to doubt the genuineness of these documents and I accept them as genuine. As these documents relate to the central elements of the claimant\u2019s allegations, being that the Punjab police have targeted the claimant by alleging the claimant is affiliated with Khalistani terrorists, I assign significant weight to these documents in establishing the claimant\u2019s allegations as true.\n[20] Based on the claimant\u2019s straightforward testimony coupled with the documentary evidence noted above, I find the claimant to be a credible witness and accept the claimant\u2019s allegations in support of his claim to be true.\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution\n[21] Based on the claimant\u2019s testimony and the objective country conditions evidence as set out in the National Documentation Package (NDP), I find that the claimant has a well-founded fear of persecution from the police in India based on his imputed political opinion.\n[22] The claimant has suffered harm from the police due to his imputed political opinion as the Punjab police falsely alleged that the claimant was affiliated with Khalistani militants. The claimant indicated that these are false allegations, and that he has only begun to support the establishment of Khalistan after his arrival in Canada.\n[23] Country conditions documents in the NDP for India confirms that police corruption is widespread and that the police have broad arrest and detention rights. A report by the UK\u2019s Home Office[v] reports:\nThe USSD HR Report 2017 noted that \u2018Police may detain an individual without charge for up to 30 days, although an arrested person must be brought before a judge within 24 hours of arrest. Lengthy arbitrary detention remained a significant problem due to overburdened and under resourced court systems and a lack of legal safeguards. Arraignment of detainees must occur within 24 hours unless authorities hold the suspect under a preventive detention law.\n[24] A report by the US Department of State[vi] states the following regarding the prevalence of in-custody treatment:\nSignificant human rights issues included: unlawful and arbitrary killings, including extrajudicial killings perpetrated by police; torture and cases of cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment by some police and prison officials; arbitrary arrest and detention by government authorities; harsh and life-threatening prison conditions.\n\u2026 There were reports of abuse in prisons at the hands of guards and inmates, as well as reports that police raped female and male detainees.\n[25] Further, an RIR by the IRB[vii] on the treatment of perceived separatists or Khalistan supporters in and outside of the state of Punjab states the following:\n\u2026 the World Sikh Organization of Canada, an organization promoting the interests of Canadian Sikhs, stated that the \u201cgovernment, civil society and media vilify Sikhs advocating for Khalistan as extremists and militants by default\u201d \u2026 the government is \u201chostile\u201d to separatist movements.\nAccording to sources, the police \u201ckeep track of\u201d or \u201cmonitor\u201d Khalistan supporters\u2026 security services are more likely to focus on Sikh separatists because they represent \u201ca perceived political threat to the unity of India\u201d\u2026 Khalistan activists who participate in activities such as demonstrations, meetings or posting on social media will be monitored\u2026 individuals who move to another city will continue to be tracked since that information will be shared.\nAccording to the WSO representative, \u201csuspected supporters of Khalistan are not safe outside of Punjab, anywhere in India\u201d. The same source added that \u201cno Sikh can openly be an advocate for or support the creation of Khalistan\u201d and doing so results in harassment by police, false cases and also hatred of those who do not support Khalistan\u201d; the government portrays anyone supporting separatism as \u201can extremist or terrorist and as an \u2018anti-national\u2019 that can be legitimately targeted for violence\u201d.\n[26] I find that the claimant is an individual who has been falsely alleged and implicated by the police to be affiliated with extremists due to the claimant\u2019s frequent travel between India and the Emirates. Given the objective evidence listed above, which indicates that police in India act with impunity towards perceived Khalistan supporters, I find that the claimant would face a serious possibility of persecution should he return to India.\nState Protection\n[27] In all refugee claims, the state is presumed to be capable of protecting their citizens unless there is clear and convincing evidence to the contrary. A claimant who alleges that state protection is not available must persuade the Board, on a balance of probabilities, that the state would be unable or unwilling to offer protection.\n[28] Since the state is the agent of persecution in this case, I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant will not be able to access adequate state protection in his home country and that the presumption of state protection has been rebutted. I find that state protection would not be reasonably forthcoming for the claimant as the police are accusing the claimant of collaborating with militants, which resulted in the arrest, detention, and abuse of the claimant.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[29] The question then becomes whether the claimant could find safety in an internal flight alternative (IFA). At the outset of the hearing, I proposed Mumbai and Delhi as possible IFA locations.\n[30] Once the issue of an IFA has been raised, the onus is on the claimant to show that he or she does not have an IFA.[viii] To find a viable IFA, I must be satisfied that there is no serious possibility of the claimants being persecuted or, on the balance of probabilities, being subjected personally to a danger of torture or a risk to life or cruel and unusual punishment in the proposed IFA. Furthermore, the conditions in that part of the country are such that it would be reasonable in all the circumstances, including those particular to the claimants, to seek refuge there.\n[31] I find that the police still have continuing motivation to seek the claimant in India. It is the claimant\u2019s testimony, which I find to be true, that the police continue to visit the claimant\u2019s village and home in search of the claimant. Given the police\u2019s continued efforts to visit the claimant\u2019s home in search of the claimant despite the passage of time from the initial incident in XXXX 2015, I find that the police are still motivated to seek the claimant.\n[32] The question then becomes whether the police would have the means to locate the claimant in India should he return. Based on the objective evidence in the NDP, I find that the police would have the means to locate the claimant in India.\n[33] The objective evidence shows that anyone moving to another part of the country from their regular area of residence will have to undergo a background check when filling out an application for tenancy or lease. According to a Response to Information Request by the IRB,[ix] \u201csources describe tenant registration [or verification] as mandatory\u201d, and that \u201ctenant verification aims to detect criminal background, if any, and maintain a database on people living in a particular area\u201d. The report further states that \u201cthrough police verification, the history of any tenant can be verified whether the person had any criminal involvement or absconding from other states\u2019 police\u201d.\n[34] As part of the background checks used in verifying tenants, Indian authorities have access to a nationwide database known as the Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and Systems (CCTNS), which contains information on crime and criminals, police daily diary and general diary entries, as well as Integrated Investigation Forms (IIF).[x] It also interconnects police stations across the country.\n[35] According to an RIR, 97 percent of India\u2019s police stations are connected to the system. The CCTNS is also deployed in 95 percent of police stations nationwide; 81 percent of the data from police stations across India is synched with the CCTNS on the same day. Punjab, meanwhile, is among the states which report the most access to functioning CCTNS.[xi]\n[36] The claimant indicated that he was never presented with any formal paperwork from the police or has been informed by the police that an FIR has been lodged against him. However, according to an RIR[xii] by the IRB, the police \u201ckeep track of or monitor Khalistan supporters\u201d and that the \u201csecurity forces are more likely to focus on Sikh separatists because they represent a perceived political threat to the unity of India\u201d. The same RIR further mentions that individuals who move to another city will continue to be tracked since that information will be shared.\n[37] According to a researcher who studies digital policing in India, only a portion of the CCTNS records data come from FIRs; in addition, the system also captures the \u201c\u2018daily diary\u2019 or the \u2018general diary\u2019 (an account of the daily functioning of the police station).\u201d[xiii] Given such evidence, I find on a balance of probabilities that the claimant\u2019s encounters with the police in XXXX 2015, XXXX 2016, and XXXX 2018 were recorded as part of the police\u2019s daily or general diary, meaning they have a record of his stay there. As such, I find that it is more likely than not that the claimant\u2019s name would notify Punjab police should the claimant go through the tenant verification process in the proposed IFA locations.\n[38] Given the mandatory nature of tenant verification checks in India, coupled with the fact that personal information of Khalistan supporters, real or imputed, are tracked even to different cities, I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the police in India would have the means to locate the claimant in the proposed IFA cities.\n[39] Ultimately, I find that the IFA test fails on the first prong, and I find that no viable IFA exists for the claimant.\nCONCLUSION\n[40] For the foregoing reasons, I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the Act and I accept his claim.\n(signed) Kevin Kim\nOctober 11, 2022\n\n[i] Immigration and Refugee Protection Act,S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n\n[ii] Exhibit 2.\n\n[iii] Exhibit 1.\n\n[iv] Maldonado v.

His family belongs to the Chamar caste, which is a scheduled caste in India. He met a girl named XXXX at school in 2015 and they began to date. The two kept their relationship a secret because the claimant and his family are from a lower caste than XXXX and her family. The claimant traveled to Canada in XXXX 2017 for school and maintained a long-distance relationship with XXXX. When he returned in XXXX 2017, he decided to surprise XXXX at her workplace, however her brother caught them hugging. XXXX brother and his friends beat the claimant. The next day, the claimant and his mother went to XXXX house to convince her parents to allow the two to marry. Her family verbally and physically abused the claimant and he agreed to stop seeing XXXX.\n[5] On XXXX XXXX, 2017, XXXX came to the claimant\u2019s house alleging that her brother had seen intimate photos of them on her phone and that her family had beaten her. Shortly afterwards, XXXX family and the police arrived. When they discovered the claimant and XXXX together, the claimant was taken into custody. While in custody the police beat the claimant and threatened him to stay away from XXXX and her family. The claimant was released from custody on XXXX XXXX, 2017 after his mother paid a bribe. The claimant returned to Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2017.\n[6] In XXXX 2018, the claimant received a call from his mother stating that the police were looking for him; XXXX had disappeared, and they suspected that he was involved. At the start of the hearing, the claimant submitted a BOC amendment alleging that the police had started to accuse him of being anti-national and had visited his mother and relatives recently in search of him.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[7] I find that the claimant\u2019s identity as a national of India is established on a balance of probabilities by his sworn testimony and the copy of his Indian passport in evidence.[3]\nNexus\n[8] In order to satisfy the definition of a \u201cConvention refugee\u201d found in section 96 of the Act, a claimant must establish that he or she has a well-founded fear of persecution by reason of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion.\n[9] In this case, I find that the claimant\u2019s allegations have a connection to the Convention on the basis of ethnicity, as the claimant is a member of a scheduled caste, as well as political opinion, with relation to the police\u2019s current allegation that the claimant is anti-national. As such, I have assessed his claim pursuant to section 96 of the Act.\nCredibility\n[10] When a claimant affirms to tell the truth, this creates a presumption that his allegations are true unless there is reason to doubt their truthfulness. In this case I have found the claimant to be a credible witness. The claimant testified in a consistent and straightforward manner. While there were some concerns with material portions of his evidence at the outset of the hearing, I find that he was able to provide reasonable explanations for my concerns. I did however find the claimant to be speculative with regards to the reasons for the police\u2019s current search for him and their connection to XXXX and her family. I outline my findings in more detail below:\nSignificant Change to BOC\n[11] At the start of the hearing, the claimant submitted an addendum to his BOC stating that he was now wanted by the police because of allegations that he was anti-national. He also submitted affidavits from his mother, neighbour, cousin and uncle alleging that the police had been to their homes recently in search of the claimant and that they had alleged he was anti-national.[4] This is a significant change from the claimant\u2019s original BOC which focused on the threats that he faced due to his relationship with XXXX.\n[12] I questioned the claimant about the addendum. He told me that the police first made this accusation to his mother in XXXX 2022. Prior to this, they had approached his cousin in Rajasthan in XXXX 2021 and made the same allegation. The claimant does not know why the police are making this allegation. The police do not provide much detail other than saying that they believe he is an anti-national goon and that he has been instrumental in fights and riots. The claimant is not aware if the police have filed a First Instance Report against him or whether there is a warrant for his arrest.\n[13] I asked the claimant why he didn\u2019t update his BOC back in XXXX 2022 when he first found out about the situation. He indicated that he did not know that he had to mention this to his counsel, and thought it was something he would tell me about in the hearing. Given that the claimant testified that he did not mention this to his counsel earlier, I find it reasonable that he was not advised by his counsel that this was something that he should raise as soon as possible.\n[14] The claimant provided affidavits from his mother, neighbour, cousin and uncle in support of this allegation.[5] Each affidavit is consistent with the claimant\u2019s allegations, and I have no reason to doubt the credibility of these affidavits, so I give them significant weight in establishing the claimants\u2019 allegations. I also give the claimant\u2019s testimony in this regard significant weight as it was detailed and consistent. He did not exaggerate his claim, but rather confirmed that this was something that came out of the blue and that the police had never previously accused him of being anti-national when they were investigating XXXX disappearance. The claimant was also able to provide specific dates of when the police visited his mother including on Diwali and his birthday.\n[15] While I acknowledge that it is unclear why the police are now searching for the claimant on an entirely new basis, it would be speculative of me to set out what a \u201creasonable agent of persecution\u201d should do. The Federal Court has previously found that it is an error for the Board to \u201cspeculate as to the rational actions of reasonable agents of persecution.\u201d[6] Therefore, given all the foregoing and weighing all the evidence before me, I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the police are actively searching for the claimant across India and alleging that he is anti-national.\nPolice Search not connected to XXXX disappearance\n[16] The claimant testified that he believed the current search by the police was connected to his relationship with XXXX and instigated by her family. He testified that he has no proof of this but believes that it is a matter of honour for her family and that they manipulating the police with their connections. When asked about XXXX family\u2019s police connections, he stated that his mother learned about them from an unknown person at the jail when she came to bail the claimant out. This individual told his mother that XXXX father was a goon and people were scared of him. With regards to their political connections, he said that his mother told him about them, and she probably learned of them in the news. He did not submit any newspapers on this point into evidence. However, when the claimant spoke to XXXX about her father, she told him that he dealt with properties and never mentioned any illegal activity or connections.\n[17] The claimant testified that since his detention, XXXX family had never been to his house looking for him. He explained that people of XXXX caste do not like to associate with people of his caste. He testified that the police were regularly contacting his mother regarding XXXX disappearance, however, he later stated that he assumed this, and his mother hadn\u2019t told him anything to that effect. I find this to be speculative. Based on the evidence before me, there has been no involvement of the police or XXXX family in relation to XXXX disappearance since XXXX 2018. As such, there is insufficient credible evidence before me that the current searches by police are connected in any way to the claimant\u2019s relationship with XXXX or her disappearance.\nDocumentary Evidence\n[18] I have also considered the other documentary evidence the claimant submitted in support of his claim.[7] Of relevance is his Scheduled Caste Certificate, obtained by the claimant\u2019s mother from the Court in Haryana, which confirms that he belongs to the Chamar caste which is a scheduled caste.\nSubjective Fear\n[19] The claimant testified that when he returned to Canada at the end of 2017, he was still on a study permit. His study permit expired on XXXX XXXX, 2019, and afterwards he applied for a study permit extension which was rejected after 5-6 months. He was not aware at the time that he could apply for refugee protection. He testified that he did not become aware until he started going to a temple in Brampton where he was advised to submit an application for refugee protection. The claimant applied for refugee protection on January 20, 2020.\n[20] I find that the claimant\u2019s actions demonstrate that he has subjective fear on a balance of probabilities as he was always actively taking steps to secure his status in Canada and applied for refugee protection shortly after he was advised to do so by individuals at his temple.\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution\n[21] To be considered a Convention Refugee, the claimant must demonstrate that he has a well-founded fear of persecution which includes both subjective fear and an objective basis for that fear. Based on the claimant\u2019s BOC, testimony, documentary evidence and the National Documentation Package for India[8], I find that the claimant does face a serious possibility of harm in India.\nDalit Status\n[22] In reviewing the country condition documents in the NDP, it is clear that despite the fact that the Indian Constitution specifically prohibits discrimination on the grounds of caste, there are a number of troubling issues faced by members of the Dalit caste in India.[9] Dalits were historically associated with work seen as less desirable, including work involving cleaning or waste, and traditional taboos existed against members of the four castes touching them. Many Dalits continue to work in occupations that include scavenging, street cleaning and handling of human or animal waste, corpses or carcasses.[10] The evidence outlines that violence and discrimination against Dalits continues. Dalits have more limited educational and employment opportunities and face discrimination in health care and access to other essential services.[11]\n[23] Untouchability practices in India remain widespread in both urban and rural settings. These include dominant castes not touching Dalits, not letting them use the same mugs, utensils etc., not entering Dalit houses, not allowing their children to play with Dalits or to be in a relationship with a Dalit. There are thousands of variations of untouchability practices and the severity and prevalence vary depending on location.[12]\n[24] The claimant testified that he and his family have suffered serious and continued discrimination because of their Dalit status. His father used to work as a farmer but was never paid full price for his crops. This led him to seek other employment however he was frequently dismissed for minor mistakes. The claimants\u2019 father has been living and working in Italy since 2010 due to his inability to maintain employment in India because of his Caste. The claimant testified that he was discriminated against in school. The teacher would force children from lower castes to sit in the back seat, they were not allowed to travel in the school bus, play school sports, or drink from the same water cooler as higher caste students. The family had to buy groceries from a different store and attend a different temple because of their caste.\nHonour Crimes\n[25] The objective evidence supports that honour-based crimes are a problem in India, particularly in the provinces of Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh. The term \u201chonour killing\u201d or \u201chonour crime\u201d is used to describe incidents of violence and harassment caused to a couple who are together against the wishes of the community or family members. Such crimes can be linked to unapproved relationships.[13] Caste based violence additionally continues to persist in India, and unions between Dalit and non-Dalit individuals are some of the least socially accepted, especially where the male comes from an inferior or less dominant social group. They can give rise to serious violence including lynching and killings by family members or vigilante groups.[14]\nPolice Corruption\n[26] The objective evidence also supports that there is widespread corruption in India.[15] Officials frequently engage in corrupt practices with impunity.[16] Police officers routinely demonstrate brutal behaviour, including torture and extrajudicial killings with impunity.[17] Additionally, police effectiveness is undermined by inadequate training and equipment, and limited resources. Investigations are seriously hampered by some police officers refusing to register victims\u2019 complaints, poor quality of investigations, insufficient training and legal knowledge, inadequate and outdated forensic and cyber infrastructure and a lack of public trust.[18] A report from the Swadhikar \u2013 the National Dalit Movement for Justice suggests that police are accomplices in violence against Dalits through custodial torture and deaths, encounter deaths, raids of Dalit homes, and false arrets of Dalits among others. It recounts the story of a Dalit man who was abducted by police, tortured, abused using derogatory caste names and had a false charge filed against him.[19]\n[27] The objective evidence demonstrates that Dalits face serious violations of their fundamental rights that amount to persecution. These violations extend to all parts of their lives, including their relationships. The claimant has established on a balance of probabilities that he has experienced discrimination and harm due to his Dalit status throughout his childhood and most recently with regards to his relationship with a girl from a higher caste. Additionally, I find that the claimant has credibly established that he is being targeted by the police because of the belief that he is anti-national. While it is unclear why the police are suggesting this, the objective evidence corroborates the prevalence of police corruption as well as violence when it comes to Dalit individuals involved with the justice system. Given all of the foregoing, I find that the claimant would face a serious possibility of persecution in India.\nState Protection\n[28] There is a presumption that countries can protect their citizens. The claimant bears the burden of rebutting that presumption with clear and convincing evidence. I find that there is clear and convincing evidence that adequate state protection is not available to the claimant in this case given the state is one of the agents of persecution.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[29] I have considered whether the claimant has an internal flight alternative (\u201cIFA\u201d) in India and have concluded that he does not. To find a viable IFA, I must be satisfied that (1) there is no serious possibility of the claimant being persecuted or, on the balance of probabilities, in danger of torture or subjected to a risk to life or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in the IFA and (2) that conditions in that part of the country are such that it would be reasonable, in all the circumstances, including those particular to the claimant, for him to seek refuge there.\nFirst Prong: Risk in the IFA\n[30] On the evidence before me, I find that there is a serious possibility of the claimant being persecuted or, on the balance of probabilities, in danger of torture or subjected to a risk to life or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment anywhere in India.\n\nMeans and Motivation of the Agents of Persecution[31] There is insufficient credible evidence before me that either XXXX family or the police have continued to pursue the claimant in relation to XXXX disappearance since XXXX 2018. However, I do find that the police have demonstrated recent and continued means and motivation to pursue the claimant outside of their jurisdiction based on the belief that the claimant is anti-national. Starting at the end of 2021 and continuing to just a month prior to the hearing, the police have approached the claimant\u2019s mother and neighbour in Kurukshetra, his cousin in Rajasthan state and his uncle in Maharashtra state. Further, the claimant explained that it was the local police who visited his cousin in Rajasthan and his uncle in Maharashtra, indicating that information about the claimant has been passed along to different police forces across the country. Given the foregoing, I find that there is a serious possibility that the claimant\u2019s information is contained in national police databases and that the police across India are searching for the claimant.\n\nDalit Status[32] On the evidence before me, I find that there is a serious possibility of the claimant being persecuted because of his Dalit status. DFAT notes that Dalits in India face a high risk of official and societal discrimination including social segregation, exclusion, and compromised access to education and healthcare.[20] Violence against Dalits also continues, including killings, mob violence, assaults, and intimidation.[21] Further the objective evidence suggests that Dalits would have significant difficulty relocating to urban areas and are often denied accommodation and employment. A social network would be essential in finding employment and housing.[22]\n[33] While cities provide some limited level of anonymity, social networks would be essential in finding employment and housing in urban areas.[23] Those without social networks would face high discrimination in jobs and housing and often end up at the bottom of the social hierarchy. Although Dalits are reported to have increasing opportunities in cities, including a system of quotas to ensure employment of Dalits in certain sectors such as educational institutions and the federal public service, the quota system can generate hostility towards Dalits.[24] \u201cSevere inequalities persist, however, with Dalits making up a large proportion of those engaged in the urban informal labour sector as domestic workers, rickshaw-pullers, street vendors and other poorly paid sectors.[25] While the claimant has family outside of his village, including an uncle in Mahrashtra state where one of the proposed IFAs is located, the claimant would be unable to access these social networks due to the fact that the police are monitoring his relatives in search of him.\n[34] For the foregoing reasons I find that the claimant has demonstrated that the police have the means and motivation to pursue him to various parts of India. Further, I find that the claimant has demonstrated that he would face a serious possibility of persecution due to his Dalit status in other parts of India. As such, I do not need to consider the second prong of the test and find that there is no viable IFA for the claimant.\nCONCLUSION\n[35] For the forgoing reasons, I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee. The claim is therefore accepted.\n(signed) Katarina Bogojevic\nNovember 24, 2022\n\n[1] Immigration and Refugee Protection Act,S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n\n[2] Exhibit 2.\n\n[3] Exhibit 1.\n\n[4] Exhibit 5.\n\n[5] Exhibit 5.\n\n[6] Hernandez Cortez v Canada (Citizenship and Immgiration), 2021 FC 1392 (CanLII); Senadheerage v Canada (Citizenship and Immgiration), 2020 FC 968 (CanLII).\n\n[7] Exhibit 5.\n\n[8] Exhibit 3.\n\n[9] National Documentation Package, India, 30 June 2022, tab 2.1: \u200bIndia.

Mangat\nCountry: Pakistan\nRPD Number: VC2-01083\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2022-01960\nATIP Pages: N\/A\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: These are the reasons for the decision in the claim of XXXX XXXX, a citizen of Pakistan, who is claiming refugee protection pursuant to subsections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nDETERMINATION\n[2] For the reasons that follow, I find that you are a Convention refugee as you have established a serious possibility of persecution on account of a Convention ground, namely religion.\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] Briefly, you fear that you will be killed by your Sunni relatives and former Sunni colleagues, members of the XXXX and for the record, that is XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Pakistan, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, generally, and two (2) XXXX leaders, specifically, named XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. You also fear members of other anti-Shia extremist groups such as the XXXX, (inaudible), and the XXXX, as well as the political party, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and you fear them because you have converted to the Shia faith, because you XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and because you were actively supporting fellow Shia Muslims in Pakistan as a member of both the XXXX, which is a Shia Muslims religious and political party, and also a lawyers forum that provided legal assistant to Shia Muslims and other minorities.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[4] I find that your personal identity \u2013 an identity as a national of Pakistan is established by the documents provided, including a certified copy of your Pakistan passport.\nNexus\n[5] For a claimant to be a Convention refugee, the claimant must have a well-founded fear of persecution due to a Convention ground and I find that the harm you fear is by reason of the Convention ground of religion due to your conversion to the Shia faith.\nCredibility\n[6] When a claimant swears to the truth of certain allegations, this creates a presumption that those allegations are true unless there is a reason to doubt their untrue \u2014 or to doubt their truthfulness and I found you to be a credible witness. You testified in a straightforward manner, and you answered my questions, giving detailed answers without hesitation. There were no relevant inconsistencies in your testimony or contradictions between your testimony and the other evidence before me. I accept on a balance of probabilities that you converted to the Shia faith. You provided a lengthy Basis of Claim form, a narrative in Exhibit 6 detailing why you chose to convert and how you converted. In addition, you provided documentary evidence showing that you continue to follow your faith in Canada. You have also provided other documentary evidence to support your allegations, including letters from your mother and friend, letters regarding your membership in the XXXX and the lawyers forum in Pakistan, a copy of the fatwa issued against you by the SSP, a medical report showing the injuries that you sustained after you were attacked, the letter that you wrote to the police requesting that an FIR be registered, and a land registry document showing the land and the graveyard that you donated. In summary, you have provided extensive evidence of the threats and the attacks made against you.\n[7] You have also provided several photographs of yourself participating in protests in Calgary and copies of six (6) different newspapers from Pakistan, which reported the protest, and which contain your photograph and name. Upon a review of these items, I find no reason to doubt their authenticity and therefore, place significant weight on them as they serve to corroborate your allegations. I find that you have established on a balance of probabilities that you converted to the Shia faith in XXXX 2018. You joined the XXXX, a Shia political and religious party, in XXXX 2018 and participated in approximately seven (7) to eight (8) peaceful protests, rallies, and hunger strikes in Pakistan in support of Shias.\n[8] You joined the (inaudible) forum in XXXX 2018, an organization formed to provide legal support to Shias and other minorities in XXXX, your home city, and your particularly \u2014 you particularly helped three (3) or four (4) families who have been charged with blasphemy. You first began to receive threats in XXXX 2019 when you XXXX XXXX XXXX to a Shia neighbor for his XXXX. You received threats from XXXX XXXX XXXX, who arranged a group of people to attend and attempt to stop XXXX XXXX from happening. Mr. XXXX and his group called the Shias kafirs and infidels. The next day, your cousin who follows XXXX and also both \u2014 he also follows both the XXXX and the XXXX \u2014 he threatened you, telling you to revert to Sunni Islam and to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, or you will face the consequences. You receive more than one (1) threatening call from XXXX XXXX, a leader of the XXXX, who told you to revert to Sunni Islam and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX or it would be the cause of your death. In XXXX 2019, you were physically attacked by four (4) armed individuals shouting XXXX slogans, calling you \u2018Kafir\u2019 and said, \u2018If you wish to be alive,\u2019 to \u2018Revert to the Sunni faith and give back the land you donated.\u2019 Your neighbours took you to the hospital to tend to your injuries. You then went to the police station who took your complaint, but when you gave the name XXXX XXXX to the police, the police\u2019s attitudes changed and said that you were responsible for the attack and they did not issue an FIR, and you believe that the police told XXXX XXXX of the XXXX about your visit to the police because XXXX XXXX mentioned you in the phone calls.\n[9] In XXXX 2019, XXXX XXXX forcibly entered your home with members of the XXXX while you were not present and searched for you. In XXXX 2019, your XXXX XXXX XXXX of the XXXX in XXXX was murdered by Sunni extremists on his way to work. You arranged a protest and demanded the police to lodge a FIR. You received more threats. You left Pakistan in XXXX 2019 and first flew to the United States where you had intended to make a refugee claim, but you were advised that your claim would be refused in the United States due to President Trump\u2019s immigration policy, so you decided to come to Canada, and you arrived on the XXXX XXXX XXXX 2020 and made a refugee claim at the border. In your absence, the XXXX has posted a fatwa outside your residence, calling for your death as a blasphemer and apostate. You \u2013 friends \u2013 apostate. Your friends and family have stated that the XXXX continue to search for you.\nWell-Founded Fear\n[10] I find that you have established a subjective fear of persecution in Pakistan based on your conversion to the Shia faith. I also find that the objective evidence before me establishes that your fears of persecution are objectively well-founded. The country condition evidence as outlined in the National Documentation Package for Pakistan supports your allegations regarding the treatment of those who follow the Shia faith in Pakistan. Item 1.8 is the UNHCR guidelines for assessing religious minorities in Pakistan, and it indicates blasphemy is criminalized in Pakistan and can carry the death penalty. The addition of the blasphemy laws to the criminal penal code has \u201cContributed to the institutionalization of discrimination against religious minorities,\u201d and has been criticized for fueling extremist violence and targeted attacks. The report indicates that Shiites are the main target of sectarian, attacks and the number of blasphemy allegations against Shiites increased exponentially between 2012 and 2015. Extremist militant groups view the Shiites as heretics, infidels, and apostates who should be punished by death. A footnote in the UNHCR report \u2014 and for the record, that is footnote 369 \u2014 indicates the four (4) militant groups which are responsible for most of the attacks against Shiites in Pakistan: one (1) is the XXXX and another is the XXXX.\n[11] You have provided additional evidence regarding the treatment of Shias in Exhibit 5 that indicate sectarian violence has been rising in Pakistan. One (1) article from the Minority Rights Group describes a wave of online and offline campaigns against the Shia community in August and September 2020. Online hate speech was documented and there were major spikes in hate speech during that time period with the Urdu word for \u2018Infidel\u2019 being particularly prevalent in searches. Also in Exhibit 5 is an article from The Diplomat that shows at least six (6) large anti-Shia rallies took place by different Sunni groups in five (5) different cities, including Karachi. Another article he provided indicates that rallies were orchestrated on successive dates with at least 30,000 people attending, some chanting anti-Shia slogans, and there are also reports of Shias being killed in broad daylight by Sunni extremists.\n[12] In addition, the objective evidence indicates that 43 blasphemy cases, primarily targeting Shias, were registered in August 2020 alone. One (1) of those charged was a mourner who was only three (3) years old. Societal violence due to religious intolerance is also reported by the United States Department of State report, which is Item 2.1 of the NDP, and it reports Shia Muslim activists reported continuing instances of targeted killings and enforced disappearances in part of the country \u2013 in parts of the country. One (1) article he provided in Exhibit 5 suggests that either the state has acquiesced to anti-Shia hysteria or is wholeheartedly backing it. The New York Times article in Exhibit 5 indicates the new political party in Pakistan, the Tehreek-e-Labbaik, was approved to run on a platform of punishing those who blaspheme Islam, and the leader of the political party was also the leader of the banned anti-Shia group, ASWJ. I find that the country condition evidence establishes that Shia practitioners are targeted by militant groups such as the XXXX and LeJ and political parties, such as the Tehreek-e-Labbaik, and you have established on a balance of probabilities that you have been personally targeted for death by the XXXX. As such, I find that there is more than a mere possibility of persecution, should you return to Pakistan.\nState Protection\n[13] As a presumption that \u2013 absent a complete breakdown, states are capable of protecting their citizens, however, I find that presumption has been rebutted in your case as the agent of persecution is in part, the state. You have sought assistance from the police when you were attacked, and they have refused to register a FIR and said that you were responsible for the attack. Furthermore, the local authorities were unable to protect your mentor, the president of the (inaudible) unit of the political party you were part of. He was targeted and murdered on his way to work in XXXX of 2019. The UNHCR report at NDP 1.8 indicates analysists describe the state authorities as being \u201cIndifferent, incompetent, or even complicit in the violence and discrimination against Shiites.\u201d So accordingly, I find that you have rebutted the presumption of state protection and I find that there is no adequate state protection available to you.\nIFA\n[14] I find that there is no internal flight alternative for you in Pakistan. The objective country evidence indicated that attacks against Shiites occur throughout Pakistan. As already stated, large demonstrators against \u2014 demonstrations against Shias occurred in five (5) cities in succession in 2020. The XXXX is a group that operates throughout Pakistan and (inaudible) has issued a fatwa against you since you left Pakistan.

One (1) of the largest militant authorization \u2014 organizations in the country has said that they want you killed for your conversion to the Shia faith.

        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2022 RLLR 21\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: July 27, 2022\nPanel: Alannah Hatch\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Gaurav Sharma\nCountry: India\nRPD Number: VC2-00904\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2022-01960\nATIP Pages: N\/A\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] This is the decision of the Refugee Protection Division in the claims of XXXX XXXX (the \u201cprincipal claimant\u201d), XXXX XXXX (the \u201cassociate claimant\u201d) and XXXX XXXX (the \u201cminor claimant\u201d). The claimants are citizens of India and are seeking refugee protection pursuant to subsections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).\n[2] The principal claimant was appointed the Designated Representative for the minor claimant at the outset of the hearing.\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] The details of the claimants\u2019 allegations are fully set out in the Basis of Claim (BOC) forms and were supplemented by a BOC addendum and oral testimony.[1] In summary, the claimants fear persecution in India from goons associated with the Congress political party because the principal claimant is a supporter of the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX political party. In addition, the claimants fear the police because they have accused the principal claimant of financially supporting terrorists and because they believe the police work at the behest of the Congress party.\nDETERMINATION\n[4] I find that the claimants are Convention refugees as they have a well-founded fear of persecution for at least one Convention ground, namely membership in a particular social group, as the claimants are members of the \u201cBackward Caste\u201c XXXX, also known as Dalits. I therefore have not assessed the claimants\u2019 allegations regarding their fears of Congress party goons or the police.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[5] The Claimants\u2019 identities as nationals of India are established on a balance of probabilities by the sworn statements in their BOC forms and the copies of their Republic of India passports.[2]\nNexus\n[6] I find that there is a nexus between the claimants\u2019 allegations and the Convention ground of membership in a particular social group because the claimants are members of the XXXX Caste, or Dalits.\nCredibility\n[7] The Federal Court has held in Maldonado that when a claimant swears to the truth of certain allegations, it creates a presumption that those allegations are true unless there is a reason to doubt their truthfulness.[3] The presumption of truthfulness does not apply to inferences or speculation.\n[8] In this case, I have no reason to doubt the truthfulness of the claimants. The principal claimant testified in a straightforward manner and gave detailed answers to my questions about how he was treated as a Dalit in his village of XXXX, Punjab. The principal claimant provided spontaneous testimony about Dalits being forbidden to build a sports field in XXXX solely because they were Dalit, and how Dalits were not allowed to mingle with others in the community during celebrations because they were Dalit. Both the associate claimant and principal claimant testified about how they were treated at school due to being Dalit. The associate claimant testified other students refused to play with her and she was treated differently by teachers because she was Dalit. In addition, the claimants provided corroborating evidence including a \u201cBackward Caste Certificate for the principal claimant\u2019s father, indicating he is from the XXXX XXXX.[4]\n[9] I find that the claimants have established on a balance of probabilities that they are Dalits. I asked the principal claimant why he did not have a Certificate in his own name, and he testified that they issued only one certificate for the family, and that both of his parents were of the XXXX XXXX. The associate claimant testified she did not have a certificate; however, I accept on a balance of probabilities that she is of the same XXXX XXXX based on her credible testimony.\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution and Risk of Harm\n[10] I find that the claimants\u2019 subjective fear is objectively well-founded.\n[11] Regarding Dalits, Minority Rights Group International states the following:\nAmidst India\u2019s cultural traditions is a rigid caste structure, a continuing symbol of identification and social stratification. 16.6 per cent of the total population of India consists of the scheduled castes which includes \u2018Dalits\u2019 also known as Harijans, or \u2018Untouchables\u2019. The Indian Constitution requires the government to define a list or schedule of the lowest castes in need of compensatory programmes\u2026\nDalits in rural areas suffer from entrenched caste discrimination, including \u2018untouchability\u2019, violence and harassment. Violence against Dalits is widespread, driven by the persistent effects of India\u2019s caste system and the lack of justice for victims.\nThe constitutionally guaranteed affirmative action policies have had some positive impact in increasing the representation of Dalits in educational institutions, governmental jobs and elected positions. Notwithstanding this improvement, Dalits continue to remain the most underprivileged class of Indian society: the stigma they face remains evident to this day. Dalits in general continue to survive under inhumane, degrading conditions.[5]\n[12] The International Dalit Solidarity Network states:\n[u]ntouchability practices in India remain widespread in both urban and rural settings. These include dominant castes not touching Dalits, not letting them use the same mugs, utensils etc., not entering Dalit houses, not allowing their children to play with Dalits or to be in a relationship with a Dalit. There are thousands of variations of untouchability practices and the severity and prevalence vary depending on location.[6]\n[13] The Navsarjan Trust also states that untouchability \u201cis present in nearly every sphere of life and practiced in an infinite number of forms\u201d. Examples include Dalits being refused entry to barber shops or temples, being forbidden to use wells, and Dalit children may be asked to clean the toilets and to eat separately at schools.[7]\n[14] The treatment of Dalits has not improved in recent years. The 2015 National Dalit Movement for Justice report[8] provides a list of \u201cnew forms of atrocities\u201d against Dalits that were proposed additions to the Scheduled Castes and Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 (\u201cPOA Act\u201d). At the time, the POA Act had 22 offences listed as atrocities\nwhich include forcing to drink or eat any inedible or obnoxious substance; dumping excreta; parading naked; occupying or cultivating any SC\u2019s land; forcing or intimidating to vote or to vote to a particular candidate; instituting false, malicious or vexatious suit; insulting or intimidating to humiliate in any place within public view; exploiting a woman sexually; and mischief by fire or any explosive substance to cause damage to any SC\u2019s property; etc.\n[15] The National Dalit Movement for Justice report, however, states:\nnumerous new forms of caste-based atrocities have been identified in \u2026(and) perpetrated in both rural and urban regions. These forms are widespread and systemic in nature. The POA Amendments Bill introduced in the Lok Sabha in 2014 and pending before the Parliament has identified and included these additional forms of atrocities.\n[16] The new forms of atrocities listed in the POA Amendments Bill are extensive and numerous and divided into five categories. As an example, the first category of proposed amendments to the POA Act are offences related to assault on dignity such as:\nputting inedible or obnoxious substance into the mouth; garlanding with footwear, removing clothes, tonsuring of head, removing moustaches, painting face or body; compelling to dispose or carry human or animal carcasses, compelling to dig graves; manual scavenging; disrespecting any late persons held in high esteem to SCs\/STs; attempting to promote feelings of enmity and hatred against SCs\/ STs; and imposing social or economic boycott.\n[17] As the Navsarjan Trust, supra, succinctly relates, the objective evidence unanimously demonstrates that untouchability is \u201cpracticed in an infinite number of forms\u201d which are rightfully labelled \u2018atrocious\u2019.\n[18] I find Dalits face systemic serious violations of their fundamental rights that amount to persecution. I find the claimants have established on a balance of probabilities that they have experienced discrimination since childhood as Dalits. I find there is a serious possibility the claimants will face continued discrimination as Dalits if they were to return to India and that the treatment cumulatively amounts to persecution.\nState Protection\n[19] There is a presumption that, unless in complete breakdown, states are capable of protecting their citizens. I find that that the claimants have rebutted the presumption of state protection and I find there is no adequate state protection for the claimants.\n[20] The Australian DFAT, quoted in the UK Home Office Country Policy and Information Note, reports:\nRegistration, investigation and prosecution of cases may be affected by bias in relation to the class, caste, ethnicity and religion of a victim or offender. Ethnic and religious minorities complain that police lack sensitivity, suspicions about which sometimes lead to communal violence. Local sources report that police, along with other agencies including the courts, public servants, judiciary and prosecutors, have an inherent bias when dealing with Dalit victims of crime in particular.[9]\n[21] In the most recent \u201cStatus of Policing in India Report\u201d, 32 percent of those interviewed in conflict-affected regions believed the police would favour an upper caste person in a criminal investigation over a Dalit.[10]\n[22] The Australian DFAT country report indicates:\ncorrupt practices such as facilitation payments and bribes persist in India, with corruption particularly prevalent in the judiciary, police, public services and public procurement sectors\u2026Since 2014, India has consistently ranked low on the (World Justice Project Rule of Law) indices measuring absence of corruption across government. Similarly, India ranked 80 out of 198 countries on Transparency International\u2019s Corruption Index, 2019 (down from 78th place in 2018).[11]\n[23] I find that the claimants have established on a balance of probabilities that adequate state protection for them in India is not available because the police, judiciary and other government agencies are reported to be not only corrupt, but also biased against Dalits.\nInternal Flight Alternative (IFA)\n[24] The Federal Court of Appeal in Rasaratnam,[12] developed a two-prong test when assessing IFA, which entails a consideration of two matters: (1) whether there is a serious possibility of the claimant being persecuted or, on the balance of probabilities, in danger of torture or subjected to a risk to life or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in the IFA and (2) whether conditions in the IFA are such that it would be reasonable, in all the circumstances, including those particular to the claimant, for him to seek refuge there. The onus is on the claimants to demonstrate they do not have a viable IFA.\n[25] Based on the evidence before me, I find that the claimants would face a serious possibility of persecution throughout India and there is no IFA available to them.\n[26] The persecution suffered by Dalits is widespread and systematic and occurs in both rural and urban areas. I note that the objective evidence, reviewed above, regarding the persecutory treatment of Dalits in India is not location specific. While cities provide some limited level of anonymity, social networks would be essential in finding employment and housing in urban areas.[13] Those without social networks would face high discrimination in jobs and housing and often end up at the bottom of the social hierarchy. Although Dalits are reported to have increasing opportunities in cities, including a system of quotas to ensure employment of Dalits in certain sectors such as educational institutions and the federal public service, the quota system can generate hostility towards Dalits.[14] \u201cSevere inequalities persist, however, with Dalits making up a large proportion of those engaged in the urban informal labour sector as domestic workers, rickshaw-pullers, street vendors and other poorly paid sectors\u201d.[15]\n[27] There is no evidence before me to indicate that the claimants have a social network in the proposed IFAs of Delhi or Mumbai.\n[28] I find that the claimants face a serious possibility of persecution in either Delhi or Mumbai because they are Dalits and as such the IFA fails on the first prong of the Rasaratnam test. I find that there is no IFA available to the claimants.\nCONCLUSION\n[29] When I consider the claimants\u2019 personal profiles, the objective country evidence, the lack of state protection and lack of a viable IFA, I find that the claimants are Convention refugees and I accept their claims.\n(signed) Alannah Hatch\nJuly 27, 2022\n\n[1] Exhibits 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 and 4.\n\n[2] Exhibit 1.\n\n[3] Maldonado v.

        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2022 RLLR 20\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: December 22, 2022\nPanel: Kay Scorer\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Solomon Orjiwuru\nCountry: Uganda\nRPD Number: VC2-00608\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2022-01960\nATIP Pages: N\/A\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] This is the decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) in the claim for refugee protection of XXXX XXXX (the Claimant), a citizen of Uganda, who claims refugee protection in Canada pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (the Act).[i]\n[2] On June 29, 2022, the Minister submitted a Rule 21 Cross Disclosure Application (Rule 21 Application) to the RPD.[ii] As set out in the Rule 21 Application, the Minister requested that the RPD cross disclose the Basis of Claim form and TRV application for the claimant (the BOC)[iii] with the Basis of Claim forms and TRV applications for approximately 16 other claimants (file numbers listed in the Rule 21 application) due to similar details contained in each claimant\u2019s application for Temporary Resident Visas to visit Canada, the date of and route of entry into Canada, the Canadian contact address, the reasons for\/details of their claim for protection, and the similar formatting of their BOC allegations. The RPD granted the Rule 21 Application. In the said Rule 21 Application, the Minister notified the parties that it wishes to intervene by making observations and submitting evidence in all claims.\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] The claimant\u2019s full allegations are contained in his Basis of Claim form, additional narrative, and were supplemented by his testimony at the hearing.[iv] Summarized only briefly, the claimant fears persecution in Uganda on the basis of his political opinion. The claimant has been an active supporter of the National Unity Party (the NUP) and has held roles within the party. As a result of the claimant\u2019s political involvement, he has been targeted by the state and its agents, assaulted, harassed and threatened. The claimant fears similar or worse treatment in Uganda on the basis of his political opinion should he return.\nDETERMINATION\n[4] After considering the claimant\u2019s testimony and the documentary evidence, I find the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to s. 96 of the Act. My reasons are as follows.\nANALYSIS\nNexus\n[5] The claimant\u2019s allegations establish a nexus to the Convention on the ground of political opinion. I have therefore analyzed the claim pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA.\nIdentity\n[6] The claimant\u2019s identity is established, on a balance of probabilities, by the documentary evidence before me, including a copy of his Ugandan passport in Exhibit 1.\nCredibility\n[7] Pursuant to the Maldonado principle, the claimant benefits from a presumption of truthfulness. I find, on a balance of probabilities, the claimant is credible.\n[8] The claimant\u2019s testimony was direct, spontaneous, and consistent. The claimant was able to respond to questions in a forthcoming manner. I asked numerous questions about the claimant\u2019s past involvement in politics in Uganda. The claimant was able to provide ample description about all of his roles within the NUP and his aspirations for running as a candidate for the party. The claimant provided very detailed and spontaneous testimony about his past political passions, including running for perfecter positions in elementary, primary and high school, his official roles as a speaker and later president of a student group at Kampala International University, and his previous support for the FDC and why he ultimately transitioned his support from FDC to the NUP. To these and many other questions, the claimant gave responses which were materially consistent with his narrative, and responses which provided further detail about the claimant\u2019s allegations. I find the claimant was a credible witness, on a balance of probabilities, relating to his allegations of political involvement and risk in Uganda.\n[9] In addition, the Claimant submitted documentary evidence to corroborate his claim, all of which can be found in Exhibits 6, 7 and 9, including medical records from injuries sustained in attacks by state agents, a copy of his NUP membership card, NUP documents corroborating the claimant\u2019s official roles within the organization and the risk he has faced on the basis of his involvement with the NUP, a letter from the claimant\u2019s spouse corroborating that the authorities continue to be motivated in harming the claimant. I do not doubt the authenticity of these documents, and I assign them significant weight as they corroborate the claimant\u2019s central allegations.\n[10] The Minister raised various credibility concerns including (i) the similarities between the claimant and the other claimants relating to the basis of their TRV applications to Canada and their contact information in Canada (with no claimant referencing this connection) and (ii) the striking similarity in the Basis of Claim form between the claimant and the other Rule 21 Application claimants. Specifically, the Minister submits that because none of the claimants made reference to one another in their applications, their arrival to Canada was likely facilitated by the same agent who helped them fabricate their information, including their similarly drafted Basis of Claim forms and narratives made in their applications for protection. These concerns will be addressed below.\nTRV Application Issues \u2013 Rule 21 Application\n[11] Based on the Rule 21 Application which was granted by the RPD, the TRV applications between all 16 claimants were cross disclosed. The TRV applications were based on the same conference attendance and contained similar supporting documentation to facilitate the obtaining of a visa to Canada.\n[12] I asked the claimant to explain how he obtained his visa to Canada. In testimony, the claimant explained that he relied on the assistance of an agent, organized by the NUP party, for obtaining the visa. The claimant provided only his passport to the agent. When I asked the claimant how the agent would have gotten access to some of the other supporting evidence (i.e. educational documents, certificates, employment letters, etc) the claimant advised that all of these documents had already been provided to the NUP and it is possible the agent obtained them from the NUP directly. The claimant advised that he never saw the application for a visa before it was submitted, did not sign the forms included in the application, and was entirely unaware of the contents of the application, including the fact that it was for a TRV to attend a conference. The claimant also explained in testimony that he was unaware of the contents of the visa application until the RPD cross-disclosed the TRV applications pursuant to the Rule 21 application.\n[13] I accept that the claimant relied entirely on an agent facilitated by the NUP to obtain the visa, and that he was not privy to the contents of the visa application as a result. I find this to be a reasonable explanation.\n[14] I agree with the Minister that these cases demonstrate, on a balance of probabilities, that these claimants used the same agent for facilitating their travel to Canada. I do not find, however, that this undermines the claimant\u2019s allegations that he relied on an NUP agent to obtain a visa to Canada. I find it is a reasonable to believe that there are agents in Uganda who facilitate the travel of multiple claimants at the same time, using the same basis for travel, without the knowledge of those accessing the agent\u2019s services. The actions of the agent would be outside of the control or knowledge of the claimant. I also find it reasonable to believe that the NUP as a party may use the same agent, throughout Uganda, to facilitate the flight of numerous people at the same time from Uganda. I find the claimant\u2019s explanation to be reasonable.\n[15] I also asked the claimant about the other claimants living at the same address. The claimant stated that he did not know any of the other claimants living at his address until after he had arrived in Canada. He stated that the agent advised him to talk to no one, including those at his home, and to tell no one about his reasons for being in Canada. As a result, the claimant did not discuss with the other claimant the reasons for being in Canada, and that it was not until the RPD disclosed the Basis of Claim forms that the claimant became aware of the reason for the other claimant\u2019s travel to Canada. Again, I find this explanation to be reasonable. The claimant did not mention these other claimants when he filed his own claim for protection because, when he filed his claim, he was not aware of the reason why the other claimants were in Canada, and unaware of the connections related to the use of the same agent in Uganda. I find the claimant\u2019s explanation to be reasonable.\nSimilarity in the Basis of Claim forms \u2013 Rule 21 Application\n[16] Based on the Rule 21 Application, it is notable that the Basis of Claim forms are written in a remarkably similar manner, including the use of capital letters and short sentences in the Basis of Claim form itself, and in the format of the majority of the written additional narratives.\n[17] The Panel acknowledges that similarities in narratives may service to undermine a claimant\u2019s credibility. As stated by the court in Ravichandran,[v] \u201ccourts have found that it is not unreasonable to draw a negative inference as to credibility from unwarranted similarities between a refugee claimant\u2019s narrative and the narratives of other unrelated claimants (Liu v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2006 FC 695 at para 39; Shi v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2003 FC 1088 at paras 1, 19).\u201d[vi]\n[18] Nonetheless, the court went further to state that \u201c\u2026 while decision-makers may rely on their common sense in drawing negative credibility inferences from unwarranted and striking similarities between the testimony of applicants, it is equally true that they must use their common sense to determine whether, in the circumstances of the case, there is a valid reason for the similarity. If there is, it would not be appropriate to find that the similarity casts doubt on the applicant\u2019s credibility (Zhang v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2006 FC 550 at paras 25-28, [Zhang]).\u201d[vii]\n[19] I put to the claimant that there are remarkably similar formats in the Basis of Claims for each of the noted claimants that lead the Panel to believe that the forms were, in some way, completed using the same person\/person(s) for assistance, or the same template. The claimant stated he did not have anyone help in completing his Basis of Claim form, and that he is not sure why the other Basis of Claim forms are stylistically like his own. The claimant was adamant that he completed the document himself, with the help of searching for advice online on how to initiate a claim in Canada. The claimant also stated that he completed the form using a shared computer at the residence, and that the documents were saved to the desktop of that computer and would have been available to the other residents. In this way, the claimant submits it is possible that other claimants reviewed his form and completed their documents in a similar fashion.\n[20] The Minister submits that the similar formatting may indicate that the claimant\u2019s claim is fabricated. I find there is insufficient evidence before me to demonstrate this to be the case on a balance of probabilities. Instead, while I do not accept the claimant\u2019s testimony that no one assisted him in completing his forms, I do not find this credibility concern undermines the otherwise detailed and credible testimony presented by the claimant in support of his allegations of political persecution and risk. Although the claimant was not forthcoming in explaining who assisted him in completing his form, I find that receiving assistance or following a stylistic template does not necessarily indicate that a claim is fabricated. Given the claimant was able to credibly testify to the contents of his allegations, I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the assistance in completing his Basis of Claim and narrative was limited to the stylistic approach and not a fabrication of its contents.\n[21] Informing this finding is the observation that the similarities between the claimant\u2019s Basis of Claim and the other claimants\u2019 documents relates to the stylistic completion of the form and narrative. The style of the answers to the questions in the Basis of Claim form itself are all similar, in capital letters and with the same countries listed in question 6. In contrast, in my review of the Basis of Claim forms disclosed pursuant to the Rule 21 Application, the actual content of the Basis of Claim forms \u2013 in particular, the chronology of the risk alleged by the claimant in the case before me \u2013 is unique to the claimant and not reiterated by any other claimant. While other claimants express risk for their political opinion and association with the NUP, the claimant was able to credibly testify to his specific experiences in Uganda. Given the country documents do indicate that NUP supporters face persecution in Uganda, I do not find it surprising that a dozen or so supporters have made their way to Canada to seek protection at a similar time, in light of the evidence that such supporters would require protection.\n[22] For that reason, while I agree with the Minister that there are striking similarities in the format of narrative of the claimant as compared with the other claimants, I find the contents are unique and supported by the claimant\u2019s credible testimony.\nSummary of Credibility Determination\n[23] My role is to assess the evidence before me to determine what has been established, on a balance of probabilities. Although I accept the claimant was not truthful about assistance received in the preparation of his BOC, I do not find this to be determinative of the credibility of his allegations of risk. I find there is enough credible evidence before me to establish, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant has been subjected threats, assaults and harassment in Uganda on the basis of his political opinion.\n[24] I find the claimant has established his subjective fears on a balance of probabilities.\nObjective Basis\n[25] The claimant\u2019s allegations of fear of persecution on his political opinion are supported by the objective documentary evidence. The panel finds the claimant\u2019s claim that he fears imprisonment, torture and death if he is returned to Uganda, at the hands of the NRM ruling party on the grounds of his political opinion and membership in the NUP opposition party, to be objectively well-founded.\n[26] Pertaining specifically to political opponents, there is evidence in the National Documentation Package (NDP), for example at item 2.1, that the government committed significant human rights issues including arbitrary killings; forced disappearance; torture; harsh and life-threatening prison conditions; arbitrary arrest or detention; political prisoners or detainees; serious restrictions on free expression and free restrictions on political participations. Opposition activists, local media, and human rights activists reported that security forces killed individuals the government identified as dissidents and those who participated in protests against the government.[viii]\n[27] The government continued to target political dissidents subjecting them to intimidation, harassment, arbitrary arrest and detention. There were reports, for example at item 2.2, of restrictions on the rights to freedom of expression, association, and peaceful assembly of political opposition members, journalists, human rights defenders, and students.[ix]\n[28] According to item 2.3, violations of freedom of association, assembly, and expression continued in 2019 as authorities introduced new regulations restricting online activities and stifling independent media. The government arrested political opponents and blocks political and student rallies.[x]\n[29] Based on the documents evidence cited above, I find that the claimant will face a serious possibility of in Uganda on the basis of his political opinion and involvement. I find that the claimant\u2019s fears are objectively well-founded.\nState Protection and Internal Flight Alternative\n[30] States are presumed capable of protecting their citizens. In this case, given the state is an agent of persecution I find the presumption has been rebutted. I find there is no state protection available to the claimant in Uganda.\n[31] Further, since the state is an agent of persecution and is in control of the entirety of its territory, I find the claimant faces a serious possibility of persecution throughout Uganda. I find there is no viable internal flight alternative available to the claimant in that country.\nCONCLUSION\n[32] Based on the above analysis, I find the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to s. 96 of the Act.

He is seeking protection pursuant to section 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (\u201cIRPA\u201d).[i]\nAdministrative Matters\n[2] The Minister intervened regarding credibility, identity and program integrity on April 05, 2019.\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] The allegations are fully set out in the claimant\u2019s Basis of Claim form and his narrative. In summary, the claimant alleges that that he will be harmed and may be killed by a Youth Congress member, XXXX XXXX, whose sister the claimant got pregnant out of wedlock, and the family considered their honour tarnished by the incident. Furthermore, he alleges fear of the Punjabi police acting at the behest of XXXX XXXX.\n[4] The claimant met a lady by the name of XXXX XXXX XXXX during his 11th grade schooling. They became attracted to each other and started meeting even after leaving the school. While the claimant was away studying in Singapore, he kept in contact with XXXX. On return to India in XXXX 2016, the claimant and XXXX continued their relationship and began meeting at one of the motels in secret.\n[5] In XXXX 2016, XXXX became pregnant. She told her mother of her relationship with the claimant, and her mother took her to a doctor for abortion. When XXXX father and XXXX (the brother) became aware of what had happened, XXXX went with some of his friends to look for the claimant at home, but he was absent.\n[6] On XXXX XXXX, 2016, while the claimant was returning home in the evening, he was accosted by two men who were instructed by XXXX to kill him. The claimant was beaten with hockey sticks and an acid was used to remove the tattoo of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The claimant was left for dead and passerby that saw him called the claimant\u2019s father who came and took him to the doctor for treatment.\n[7] After being discharged from hospital, the claimant was taken by his father to a friend\u2019s place in Ludhiana because XXXX had returned with some men to the claimant\u2019s residence threatening to kill him for tarnishing the reputation of his family, socially and politically.\n[8] The claimant\u2019s friend in Ludhiana advised him that he could not stay in hiding all his life and that relocation within India would be difficult. When he was also advised by a lawyer that he should leave the country to avoid honour killing, the claimant\u2019s friend got him an agent to help facilitate leaving India.\n[9] In XXXX 2017, the agent took the claimant to New Delhi and kept him in hiding. The agent later misplaced the claimant\u2019s passport but promised he would get him out of India. On XXXX XXXX 2017, the agent put the claimant on a flight to Canada on a passport with the name of XXXX XXXX. On arrival in Canada, the claimant was met at Vancouver Airport by the agent\u2019s representative who took the false passport from him after the claimant had cleared customs. The claimant was thereafter introduced to someone else who promised to find him work as well as arrange a permanent residency in Canada.\n[10] When the claimant tried to stay legally in Canada through work and explained his circumstances as well as fear of honour killing to his employer, he was advised to seek legal support. The claimant thereafter made an application for refugee protection.\nDETERMINATION\n[11] The panel finds that the claimant is a person in need of protection, pursuant to section 97(1)(b) of the IRPA, because, on a balance of probabilities, he would be subjected personally to a risk to his life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, should he return to India.\nANALYSIS\nMinister\u2019s Intervention\n[12] The Minister of Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada (the Minister) intervened in-writing in this matter on April 05, 2019.[ii]\n[13] The Minister noted that the claimant only had the following identity documents with him when he made his refugee claim: a unique identification authority of India card; a card from the electoral commission of India; a Punjab senior secondary school certificate; and a birth certificate that had a translated photocopy without the translator\u2019s attestation. The Minister therefore submitted that the claimant has not proven his identity having failed to produce a copy of his passport, or a copy of the passport as well as other travel documents with which he travelled into Canada under a false identity of Gurpreet Singh.\n[14] On May 16, 2022, as part of disclosures made by the claimant, he submitted a copy of his Indian passport to verify his identity. Same disclosure was made to the Minister and the panel did not receive any objections to the disclosure from the Minister.\nIdentity\n[15] The claimant\u2019s identity as a national of India has been established on a balance of probabilities by the sworn statement in his BOC form,[iii] his testimony, his XXXX card and school certificate,[iv] as well as a copy of his Indian passport.[v]\n\nNexus\n[16] The panel finds that the claimant has not established a nexus with a Convention ground. The claimant\u2019s fears do not arise from his political opinion, religion, race or nationality or membership in a particular social group.\n[17] The claimant is a victim of crime or personal vendetta. Those who targeted the claimant have done so out of revenge to teach his family a lesson, while the Punjab police have acted against the claimant at the behest of the agents of harm. The Court has held that victims of crime, corruption or vendettas, including blood feuds generally cannot establish a link between their fear of persecution and one of the five Convention grounds.[vi] The panel finds that there is nothing particular about this case which takes it outside these general principles.\n[18] The principal claimant fears future criminality which is not connected to one of the five Convention grounds. The panel therefore assessed his claim pursuant to section 97(1) of IRPA.\nCredibility\n[19] When a Claimant swears to the truth of allegations, this creates a presumption that those allegations are true unless there is a reason to doubt their truthfulness.[vii] However, this presumption does not extend to inferences, which are conclusions from facts, or speculation, which are allegations without any evidentiary basis.\n[20] In assessing the Claimant\u2019s credibility, the Panel has considered potential difficulties that the Claimant may face in giving his testimony including:\n\nthe impact of trauma,\ncultural and social factors,\nthe Claimant\u2019s age and educational background,\nthe unfamiliar hearing environment and the high-stakes nature of refugee proceedings.[21] On a balance of probabilities, the panel accepts the claimant\u2019s allegations as credible. There were no relevant inconsistencies in his testimony or contradictions between his testimony and the other evidence before the panel which have not been satisfactorily explained.\n[22] The claimant submitted numerous documents to substantiate his claim.[viii] These include:\n\nAn affidavit from the claimant\u2019s parents explaining that XXXX XXXX with unknown members of his party, and the police, have kept coming to them seeking the claimant\u2019s whereabout. The affidavit further stated that the efforts by the claimant\u2019s parents to reconcile with XXXX XXXX and family have been a failure.\nAffidavit from the claimant\u2019s friend in Ludhiana where he was taken by his father after receiving medical treatment on XXXX XXXX 2016.\nA medical report from XXXX XXXX that confirmed the injury the claimant received on XXXX XXXX 2016 \u2013 \u201chand burnt with acid, injury on forehead and face swollen\u201d \u2013 and the treatment he was provided.\nVarious media articles as objective evidence.Upon a review of these documents, the panel finds no reason to doubt their authenticity. The panel places significant weight on them as having probative values in substantiating the claimant\u2019s allegations.\n[23] The panel notes that the claimant first arrived in Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2017. He was asked why he did not make a claim then. The claimant testified that he knew very little about Canada and the immigration process. He stated that the agent that got him his visa arranged for someone to meet him in Vancouver who took the passport and documents he travelled with from him, and also arranged for him to start working at a company in Vancouver. He stated that he was told a permanent residence would be arranged for him. He testified that in XXXX 2018 when he asked his supervisor about his application for a permanent residence, and his passport was requested, he narrated how he came into Canada and was at that point advised that he had no legal status in Canada and should go to Montreal to seek advise.\n[24] The panel finds the claimant\u2019s explanation regarding his delay in claiming to be reasonable. The panel does not draw a negative inference regarding claimant\u2019s credibility.\nForward Facing Risk\n[25] The panel finds on a balance of probabilities that the claimant has been targeted by the Punjabi police at the behest of the family of XXXX XXXX XXXX who feels dishonored by the claimant\u2019s pre-marital relationship with their daughter that resulted in an aborted pregnancy.\n[26] According to Subsection 97(1)(b) of the IRPA, a person in need of protection is a person in Canada whose removal to their country or countries of nationality or, if they do not have a country of nationality, their country of former habitual residence, would subject them personally\n\nto a risk to their life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if\nthe person is unable or, because of that risk, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of that country,\nthe risk would be faced by the person in every part of that country and is not faced generally by other individuals in or from that country,\nthe risk is not inherent or incidental to lawful sanctions, unless imposed in disregard of accepted international standards, and\nthe risk is not caused by the inability of that country to provide adequate health or medical care.[ix][27] The risk to life, a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or death faced by the claimants is captured by subsection 97(1)(b) of the IRPA.\n[28] The initial basis for the risk arose from the claimant\u2019s pre-marital relationship family with XXXX XXXX XXXX whose family seek revenge against the claimant for dishonoring them.\n[29] The claimant has established on a balance of probability that he is personally at risk. The panel finds that the assault on the claimant in XXXX 2016 by two men who were instructed by XXXX to kill him, and the application of acid on the claimant\u2019s hand XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, indicates a high degree of the risk identified above.\n[30] Objective evidence corroborates the claimant\u2019s subjective fear of honor killing. It is reported that \u201c\u2018Honour killings\u2019 do take place in India in cases of alleged adultery, premarital relationships, rape or falling in love against family wishes\u201d.[x] Between 2014 and 2016, India\u2019s Supreme Court registered 288 cases of such killings.[xi] A report by the Law Commission of India indicates that honour-based violence are under-reported, and honour-related murders are often reported as suicides or as accidents. It is reported that the harmful traditional practise has remained persistent in the country.[xii]\n[31] Further objective evidence supports the claimant\u2019s fear of how the Indian police treat suspects. The prevalence of corruption within the Indian police and the judicial system is highlighted with bribery reported to be prevalent.[xiii] It is reported that unwarranted arrests and maltreatment during police detentions are regular occurrences in India.[xiv] All this documentary evidence serves as an objective basis for the claimant\u2019s fear and corroborates his allegations.\n[32] The panel finds that risk is not faced generally by other individuals in or from that country, as per section (97)(1)(b)(ii). The panel finds that the claimant has been targeted by XXXX XXXX XXXX family who has blamed the claimant for tarnishing the reputation of their family, socially and politically. They have gone further by influencing the Punjab police to seek the whereabout of the claimant. The panel finds that these circumstances change the nature of the claimant\u2019s risk from a generalized risk of indiscriminate crime or police harassment to a non-generalized risk particular to him.\n[33] Likewise, the panel finds that the risk faced by the claimant is neither inherent or incidental to lawful sanctions, as per section (97)(1)(b)(iii) since there is no evidence that he has committed a crime for which he is legally wanted, nor the risk the claimant faces caused by the inability of the country of reference to provide adequate health or medical care, as per section (97)(1)(b)(iv).\n[34] Based on the evidence before the panel, as well as the credible evidence of the claimant that he has been targeted by the police at the behest of XXXX brother and father, the panel finds that the claimant has established the objective basis of his claim and has further established on a balance of probabilities, that the risk he faces is one that is personal to him, and it is not a risk faced generally by the population of India.\nState Protection\n[35] The panel finds there is clear and convincing evidence that the state is unable or unwilling to provide the claimant with adequate protection.\n[36] States are presumed to be capable of protecting their citizens, except in situations where the country is in a state of complete breakdown. The responsibility to provide international (or surrogate) protection only becomes engaged when national or state protection is unavailable to the claimant. To rebut the presumption of state protection, a claimant must provide \u201cclear and convincing\u201d evidence of the state\u2019s inability to protect its citizens. A claimant is required to approach the state for protection if protection might reasonably be forthcoming. However, a claimant is not required to risk their life seeking ineffective protection of a state, merely to demonstrate that ineffectiveness.[xv]\n[37] The claimant testified that the Punjabi police have been to his parents\u2019 home to inquire about his whereabouts. He testified that he cannot live anywhere in India safely due to the quest by the family of XXXX to redeem their family dignity by killing him for impregnating their daughter, and their involvement of the Punjabi police in seeking his whereabouts. The claimant\u2019s parents attested in an affidavit, that the Punjab police are seeking the whereabout of the claimant under the influence of XXXX family. The panel has no evidence to indicate that the police search for the claimant, is consequent to his being charged with an offence relating to his relationship with XXXX.\n[38] Objective evidence indicates that the police, just like the judicial system, is riddled with corruption, with bribes and irregular payments exchanging hands in return for influencing the redress system and obtaining favourable court decisions.[xvi] It is reported that widespread human right abuses are conducted with impunity by the police. It is further reported these abuses include arbitrary detention, torture, kidnappings, and extra-judicial killings.[xvii]\n[39] Given the claimant\u2019s testimony, and the attestation from his parent, the panel concludes that on a balance of probabilities, the claimant faces persecution in the hands of the Punjabi police as agents of the state, at the behest of the family of XXXX XXXX XXXX.\n[40] The panel finds that the presumption of state protection is rebutted in this case. Since the state through the Punjabi police is an agent of persecution, the panel finds that it would be objectively unreasonable for the claimant to seek the protection of the state considering his particular circumstances.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[41] For a viable IFA to exist, two things must be the case. First, the claimants must not face a serious possibility of persecution or, on a balance of probabilities, a danger of torture, risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual punishment in the proposed IFA location. Second, it must not be objectively unreasonable in all the circumstances for the claimant to seek refuge there. Once an IFA has been proposed, the onus is on the claimant to establish that the proposed IFA is not viable. The standard of objective unreasonableness for a proposed IFA is high and requires proof of adverse conditions which would jeopardize the life and safety of the claimant in travelling to and in living in the proposed IFA location.[xviii]\n[42] The panel considered whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for the claimant in Dharamshala, Jaipur and New Delhi.\n[43] The panel finds that the claimant has established that on a balance of probabilities, he faces serious possibility of persecution in the proposed IFA.\nFirst Prong: Is it safe for the claimant to relocate in India?\n[44] The claimant was asked if he has been to Dharamshala, Jaipur or New Delhi before. He testified that he had been to New Delhi when the agent facilitated his exit from India. He was asked if either of the IFAs would be a safe location for him. The claimant testified that he fears that the XXXX family and the police will find him anywhere in India.\n[45] To assess whether the claimant would be at risk of harm in the IFA location, the panel considered whether the evidence indicates that the family of XXXX XXXX XXXX have the motivation and interest to continue pursuing the claimant.\n[46] The claimant was asked by why he believes that the XXXX brother and family would still be interested in harming him after more than three years, he testified that his parents told him the agents of harm went looking for him about three months ago. The claimant testified that XXXX family are politically active and influential. The claimant did not provide any evidence to establish how XXXX family would be able to influence the Youth Congress and the Congress Party in Dharamshala, Jaipur or New Delhi to harm him.\n[47] The panel further considered whether the agents of persecution have the means to locate the claimant. The claimant testified that if he were to move to any of the proposed IFAs, he would have to submit identifications before he is able to rent an accommodation and that such identification would be subjected to verification with the police in Punjab. He further testified that as soon as the local police receives information about his whereabout, XXXX family would be aware of his location. He stated that XXXX family would then utilise their connections with the Youth Congress and the National Congress Party to influence the police to arrest the claimant wherever he is.\n[48] The panel accepts the claimant\u2019s allegations that he has been targeted by Punjabi police at the behest of XXXX family. Although the claimant did not provide any evidence to establish that he is legally and officially wanted by the police, the panel is mindful of objective evidence that \u201cpolice authorities in India are able to track and locate persons of interest, depending on the heinousness of the crime and the pressure received from political authorities\u201d.[xix] It is reported that the police in India are susceptible to endemic corruption which results in the undue influence of the police by those able to afford bribes that may be demanded.[xx] Even though the tenant registration system is noted as limited in its effectiveness, it is reported that it can be used to verify the history of any tenant \u201cwhether the person had any criminal involvement or absconding from other states\u201d[xxi].\n[49] Based on the testimony that XXXX family together have been seeking the claimant\u2019s whereabout to redeem the perceived tarnished image of their family, the objective evidence already cited about honor killings in India, and the allegations that the Punjab police are seeking to know the claimant\u2019s whereabout at the behest of XXXX family, the panel finds that on a balance of probabilities, XXXX family have sufficient interest and motivation to continue to seek the claimant\u2019s whereabout in India.\n[50] Furthermore, the panel finds on a balance of probabilities that if the claimant\u2019s identity is verified through the tenant registration system with the Punjab police, the Punjab police under obligation to XXXX family may divulge knowledge of the claimant\u2019s location in India, thereby providing a means for XXXX family as agents of persecution to locate and harm the claimant in the proposed IFAs.\n[51] Based on the evidence before it, the panel finds that the claimant has provided sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the agents of persecution are motivated and have the capacity to locate and harm him in the proposed IFA. Accordingly, the panel finds that the claimant does face a serious possibility of persecution in India.\n[52] Given the findings on the first prong of the IFA test, the panel finds that there is no viable internal flight alternative for the claimant within his country, and there is no need to examine the second prong of the IFA test.\nCONCLUSION\n[53] Considering the preceding, the panel concludes that the claimant has established that he is a person in need of protection, pursuant to section 97(1)(b) of the IRPA. The panel therefore accepts his claim.\n(signed) Olukunle Ojeleye\nSeptember 27, 2022\n\n[i] Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n\n[ii] Exhibit 4.\n\n[iii] Exhibit 2.\n\n[iv] Exhibit 1.\n\n[v] Exhibit 5.\n\n[vi] Kang, Hardip Kaur v.

These are the reasons for the decision in the claim of XXXX XXXX, a citizen of Nepal, who is seeking protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. In rendering my reasons today, I have considered and applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guidelines on women refugee claimants fearing gender related persecution.\nAllegations\n[2] The claimant\u2019s allegations are contained in full in her Basis of Claim form and very detailed narrative which can be found in Exhibit 2. Summarized only briefly, the claimant alleges that she is at risk of persecution in Nepal from persons associated or affiliated with Maoist groups because of her involvement with and support of the Nepal Women\u2019s Association which is women network of the Nepali Congress Party. The claimant is a known women\u2019s rights activist in Nepal. The claimant alleges that she has been threatened, extorted and physically attacked by Maoist persons in the past and that the attackers continue to pursue her in that country.\nDetermination\n[3] I find the claimant is a Convention refugee. I find the claimant has established her claim has a nexus to the Convention ground of political opinion. I have therefore assessed this claim under section 96 of the Act.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[4] I find the claimant has established her identity on a balance of probabilities by her testimony and by the copy of her passport which can be found in Exhibit 1.\nCredibility\n[5] Pursuant to the Maldonado principle, the claimant benefits from a presumption that her allegations are true. In this case, I have no reason to doubt the truthfulness of the claimant. She testified in a straightforward manner and there were no relevant inconsistencies in her testimony or contradictions between her testimony and the other evidence before me. She was detailed, passionate, consistent, forthcoming. Overall, I found the claimant to be a compelling witness and I believe what she has alleged.\n[6] The claimant also supported her allegations with significant evidence, including plenty of identification documents, certificates for work and promoting the rights of women in Nepal and for her involvement in politics, photographs of the claimant at political events including events where she was receiving honours, membership documents for the Women Network of the Nepali Congress Party, a copy of a press release by the Nepali Congress Party relating to the claimant\u2019s work in Nepali, a threat letter from a communist party of Nepal, police report, medical records, and a supporting statement from the claimant\u2019s husband. I have no reason to doubt the authenticity of these documents. I assign them significant weight as they help establish the material elements of the claimant\u2019s allegations, namely her political opinion and the risks she faces in Nepal on the basis of this opinion.\n[7] I have considered whether the claimant\u2019s failure to claim in Canada and her subsequent twice return to Nepal undermines the credibility of the claimant\u2019s subjective fear and I find it does not. The claimant made two trips to Canada before her current trip where she made her claim for protection. She first arrived in Canada in XXXX 2018 and returned to Nepal in XXXX 2018. On the second trip, she arrived in Canada in XXXX 2019 and again returned to Nepal in XXXX 2020. The claimant finally fled for the last time in XXXX 2020.\n[8] The claimant testified that her first return was because her visa had run out in Canada and she was hopeful the situation would have tempered in Nepal after a period of time had passed. She states she was hopeful because there had been no indications that Maoist persons had been pursuing her since leaving Nepal. Further, the claimant testified that her second return was because her husband had been in a serious motorcycle accident and she had no choice but to return to care for him and her family. She also testified to having read about Maoist members being arrested by the state. During the last trip to Nepal, the claimant took efforts to minimize her movements. Unfortunately, it was during this second trip when the claimant herself was viciously assaulted and hospitalized by Maoist persons.\n[9] While it is disappointing that the claimant would return to a country that she fears, I find that ultimately the evidence before me does establish on a balance that the claimant subjectively fears a return to Nepal and that she has been targeted by Maoist factions for her political activism. On a balance of probabilities and in considering the circumstances of this case, I find it reasonable that the claimant would be hopeful that the situation would become safer in Nepal. I also accept that she believed, however misplaced, that her risk had subsided at the time that she returned for the first time. Obviously, for me it\u2019s clear that she\u2019s passionate about the work she does in Nepal. I also find that in the face of an exceptional family emergency, her return to care for her husband and her family was reasonable. I do not make a negative inference against the claimant for her failure to claim in Canada earlier or for her return to Nepal in light of the circumstances of this case.\n[10] I find the claimant has established her subjective fear and risk profile on a balance of probabilities. I find the claimant is a political activist in Nepal and a supporter of the Women\u2019s Association and vis-a-vie the Congress Party. I find she has a higher profile, given she has been publicly acknowledged for her political work. I find she has been targeted by Maoist persons threatened, assaulted and extorted. Further, I find these agents of persecution do continue to pursue and threaten the claimant in Nepal and that she fears persecution by these groups should she return.\nObjective Basis\n[11] The country condition evidence is outlined in the National Documentation Package (NDP) which is in Exhibit 3 and supports the claimant\u2019s allegations regarding the treatment of political members of the Nepal Congress such as the claimant herself. In Item 4.7 of the NDP, sources report that factions of Maoists described as a dissenting splinter group from the ruling Maoist party engaged in a pattern of kidnapping and extortion against various targets. Item 4.6 of the NDP likewise details instances of violence and extortion committed by a number of groups in Nepal, including the youth communist league which the claimant spoke about today and the Nepal Communist Party of Maoist individuals. It goes on to note that political pressure and corruption means that law enforcement is largely not able to serve the public or protect them. These attacks were often against supporters of the Nepali Congress Party like the claimant herself.\n[12] According to Item 4.4 of the NDP, political incidents were the primary driver of violent incidents in Nepal and also made up the majority of non-violent incidents. This report notes activities by Maoist splinter groups to attempt to disrupt the election processes. Moreover, as of 2019, the situation in Nepal is growing worse with an increase of both violent and non-violence incidents.\n[13] According to an RIR at Item 4.7 of the NDP, a hard line communist faction of Maoists have been involved in kidnapping and extortion. The faction of Biplav Maoists make coercive demands for donation. The extent is under-reported as victims do not seek \u2014 often do not seek the assistance of police out of fear of a violent backlash from the Maoist groups. Party cadres have made threatening visits, phone calls and sent letters and texts seeking funds. Biplav Maoists have also captured land from civilians and companies.\n[14] Given these country conditions and how they do corroborate material elements of the claimant\u2019s allegations herself, I find the claimant\u2019s fear of persecution because of her political opinion has an objective basis and is well-founded and forward facing.\nState Protection\n[15] There is a presumption that countries can protect their citizens unless there\u2019s clear and convincing evidence otherwise. In this case, based on the aforementioned objective evidence, I find that there is clear and convincing evidence that the state is unable or unwilling to provide the claimant with adequate protection. As another example, Item 1.6 of the NDP states \u201cpolice effectiveness is limited by a lack of resources, corruption, nepotism and a culture of impunity, particularly among low-level officers. Nepali police agencies are hindered by a lack of adequate transportation, training and equipment\u201d. NDP Item 1.6 also states that many Nepalese have only limited access to justice and that courts are vulnerable to political pressure, bribery and intimidation.\n[16] In light of the circumstances and based on the objective evidence, I find that the adequate state protection would not be forthcoming to the claimant in Nepal. I note that the claimant did seek state protection on a number of occasions and the country condition evidence that I\u2019ve already cited applied in her case as well. I find the presumption of state protection therefore has been rebutted.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[17] I have also considered whether there is a viable Internal Flight Alternative available to this claimant. Based on the evidence in this file including a lack of reasonable state protection persisting throughout the country and the Maoist influence that continues also throughout the country, I find the claimant faces a serious possibility of persecution throughout Nepal. Further, I find the agents of persecution have demonstrated an ongoing motivation to continue to pursue this claimant in Nepal. I find, therefore, that she does not have a viable IFA in that country.\nCONCLUSION\n[18] Based on the foregoing analysis, I find the claimant is a Convention refugee and I accept her claim.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n",

In summary, in 2004 she married a man named XXXX XXXX (XXXX) and had two daughters with him. However, through means such as recording his conversations, the claimant learned by 2013 that XXXX is gay. XXXX was threatened by this and told the claimant to move out, and he said that if the claimant told anyone about his sexuality, he would kill her.\n[4] XXXX divorced the claimant; the divorce was finalized in XXXX 2014, with XXXX having full custody of their children. The claimant continued receiving phone calls from XXXX threatening that he would kill her if she tried to come near their daughters or if she told anyone about his sexuality. In XXXX 2014, the claimant met a man named XXXX XXXX (XXXX) who lived in the United States of America (USA) and was visiting his father in Lebanon. They began dating.\n[5] In XXXX 2015, the claimant went to the USA, and soon her mother, brothers and sister also moved there. The claimant reconciled with XXXX, and in XXXX 2015 they were married. XXXX applied to sponsor the claimant as a US permanent resident, but this application was denied twice, in 2018 and in XXXX 2019. The second denial letter said that XXXX had gone on vacation with another woman. This notice ended their marriage, and the claimant returned to her parents\u2019 house in Michigan.\n[6] The claimant realized that she would be forced to return to Lebanon, and she was barred from making a refugee claim in the USA. She decided to come to Canada, and on XXXX XXXX, 2019, she entered Canada irregularly by boat. She alleges that she cannot return to Lebanon, as she fears violence and persecution by XXXX and his contacts, and because she would be at risk as a divorced woman in Lebanon.\nDecision\n[7] I find that the claimant is a refugee, pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA, as there exists a serious possibility of persecution, should she return to Lebanon, on account of being a member of a particular social group as a woman fearing gender-based persecution.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[8] I find that the claimant\u2019s identity as a national of Lebanon is established by the documents provided, particularly a certified true copy of her passport in Exhibit 1.\n[9] I note that the claimant lived in the USA from XXXX 2015 to XXXX 2019. However, this does not constitute a country of reference, considering the evidence that she only had temporary status in that country.\nCredibility\n[10] When a claimant swears to the truth of certain allegations, this creates a presumption that those allegations are true unless there be reason to doubt their truthfulness.[3] However this presumption does not apply to inferences or speculation.\n[11] I find the claimant to be a credible witness and therefore believe what she alleged in support of her claim. She testified in a straightforward manner, and there were no relevant inconsistencies in her testimony or contradictions between her testimony and the other evidence before me.\n[12] I note that the claimant did not seek asylum in the USA when she was there from XXXX 2015 to XXXX 2019. However, the claimant\u2019s evidence is that she married XXXX, an American citizen, in XXXX 2015, and he sponsored her for permanent residence as his spouse. By the time U.S. authorities denied their application for the second time, in XXXX 2019, the claimant was barred from making an asylum claim because more than one year had elapsed following her entry to the USA. This is consistent with my understanding of USA immigration law, so this explanation seems reasonable in the claimant\u2019s alleged circumstances, and therefore does not raise significant concerns with respect to subjective fear or credibility. I find it was reasonable for the claimant not to apply for asylum during this time, because she married a U.S. citizen and she had status while waiting for a decision about her application for permanent residence.\n[13] The claimant disclosed documents in support of her claim. These include, in Exhibit 5, a translated divorce certificate at pages 5-6, a translated letter from her sister XXXX at pages 48-51, a translated letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX at pages 52-54, a letter from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to XXXX at pages 8-15, and copies of counselling and psychotherapy records. In Exhibit 6, the claimant disclosed a photograph of herself with a translation of the handwritten caption. The divorce certificate corroborates the claimant\u2019s relationship with XXXX, and the two letters from XXXX and XXXX both corroborate the threats from XXXX to which the claimant was subjected. The U.S. immigration letter corroborates the claimant\u2019s activities in the USA and the reasons she left for Canada. The counselling and psychotherapy records also corroborate the claimant\u2019s account of her treatment by XXXX and her fear of returning to Lebanon, and the photograph corroborates the claimant\u2019s description of a threatening note that was left on her door in XXXX 2015. After reviewing the documents, I have no reasons to doubt their authenticity.\n[14] Considering the evidence, I find on a balance of probabilities that the claimant endured a history of mistreatment from XXXX including physical violence, and that he divorced the claimant while keeping custody of their children. I find that the claimant believes XXXXto be gay or bisexual, and that XXXXhas threatened the claimant multiple times, including threats to kill her, if she discusses his sexuality or if she tries to see their daughters.\nObjective basis\n[15] The objective evidence provides support for the allegation that XXXXfears being perceived as a gay man in Lebanon.\n[16] Item 6.4 in the National Documentation Package (NDP) notes how the LGBTQ community is ostracised in Lebanon. While there may be growing acceptance in Beirut, the report also describes police abuses against LGBTQ individuals, raids on LGBTQ establishments, and it states that LGBTQ individuals are unable to live openly in Beirut without facing severe harassment and discrimination. \u201cHomosexuality in Lebanon is illegal, and social stigma of same-sex relationships persists, especially in conservative areas.\u201d[4]\n[17] Item 6.5 in the NDP reiterates much of this and notes that LGBTQ individuals are highly vulnerable to both state and social violence because of their sexual orientation. This report also talks about the risk of individuals who are part of the LGBTQ community to face family violence, which may include death threats, physical abuse, or being shunned.\n[18] I find, based on the objective evidence, that the claimant has a well-founded fear of persecution based on her status as a woman in Lebanon. Gender-based violence in Lebanon is tolerated, ignored, and perpetuated in Lebanese society. The claimant\u2019s BOC and testimony referred to multiple incidents of verbal and physical abuse by XXXX, who also controlled other aspects of her life such as not wanting her to finish high school. XXXXthreats continued after they divorced, even when she changed her phone number, and the claimant fears that he will one day follow through with his death threats.\n[19] This past abuse demonstrates a prospect of continued violence that can be characterized as serious, sustained, and systematic human rights violations amounting to persecution. As the claimant\u2019s fear of persecution is based on her membership in a particular social group, her allegations form a nexus to the Convention. The objective evidence corroborates the fact that gender-based violence in Lebanon is a serious problem.\n[20] A Response to Information Request (RIR) cites an estimate that one woman a month is killed by a family member in Lebanon, usually her husband.[5] It goes on to state that gender-based violence is serious and widespread, and women are also victims of discrimination both in law and practice. Furthermore, women cannot depend on family to prevent violence as they rarely receive their family\u2019s support. Finally, the RIR finds that customs and beliefs have \u2018normalized\u2019 violence against women in Lebanon.\n[21] The RIR indicates that Lebanese women are victims of discrimination in both law and practice. It describes how there are no official statistics on domestic violence in Lebanon and cites a UN report stating that \u201cgender-based violence is prevalent in Lebanon in different forms, including domestic\/marital physical, sexual and psychological violence.\u201d The RIR quotes another source who states that \u201cthere was a broad consensus that domestic violence, including spousal abuse, was a serious and widespread problem in the country.\u201d[6]\n[22] The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) reports that until recently, discussion of gender-based violence was subject to strong taboos, considered to be private and a matter of concern only for religious courts.[7] It indicates that there are no official national statistics on the prevalence of gender-based violence and notes that the issue of violence against women is largely ignored by local and religious authorities. The report goes on to describe how \u201chonour crimes\u201d are difficult to measure, but 66 women were identified as being murdered in an \u201chonour crime\u201d over an 8-year period.[8]\n[23] The U.S. Department of State (DOS) reports that the law criminalizes domestic violence, calls for provision of shelters, gives women the ability to file a restraining order against the abuser, and assigns special units within the ISF to receive domestic violence complaints. However, although the law provides for a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison for battery, religious courts could cite personal status law to require a battered wife to return to a home shared with her abuser. Some police, especially in rural areas, treated domestic violence as a social, rather than criminal, matter.[9]\n[24] The Australia Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) states that according to international observers, despite many advantages and acquired rights, women in Lebanon continue to face discrimination at numerous levels.[10] It reports that a Domestic Violence Law was passed in 2014, but a March 2018 Human Rights Watch (HRW) report noted that the Domestic Violence Law did not require religious courts to adhere to civil court rulings relating to domestic violence, leaving women trapped in abusive marriages; and that some religious courts issue obedience and cohabitation rulings against women, requiring them to return to the marital home.\n[25] Documents disclosed by the claimant also support the risk to the claimant as a woman in Lebanon. One February 2021 article at pages 7-9 of Exhibit 5 notes that, according to the Internal Security Forces (ISF), \u201ccases of domestic violence against women skyrocketed by 96% during Lebanon\u2019s strictest lockdown.\u201d A December 2021 article at pages 10-15 of Exhibit 5 reported that figures shared by the ISF said that domestic violence reports in Lebanese homes doubled in the previous year. The article quoted one lawyer who said, \u201cWe have never witnessed this much violence against women.\u201d\n[26] The evidence reveals that domestic violence in Lebanon is widespread. Based on the past violence suffered by the claimant, the threats to harm her further and the treatment of women in Lebanon generally, I find that there is a serious possibility of persecution if she returns to her country.\nState Protection\n[27] I find that there is no operationally effective state protection for the claimant in Lebanon.\n[28] While the U.S. DOS report for Lebanon at item 2.1, indicates that Lebanon criminalizes domestic violence, the law provides for shelters and protections, and Lebanon is making progress in improving the police and judicial management of domestic cases, the report also states that \u201cNGOs and activists criticized the domestic violence law, claiming that it does not sufficiently protect victims or punish abusers, who they alleged often received disproportionately light sentences.\u201d[11]\n[29] The RIR at item 5.2 quotes a report that states that \u201cin most cases, police ignored complaints submitted by battered or abused women.\u201d Another source stated that \u201ceven tough\nwomen could theoretically go to a police station in order to submit a complaint against anyone who subjects them to violence, it rarely happens because women know that they do not have legal protection against domestic violence\u201d and that source goes on to indicate that police often do not take complaints of these women seriously.[12] This is consistent with the claimant\u2019s testimony that following one incident when XXXXhit and threatened her in about 2014, she went to the police to make a written complaint, but they made excuses and did not help.\n[30] The OECD report at item 5.3 indicates that while some shelters exist that are run by NGOs, overall capacity to house victims is limited. The report also indicates concerns with the lengthy process required for a woman to obtain a protection order in the country.[13]\n[31] The country condition documents indicate that the government in Lebanon has taken steps with respect to gender-based violence. I considered that state protection does not mean that the state must provide perfect protection or always be successful in providing protection, but that it must be adequate. However, the country conditions documents, as a whole, indicate that those steps have not translated to operationally effective state protection.\n[32] Given the country conditions, I find that the claimant has rebutted the presumption of state protection with clear and convincing evidence establishing that there is no operationally effective state protection available to her in Lebanon.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[33] I also examined whether a viable internal flight alternative (IFA) exists for the claimant. Potential IFA locations of Tripoli and Tyre were identified at the start of the hearing. The test is comprised of two prongs, both of which must be satisfied before an internal flight alternative can be found. The first is that the claimant is not at risk of persecution, torture, or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in the internal flight location; the second is that it is not objectively unreasonable for the claimant to relocate there.\n[34] The second prong of the IFA test may be stated as follows: would it be unduly harsh to expect the claimant to move to another, less hostile part of the country before seeking refugee status abroad? The courts have set a very high threshold for what makes an IFA unreasonable in all the circumstances. (Thirunavukkarasu [1994] 1 F.C. 589 (C.A.))\n[35] On the evidence before me, I find that it would be objectively unreasonable for the claimant, in all the circumstances, including those specific to her, to relocate to another place in Lebanon.\n[36] In North America the claimant worked XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, but as of the hearing date, she is a 39-year-old high school graduate who has never held a job in Lebanon. The only relative she has remaining in Lebanon is a sister, who is trying to leave the country. The claimant\u2019s ability to support herself in another city is therefore quite limited, particularly given income inequality and other disadvantages women experience.\n[37] The claimant testified that Lebanon is a small country and anywhere she went, XXXXwould find out. She said that XXXXhas acquaintances and contacts at the airport and in the government, and her counsel submits that eventually someone will recognize the claimant and tell XXXXof her whereabouts.\n[38] The 2021 World Factbook for Lebanon found at item 1.5 indicates that Lebanon is a small country, approximately 10K square KMs, which is described as one-third the size of the state of Maryland, and roughly 5.5M people with the majority living in the capital Beirut.[14]\n[39] The DFAT report referred to earlier considers the ability of single women such as the claimant to relocate:\nDFAT assesses that the ease with which an individual is able to relocate internally depends to a large degree on their individual circumstances, including whether they have family or community connections in the intended area of relocation, and their financial situation. Internal relocation is generally easier for men and family groups. Single women, particularly those fleeing family violence, are less likely to have access to sufficient support services and are likely to face societal discrimination in the form of harassment, particularly in rural and more conservative areas.[15]\n[40] Given the size of Lebanon, the threats against the claimant, the fact that the claimant and her ex-husband are still in contact with their children, the prevalence of violence against women, and the lack of state protection noted previously, I find that the claimant would face a serious possibility of persecution throughout Lebanon. Accordingly, I find that there is no internal flight alternative available to the claimant in Lebanon.\nConclusion\n[41] Having considered all the evidence, I conclude that the claimant is a refugee, pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA. Accordingly, I accept her claim.\n(signed) Douglas Armstrong\nAugust 23, 2022\n\n[1] Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n[2] Exhibit 2.\n[3] Maldonado v.

        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2022 RLLR 16\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: May 11, 2022\nPanel: Katarina Bogojevic\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Mo Vayeghan\nCountry: Morocco\nRPD Number: VC1-06901\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2022-01960\nATIP Pages: N\/A\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] This is the decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) in the claim of XXXX XXXX as a citizen of Morocco who is claiming refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (the \u201cAct\u201d).[1]\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] The claimant\u2019s allegations are contained in his Basis of Claim (\u201cBOC\u201d) form.[2] The claimant is a citizen of Morocco who fears harm at the hands of authorities, society and his family because of his sexual orientation and because he has refused to be a practicing Muslim. He also fears gang members who have threatened to kill him because his brother informed on them while he was in prison.\nDETERMINATION\n[3] I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the Act.\n[4] In making this determination, I have reviewed and applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9: Proceedings before the IRB Involving Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Expression, and Sex Characteristics.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[5] I find that the claimant\u2019s identity as a national of Morocco is established on a balance of probabilities by his sworn testimony and the copy of his Moroccan passport and identification in evidence.[3]\nCountry of Reference\n[6] There was a question at the start of the hearing concerning whether the claimant might have a right to Algerian citizenship. The claimant was born in Morocco, but his parents were both born in Algeria.\n[7] The Algerian Nationality Law Article 6 (1) states that an individual born to an Algerian father is considered a national by descent.[4] As such, I would need to know the claimant\u2019s father\u2019s nationality to confirm whether the claimant has a right to Algerian citizenship.\n[8] I questioned the claimant about his citizenship and that of his parents. The claimant indicated they are all Moroccan. He stated that his parents were born in Algeria but are Moroccan and during Algerian independence they were displaced and sent back to Morocco. He indicated that he does not know what their status was in Algeria or why they were there. He has only met one of his grandparents and she is Moroccan.\n[9] During his counsel\u2019s questioning, the claimant confirmed that his parents are not Algerian citizens. When I asked him how he knew this, he said that he had seen on his mother\u2019s ID card when he was younger that she was born in Algeria and at that time he had asked her whether she had nationality there or a passport or any papers and she said no. He said he asked his father the same thing.\n[10] The claimant has not provided any affidavits or information from his parents concerning their Algerian citizenship. However, given that his allegations identify his father as an agent of harm, I find this to be reasonable. I asked the claimant whether he had tried to go to the Algerian consulate to ask about his status and he said that he had not. The claimant was sent a copy of the Algerian Nationality Law prior to the hearing; thus he would have been aware the question of his Algerian citizenship was in issue. However, I acknowledge that this was only sent three days prior to the hearing of this matter and so I find it reasonable that the claimant did not take these steps prior to the hearing.\n[11] Having reviewed all the evidence before me, I find on a balance of probabilities that Algeria is not a country of reference. While the claimant does not know much about his parents\u2019 status in Algeria, he did testify that they told him when he was younger that they did not have any nationality there. He also testified that his parents were displaced by the Algerian government back to Morocco, suggesting that they did not have any form of permanent status in Algeria.\nNexus\n[12] In order to satisfy the definition of a \u201cConvention refugee\u201d found in section 96 of the Act, a claimant must establish that he or she has a well-founded fear of persecution by reason of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion.\n[13] The claimant has alleged three different risks in this case. However, I have found the claimant\u2019s sexual orientation to be determinative of his claim. As such, for the purposes of this decision I have focused solely on the claimant\u2019s allegation concerning his sexual orientation. This allegation is connected to the convention on the basis of membership in a particular social group, namely sexual minorities. As such, I have assessed his claim under section 96.\nCredibility\n[14] When a claimant affirms to tell the truth, this creates a presumption of truthfulness unless there is evidence to the contrary. A finding that the claimant lacks credibility may be based on the failure of the claimant\u2019s account to stand up to scrutiny, or unexplained inconsistencies, omissions or contradictions.\n[15] In this case, the claimant provided a very sparse BOC narrative in which he identified that his father wanted to harm him because he was no longer a practicing Muslim and was gay, and that he was threatened by a gang member due to his brother\u2019s involvement in the drug trade. In his narrative, he referenced back to a submission letter written by his former counsel. The letter provided by counsel was in the form of submissions and not written in the claimant\u2019s words, as such, it could not be adopted by the claimant as his BOC narrative or evidence.\n[16] Prior to the hearing, the claimant\u2019s counsel was sent a letter identifying that former counsel\u2019s letter would be considered advanced submissions and outlining the requirements of a BOC. The claimant did not submit an updated BOC statement prior to the hearing, and he did not indicate that he needed to make any amendments to the BOC at the start of the hearing.\n[17] Despite this, I have found the claimant to be a credible witness concerning his sexual orientation. Both myself and his counsel questioned the claimant on his sexual orientation and the claimant\u2019s testimony remained consistent throughout with no major omissions or contradictions. I have also relied on Guideline 9 in making my credibility findings.\n[18] The claimant testified credibly about having a difficult childhood filled with mocking and sarcasm because of the way he dressed and spoke. This is supported by an affidavit from the claimant\u2019s uncle (his mother\u2019s brother).[5] This bullying increased when he was around 15 or 16, after which time the claimant was involved in weekly fights. He tried to change the things about him that made him look gay and avoided talking about his sexual needs. The claimant had only two friends in school, and they were gay. One left school and the claimant lost communication with him and the other one had to change schools because of the bullying, fights, and mockery.\n[19] The claimant testified that he realized he was gay when he was around 14 or 15 years old. He had had feelings prior to this but was not sure. It was at this time that he noticed that he was attracted to another boy at his school and that he did not have the same feelings towards women that his friends did. The claimant was genuine when he described that the first impression that he had when he realized that he was gay was that there was something wrong inside of him. Later, when he came to Canada and saw how the LGBTQ community lived freely and happily, he realized that the problem was not with him but with his country and community.\n[20] The claimant also credibly testified about his same-sex relationships. The first occurring when he was about 15 years old. The claimant and his boyfriend at the time had a difficult time continuing their relationship and keeping it secret. They decided to separate after a short time because of the pressure on their relationship and the concern that they would be found out. The claimant was nervous to start any other relationships in Morocco because he felt that they would end the same way as his first.\n[21] The claimant had one relationship in Canada. He met this individual in the gym at the beginning of the pandemic. The relationship did not last because they were not able to meet very often, however they continue to be friends. The claimant credibility testified about how this individual did not know that he was gay when they first met and that he felt that their relationship was special because it helped him to realize his sexual orientation. I asked the claimant whether he had asked this individual to write an affidavit in support of his claim and he said he did not. He offered to obtain this affidavit post-hearing; however, I find that any weight that I could place on such evidence would be limited given it is being provided after the hearing has already been conducted.\n[22] Initially the claimant did have some difficulties answering his counsel\u2019s questions related to his sexual activities. He first stated that had not had sexual relationships with men, and then later said that he had. Then he stated that he was only able to meet with his boyfriend in Morocco during school hours and not outside of school. But he later said that they had sex at his boyfriend\u2019s house but were not able to go out in public. I acknowledge these inconsistencies; however, I rely on Guideline 9 section 3.3:\nMany SOGIESC individuals conceal their SOGIESC in their country of reference out of mistrust or fear of repercussion by state and non-stat actors, or due to previous experiences of stigmatization and violence. These circumstances may manifest themselves as an individual being reluctant to discuss or having difficulty discussing their SOGIESC with a member based on fear or general mistrust of authority figures, particularly where intolerance or punishment of SOGIESC individuals are sanctioned by state officials in an individual\u2019s country of reference.\n[23] In this case I found counsel\u2019s questioning about the claimant\u2019s sexual activity to be very direct and it appeared to make the claimant uncomfortable. The claimant comes from a background of having to hide his sexual orientation for fear of reprisal and physical harm. This is the first time that he was speaking openly to authority figures about his sexual orientation in a formal setting. The questions that he was being asked were very intimate. As such, I find on a balance of probabilities that the claimant\u2019s difficulty in answering questions concerning his sexual activity can be attributed to the reasoning identified above and does not negatively impact his credibility concerning his sexual orientation. Further, I find that the claimant\u2019s sexual activity is not determinative of his sexual orientation and that the claimant was credible concerning other elements of his relationships as outlined above.\n[24] I have also considered the claimant\u2019s documentary evidence which is corroborative of his claim. Particularly the letters from his brother-in-law, sister, and friends and neighbours here in Canada which all identify the claimant\u2019s sexual orientation.[6] I acknowledge that the claimant\u2019s uncle\u2019s letter does not explicitly state that the claimant is gay. I find that this is reasonable given the fact that the claimant hid his sexual orientation in Morocco. I have no reason to doubt the veracity of these support letters.\n[25] The claimant submitted two letters from a deputy Imam at his mosque.[7] In one of these letters the deputy Imam describes that the claimant told him that he was \u201calmost gay\u201d and says that he was convinced at that time that he was gay. I place no weight on these letters as I find on a balance of probabilities that they are fraudulent. When questioned about them the claimant first said that he got them personally from the deputy Imam. When it was pointed out to him that the letters were dated after he was in Canada, he said that he must have been mistaken and that his mom obtained these letters. I find it unreasonable that the claimant would have forgotten whether he was the one that personally obtained these letters from the deputy Imam. When I asked why there were two, he said that the deputy Imam gave them two letters to choose from and that his sister accidentally sent both in as part of his evidence. The claimant was not able to explain why the deputy Imam provided two letters. I find that this puts these letters further into question as the claimant had testified that he did not have a strong relationship with the deputy Imam.\n[26] For the foregoing reasons, I find that the letters are fraudulent and place no weight in them. However, while the claimant may have submitted these fraudulent letters to bolster his claim, I do not find that this alone is sufficient to rebut the presumption of credibility with regards to the claimant\u2019s sexual orientation. While these letters briefly mention the claimant\u2019s presumed sexual orientation, they mainly focus on the claimant\u2019s allegation regarding not being a practicing Muslim. I therefore find that the fraudulent nature of these letters speaks more to the claimant\u2019s credibility regarding his religion rather than his sexual orientation. There are several other supporting letters provided by the claimant from family, friends and neighbours in Canada that explicitly identify his sexual orientation which I find to be genuine. These letters are varied, each has a unique voice and uses different language, they are all signed and provide the contact information of the letter writer. Pursuant to Guideline 9 part 3, I find it reasonable that the claimant would be able to obtain more reliable information concerning his sexual orientation from individuals in Canada, given that he was concealing his sexual orientation in Morocco. Further the claimant\u2019s testimony regarding his sexual orientation was authentic and consistent throughout the hearing. As such, I find the claimant to be credible regarding his sexual orientation.\nSubjective Fear\n[27] The claimant went to visit his sister in Canada in 2016. It was at that time when he first realized that he could live freely as a gay man in Canada. However, he was still in school, so he returned to Morocco, but thought about going back to Canada once he finished school. The claimant fled Morocco at the time that he did because things came to a head with his father. The claimant had been getting in regular fights at school and the principle contacted his father and told him about the rumours that the claimant was gay. It was at this time that the claimant\u2019s father became convinced that the claimant was gay, and the claimant revealed his sexual orientation to his father. This resulted in a serious argument during which his father tried to beat him. He asked his sister for help, and she bought tickets for him and his mother (who was supportive of him) to come to Canada. The claimant did not try to leave earlier because he had not revealed his sexual orientation prior to this and was still trying to hide it to fit in with his community. I find the claimant\u2019s explanation regarding why he did not leave Morocco sooner to be reasonable and that it does not negatively impact his subjective fear. The claimant was young and trying to hide his sexual orientation.\n[28] When he came to Canada the claimant was not aware of the option to ask for asylum until he consulted with counsel sometime in 2019. The claimant\u2019s visitor status expired on XXXX XXXX, 2020. The claimant applied for refugee protection on XXXX XXXX, 2021. The claimant testified that he had the intention of staying in Canada permanently and that was why he was trying to extend his visitor visa in order to prepare for asylum. While the claimant did not specifically mention it in his answer, I take notice of the fact that the period between when the claimant\u2019s visitor status expired and when he applied for refugee protection as in the middle of the pandemic when a number of services were unavailable. Given this, I find the claimant\u2019s delay in seeking protection to be reasonable.\n[29] Ultimately, while I acknowledge issues with the claimant\u2019s evidence outlined above none of these issues rebut the presumption of credibility with regards to the claimant\u2019s sexual orientation and are insufficient to reject his assertions about his sexuality. Given my finding concerning the claimant\u2019s credible testimony and credible supporting letters from friends and family in Canada, I find on a balance of probabilities that the claimant is a gay man.\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution and Risk of Harm\n[30] To be considered a Convention Refugee, the claimant must demonstrate that he has a well-founded fear of persecution which includes both subjective fear and an objective basis for that fear. Based on the claimant\u2019s BOC, testimony, documentary evidence and the National Documentation Packages (\u201cNDP\u201d) for Morocco[8], I find that the claimant does have a well-founded fear of persecution in Morocco.\n[31] Morocco criminalizes same-sex sexual activity with a maximum sentence of three years in prison for violations. In 2019, 122 individuals were prosecuted under this law. Societally there are reports of overt discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity in employment, housing and health care.[9] The Danish Immigration services cites that \u201cparts of the population in Morocco are very hostile towards LGBTQ persons including public demonstrations, violent intrusions into private homes and public denunciations.\u201d Gay men, especially those who are perceived as effeminate are most likely to be victims of physical assaults. LGBTQ people report being cautious about how they walk, talk and behave in public places in order to avoid homophobic violence.[10] This is corroborative of the claimant\u2019s experiences as a gay man hiding his sexuality in Morocco.\n[32] Guideline 9 states, an individual\u2019s profile may be sufficient to demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution in their country of reference given conditions that may include discriminatory laws, or at atmosphere of intolerance and repression. It also states that being compelled to conceal one\u2019s sexual orientation constitutes a serious interference with fundamental human rights that may amount to persecution and a claimant cannot be expected to conceal their sexuality to avoid persecution.\n[33] I find on a balance of probabilities that LGBTQ people face a significant risk of violence, arrest and conviction in Morocco due to their sexuality and that these conditions would compel the claimant to conceal his sexual orientation in an attempt to protect his physical safety. For these reasons, I find the claimant faces a serious possibility of persecution for reason of his sexual orientation in Morocco.\nState Protection and Internal Flight Alternative\n[34] There is a presumption that countries can protect their citizens. The claimant bears the burden of rebutting that presumption.\n[35] In this case, the state is one of the agents of persecution and they have effective control over all their territory. The Danish Immigration service has identified that it is almost impossible for an LGBTQ person fearing for his or her safety to obtain efficient protection by police in Morocco and that they would face arrest or stereotypical questions and prejudice.[11] I therefore find that the presumption of state protection is rebutted and there is no viable internal flight alternative for the claimant.\nCONCLUSION\n[36] For the forgoing reasons, I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to s. 96 of the Act. The claim is therefore accepted.\n(signed) Katarina Bogojevic\nMay 11, 2022\n\n[1] Immigration and Refugee Protection Act,S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n[2] Exhibit 2.\n[3] Exhibit 1.\n[4] Exhibit 4.\n[5] Exhibit 7.\n[6] Exhibits 7 to 9.\n[7] Exhibit 7.\n[8] Exhibit 3.\n[9] National Documentation Package, Morocco, 31 May 2021, tab 2.1: Morocco.

Odigie\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Alastair Clarke\nCountry: Ghana\nRPD Number: VC1-06738\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2022-01960\nATIP Pages: N\/A\nREASONS FOR DECISION\nINTRODUCTION\n[1] This is the decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) in the claim of XXXX XXXX (the \u2018claimant\u2019) as a citizen of Ghana who is claiming refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (the \u201cAct\u201d)[1].\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] The specifics of the claim are stated in the claimant Basis of Claim (BOC) forms[2] and narrative in evidence.[3] The claimant alleges that he will be persecuted if he returns to Ghana because his stepmothers and half siblings have refused to share the inheritance with him and have accused him of witchcraft. The claimant was born in XXXX, Ashanti region of Ghana and grew up after his mother\u2019s death with his father. He attended elementary school and thereafter took up farming with his father. The claimant\u2019s mother was the 3rd wife to his father and, she died 3 months after Claimant\u2019s birth. In XXXX 2015, claimants father died, and this led to a property dispute.\n[3] The claimant left Ghana in XXXX 2015 after series of incidents instigated by his half siblings. The crop in his farm was cut down by his half siblings and he was threatened that he will be killed by his siblings. The claimant traveled from Takoradi ports with the help of his friend\u2019s father to Panama, he then traveled from Panama to the United States of America (US). The claimant arrived in the U.S. in XXXX of 2016 through California from Mexico and was detained till XXXX 2016. The claimant made an unsuccessful asylum claim in the U.S. The claimant arrived in Canada in XXXX of 2019.\nDETERMINATION\n[4] The panel finds that the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the Act.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[5] Identity is a determinative issue, in particular who the claimant is and what the country of nationality is. The claimant testified about his place, his religion and language. The claimant submitted copies documents as evidence of his identity which includes\n\nCopy of his birth certificate obtained in March 2017,\nCopy of marriage certificate for marriage held in Winnipeg, Manitoba on April 18, 2021,\nCopy of child\u2019s birth certificate dated July 12, 2021showing claimant\u2019s identity.[4]\n[6] The panel notes that the claimant had stated at the port of entry that his passport was missing in the US. Asked how he originally obtained the lost passport, the claimant testified that he had sent for his birth certificate through his friend\u2019s father in Ghana. With the birth certificate and filled application form, he applied for it in New York. He stated that his lawyer requested for the passport to enable him to apply for work permit. The panel finds that that this is reasonable and accepts the above listed document in evidence. Objective evidence indicates that certified copy of entry into registry of birth can be obtained by being computer generated since 2009 on Ghana\u2019s Birth and Death Registry (BDR).[5] The copy of the claimant\u2019s birth certificate attached as evidence is consistent with the Response to Information Request (RIR) sample. Objective documentation further states that an individual can apply for a passport in Ghana using an application form, birth certificate or any other proof of citizenship, 4 recent sized passports as well as the processing fee and two guarantors while the biometric passport can be obtained with the submission of an application form, birth certificate, old passport where available and bank receipt for processing fee. Ghanaians abroad can obtain a passport by providing an application form, passport sized photographs and an old passport where available.[6]\n[7] Based on the totality of the evidence, the panel finds that the claimant has established his identity as a Ghana national with his Ghana certified copy of registration of birth, marriage certificate as well as his oral testimony.[7]\nNexus\n[8] For a claimant to be a Convention refugee the fear of persecution must be by reason of one of the five grounds enumerated in the Convention refugee definition. The claimant must have a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\n[9] The claimant has made two allegations of fear in Ghana. First, he fears being targeted by his half siblings and stepmothers due to a property dispute after his father\u2019s death. The panel finds that this allegation of dispute with his half siblings and stepmothers is a personal vendetta and does not have a nexus to the Convention, as such, has assessed this allegation based on section 97(1) of the Act. Secondly, the claimant alleges that he will be targeted in Ghana due to his perceived practice of witchcraft. The panel finds that there is a nexus between his allegation and the refugee Convention ground of membership in a particular social group. As such, has assessed this claim under both sections 96 and 97(1) of the Act.\nCredibility\n[10] When a claimant swears to the truth of allegations, this creates a presumption that those allegations are true, unless there is reason to doubt their truthfulness.[8] The claimant testified in straightforward, forthright, detailed, and candid manner. There were no material inconsistencies, omissions, or contradictions between any of the claimant\u2019s testimony and the other evidence in this case. In summary, the claimant\u2019s testimony was consistent with the other evidence on central aspects of the claim.\n[11] The claimant testified that he was born in a polygamous home with his mother being the last wife of three wives. He stated that his mother died when he was three months old and, his father raised him while the other wives and children did not like him. He attended elementary school and upon completion joined his father in farming, after some years, his father gave him a portion of the land to farm. After his father\u2019s death in 2015, tension escalated as his siblings did not wish to share the properties according to the traditional and religious practice and proceeded to destroy his farm, threaten him and spread the rumours that he was a witch who had taken after his late mother\u2019s witchcraft. The claimant submitted a statutory declaration by an XXXX chief which corroborates his allegations that he was being targeted.\n[12] The claimant was able to speak clearly about his fears of returning to Ghana due to being accused of witchcraft by his half siblings, stepmothers and the community and how witches are treated in Ghana. The claimant was also able to answer the specific questions asked without embellishment. The panel finds that the claimant is a credible witness.\n[13] The claimant provided document to support his claim supporting the allegations of treatment of witches in Ghana.[9] The panel has no reason to doubt the genuineness of the documents provided by the claimant and since they relate to the claimant\u2019s allegations of being a victim of violence, threats and being a witch, the panel gives them great weight to support the claimant\u2019s allegations and overall claim.\nClaimant\u2019s travel history and claim in the United States\n[14] The claimant entered Canada in XXXX 2019. The claimant testified that he travelled from Takoradi port through his friend\u2019s father\u2019s help to Panama in XXXX 2015 through a ship, after which he went through central America until he crossed the border from Mexico into the United States in XXXX 2016. He was detained on arrival till XXXX 2016, after which he filed an asylum claim which was denied in XXXX 2018. This brings into question the issue of eligibility under section 101(1)(c.1) of the Act. A notice was sent out to the Minister abut a possible ineligibility on the claim, the Minister responded that the claimant is not ineligible due to his claim in the United States, and the Minister declined to intervene.[10]\n[15] Based on the overall credibility of the claimant\u2019s testimony, the presumption of truthfulness, and the corroborative evidence, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities that the claimant was a farmer, has half siblings and stepmothers, that there was a dispute regarding properties arising from the death of his father. The panel further finds that the claimant fled XXXX to Takoradi and thereafter left Ghana using a ship and travelled through central America to Mexico and crossed to the United States where he filed an asylum claim which was denied and thereafter to Canada where he filed a claim.\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution and Risk of Harm\n[16] In order to be found a Convention refugee under section 96 of the IRPA, a claimant must show that she or he has a well-founded fear of persecution by reason of race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular social group. Based on the information available before the panel, the panel finds that the claimant is a member of the particular social group of people who are perceived to be witches.\nLand dispute claim\n[17] The claimant alleges that his problems escalated after his father\u2019s death in 2015. According to the claimant, he is the youngest child and only child of his mother who died after 3 months of his birth. He has 4 older siblings who are from different mothers, he stated that it was the religion and culture to share these properties as they belong to all the children. When asked how many lands and houses, the claimant responded that he was not certain how many pieces, but the land was a large piece with one house.\n[18] Land ownership is not a core human right. The court has found that those who are able to make reasonable choices to free themselves of a risk of harm must be expected to pursue those options.[11] The claimant testified that his village has a chief and a meeting was summoned where the chief talked to them and there was nothing to show his half siblings had backed down. He further stated that the chief knew the nature of his half siblings and he was advised to go somewhere else if he valued his life. The panel asked if he reported the issue to the police, the claimant testified that in his society, no one bothers with the police as no action is taken unless money is given to them. He then stated that he took the chief\u2019s advise and with the help of his friend\u2019s father left Ghana through Takoradi.\n[19] The panel does not find it reasonable that the claimant would put his life at risk for property which he has in essence already given up since he left Ghana, as the half siblings and stepmothers continue to live there. As such, the panel does not find that there is sufficient evidence to establish that the claimant faces a danger of torture, a risk to his life or a risk to cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if he returns to Ghana.\nPerceived practice of witchcraft\n[20] Ghana constitution prohibits religious discrimination, stipulates that individuals are free to profess and practice their religion, and does not designate a state religion. The estimated population is 28 million with 71percent Christians, 18 percent Muslims and 5 percent practice indigenous or animistic religious beliefs and 6 percent belong to other groups or has no religious beliefs.[12] Even though this demography exists, objective documentation shows that most Ghanaians believe in juju (fetish), ghosts, black magic and evil spirits and will seek help from fetish priests or other spiritual specialists in their locality.[13] The report also indicates that, in certain areas in Ghana, many believe in witchcraft with many hamlets, villages, clans and towns seeking protection against witches or having gods and fetishes to spiritually kill witches.[14]\n[21] Objective documentation states that the constitution prohibits practices that dehumanize or are injurious to the physical and mental well-being of a person however the media has reported several killings and attempted killings for ritual purposes. In the Northern, North East, Upper East, and Upper West Regions, families or traditional authorities banished rural women and men suspected of \u201cwitchcraft\u201d to \u201cwitch camps.\u201d It further states that most of those accused of witchcraft were older women, often widows. Some persons suspected to be witches were killed. In July several individuals beat to death a woman aged 90 suspected of witchcraft in Kafaba, in Savannah Region.[15]\n[22] The claimant testified that he had been accused of witchcraft with villagers being told it was passed to him from his late mother through the various narratives by his half siblings and stepmothers. He further testified that in communicating with his friend in Ghana, that there\u2019s ongoing threat against him if he were to return as this information is now in the public domain. Based on the information before the panel, the panel finds that the claimant has established on a balance of probabilities, that he faces a serious possibility of persecution on the basis of his imputed practice of witchcraft in Ghana.\nState Protection\n[23] In all refugee claims, a state is presumed to be capable of protecting its citizens unless there is clear and convincing evidence that protection would not be forthcoming to a claimant.[16] The United States Overseas Security Advisory Council report states that the Ghana Police Service (GPS) is almost solely a reactive force and demonstrates only moderate proactive techniques and ability to deter crime. It states further that the Ghana Police often lack the equipment, resources, training, and personnel to respond to calls for assistance or other emergencies and that the police have a poor record of investigating and solving serious crimes.[17]\n[24] Further objective evidence states that in areas without a significant or permanent presence of public security officers, civil rights are often determined and protected based on traditional law, which does not necessarily follow the letter of public law. This specifically refers to individuals and groups who display socially unacceptable behavior or are accused of such (e. g. \u201cwitches\u201d).[18]\n[25] The claimants\u2019 testimony is consistent with the country reports referred to above, which report that Ghana police forces is mostly reactive and lack the equipment and resources to solve crimes. The panel notes that\u2019s there is an elevated fear and risk with the claimant being perceived a witch. In these circumstances, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant cannot avail himself of state protection in Ghana.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[26] In Rasaratnam v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), the Court of Appeal held that, with respect to the burden of proof, once the issue of an internal flight alternative was raised, the onus is on the claimant to show that she does not have an IFA.[19] The burden placed on a claimant is fairly high in order to show that the IFA is unreasonable. In the Federal Court of Appeal decision of Ranganathan v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) in 2001, it was stated that the test is to show that the IFA is unreasonable.[20] That test requires nothing less than the existence of conditions that would jeopardize the life and safety of the claimants in relocating to a safe area. Actual and concrete evidence of adverse conditions is required. The panel finds that that the claimant would face a serious possibility of persecution in either Tamale or Accra.\nFirst Prong \u2013 Serious Possibility of Persecution\n[27] At the hearing, the panel proposed Accra and Tamale as possible IFAs. The objective evidence, as found in the World Factbook for Ghana at item 1.3, indicates that Ghana is a country that\u2019s approximately 230K square kilometres and has a population of approximately 29M. Accra is the capital and it has approximately 2.5M people.[21] The claimant was residing in XXXX which is approximately 248kms from Accra and 375kms from Tamale.\n[28] The claimant testified that he fears his half siblings, stepmothers and the society at large. The claimant testified that his siblings are in the transportation industry and therefore he would not be safe as Ghana is not a big country and this is why he cannot live anywhere safely in Ghana. The panel finds that there is not sufficient evidence before it that the half brothers, even though in the transportation business, have the ability and means in harming the claimant any of the proposed IFAs.\n[29] The panel then considered the issue of the claimant being perceived a witch in Ghana. The panel notes that there is still ongoing threats about the claimant being a witch in the community. The evidence before the panel as noted above is that most Ghanaians still believe in traditional practices and in the powers of witchcraft. The claimant\u2019s half brothers are into transportation business and therefore have the opportunity to be in different cities with different people.\n[30] The Federal Court has repeatedly held that a refugee claimant cannot be expected to live in hiding in order for a proposed IFA to be reasonable. The evidence indicates that the claimant\u2019s half siblings have continued spreading news about him being a witch and as they are truck and taxi drivers, they have, on a balance of probabilities, disseminated this information across several routes. As such, the panel finds that if the claimant returns to Ghana and tries to relocate to either proposed IFA, he would face more than a mere possibility of persecution from the community and general populace as he may be killed for being a witch unless he chooses to live in hiding. It is more than merely speculative that people in Accra or Tamale would learn that he is a witch and harm him.\n[31] Based on the totality of the evidence, the panel finds that the claimant would not be safe nor would it be reasonable to relocate to the proposed IFAs , therefore, he would face a serious possibility of persecution in either proposed IFA location and as such there is no viable internal flight alternative available to the claimant.\nCONCLUSION\n[32] For the foregoing reasons, the panel determines that the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to s. 96 of the Act, and therefore accepts the claim.\n(signed) Osehise L.

The following is a brief summary. You never agreed with the sexism and the lack of freedom under Islam in Iran. Your family sent you to Canada to study and you converted to Christianity here in Canada. You fear persecution on the basis of your conversion if you return.\n[5] The presumption before me is that your testimony is true; however, this can be rebutted in appropriate circumstances such as inconsistencies, contradictions, omissions or undetailed testimony. The presumption does not apply to inferences or speculation for which there is no evidentiary basis. You have provided several credible documents to support your claim in Exhibit 4.1. There is a letter from lead pastor XXXX XXXX of the XXXX XXXX XXXX confirming your participation from XXXX 2020 and stating that as of XXXX XXXX, 2021, you were taking the 12-week baptism course and the pastor supplied his contact information and invited me to contact him if he can be of further assistance.\n[5] In Exhibit 4.2, you were baptized on XXXX XXXX, 2022. There is a certificate to this effect. This was at the XXXX XXXX XXXX. A second letter from Pastor XXXX XXXX dated XXXX XXXX of 2022 confirms that you completed the baptism course and were baptized as well as your participation in church classes, activities, and Sunday worship services. Pastor XXXX XXXX states \u201cI believe he is sincere in his new faith.\u201d\n[6] Your testimony was consistent and compelling. You were straightforward and forthcoming. You did not appear to embellish your description of events or actions, and I find you to be a credible witness and therefore believe what you have alleged in support of your claim. Your narrative and your testimony corresponds to the ample objective evidence about conditions in Iran pertaining to those who disavow Islam and convert to Christianity. Accordingly, I have no reason to doubt the central elements underpinning your claim for protection. I accepted that you have converted from Islam to Christianity and given the foregoing, I accept that you subjectively fear persecution in Iran.\nNEXUS\n[7] I find the persecution you face has a nexus to the Geneva Convention, that of religion, due to your disavowal of Islam and your conversion to Christianity and therefore, I have assessed your claim under Section 96. I also note that you make some statements showing you hold a political opinion in opposition to that of the Iranian regime; however, I have found the previously mentioned nexus to be sufficient to determine your claim.\nWELL-FOUNDED FEAR\n[8] In order to be considered a Convention refugee, you have to demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution. This includes both a subjective fear which you have already established, and an objective basis for that fear and it must be forward looking.\n[9] Based on your testimony, supporting, documents, and the Country Condition documents, I find you have a well-founded fear of persecution for the following reasons: In testimony, you described the difficulties you had growing up. You wanted to listen to music but it wasn\u2019t allowed because it didn\u2019t conform to the Islamic requirements, you wanted to get together in mixed groups; once again, that wasn\u2019t allowed, you had to hide your own feelings, you weren\u2019t allowed to express yourself, your opinions, or your beliefs. You came to Canada to go to school and you found a degree of freedom that you hadn\u2019t experienced before; however, you ran into a time of difficulty. There were family members who died in Iran, you weren\u2019t able to return, you were alone here unable to work at home, and you spent a very difficult time of your life questioning the meaning of life. Then you told me that you had some acquaintance already with Christianity and its teachings and what happened was you found another meaning for your life and you found this through Christianity. You found the new meaning and tranquility and your life changed and you found that you could be happier and as you believed in your heart, everything improved in your life, you found peace of mind, a job, discipline in your life, and you attribute this all to Jesus Christ.\n[10] The country documentation is consistent with your allegations of the treatment of converts such as ourself in Iran. The law prohibits Muslim citizens from changing or renouncing their religious beliefs, Under Iranian law, a Muslim who leaves his or her faith or converts to another religion can be charged with apostacy and apostacy from Islam is a crime that can be punished by death.\n[11] Amnesty International stated the following in their June 2019 report entitled Iran Failing on all Fronts. Freedom of religion and beliefs continues to be systematically violated. The authorities impose, on people of all faiths as well as atheists, codes of conduct written in a strict interpretation of Shia Islam. The right to change or renounce religious beliefs continues to be violated with those converting from Islam at risk of arbitrary detention, torture, and the death penalty. The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade assesses that those accused of religiously based charges are also likely to face charges related to national security and they are unlikely to have adequate legal defence and they are likely to be convicted. So, I\u2019m satisfied that regardless of whether a convert faces the death penalty or imprisonment, the conditions and treatment are such that both amount to persecution. Accordingly, I find your fear of persecution in Iran is well-founded.\nSTATE PROTECTION AND INTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE\n[12] Except in situations where a state is in complete breakdown, states are presumed capable of protecting their citizens. To rebut this presumption, you have to establish on a balance of probabilities with clear and convincing evidence that your state\u2019s protection is inadequate. In this case, the agents of persecution is the states. The persecution you would face if you return to Iran is at the hands of the authorities. Accordingly, I find there is no state protection available to you. The presumption of state protection is rebutted. The states are in control of its territories and therefore, I find there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout Iran for you and there is no viable Internal Flight Alternative where you could safely relocate given your circumstances.\nCONCLUSION\n[13] Based on the totality of the evidence, I have concluded that you are a Convention refugee. Accordingly, I am accepting your claim.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014- REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n[1] This is the decision of the Refugee Protection Division in the claims of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (the \u201cprincipal claimant\u201d) and her spouse, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (the \u201cassociate claimant\u201d). The Claimants are citizens of Honduras and are seeking refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] The details of the Claimants\u2019 allegations are fully set out in their Basis of Claim (BOC) forms and were supplemented by their oral testimony.[1] In summary, the Claimants fear they will be killed by the Mara 13, also known as the MS13, in Honduras because they stopped paying the \u2018war tax\u201d that the Mara 13 had extorted from them weekly and because the Claimants filed a report against the Mara 13 with the Honduran police.\nDETERMINATION\n[3] I find on a balance of probabilities that the Claimants would be subjected personally to a risk to their lives or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, at the hands of the Mara 13 should they return to Honduras, for the following reasons.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[4] The Claimants\u2019 identities as nationals of Honduras are established by the sworn statements in their BOC forms and the certified copies of their Honduran passports contained in evidence.[2]\nNexus\n[5] For a claimant to be considered a Convention refugee, the well-founded fear of persecution must be by reason of one or more of the five grounds enumerated under s.96 of IRPA: race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion. Victims or potential victims of crime, corruption or personal vendettas generally cannot establish a link between fear of persecution and Convention reasons.[3]\n[6] The Claimants submit that there is a nexus in their case to the Convention ground of political opinion and allege they face persecution due to their imputed political opinion.\n[7] I find that there is nothing particular about this case which takes it outside the general principles as set out in Kang. I find the Claimants were victims of crime and their lives are at risk because they face retribution for ceasing to obey the Mara 13. As victims of crime who fear future criminality, I find that the Claimants have not established a nexus to one of the Convention grounds. I will therefore assess their claims under section 97(1) of IRPA.\nCredibility\n[8] The Federal Court has held in Maldonado that when a claimant swears to the truth of certain allegations, it creates a presumption that those allegations are true unless there is a reason to doubt their truthfulness.[4] The presumption of truthfulness does not apply to inferences or speculation.\n[9] In this case, I have found no reason to doubt the truthfulness of the Claimants. The principal claimant testified in a straightforward and convincing manner and was able to answer questions spontaneously and in detail about the extortion and the fear she felt on a daily basis. The Claimants provided corroborating evidence, found in Exhibit 5, to support their allegations including their business licence, photographs of the Claimants in their business, and a copy of the police report filed on XXXX XXXX, 2021.\n[10] I find that the following facts have been established on a balance of probabilities:\na) The Claimants owned an operated a XXXX XXXX, or \u201cXXXX\u201d, in Honduras. The XXXX was a profitable business and had a large clientele.\nb) In XXXX 2021, a masked man who identified himself as Mara 13 and who had XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX attended the XXXX and demanded the Claimants pay a \u201cwar tax\u201d of 5000 lempiras on a weekly basis. The man stated that he knew everything about the Claimants\u2019 family and their business and stated the Claimants would be killed if they did not pay the money.\nc) Based on the man\u2019s self identification as a member of the Mara 13 and because of his XXXX XXXX, I accept that the individual who extorted the Claimants was a member of the Mara 13 on a balance of probabilities.\nd) Between XXXX 2021 and XXXX 2021, the amount the Claimants were extorted to pay rose from 5000 lempira weekly to 30,000 lempira weekly. The Claimants used profits from the business, their savings, and ultimately sold their cars and some personal belongings in order to make the payments.\ne) The Claimants made one payment of 30,000 lempira on XXXX XXXX, 2021. The Claimants abandoned their home and business on XXXX XXXX, 2021, the day before the next payment of 30,000 lempira was due.\nf) The Claimants made a police complaint against the Mara 13 on XXXX XXXX, 2021 at a police station in a different town. The Claimants spent the night of XXXX XXXX, 2021 at the airport awaiting their flight out of Honduras on XXXX XXXX, 2021.\nRisk of Harm\n[11] In order to establish they are persons in need of protection under section 97(1)(b), the Claimants must show they would be subjected personally, on a balance of probabilities, to a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment which is not faced generally by others in Honduras.\n[12] When I consider the objective country evidence in relation to the Claimants\u2019 profile as small business owners who have been previously extorted by the Mara 13, I find that the Claimants have established on a balance of probabilities that they face a risk to their life at the hands of the Mara 13 if they returned to Honduras.\n[13] The National Documentation Package contains several articles and reports on the Mara 13. A report by Insight Crime, states that:\nThe Mara Salvatrucha (MS13) is one of the world\u2019s largest and arguably most violent street gangs. After relatively humble beginnings in Los Angeles in the 1980s, it has spread to more than a half-dozen countries and become a central focus of law enforcement in two hemispheres. In spite of these efforts, the MS13 remains a persistent threat and shows signs of expanding its criminal portfolio. The MS13 has between 50,000 and 70,000 members who are concentrated in mostly urban areas in Central America or locations outside the region where there is a large Central American diaspora. In Honduras and Guatemala, the gang is still largely urban. Violence is at the heart of the MS13 and is what has made it a target of law enforcement in the United States, Central America and beyond. It is central to the MS13\u2019s ethos, its modus operandi, and its evaluation and discipline of its own members. Violence also builds cohesion and comradery within the gang\u2019s cliques. This use of violence has enhanced the MS13\u2019s brand name, allowing it to expand in size and geographic reach, but it has undermined its ability to enter more sophisticated, money-making criminal economies.[5]\n[14] The US Department of State Travel Advisory for Honduras states:\nHondurans continue to be affected by MS-13 (Mara Salvatrucha) and Calle 18 gang activity in cities such as Tegucigalpa, Choloma, La Ceiba, Tela, and San Pedro Sula. Most crime victims are members of rival gangs, small business owners who resist gang extortion, passengers on public transportation, or those involved in land disputes. The MS-13 and Calle 18 gangs are the most active and powerful gangs present in Honduras. Gangs are not reluctant to use violence, and specialize in murder-for-hire, carjacking, extortion, and other violent street crime\u2026[6]\n[15] In addition, the objective evidence indicates organized crime groups, including the Mara 13, use extortion as one of their primary sources of income.[7] One clique of the MS 13 murdered approximately 40 people between 2016 and 2019 \u201cfor not paying extortions, or on suspicion that [the victims] were informants for authorities\u201d.[8]\n[16] Furthermore,\nClique leaders keep a close eye and strict control over who gets targeted for extortion, how much money is collected and how often. New targets can be proposed and accepted during meetings. Gang leaders may also discuss issues with collection during those meetings, including whether or not to discipline a target for not paying, not paying on time or absconding.[9]\n[17] One recent example of retribution against a pulperia owner occurred in October 2021. As reported in a Honduran newspaper, a pulperia owner refused to pay the extortion demands and was shot and killed on the street, presumably by gang members.[10]\n[18] The objective evidence discussed above establishes that MS13 is a prominent and highly violent gang operating throughout Honduras, which uses the extortion of small business owners as a primary source of income.\n[19] Given the Claimants have already been targeted by the Mara 13 and subsequently stopped making their regular extortion payments, I find, on a balance of probabilities, the Mara 13 are motivated to harm or kill the Claimants in retaliation for ceasing to pay them money, for reporting them to the police, and as a warning to others who refuse the Mara 13\u2019s demands.\nState Protection\n[20] I find that there is no adequate state protection for the Claimants in Honduras.\n[21] The principal claimant testified that when she and her husband filed the complaint with the police, the police told the Claimants that they would not be able to protect them as the police were understaffed and underfunded.\n[22] The objective evidence supports the principal claimant\u2019s testimony. As cited above, the Mara 13 has not been suppressed by state authorities; rather, the Mara 13 has been growing in both size and geographical reach. Objective evidence shows that police response to crime is unsatisfactory and undermined by lack of training and resources:\nThe government lacks resources to investigate and prosecute cases; police often lack vehicles\/fuel to respond to calls for assistance. Police may take hours to arrive at the scene of a violent crime or may not respond at all.[11]\n[23] Therefore, based on the evidence discussed above and the Claimant\u2019s own experience in seeking protection from the police in Honduras, I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the Claimants will not be able to access adequate state protection in Honduras, and that the presumption of state protection has been rebutted.\nInternal Flight Alternative (IFA)\n[24] I find that there is no viable IFA for the Claimants in Honduras. The agent of harm is motivated to pursue the Claimants for refusing to comply with their demands and for reporting them to the police. As stated above, the Mara 13 uses violence to ensure compliance with their demands of extortion. The Mara 13 is a widespread criminal organization with significant resources and have the means and presence throughout the country to pursue the Claimants anywhere in Honduras. As already discussed, the objective evidence shows targets are disciplined by the Mara 13 for not making their payments and for absconding, both of which the Claimants have done. Therefore, I find that the Claimants will not be able to live safely anywhere in Honduras and they do not have a viable IFA.\nCONCLUSION\n[25] When I consider the Claimants\u2019 personal circumstances, the objective country evidence, the lack of state protection and lack of viable IFA, I find that the Claimants have established on a balance of probabilities that they face a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment at the hands of the Mara 13 if they were to return to Honduras. I therefore find that the Claimants are persons in need of protection pursuant to section 97 of IRPA and accept their claim.\n(signed) Alannah Hatch\nJanuary 18, 2022\n\n[1] Exhibits 2.1 and 2.2.\n[2] Exhibits 1 and 5.\n\n[3] Kang v.

In Honduras and Guatemala, the gang is still largely urban. Violence is at the heart of the MS13 and is what has made it a target of law enforcement in the United States, Central America and beyond. It is central to the MS13\u2019s ethos, its modus operandi, and its evaluation and discipline of its own members. Violence also builds cohesion and comradery within the gang\u2019s cliques. This use of violence has enhanced the MS13\u2019s brand name, allowing it to expand in size and geographic reach, but it has undermined its ability to enter more sophisticated, money-making criminal economies.[5]\n[14] The US Department of State Travel Advisory for Honduras states:\nHondurans continue to be affected by MS-13 (Mara Salvatrucha) and Calle 18 gang activity in cities such as Tegucigalpa, Choloma, La Ceiba, Tela, and San Pedro Sula. Most crime victims are members of rival gangs, small business owners who resist gang extortion, passengers on public transportation, or those involved in land disputes. The MS-13 and Calle 18 gangs are the most active and powerful gangs present in Honduras. Gangs are not reluctant to use violence, and specialize in murder-for-hire, carjacking, extortion, and other violent street crime\u2026[6]\n[15] In addition, the objective evidence indicates organized crime groups, including the Mara 13, use extortion as one of their primary sources of income.[7] One clique of the MS 13 murdered approximately 40 people between 2016 and 2019 \u201cfor not paying extortions, or on suspicion that [the victims] were informants for authorities\u201d.[8]\n[16] Furthermore,\nClique leaders keep a close eye and strict control over who gets targeted for extortion, how much money is collected and how often. New targets can be proposed and accepted during meetings. Gang leaders may also discuss issues with collection during those meetings, including whether or not to discipline a target for not paying, not paying on time or absconding.[9]\n[17] One recent example of retribution against a pulperia owner occurred in October 2021. As reported in a Honduran newspaper, a pulperia owner refused to pay the extortion demands and was shot and killed on the street, presumably by gang members.[10]\n[18] The objective evidence discussed above establishes that MS13 is a prominent and highly violent gang operating throughout Honduras, which uses the extortion of small business owners as a primary source of income.\n[19] Given the Claimants have already been targeted by the Mara 13 and subsequently stopped making their regular extortion payments, I find, on a balance of probabilities, the Mara 13 are motivated to harm or kill the Claimants in retaliation for ceasing to pay them money, for reporting them to the police, and as a warning to others who refuse the Mara 13\u2019s demands.\nState Protection\n[20] I find that there is no adequate state protection for the Claimants in Honduras.\n[21] The principal claimant testified that when she and her husband filed the complaint with the police, the police told the Claimants that they would not be able to protect them as the police were understaffed and underfunded.\n[22] The objective evidence supports the principal claimant\u2019s testimony. As cited above, the Mara 13 has not been suppressed by state authorities; rather, the Mara 13 has been growing in both size and geographical reach. Objective evidence shows that police response to crime is unsatisfactory and undermined by lack of training and resources:\nThe government lacks resources to investigate and prosecute cases; police often lack vehicles\/fuel to respond to calls for assistance. Police may take hours to arrive at the scene of a violent crime or may not respond at all.[11]\n[23] Therefore, based on the evidence discussed above and the Claimant\u2019s own experience in seeking protection from the police in Honduras, I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the Claimants will not be able to access adequate state protection in Honduras, and that the presumption of state protection has been rebutted.\nInternal Flight Alternative (IFA)\n[24] I find that there is no viable IFA for the Claimants in Honduras. The agent of harm is motivated to pursue the Claimants for refusing to comply with their demands and for reporting them to the police. As stated above, the Mara 13 uses violence to ensure compliance with their demands of extortion. The Mara 13 is a widespread criminal organization with significant resources and have the means and presence throughout the country to pursue the Claimants anywhere in Honduras. As already discussed, the objective evidence shows targets are disciplined by the Mara 13 for not making their payments and for absconding, both of which the Claimants have done. Therefore, I find that the Claimants will not be able to live safely anywhere in Honduras and they do not have a viable IFA.\nCONCLUSION\n[25] When I consider the Claimants\u2019 personal circumstances, the objective country evidence, the lack of state protection and lack of viable IFA, I find that the Claimants have established on a balance of probabilities that they face a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment at the hands of the Mara 13 if they were to return to Honduras. I therefore find that the Claimants are persons in need of protection pursuant to section 97 of IRPA and accept their claim.\n(signed) Alannah Hatch\nJanuary 18, 2022\n\n[1] Exhibits 2.1 and 2.2.\n[2] Exhibits 1 and 5.\n\n[3] Kang v.

        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2022 RLLR 12\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: February 8, 2022\nPanel: Kevin Kim\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Mary Alison Pridham\nCountry: Nigeria\nRPD Number: VC1-06001\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2022-01960\nATIP Pages: N\/A\nREASONS FOR DECISION\nINTRODUCTION\n[1] This is the decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) in the claim of XXXX XXXX XXXX as a citizen of Nigeria who is claiming refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (the \u201cAct\u201d) .\n[2] The panel has considered and applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 4 on Female Refugee Claimants fearing gender-related persecution, particularly when considering the possibility of an internal flight alternative.\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] The following is a brief synopsis of the claimant\u2019s allegations as set out in her Basis of Claim (BOC) form as well as her testimony. The claimant is a 30-year-old Nigerian woman who fears persecution from her mother-in-law who is a member of the XXXX XXXX.\n[4] The claimant alleges that her mother-in-law has been targeting the claimant\u2019s son to be initiated into the XXXX XXXX, and that her mother-in-law has been attempting to forcefully take the claimant\u2019s son away.\n[5] After the claimant married her husband, she moved into his family home and lived with her husband and his family, including the husband\u2019s mother. Due to the husband\u2019s job, he traveled frequently for months at a time across Nigeria and was often unable to be contacted as he was out of cellular service. In 2016, the claimant and her mother traveled to Canada for vacation while the claimant was pregnant with her son. In XXXX 2016, the claimant gave birth to her son in Canada.\n[6] The claimant alleged that her relationship with her mother-in-law has always been tumultuous. On XXXX XXXX, 2018, at her family home, the claimant\u2019s mother-in-law and her husband\u2019s cousin insulted the claimant and pushed her, injuring the claimant\u2019s leg. In XXXX 2018, the mother-in-law made death threats to the claimant and stated that if the claimant did not surrender her son, she would send the \u201carea boys to attack her and kill her so that she will no longer be a problem for her\u201d. The claimant reported this incident to the police, but the claimant alleged that the police did not act as the mother-in-law was an influential member of the XXXX XXXXwith connections to the police. Although the mother-in-law was required to report to the police, she was let go within the same day. Furthermore, the claimant alleged that the police ignored this matter and dismissed it as a domestic dispute.\n[7] Feeling unsafe, the claimant fled to her cousin\u2019s house with her son in XXXX on XXXX XXXX, 2018. At her cousin\u2019s home, the claimant continued to receive threatening phone calls from her mother-in-law. The claimant changed her phone number, but she continued to receive threatening phone calls from her mother-in-law who said that she knows the claimant is hiding in XXXX and there was no point in hiding as she would eventually find her.\n[8] On XXXX XXXX, 2018, the claimant fled to her church in Lagos where she took shelter for 24 days. Although the threatening phone calls continued, the claimant\u2019s mother-in-law or anyone from the XXXX XXXXwas able to confront her directly. The claimant testified that she believes her mother-in-law knew the general vicinity of where she was, but not the precise location.\n[9] The claimant fled Nigeria with her son on XXXX XXXX, 2018 and made a claim in Canada on June 12, 2018.\nDETERMINATIONS\n[10] The panel finds that the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the Act for the reasons that follow.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[11] The panel finds that the claimant\u2019s personal identity and her identity as a citizen of Nigeria has been established on a balance of probabilities by a copy of her Nigerian passport.\nNexus\n[12] The panel finds that the claimant\u2019s allegations establish a nexus to the Convention ground of particular social group as a woman experiencing domestic violence in Nigeria. Therefore, the panel will assess this claim under section 96 of the Act.\nCredibility\n[13] When a claimant swears to the truth of his or her allegations, this creates a presumption that those allegations are true, unless there is reason to doubt their truthfulness. In this case, the panel has found no reason to doubt the claimant\u2019s truthfulness. The claimant testified in a straightforward manner that was consistent with all of the other documents on the file, including her Basis of Claim form and narrative. The claimant was able to answer all questions fully and provided all details that were requested of her. There were no relevant inconsistencies in her testimony or contradictions between her testimony and the other evidence before the panel, which have not been satisfactorily explained.\n[14] The claimant also provided documentary evidence in support of her claim. The documents form parts of Exhibit 4 and contain the following:\n1. XXXX XXXXcard of XXXX XXXX, the claimant\u2019s mother in law;\n2. Medical report for the claimant dated XXXX XXXX, 2018;\n3. Police report dated XXXX XXXX, 2018 in relation to the death threats made by the mother-in-law towards the claimant.\n[15] Although the panel initially had some concerns with the legitimacy of the medical report and the police report due to formatting and grammatical mistakes identified, the panel accepts the claimant\u2019s explanation of the mistakes to be typographical in nature and finds the documents to be genuine.\n[16] Ultimately, in terms of the claimant\u2019s allegations, the panel finds the following:\n1. The claimant\u2019s mother-in-law is a member of the XXXX XXXX;\n2. The claimant\u2019s mother-in-law has attacked her on XXXX XXXX, 2018 and made death threats to the claimant demanding that she surrenders her son in XXXX 2018;\n3. The claimant\u2019s mother-in-law continued to threaten her while the claimant hid at her cousin\u2019s home as well as her church;\n4. The claimant\u2019s mother-in-law was able to find her new phone number and knew of her general vicinity while the claimant was fleeing.\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution and Risk of Harm\n[17] Turning to the well-founded fear of persecution, the panel accepts that the claimant has a subjective fear of returning to Nigeria. Considering the totality of the evidence, the panel finds that the claimant\u2019s subjective fear is objectively well-founded and if she was to return, she would face a serious risk of persecution. Although the panel finds that the sphere of influence and the reach of the XXXX XXXXhas been diminishing in the recent years, as will be discussed below, the panel finds that the claimant\u2019s fears are objectively well-founded.\n[18] The objective evidence as set out in the National Documentation Package (NDP) confirms that the XXXX XXXXexists. According to the EASO Country of Information , the XXXXis the best-known but certainly not the only secret society in Nigeria. The XXXX XXXX is a caste of Yoruba priests who elected and controlled the Oba, the Oruba king. The XXXXhad great political and societal powers, and it used to be highly prestigious to become a member.\n[19] The same report indicates that the XXXX XXXXhad considerable influence in Nigerian society and government in the 1990s. Only members of the XXXX XXXXcould give access to an influential or government job. However, nowadays, the influence of the XXXX XXXXis declining although not totally disappeared. The report noted that in these days, money is a greater means to access political power.\n[20] The same report also indicates the general sphere of influence of the XXXX XXXX. It indicates that the XXXXare only influential in \u201cYoruba parts of Nigeria where they still have some real influence\u2026 [cities such as] Egba, Egbado, and Abeokuta parts of Nigeria (Ogun and Lagos States). Also, in some rural villages and small towns along in the borders of Ogun state with Oyo, Osun, and Ondo, they might still be able to intimidate pockets of people\u201d. However, the report also indicates that XXXXare often members of Nigerian society\u2019s elites working in the police, judiciary, and government institutions.\n[21] Turning to the refusal of membership in the XXXX XXXX, the report indicates that while membership in the XXXX XXXXis primarily voluntary, social pressure and intimidation can occur, especially when the person refusing has personal knowledge of the XXXX XXXX. The report indicates that \u201crefusal to join in such cases is very difficult\u201d.\n[22] The panel acknowledges that the evidence regarding the capacity and influence of the XXXX XXXXis mixed. The evidence appears to indicate that the XXXX XXXXis a well-known secret society that wielded considerable power in the 1990s but has been declining in the recent years. However, the panel finds that the claimant\u2019s fears are well-founded as the persecution she has experienced, such as the beatings and death threats from her mother-in-law, has been localized in Lagos and Ogun states, where the objective evidence indicates the XXXX XXXX still has a considerable amount of influence.\n[23] Based on the claimant\u2019s testimony regarding the sustained periods of domestic abuse suffered by the hands of her mother-in-law and other relatives, and due to the claimant\u2019s personal knowledge of the XXXX XXXXresulting from living in the same household as her mother-in-law, the panel finds that the claimant would face a serious risk of persecution should she return to Nigeria. Therefore, the panel finds that the claimant has a well-founded fear of persecution.\nState Protection\n[24] There is limited country conditions documents that directly reflect whether state agencies would protect individuals from the XXXX XXXX. According to the United States Department of State report , the government in Nigeria lacked effective mechanisms and sufficient political will to investigate and punish most security force abuse and corruption. Police remained susceptible to corruption, committed human rights violations, and operated with widespread impunity in the apprehension, illegal detention, and torture of suspects. This document raises serious concerns about the efficacy of state protection agencies in Nigeria.\n[25] The claimant also testified that she went to the police regarding the death threat her mother-in-law made in XXXX 2018. Although the police report provided by the claimant indicates that the mother-in-law was invited for an investigation, she was released on the same day and no further investigations were actioned by the police. The claimant testified that she was only let off with a warning, and the claimant believes that this is because of her influence in the XXXX XXXX.\n[26] Further, as mentioned earlier, some members of the XXXX XXXXare connected to or are members of the Nigerian elite, such as the police, judiciary, or politicians. The evidence indicates that some of the XXXX XXXXappears to be above the law. When the panel reviews the totality of the evidence, the limitations of the police and in general in Nigeria and the links between the XXXXand Nigerian authorities, the panel finds that there is clear and convincing evidence that state protection would not be reasonably forthcoming to the claimant. As such, the panel finds that there is no operationally effective state protection for the claimant in Nigeria.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[27] The final issue is whether the claimant has a viable internal flight alternative (IFA) in Nigeria. In order to determine whether an IFA exists, the panel must assess whether there is any location in Nigeria in which claimants would not face a serious possibility of persecution and whether it would be reasonable to expect them to move there. At the outset of the hearing, the panel proposed Abuja as a possible IFA. The panel finds that the claimant does not have a viable IFA because the panel finds that given the claimant\u2019s profile as a woman who would mostly travel and live alone without her husband, it would be unreasonable for the claimant to relocate within Nigeria.\nFirst prong \u2013 Means and motivations of mother-in-law and XXXX XXXX\n[28] Turning to whether the claimant\u2019s mother-in-law or the XXXX XXXXas a whole would have the means and the motivation to find the claimant in Abuja, the panel finds that they would not. The evidence about the XXXX XXXX seems to indicate that although they were powerful and well-known in the past, their capacity and their influence has been diminishing in the recent years. Furthermore, the sphere of influence of the XXXX XXXXappears to be localized in the Ogun and Lagos states which is in the southwest region of Nigeria. This sphere of influence does not include Abuja, which is in central Nigeria.\n[29] The claimant testified that she ran away to her cousin\u2019s home in XXXX and to her church in Lagos, where the objective evidence appears to indicate that the XXXX XXXXstill has a considerable amount of influence. Although the claimant\u2019s mother-in-law was able to find the claimant\u2019s new phone number, she was never able to precisely locate the claimant at the claimant\u2019s church or her cousin\u2019s home despite the fact that these locations are within the XXXX XXXXarea of influence.\n[30] The panel notes that the claimant\u2019s church and her mother in law\u2019s home are both located in Lagos, and that the claimant remained hidden in her church for 24 days prior to leaving Nigeria. However, despite being so close geographically, the claimant\u2019s mother-in-law was not able to precisely locate the claimant. The panel therefore finds that the XXXX XXXXlacks the means to locate an individual, even within their reported sphere of influence. Therefore, the panel finds that the claimant\u2019s mother-in-law or the XXXX XXXXwould have the means to locate the claimant in Abuja.\n[31] Turning to the motivations of the agents of persecution, the panel finds that the claimant\u2019s mother-in-law or the XXXX XXXXas a whole still has the motivation to locate the claimant. The claimant testified that ever since coming to Canada, the claimant never had any direct contact with her mother-in-law or any other members of the XXXX XXXX. The claimant also did not mention any threats made to her family or friends from the XXXX XXXX. The panel therefore finds that the agents of persecution in this specific case lacks the motivation to locate the claimant because of the lack of measures taken by the claimant\u2019s mother-in-law or the XXXX XXXX.\n[32] As such, the panel finds that there is no serious possibility that the claimant\u2019s mother-in-law or the XXXX XXXXas a whole would locate the claimant in Abuja.\nSecond prong \u2013 Reasonableness test, jeopardy to life or safety\n[33] Considering the totality of the evidence, the panel finds that the claimant would face jeopardy to her life or safety should she relocate to Abuja. In coming to this conclusion, the panel has considered the claimant\u2019s profile as a woman traveling with a young son whose husband is largely absent due to his work obligations.\n[34] The claimant wrote in her narrative and also testified that although she and her husband is still married and on good terms, there are times when she is left to support herself alone for extended periods of time. The claimant testified that she was not able to contact her husband to tell him about the attack on XXXX XXXX, 2018 and the threats in XXXX 2018 because he was out of cellular service, and that she was only able to contact him after she arrived in Canada. When asked if this kind of occurrence is common with her husband, the claimant testified that it is does happen from time to time and she has learned to deal with issues herself.\n[35] The documentary evidence is clear that women in Nigeria are subject to stereotypical beliefs and cultural norms that significantly restrict a woman\u2019s ability to participate in free and equal individuals.\n[36] The US Department of State report in the NDP indicates that women in Nigeria are subjected to considerable economic discrimination and that the culturally implemented restrictions on women prevent women from finding jobs in numerous industries. In a report at tab 5.1 , women are frequently restricted to work in the informal sectors, which carries a high level of uncertainty, a high risk of employment, lower wages, and in some cases an outright dangerous work environment.\n[37] Both the US Department of State report and the report at tab 5.1 indicates that it is commonplace for employers to request sexual favours from women in exchange for employment. Sexual violence is endemic both in the household and in the community at large.\n[38] At tab 5.9 , a report about female headed households, indicates that it is very difficult, or even potentially impossible, for women to live independently as a single woman, to relocate without a support network, and that it is \u201cvery difficult for women heads of households\u201d to survive in any place in Nigeria. Potential landlords suspect single women as working as prostitutes or may demand sexual favours for a place to live. The panel finds that there is a serious risk that the claimant could be left unemployed and homeless.\n[39] Should the claimant relocate to Abuja, she would be relocating without any family support and with only limited support from her husband, whose employment requires him to travel throughout Nigeria. Considering all of the circumstances, including the current situation in Nigeria as well as the claimant\u2019s personal circumstances, the panel finds that the claimant would face a serious risk of persecution should she relocate to Abuja as a single woman trying to establish her own household. Therefore, the panel finds that the claimant does not have a viable IFA in Nigeria.\nCONCLUSION\n[40] In conclusion, for the reasons above, the panel finds that the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the Act and the Refugee Protection Division acPSGcepts her claim.\n(signed) Kevin Kim\nFebruary 8, 2022\n",

Their claims were previously joined with the principal claimant\u2019s husband, however, due to allegations of domestic violence the claims were separated.\nALLEGATIONS\n[4] The claimant fled Mexico with her husband XXXXand son due to fears of the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (XXXX). The claimant\u2019s husband owned XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. He had been extorted for two years before the principal claimant learned about what was happening. The claimant\u2019s husband left Mexico on XXXX XXXX, 2019 and the claimants went to live with an Uncle in Pachuca. However, when they returned the principal claimant began receiving multiple threats. The XXXX asked about her husband\u2019s whereabouts and threatened to kill the claimants if the husband\u2019s debt was not paid. The claimants left Mexico on XXXX XXXX, 2019. The principal claimant has since been separated from her husband and has full custody of the minor claimant. She fears additional harm from him if she returns to Mexico.\nDETERMINATION\n[5] I find the claimants are Convention Refugees pursuant to s.96 of the Act, for the reasons that follow.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[6] The claimants\u2019 identities as nationals of Mexico are established through certified copies of their passports on file.\nCredibility\n[7] The claimant was a credible witness and I believe what she has alleged in support of their claims. The principal claimant testified in a direct and straightforward manner, even when asked to testify about difficult subjects. There were no material inconsistencies between her testimony and her Basis of Claim form. There were no attempts to embellish her evidence even when given the opportunity to do so. I have documentary evidence to support her claim. I accept that even though her initial reasons for fleeing Mexico were to escape the XXXX cartel due to her husband\u2019s activities, the claimant formulated an additional fear of domestic violence after initiating her refugee claim. It is clear from her testimony and the documents before me that she did not necessarily understand that she was a victim of domestic violence until arriving in Canada. Based on the totality of the evidence, I accept her allegations as credible.\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution\n[8] I find there is a nexus in this claim to the Convention Ground of membership in a particular social group, namely women fearing gender-based violence for the principal claimant, and family members of a persecuted person for the minor claimant.\n[9] The claimant testified that she became pregnant at a very young age and was essentially forced into a marriage with XXXXby her family and XXXXfamily, both who followed the Jehovah Witness faith. From the beginning of the marriage, XXXX, who is several years older than the claimant, was physically and emotionally abusive as well as unfaithful. The claimant told some members of her family about the abuse but had no recourse. She testified that she tried to tell her mother, who did not really listen to her.\n[10] She testified that the physical abuse stopped once she arrived in Canada, but only because XXXXappeared to understand that he could potentially face repercussions from authorities in this country, whereas he could act with relative impunity in Mexico. Indeed, in the transcript the claimant captured of a zoom call with XXXX, he states the following in response to the claimant\u2019s assertion that hitting XXXX as a form of discipline is violence:\n\u201cXXXX, that is not violence. That is not violence. Those are your rules and your laws as a Canadian, and honestly, well, you aren\u2019t even a Canadian. [3]\u201d\n[11] In other words, it appears that the only reason the claimants were not subjected to physical abuse here in Canada was due to the fact that XXXXwas aware the claimant could call the police. However, according to the claimant\u2019s testimony and witness affidavit before me, emotional abuse continued, as did the withholding of financial support for food and other necessities.\n[12] The objective evidence also supports the claimants\u2019 allegations. Sources report that gender-based violence is common in Mexico. In its Concluding Observations on the Ninth Periodic Report of Mexico, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) notes that \u201cthe persistence of high levels of insecurity, violence and organised crime in [Mexico] \u2026 is negatively affecting the enjoyment by women and girls of their human rights\u201d. Sources report that the average of 10 women who were killed per day in 2019 remained unchanged in [January] 2020. The New York Times also reports that an average of 10 women were killed each day in 2019 and adds that this rate represents an increase from 7 killed per day in 2017.[4]\n[13] The 2016 National Survey on the Dynamics of Household Relationships found that 42 percent of married women over 15 years old and 59 percent of separated, divorced, or widowed women have experienced situations of emotional or economic abuse, or physical or sexual violence in their current or previous relationship. The same source reports that 64 percent of the women victims of domestic violence have experienced severe or very severe violence at the hand of their spouse or partner.[5]\n[14] According to recent evidence provided by the Board in an RIR report, women are often seen by their intimate partners who are involved in organized crime as an accomplice and \u201cthey must participate to varying degrees in their illicit activities, [whether] it be actively in aiding and abetting crimes, or by keeping secrets and providing a minimal amount of support. Women in those situations do not tend to leave their partners unless they feel it is safe or necessary to do so because if they end up returning to them afterwards, the violence always escalates.[6]\n[15] Based on the totality of the evidence, I find the claimants would face a serious possibility of persecution in Mexico.\nState Protection\n[16] In terms of state protection, the federal penal code prohibits domestic violence and stipulates penalties for conviction of between six months\u2019 and four years\u2019 imprisonment. Of the 32 states, 29 stipulate similar penalties, although in practice sentences were often more lenient. Federal law criminalizes spousal abuse. However, state and municipal laws addressing domestic violence largely failed to meet the required federal standards and often were unenforced.[7] Despite passing laws to protect women in 2007, the situation for women in Mexico has worsened. The process of seeking state protection has been described as perpetual bureaucratization, politicization, and revictimization\u201d, and so far very few of the state\u2019s efforts have resulted in a reduction of gender-based violence.[8]\n[17] XXXXhas already demonstrated that while he is mindful of Canadian laws, he is aware that he can act with far more impunity in Mexico. I find that state protection would not be forthcoming to the claimants in this case.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[18] I also find that the claimants do not have an internal flight alternative in Mexico. Although the principal claimant has a temporary custody order from a Canadian court, there is no evidence that this would be valid in Mexico. XXXXhas told the claimant that if returned to Mexico he would \u2018fix things\u2019, which the claimant believes means he would take XXXX away or attempt to seek custody. A Response to Information Request (RIR) issued by the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB) also states the following with respect to family court legal proceedings:\nOnce a family law-related proceeding, including divorce, custody or guardianship, has been initiated before the court, if the address or location of the other parent is unknown and they fail to comply with their obligation to the child, the other parent can request that the judge issue an order to government institutions such as the Mexican Social Security Institute (Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social), the Tax Administration Service (Servicio de Administraci\u00f3n Tributaria), among others, to search in their respective databases on the estranged parent.[9]\n[19] I find that the agent of harm in this case has the means and motivation to track the claimants to another location.\n[20] Further, the claimant would be returning to Mexico as a young, uneducated single mother. Her father is deceased, and she has never worked outside the home. The objective evidence before me states that low-income single mothers with children under 15 years of age face limited access and enjoyment of the right to food, as well as economic, social and cultural rights due to, among others, the vulnerable income status in which they find themselves, the discrimination they have suffered in different sectors such as social, labour and family, unequal access to employment opportunities, as well as low-paid jobs.[10] I find it would be objectively unreasonable for the claimants to relocate in these circumstances.\nCONCLUSION\n[21] I find the claimants are Convention Refugees pursuant to s.96 of the Act and the Board therefore accepts their claims.\n(signed) Kari Schroeder\nJanuary 10, 2022\n[1] Immigration and Refugee Protection Act,S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n[2] Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (IRB) Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 4: Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution, November 13, 1996.\n[3] Exhibit 5.\n[4] National Documentation Package, Mexico, 29 September 2021, tab 5.10: \u200bDomestic violence, including treatment of survivors of domestic violence; legislation; protection and support services available, including psychological services, particularly in Mexico City and M\u00e9rida (2017\u2013September 2020).

The claimant fears persecution at the hands of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in Iraq. The claimant was a recent graduate from XXXX XXXX and was the XXXX XXXX, and working in the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, spelt XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. During his tenure there, he noted that there were fraudulent activities happening. He reported these fraudulent activities to his management, because he noted that there were fictitious contractors named in the invoices. After advising management about his concerns, the claimant was informed that his employment was terminated.\n[3] After that, the claimant went back to his manager and told him that he believed that he was being terminated because of his reporting of these fraudulent activities. He warned his manager that he would report the names, and the fact that he was terminated to the Iraq Commission of Integrity, which was tasked with preventing and investigating corruption at all levels of the Iraqi government. Shortly after the claimant\u2019s termination from his position, he was picked up by members who he believes to have been part of this XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. He was kidnapped, tortured, and beaten physically, and harmed, for three (3) days in total. The belief that these individuals who kidnapped him were part of this XXXX XXXX comes from knowledge with the \u2014 which the claimant did not have at the time of the reporting. Apparently, that he learned, that his manager and others within that department were members of this XXXX. And that the report of fraudulent activities would be considered perilous to their corrupt activities and being able to continue with them.\n[4] The claimant\u2019s father had some influence within the government, and he confronted the claimant\u2019s former manager about the claimant\u2019s whereabouts when he discovered that he was missing. The father was told that his son was being detained by them. And that the reason was that his son \u201ctalked too much\u201d. The manager then told him, the father, that the only way to resolve this was to provide a guarantee that the father and claimant would not report the matter to the Integrity Commission. Furthermore, the manager demanded a ransom from the father for the continued safety of the claimant and the father. The father managed to pay the ransom demanded, and in consultation with the claimant, it was decided that the claimant should leave Iraq and go to Lebanon.\n[5] The claimant stayed in Lebanon from 2016 until his arrival in Canada in 2019. He started out in Lebanon with a short-term visitor\u2019s visa, and then converted it to a one (1) year student visa once he enrolled in university. While living in Lebanon, the claimant met and married a young woman. She was not interested in having a religious ceremony and filing the necessary legal documents of marriage until she found out she was pregnant. For the interest of the child, both the claimant and the former spouse made attempts to legalize their marriage. However, the legalization process was fraught with administrative errors, particularly regarding proper dates. The claimant and his spouse at the time tried to fix the errors, but while doing so, (inaudible) to the intervene and the claimant came to Canada for refuge. The claimant and his spouse ended up to divorcing.\n[6] The claimant said he was never able to attach any resident status to this marriage. He did go through the motions of getting the paperwork corrected but did so only to legalize his daughter. In order to keep this visa active in Lebanon, the claimant had to travel to Iraq, and he did so twice. The first time he went back, he said that he was in hiding. Five (5) days after getting to Iraq, his father received a threatening text, saying that the agents of persecution knew that the claimant was back in Iraq. The second time the claimant went back to Iraq, he decided on his own to seek justice, and he went to the Integrity Commission, where he told them his story about the corruption, the violence, and the termination of his position.\n[7] On his way back to Lebanon, he was in a taxi interact, and it was hit by another car from behind. He was taken to hospital for treatment, and he believes that it was the persons who had kidnapped him, and who were no doubt his former managers that were at the root of this intentional hit to his vehicle. Shortly after that, the father received a letter under his door to the effect that the agents of harms knew that the claimant had broken the deal and that \u2014 for silence. And that death would be his destiny.\n[8] The claimant has also filed additional information from his parents about events that have happened to them since the claimant has been in Canada. There have been new \u2014 it is okay \u2014 there have been new threats which the parents had not shared due to their concerns about putting the claimant under pressure. The claimant believes that he has been targeted due to his whistleblowing, and is at risk of further violence, detention, and threats, and possibly assassination, if he returns to Iraq. My determination is that I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee. And my analysis is as follows.\n[9] First of all, I am satisfied that the claimant has established his identity on the balance the probabilities by providing his passport. In terms of country to reference and exclusion, at the outset of the hearing, I advised the claimant that I would be exploring his status in Lebanon, particularly as it pertains to his marriage. I am satisfied that his visitor visa and student visa did not constitute any engagement of these issues due to the temporary and limited nature of them. However, it was not clear to me why the claimant\u2019s marriage did not attract more permanent status. In reviewing the NDP, there is little if any mentioned about how to acquire citizenship in Lebanon.\n[10] I advised the claimant (inaudible) that I had done a Wikipedia search and it was indicated in that, that while non-Lebanese women can attain citizenship through marriage, the reverse was not the case for men. The claimant confirmed this information. He testified that he was told that the only way he could attach any residency to his spouse \u2014 his former spouse, was for a period of three (3) years, subject to renewal. He did try to do so initially when they \u2014 when he learned that they were having a child. However, due to the administrative wrangling he endured during this process, it took a long time. And by the time he was ready to file, he and his spouse had decided to divorce.\n[11] The claimant has filed his divorce certificate, which appears authentic on its face, since the claimant is no longer married and no longer has ties to the spouse, I find that the issues of country and reference and exclusions have not been engaged here. I am satisfied that the only country of reference for the purposes of this analysis is Iraq.\n[12] In terms of inclusion, and credibility, a claimant is presumed to tell the truth unless there is evidence to the contrary. In this case, I found the claimant to be articulate, and I find that there was consistency between his narrative and his testimony. In addition, the claimant has filed substantial corroborative evidence to support his claim. Most importantly, he has filed a statement from his father, which aligns with the narrative of the claimant. I have no reason to doubt the authenticity of this statement. Additionally, the claimant has provided statements from witnesses who had knowledge of the claimant\u2019s circumstances back in XXXX 2016. All of which align with the claimant\u2019s allegations.\n[13] And finally, the claimant has provided a notice and an investigation has been started by the Integrity Commission into the allegations made by the claimant. This in my view is solid evidence to support that the claimant had a story to tell about what he believed to be fraudulent activity. I am satisfied based on those documents and on the plethora of documents provided, and on the credible testimony that the claimant\u2019s allegations are true. That he quite rightfully as a legal consultant tried to report fraudulent activity, but due to the corruption at the higher levels in his department, that he was faced with violence and significant negative repercussions for disclosing these matters to persons that he initially trusted, but then had reason to learn that he should not have trusted them. I am satisfied that despite the claimant\u2019s reavailment to Iraq, that this has not negated his subjective fears based on the circumstances surrounding these redevelopments.\n[14] In terms of a nexus, I considered whether or not the claimant has a nexus, and I find that he does. His actions were perceived by the agents of persecution to be against the interests of the state, and it was the state that employed the claimant. I find this meets the ground for the claimant perceived as being acting against the state, thereby it being an imputed political opinion. I have therefore analyzed this claim under section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[15] In terms of the objective evidence, I have looked at NDP 10.4, which specifically talks about this particular XXXX that the claimant believes has been \u2014 which the claimant believes is the one that targeted him. In particular, I notice that this particular document talks about how the XXXX ask the victims to pay exorbitant ransoms, and that the victims despite paying these exorbitant ransoms, remains unknown whether their bodies are found dumped on the streets, or on the outskirts of cities, or near riverbanks. In some cases, even after the relatives pay ransoms. All of this is consistent with how the claimant and his father were treated.\n[16] I have also considered the claimant\u2019s subjective evidence provided in Exhibit 8. The articles talked about the power of the XXXX in Iraq, and how they are for example, killing protesters with impunity. In my view, the objective evidence and the subjective evidence all support that the claimant has a well-founded fear of persecution were he to have returned to Iraq.\n[17] In terms of state protection, the claimant worked for a government department, and the agents of persecution were part of that apparatus, Since the state is the agent of persecution, the claimant would not be able to access protection in an adequate manner. The same applies to an internal flight alternative. Since the state is the agent persecution, I find that he would not be safe anywhere in his country. And this is borne out by the violence he endured when he did try to reavail. Clearly, he was being surveyed and pursued.\n[18] So, my conclusion is that I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee and I therefore approve his claim.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n",

        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2022 RLLR 9\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: May 11, 2022\nPanel: Kay Scorer\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Salema Hage\nCountry: Syria\nRPD Number: VC2-00062\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2022-01960\nATIP Pages: N\/A\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: I\u2019ve considered your testimony and the other evidence before me and I\u2019m prepared to provide you with my decision orally.\n[2] This is the decision of the Refugee Protection Division in the claim of XXXX XXXX as a citizen of Syria who is claiming protection pursuant to Sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act also referred to as the Act.\n[3] In rendering my reasons and also in the conduct of the hearing, I\u2019ve considered and applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline on claims relating to a woman\u2019s gender.\nALLEGATIONS\n[4] The claimant\u2019s full allegations are contained in her Basis of Claim form and in her testimony at the hearing. Summarized only briefly, the claimant is an elderly Sunni widowed woman from Syria. She fears risk of persecution in Syria on the basis of her gender as a woman. All of her children reside outside of the country and she has no immediate family remaining in the country apart from a sister-in-law who is also an elderly woman. She fears being targeted as a vulnerable elder woman. The claimant also fears persecution on the basis of her religion as Sunni and her political opinion.\nDETERMINATION\n[5] I find the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to Section 96 of the Act. I find the claimant has established a nexus to Convention grounds of membership in a particular social group as a woman and religion as Sunni. It\u2019s the intersections of these identities where I find the claimant faces a risk in Syria.\nANALYSIS\nIDENTITY\n[6] The claimant\u2019s identity is established on a balance of probabilities by her testimony and by the copy of her Syrian passport in Exhibit 1.\nCREDIBILITY\n[7] In refugee determination claims, there is a presumption that the claimants and their allegations are true. In this case, I find no reason to doubt the claimant\u2019s truthfulness. The claimant testified in a forthcoming and spontaneous manner.\n[8] The claimant is an 80 year old woman and despite obvious frailties, I found that she testified in a clear and compelling manner. There were no material inconsistencies or contradictions between her Basis of Claim form, her testimony, and the other evidence before me.\n[9] The claimant was also able to support her claim with some documentary evidence all of which can be found in Exhibits 4 through 6 which includes identity documents and a copy of her late husband\u2019s death certificate. I have no reason to doubt the authenticity of these documents and I assign them weight as they corroborate the material elements or the claimant\u2019s allegations, namely the fact that she is an elderly widowed woman from Syria. I find the claimant has established on a balance of probabilities that she is an elderly Sunni widowed Syrian woman who fears persecution by the state on the basis of her gender as a woman, her political opinion, and her religion as a Sunni Muslim. I find the claimant has established her subjective fears.\nWELL-FOUNDED FEAR OF PERSECUTION\n[10] The objective evidence supports the claimant\u2019s fears of returning to Syria, My reasons for this are as follows: The documents in the NDP, for example, at items 5.1, 5.2, and 5.3 indicate that gender-based violence against women and children is pervasive in Syria and it has increased due to the conflict. Rape and sexual violence are endemic, underreported, and uncontrolled and are used to terrorize women, men and children perceived to support the opposition. Regime officials perpetrated gender-based violence with impunity. Government forces have perpetrated rape and sexual abuse of women. When women try to file police reports, the police often do not investigate thoroughly if at all and sometimes responded themselves with abusing women. The risk of gender-based violence is exacerbated in this case because the claimant is an elderly widowed woman. The country evidence before me confirms that women with particularly vulnerable profiles including widowed women like the claimant herself, face a higher risk of gender-based violence.\n[11] At NDP item 5.1 of the NDP, it states that widowed women face a heightened risk of sexual exploitation and are highly stigmatized by the Syrian society. The combination of being both female and Sunni adds a further dimension of risk in this case.\n[12] According to NDP item 1.12, Sunnis are often targeted by the regime due to a perceived anti-government opinion and arrests may be based merely on a person having resided in an area associated with the opposition or associated with Sunni communities.\n[13] Item 5.2 states that sexual violence against women has been used as a tactic in the war and has an integral part to the regime policy of subjugation of the opposition. The regime has framed the conflict as a fight between Alawites and Sunnis instead of a struggle for democracy. This government\u2019s antagonism towards Sunnis in particular has led to sexual violence against Sunni women. Ultimately I found the country evidence before me does establish that Sunni elderly widowed women face a serious possibility of persecution in Syria on the basis of their religion and their gender. I find the claimant\u2019s subjective fears are therefore objectively well-founded.\nSTATE PROTECTION\n[14] Except in situations where a state is in complete breakdown, states are presumed capable of protecting their citizens. In this case, the primary agent of persecution is the state and the persecution the claimant would face if returned to Syria is at the hands of the authorities. Accordingly, I find there is no state protection available to the claimant.\nINTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE\n[15] Further, the state of Syria is the agent of harm and it is in control of most of its territories. Where it is not in control, other armed groups as discussed posed a threat to women such as the claimant herself. Ultimately the claimant faces a serious possibility of persecution as an elderly woman without family support in all parts of Syria. I therefore find there is no Internal Flight Alternative available to this claimant.\n[16] For the foregoing reasons, I find the claimant is a Convention refugee under Section 96 of the Act and I therefore accept her claim.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n",

In coming to this decision today, I have considered and applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guidelines on woman claimants fearing gender-related persecution.\nDETERMINATION\n[3] I find the claimants are Convention refugees within the meaning of section 96 of the Act, because there is a serious possibility they will be persecuted in Colombia by reason of their membership in a particular social group of women and girls who are victims of domestic and family violence.\nALLEGATIONS\n[4] The following is a brief synopsis of the allegations that the claimants put forth in their Basis of Claim forms and narratives in Exhibit 2.\n[5] The claimants allege they face persecution in Colombia at the hands of the Principal Claimant\u2019s ex-partner, XXXX (ph), who is also the father of the minor claimant. The principal claimant met XXXX when she was young. Shortly after their relationship began, XXXX became violent. The principal claimant wanted to leave him, but she then became pregnant, and believed she had to stay for the sake of the minor claimant. The abuse continued throughout their relationship, including the pregnancy, the abuse was emotional, psychological, physical, and sexual. XXXX would follow her to and from work, threaten the claimant and her family, and abuse her on a regular basis. He stalked her in person and online and contacted partners and family members. The claimant was able to separate from XXXX after the minor claimant was born. The principal claimant felt compelled to allow XXXX and his family access to the minor claimant. At times, he would take her without bringing her back and at other times, when the minor claimant returned, she was unwell and seemingly uncared for. The principal claimant does not know how XXXX earns money but would be advised that he was involved with the Medellin Cartel and narco traffickers. He would post photographs on social media with narco traffickers. He would also advise the claimant of these connections and threatened to have someone kill her.\n[6] Despite being separated from XXXX, the abuse continued. The principal claimant tried to seek state protection. She called, for example, the XXXX XXXX XXXX a number of times. XXXX would flee before they arrived, and the police would never follow up on the incident. This allowed XXXX to continue with his behaviour. The principal claimant also obtained a protective order, which is in evidence, but XXXX abuse continued. In XXXX 2017, the principal claimant met a Canadian citizen online named XXXX (ph). XXXX paid for the claimant\u2019s travel to Canada. On the first trip, in XXXX 2018, the principal claimant came alone because she did not know how to obtain XXXX authorization for the minor claimant\u2019s travel. The claimant returned to Colombia in XXXX 2018. She wanted to bring the minor claimant to Canada with her. She spoke to a lawyer, and ultimately, the principal claimant was able to make an agreement not to pursue support payment against XXXX in return for his agreement to allow the minor claimant to permanently leave Colombia. Again, a copy of this agreement is also in evidence.\n[7] The claimants entered Canada for the final time in XXXX 2019. The claimants were fearful of returning to Colombia. They believed XXXX was going to sponsor them in Canada. In the summer of 2019, the claimant contacted the office responsible for the sponsorship application and was advised that XXXX had put a stop to the process without advising her. In XXXX 2019, he left the home, which forced the claimant to move in with a friend. Both claimants, I should say. XXXX returned after a month and apologized. They again began the spousal sponsorship process with a new firm. In XXXX 2020, XXXX again left with \u2014 while the claimants were out. He did not return. At the end of the relationship, he also was abusive.\n[8] At the end of XXXX 2020, the claimants contacted a legal clinic. The principal claimant explained her situation in Colombia and was advised about the refugee process. She then initiated the claim in about XXXX 2021.\n[9] Over the years, XXXX has continued to threaten the claimants, including by contacting XXXX in Canada and other partners and family members in Colombia. The claimants fear ongoing domestic violence should they return to Colombia.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[10] I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the claimant\u2019s identities as nationals of Colombia are established by the copies of their passports in Exhibit 1 and also by the principal claimant\u2019s credible testimony today.\nCredibility and Well-Founded Fear of Persecution\n[11] The duty of this Panel is to find that there is sufficient, credible, or trustworthy evidence to determine that there is more than a mere possibility that these claimants would be persecuted if returned to Colombia. My role is to determine if there is a reliable and trustworthy evidence that can establish the claimant\u2019s allegations on a balance of probabilities. In this case, I find there is.\n[12] The principal claimant testified on behalf of her family. She testified in a voluntary, detailed, and straightforward manner. She testified to her personal history, including her abusive relationship, and the resulting threats that she and her daughter have faced. Her testimony was very detailed, spontaneous, and emotive, and the claimant also provided ample supporting evidence to corroborate their allegations, including identity documents, a copy of the minor claimant\u2019s birth certificate, a custody order, a permanent travel authorization for the minor claimant, numerous police and state documents relating to the abuse from XXXX, including police reports and a copy of the temporary protective order, numerous documents relating to the relationship with XXXX and the sponsor \u2014 spousal sponsorship application in Canada, copies of correspondence between the principal claimant and the airport authorities in Colombia requesting information on XXXX notification request. I have no reason to doubt the authenticity of any of these documents. I assign the documents significant weight, as they corroborate the central elements of the claimants\u2019 allegations.\n[13] I also find the principal claimant has satisfactorily explained her delay in making a claim for protection in Canada and her re-availments to Colombia, which were at the behest of her ex-partner, XXXX, who controlled her immigration status in Canada, and which were based on her understanding of the requirements of the sponsorship process in Canada, and given she was required to return to Colombia to pick up her daughter. The delay in re-availments do not diminish the claimant\u2019s overall credibility or the core of their story about domestic, physical, and sexual violence. I find that the claimant\u2019s delays in claiming or the returns to Colombia do not impact the credibility of the claimant\u2019s subjective fears, as I find she has provided reasonable explanations. I therefore make no negative inference against the claimants.\n[14] Overall, I identified no material contradictions, inconsistencies, or omissions between the claimant\u2019s allegations and the evidence before me. I find the principal claimant was a credible witness, and I believe what she has alleged both in testimony and in whole in her Basis of Claim form and narratives. I note the \u2014 I note further that the claimant\u2019s subjective fears are objectively well-founded and corroborated by the country evidence before me.\n[15] According to a report at Item 5.4 of the NDP, \u201csources indicate that violence against woman has become normalized to the point that it is invisible to authorities and society in general in Colombia. Although prohibited by law, rape, including spousal rape, remains a serious problem. In Cali, women only report domestic violence to the FGN\u2019s office. Family commissaries not properly trained to deal with domestic violence complaints, and the process for dealing with domestic violence complaints are slow and lack effectiveness. Women are revictimized at state institutions as their \u2014 as they are the object of offensive or inconsiderate comments by officials who lay the blame on these women for the violence they have experienced. Conciliation is often considered in domestic violence situations, which, in practice, makes women vulnerable, because it means they have to accept the violence from their partner, and leaves them in an even more dire position. The infrastructure and personnel, especially at the family commissiaries (sic), is insufficient.\n[16] I accept the principal claimant was a victim of intimate partner violence, and that the minor claimant was a victim of domestic violence in Colombia as she was used as leverage by XXXX to harm the principal claimant. I also accept the principal claimant\u2019s testimony that she is certain that XXXX would harm the minor claimant. I find this certainty is not speculative, but actually a valid inference which can be drawn from the evidence, and which is derived from her own firsthand experiences. I note the objective evidence supports the claimant\u2019s allegations of the tolerance and impunity perpetrators of violence experience in Colombia. I find the claimants have established, with reliable and credible evidence, that they would likely \u2013 more likely than not, continue to experience emotional and physical violence from XXXX in Colombia. I find the claimants face a serious possibility of persecution in that country.\nState Protection\n[17] States are presumed capable of protecting their citizens. In this case, I find the presumption has been rebutted. According to the country condition documents before me, the Colombian Government has passed legislation to address domestic violence. However, these efforts have not been effective on an operational level, and domestic violence continues to be a serious problem throughout the country. The US DOS report at Item 2.1 of the NDP states that although prohibited by law, rape, including spousal rape, remains a serious problem in the country. The report further states that violence against women and impunity for perpetrators continue to be a problem.\n[18] According to Item 5.4 of the NDP, as I said, violence against women has become normalized in Colombia to the point that it is invisible to authorities and society in general. A Colombian non-governmental organization that advocated for woman\u2019s rights reports that in many cases women prefer not to report domestic violence out of a fear of being stigmatized or revictimized by state institutions. According to the United Nations, institutions that deal with cases of domestic violence in Colombia have insufficient capacity, resulting in high levels of impunity. As an example, in 2015, Colombia\u2019s Attorney General\u2019s office received over 85,000 cases of intra-family violence, with charges laid in just 12 percent of the cases, and a conviction rate of only 24 percent. Ultimately, I find there is sufficient objective clear and convincing evidence to establish the claimants are unable to receive operationally effective protection from the state authorities in Colombia. In this case, the principal claimant herself has already attempted to seek state protection on numerous occasions, each without any meaningful follow up or protection provided, and even after contacting the state, XXXX continued to harm the claimants. I find in this case the presumption of state protection has been rebutted.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[19] the first prong of this assessment is to determine on a balance of probabilities if there is a serious possibility of persecution in the internal flight alternative or a risk to life, cruel and unusual treatment. In this case, I did identify Medellin as a potential IFA. However, the Panel notes the agent of harm in this case has remained motivated and capable in finding the claimants through families and friends. He has been able to find the principal claimant online and even contacted her ex-partners. I find the claimants would have to remain in hiding to not come to XXXX attention. Further, as the father of the minor claimant having a parental connection to the child in the case would allow him to use the courts or police to assist him in locating the claimants throughout Colombia. Although the Panel recognizes court injunctions on him knowing her whereabouts could potentially be put in place under legislation, as previously noted, the ineffectiveness and the conciliation used in these cases is simply not reasonable, and I find there is not sufficient evidence to conclude that they would be effective.\n[20] Ultimately, I find the claimants do face a series possibility of persecution throughout Colombia, and that there is no internal flight alternative available for the claimants as a result.\nCONCLUSION\n[21] For the above noted reasons, I find both of the claimants are Convention refugees pursuant to section 96 of the Act, and I accept these claims today.\n[22] So, as I said, that will conclude our hearing for today. Again, thank you, everybody, for your involvement. I will take us off the record now and wish you all the best. Okay?\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n",

Coulthard\nCountry: Yemen\nRPD Number: VC1-07100\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2022-01960\nATIP Pages: N\/A\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: I have considered all of the evidence in this case, and I am prepared to provide my decision orally. This is the decision of the Refugee Protection Division in the claim of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, as a citizen of Yemen who is seeking protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. In coming to this decision today, and including in the hearing, I have considered and applied the Chairperson\u2019s guideline on woman claimants fearing gender-related persecution.\nAllegations\n[2] The claimant\u2019s allegations are contained in full in her Basis of Claim form and attached narrative at Exhibit 2. Summarized only briefly, the claimant is an elderly divorced female, alleging fear of persecution in Yemen due to her Sunni religion, her perceived political opinion, and membership in a particular social group, namely, her gender as a woman.\nDetermination\n[3] I find the claimant is a Convention refugee. I find the claimant has established a nexus to the Convention ground of membership in a particular social group, namely, her gender as a woman. Therefore, I am assessing this claim under section 96. I do note that the claimant has also alleged persecution based on her political opinion and her religion, however, I found her claim to be established on her gender alone, and have therefore only analyzed this element of her claim as a result.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[4] I find the claimant\u2019s identity as a national of Yemen is established based on her testimony, and also a copy of her passport, which can be found in Exhibit 1.\nCredibility\n[5] Pursuant to the Maldonado principle, the claimant benefits from a presumption that her allegations are true. In this case, I have no reason to doubt the truthfulness of the claimant. I note that the claimant is an uneducated elderly woman. This vulnerable profile was taken into consideration when assessing her testimony, and in questioning today. Despite some obvious barriers, she did testify in a forthcoming and emotive way that I did find to be compelling. Her Basis of Claim and narrative were detailed and materially consistent with her testimony at the hearing, and the other evidence before me. I found the claimant to be a credible witness. Further, I find that the material elements of her profile, namely her profile as an elderly woman, are corroborated by the objective evidence before me, which includes a copy of her passport. I find she has established she is a national of Yemen who fears persecution in Yemen based on her gender as a woman.\nWell-founded Fear and Risk of Harm\n[6] For a claimant to be a convention refugee, the claimant must have a well-founded fear of persecution due to a Convention ground. In this case, I find the documentary evidence is clear and consistent that women in Yemen face significant pervasive discrimination that amounts to persecution. I note that in this particular case, the claimant\u2019s vulnerabilities are further exacerbated by the fact that she is an elderly, uneducated, and divorced woman. She has no family in Yemen, and I find that this puts her at a serious risk of persecution based on her gender in that country. As noted by the report at the human rights watch at Tab 5.8 of the NDP which is in Exhibit 3, laws in Yemen require women to be obedient to their husbands. Women are generally not allowed to leave the house without permission of men. Honour killings by men of women and girls are treated very leniently by the courts, if they are prosecuted at all. As noted by the US DOS report at Tab 2.1, a male relative\u2019s consent was often required before a woman could even be admitted to a hospital. The claimant has no male relatives in Yemen. Without even taking into consideration the ongoing conflict in which woman and children bear a heavier burden of negative consequences, the discrimination against woman and girls in Yemen is so significant and pervasive that a woman is not even able to reliably seek medical treatment or help without a man there to give her permission. The US DOS report notes that with the loss of many men from households in the conflict, this requirement for a man\u2019s consent before women can get medical treatment means that many women are simply not receiving any medical treatment because hospitals are refusing to deal with women alone. According to the report at 5.7, gender-based violence in Yemen has risen to alarming proportions, with an estimated 90 percent of woman facing sexual harassment in public spaces. A report at Tab 2.7 by the UN Human Rights Council notes \u201cin 2018 and 2019, new oppressive gender norms have proliferated, and women and girls are further marginalized\u201d. Women are marginalized by both state and non-state actors, and the conditions have only worsened in recent years. I am satisfied based on the evidence before me and the remaining evidence in the NDP that the claimant will face a serious possibility of persecution as a woman if she were to return to Yemen. I find the claimant\u2019s fears are well-founded and forward-facing.\nState protection and Internal Flight Alternative\n[7] Except in situations where the state is in complete breakdown, states are presumed to be capable of protecting their citizens. The objective evidence before me indicates that all sides to the conflict in Yemen continue to commit severe human rights abuses. Given this, along with the ongoing conflict, instability, and widespread violence, I find there is no adequate or operational state protection available to the claimant in her particular circumstances, including the circumstances of being a divorced, elderly woman without male support. I find the presumption of state protection has been rebutted.\n[8] Further, I find that it is not safe nor objectively reasonable in all of the circumstances, including those particular to this claimant, to relocate anywhere in Yemen. I find the claimant faces a serious possibility of persecution through Yemen on the basis of her gender and profile as an elderly divorced woman. I also find that her gender would make internal relocation entirely unreasonable, given that women in Yemen often require permission from men to even leave their house. Accordingly, I find there is no IFA available to this claimant.\nCONCLUSION\n[9] Based on the foregoing analysis, I find the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the Act, and I therefore accept her claim.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n",

This is the decision of the Refugee Protection Division in the claim of XXXX XXXX XXXX, a citizen of Ethiopia who is claiming protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, also known as the Act. In coming to my decision, I\u2019ve reviewed and applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline on woman refugee claimants fearing gender-related persecution.\nAllegations\n[2] The claimant is an Amhara woman who fears political, ethnic, and gender-based persecution in Ethiopia. The claimant\u2019s full allegations are contained in her Basis of Claim form and narrative in Exhibit 2 and are reproduced briefly below. In about XXXX 2017, the claimant and her daughter were traveling back to Ethiopia after visiting a relative in Germany. The claimant\u2019s daughter was interrogated at the airport and the authorities demanded that she appear at the police station the following morning. The claimant\u2019s daughter was arrested on about XXXX XXXX, 2017 and held for three days. While she was arrested, she was tortured, beaten, and raped. She was accused of supporting political dissidents abroad, meeting the opposition in the diaspora, and bringing funds into the country to help the opposition in Ethiopia. The claimant herself paid her daughter\u2019s bail of about 10,000 birrs to facilitate her release, with the conditions that her daughter did not leave Addis Ababa, and that she report to the police on the first Monday of every month. Fearing for her life and safety, the claimant\u2019s daughter fled Ethiopia on about XXXX XXXX, 2017 and came to Canada, where she has since been found to be a Convention refugee. The claimant herself assisted her daughter in getting out of Ethiopia. She did this even while she was afraid that doing so would cause repercussions.\n[3] After the claimant\u2019s daughter fled Ethiopia, security agents went to the claimant\u2019s house in about XXXX 2018 with a summons for her daughter. The police warned the claimant that if her daughter did not appear, they would detain the claimant in her place. At this time, the claimant\u2019s daughter had already left the country. After this, the claimant herself continued to fear for her life and safety. She started to look for ways out of Ethiopia. She applied for a visitor\u2019s visa to Canada but was denied. Her son, who was in the USA, invited her to that country on a visitor\u2019s visa. That visa was approved in about XXXX 2019. From XXXX 2018 (sic) until about XXXX 2019, the claimant lived in hiding. She went from place to place, from relative to relative, trying to evade security forces. She did not live at her home. The claimant then paid a bribe to exit the airport safely. She had to do this because she was afraid that if she went through airport security, she would be arrested. She arrived in the USA in about XXXX 2019. The claimant remained in the USA from about XXXX XXXX, 2019 to XXXX XXXX, 2019. She did not claim protection because her son advised her to wait and see what would happen in Ethiopia. The claimant applied again for a Canadian visa while she was in the USA, and it was granted. The claimant traveled to Canada in XXXX 2019.\n[4] Since arriving in Canada, the claimant says the situation in Ethiopia has deteriorated. She fears returning to Ethiopia because she\u2019s already been threatened by the authorities with arrest. This is exacerbated by her gender and by the fact that she is now in Canada with the daughter, and both have sought protection, despite the claimant and her daughter breaching the conditions of her daughter\u2019s release. The claimant also fears persecution as an Amhara, and religious persecution as an orthodox Christian.\nDETERMINATION\n[5] I find the claimant is a Convention refugee. I find claimant\u2019s allegations have a nexus to the Convention grounds of political opinion, ethnicity, and gender. I\u2019ve therefore assessed this claim under s. 96 of the Act.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[6] I find the claimant has established her identity on a balance of probabilities by a copy of her Ethiopian passport, which can be found in Exhibit 1, and by her testimony.\nCredibility\n[7] The claimant benefits from the presumption that her allegations are true. In this case, I find no reason to doubt the truthfulness of the claimant. She testified in a spontaneous, forthcoming and compelling manner. She was detailed in her answers, and her answers were consistent with the narrative and the narrative of her daughter. The claimant also provided supporting documentation to corroborate her allegations, including a copy of her daughter\u2019s Basis of Claim form and her refugee decision, a supporting letter from her church, a supporting letter from her cousin who she stayed with Ethiopia after she was threatened by the state, and her birth certificate, which identifies her as Amhara. I have no reason to doubt the authenticity of these documents and I assign them weight, as they corroborate central elements of the claimant\u2019s allegations. I have considered whether the claimant\u2019s failure to claim in the USA and her delay in claiming once in Canada negatively impact the credibility of her subjective fear, and I find they do not. The claimant was in the USA from about XXXX 2019 to about XXXX XXXX XXXX 2019. She was residing with her son, she did not claim protection. She\u2019s then obtained a visa to come to Canada and arrived in Canada XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 2019. She did not initiate her claim for protection in Canada until about XXXX 2020.\n[8] I note that the claimant is uneducated, and she\u2019s lived much of her life as a homemaker. In the USA, she resided with her son. Her son speaks English and had been in the USA for six years. He told her not to claim protection until they knew what was going to happen in Ethiopia. The claimant accepted that her son was more knowledgeable than she on asylum claims in the USA, and she accepted his advice. Indeed, she relied on him for her livelihood in the USA. I find it reasonable on a balance of probabilities that she would take the advice of her son, even if that advice was perhaps not the best advice. Further, I find it reasonable that the claimant would continue with this advice even while in Canada. I note that the claimant was on valid status that did not expire until about April 2021. At the time that she made her claim, she was not under imminent, immediate threat of removal. Instead, as her son suggested, when she came to Canada, she continued to see what would happen in Ethiopia. Unfortunately, the situation continued to deteriorate and eventually the claimant realized she needed to claim protection. She did this well before her status expired. I find the claimant\u2019s explanations reasonable, and in light of her personal profile and circumstances, I make no negative inference against the claimant for her failure to claim in the USA or her delay in claiming in Canada. Ultimately, I find the claimant has established that her daughter is wanted by the authorities in Ethiopia, that the claimant herself was involved in bailing her daughter out and agreeing to the conditions of her release, and that the claimant herself assisted her daughter in fleeing the country despite the state demanding that she not do that.\n[9] I find that the claimant has also established that she fears returning to Ethiopia because of her ethnicity as an Amhara person, and because of her religion. I find that she was also directly threatened by the state, and that the state advised her that if her daughter did not appear, they would detain her in her daughter\u2019s place.\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution and Risk of Harm\n[10] The objective evidence supports the claimant\u2019s fears of returning to Ethiopia and indicates that, \u201cSecurity forces used excessive and sometimes lethal force and carried out extra judicial executions. Hundreds of people were killed, and property destroyed in ethnically motivated violence by armed groups and milia. Opposition members and journalists were subjected to arbitrary arrests and detention.\u201d That can be found at NDP 2.2. This confirms there is recurrent unrest and violence along ethnic lines in Ethiopia. Ultimately, I find on a balance of probabilities that the NDP establishes that ethnic groups like the Amhara, which is the claimant\u2019s ethnicity, face risk of persecution from state and non-state agents in Ethiopia. Specific reports of targeted violence against Amhara people can be found throughout the NDP, for example, at 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, to name a few. At NDP Item 2.2, it states that, \u201cInter-communal violence intensified in Ethiopia. In November, at least 54 people from the Amhara ethnic group in Gawa Qanqa village were killed in an attack by suspected members of the Oromo Liberation army (sic). In the same month, an armed conflict erupted in the Tigray region, and scores of ethnic Amhara residents, likely hundreds, were massacred in Mai Kadra.\u201d There were numerous reports in Item 2.2 of the NDP of Amhara people being targeted and attacked, including in September 2020 by the Benishangul People\u2019s Liberation Front (sic), where 45 people were killed and thousands displaced, in October 2020, where 31 Amhara residents from Guraferda were killed by armed assailants, and in November 2020, when local militias and youth stabbed and hacked to death scores and likely hundreds of ethnic Amhara residents in the western part of the Tigray region.\u201d According to NDP 2.3, the security and human rights situation in Ethiopia has deteriorated. The landscape \u201cWas defined by ongoing abuses by government security forces, attacks on civilians by armed groups, deadly violence along communal and ethnic lines, and a political crisis.\u201d According to NDP Item 1.8, the government is struggling to contain the disconnect from Ethiopia\u2019s myriad ethnic groups, fighting the federal government and each other for greater influence and resources. Outbreaks of ethnic violence have displaced around 2.4 million people according to the UN in Ethiopia.\n[11] I find the claimant, on a balance (sic), faces a serious possibility of forward-facing risk in Ethiopia on the basis of her ethnicity as Amhara. I\u2019ve also considered the claimant\u2019s risk as the known mother of a fugitive of the state in Ethiopia. The claimant\u2019s daughter was arrested on XXXX 2017 after being accused of meeting with political opposition outside of Ethiopia. The claimant assisted in facilitating her daughter\u2019s release from detention, including paying her bail. Both the claimant and her daughter have fled Ethiopia against the demands of the authorities. The authorities directly threatened the claimant that they would detain her if her daughter was not brought for the summons. I find, on a balance, that the claimant, like her daughter, is perceived as a political opponent or political dissident in Ethiopia. According to NDP 4.16, \u201cIndividuals who are known dissidents are at a high risk of detention,\u201d on return to Ethiopia. According to Item 4.21, the state continues to direct violence at actual and imputed government opponents, including through continued detention at government re-education camps, where detainees endure brainwashing. Ultimately, I find that the claimant is viewed on a balance of probabilities as a political opponent and dissident in Ethiopia, and that these conditions where these people face risk of persecution apply to the claimant. I find the claimant faces a serious possibility of persecution based on her imputed political opinion.\n[12] Lastly, I note that the claimant alleges she faces persecution as a result of her religion, being orthodox Christian. According to NDP 1.5, attacks on places of worship have increased since 2018. \u201cAccording to the Amhara Professionals Union, a US-based advocacy group, 30 churches belonging primarily to Ethiopian orthodox church were attacked between July 2018 and September 2019. These attacks reportedly left hundred people dead, including priests and parishers (sic).\u201d This is echoed in NDP 2.2. However, while I recognize that there are reports of orthodox Christians facing risk in Ethiopia, I find the claimant has established her claim based on her ethnicity and political opinion, and therefore, I am making no finding on whether orthodox Christians face risk of persecution in Ethiopia. Therefore, on a balance of probabilities, I find the claimant has establishes that she faces a serious risk of possibility of persecution in Ethiopia based on her ethnicity as Amhara and based on her imputed political opinion given she\u2019s perceived, on a balance, by the state as a political dissident.\nState Protection and Internal Flight Alternative\n[13] Given that the state agents are the agents of persecution in this case, I find that there is no operationally effective state protection available to the claimant in her circumstances. Further, given that the state has the capacity to find the claimant throughout Ethiopia, and namely that the claimant would have to go through the state to even enter Ethiopia, I find that it is neither safe nor objectively reasonable in all of the circumstances, including those particular to the claimant, for her to relocate anywhere throughout Ethiopia. Accordingly, I find there is no viable IFA available to the claimant.\n[14] In conclusion, for the foregoing reasons, I find the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to s. 96 of the Act, and I therefore accept her claim. Mister Interpreter, just a very brief overview, please. Ma\u2019am, I wish you all the best, and I will take us off the record. Everyone have a wonderful day.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n",

Okay? You will also receive a written version of this decision in the mail, and that will have reference to documentary evidence and case law. So, I will begin by telling you that my decision is a positive one and I have accepted your claims. So, congratulations.\n[2] CLAIMANT: Thank you so much.\n[3] MEMBER: You\u2019re welcome. I will now read you the reasons for my decision. They\u2019re a bit lengthy, so just bear with me. This is the decision of the Refugee Protection Division, the RPD, in the claim of XXXX XXXX XXXX, the claimant, of Zimbabwe, who is claiming refugee protection pursuant to s. 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, the IRPA. I have considered and applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guidelines on Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution. I have also considered and applied the Immigration and Refugee Board\u2019s Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9 on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression and Sex Characteristics, the SOGIESC Guidelines.\nDETERMINATION\n[4] I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to s. 96 of the IRPA based on her well-founded fear of persecution in Zimbabwe.\n[5] The specifics of the claim are stated in the claimant\u2019s Basis of Claim form and narrative in evidence. The claimant is a 38-year-old woman who identifies as bisexual. She faced threats and physical harm in Zimbabwe from her family members and general society due to her sexual orientation and her relationship with a woman. She was physically harmed on many occasions in public and in her home, and her home was burned down while she was inside. She soon \u2014 after this incident, she soon decided to move to South Africa, which she did in 2009 and remained there until 2018, where she lived on a work permit, which she renewed annually or biannually. In South Africa, she was also in a same-sex relationship with a woman named XXXX (ph) for four years, who she met at XXXX XXXX in Cape Town. Their relationship ended when the claimant moved to the USA in 2018 for employment on a cruise ship. The claimant relocated to the USA on a temporary work permit in XXXX 2018 and remained there until the end of 2018. While working on the cruise ship, she met her current partner, XXXX XXXX (ph), who is from Belize. They have been in an exclusive relationship since this time and they communicate daily. The claimant moved to Canada in early XXXX 2019 and made her refugee claim at that time. The claimant fears returning to Zimbabwe and being harmed or killed due to her sexual orientation.\nIDENTITY\n[6] I\u2019m satisfied with the identity of the claimant as a citizen of Zimbabwe, which is established by her testimony and the copy of her passport with a USA visa, type C (inaudible) in evidence.\nCredibility\n[7] When a claimant swears to the truth of allegations, this creates a presumption that those allegations are true unless there is reason to doubt their truthfulness. I find no reason to doubt the truthfulness of the claimant. She testified in straightforward, forthright, detailed, and candid manner. There were no material inconsistencies, omissions, or contradictions between the claimant\u2019s testimony and the other evidence in this case that were not reasonably explained. She did not exaggerate or tailor her evidence. In summary, her testimony was consistent with the other evidence on central aspects of her claim.\n[8] I find the claimant also provided ample details to expand upon her allegations and she provided evidence in Exhibit 4 which included a letter from the XXXX, which is an LGBTQ+ support organization in Canada, a certificate of attendance at the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX from XXXX 2019 to XXXX 2020, a letter from her current partner, XXXX XXXX and as well as her identification document, and a letter of support from XXXX XXXX (ph) from XXXX 2021, and a letter of support from her partner in South Africa \u2014 her former partner in South Africa, XXXX XXXX (ph) as well as for identification document. During the hearing, the claimant was asked if she could provide any photographs or other evidence to substantially her relationship to her current partner. The claimant testified that she had photographs and spontaneously turned on her phone and pulled up multiple photographs of her and her partner, Janalie Cruz. She further testified in a candid manner that her partner was a female who considered herself to be male. However, she was not able to afford the gender-affirming surgery yet. She further testified that her and her partner speak daily over video chat and they have future plans to be together in person and even get married as they have been in a relationship since 2018.\n[9] The claimant lived in South Africa from 2019 \u2014 sorry, 2009 to 2018, and then relocated to the USA on a temporary work visa for employment on a cruise ship. While in the USA, the claimant met her current partner. However, she feared making a refugee claim in the USA due to the Trump administration\u2019s stringent policies on refugees. She therefore relocated to Canada in 2019 to make a refugee claim. Considering the particular circumstances of claimant, I find her explanation to be reasonable and I find that her failure to claim asylum in the USA is not indicative of her lack of subjective fear. As such, I do not draw a negative inference on her credibility.\n[10] Due to the pandemic, the claimant has participated intermittently in LGBTQ organizations and events in Canada. There\u2019s a support letter from the XXXX in Exhibit 4 which is a settlement organization, providing programs and services to the LGBTQ community, who confirm the claimant\u2019s participation, and she participated in a number of XXXX hosted events.\n[11] Given the claimant\u2019s careful testimony and supporting documents, I find the claimant has established on a balance of probabilities the facts alleged in her claim, including that she has been threatened and harmed by her family in Zimbabwe as well as general society, as well as the allegations that she\u2019s a bisexual woman who is currently in a relationship with someone named XXXX XXXX, and therefore the subjective fear she has of returning to Zimbabwe now. In sum, I find the claimant to be a credible witness and therefore believe what she has alleged in support of her claim.\nNexus\n[12] To qualify for refugee status under the Refugee Convention, an individual must demonstrate that they have a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. The allegations establish a nexus to the Convention ground for the claimant based on her membership in a particular social group as a bisexual woman facing violence due to her sexual orientation. I will therefore assess this claim under s. 96. I find the claimant has a well-founded fear of persecution based on her sexual orientation.\n[13] The claimant testified that she experienced frequent physical violence and threats in Zimbabwe due to her same-sex relationships. The country condition documents indicate that LGBTQI persons face societal and official harassment and discrimination, arbitrary detention, and sporadic violence in Zimbabwe. According to the National Documentation Package for Zimbabwe at Item 6.1, the atmosphere \u2014 it states that the atmosphere of severe sociopolitical hostility directed at sexual and gender minorities over the past year was described in the UK Home Office\u2019s 2018 report. In fact, former President Mugabe\u2019s anti-gay rhetoric has been backed up by many politicians, including a member of the Zimbabwe Human Rights Commission. This report further states that this is frequently reflected in the media where journalists report that it is risky if not deadly to be gay and lesbian in Zimbabwe, a country where such relations are beyond taboo. According to a source in the National Documentation Package at item 6.2, a report on laws applying to LGBT individuals in selected Southern African countries, OutRight Action International, it states that \u201cAn international LGBTIQ organization that seeks to advance human rights and opportunities for LGBTIQ people around the world,\u201d and similarly states that in Zimbabwe, although the criminal law and Codification and Reform Act does not explicitly extend to homosexual women, in practice, lesbians are subjected to the same victimization, censure, and police harassment as gay men.\n[14] Additionally, one of the UN Human Rights Council stakeholder submissions for the forthcoming 2016 universal periodic review stated that \u2014 GALZ stated that homophobia permeates Zimbabwean society unchecked and manifests itself in different forms, ranging from verbal and physical assault (inaudible) discrimination of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex people on the basis of their sexual orientation or gender identity. NDP Item 6.3 states that refusal by duty-bearers and policymakers to address this issue has resulted in the public intolerance of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex persons becoming deeply ingrained in the community and reinforces the general stigmatization of sexual minorities in society. With respect to treatment by state actors, the DFAT report from 2016 stated that the authorities more commonly harassed LGBTI persons using loitering, indecency, and public order statutes, although violations are underreported because of the stigma attached to the LGBTI community. In 2014, Gays and Lesbians of Zimbabwe, the GALZ, reported that \u2014 41 cases of arbitrary arrest, violence, harassment, unfair dismissal, and forceful displacement involving LGBTI persons.\n[15] The claimant has identified as a bisexual woman who has already experienced physical violence in Zimbabwe on the basis of her sexual orientation. The objective evidence indicates that she faces a well-founded fear of persecution. Therefore, I find the claimant has demonstrated a well-founded fear of persecution on both a subjective and objective basis. I also find the claimant would face a serious possibility of persecution in Zimbabwe based on her profile as a bisexual woman.\nState Protection\n[16] In all refugee claims, a state is presumed to be capable of protecting its citizens unless there is clear and convincing evidence to the contrary. In this case, I find that this presumption has been rebutted. To rebut this presumption, a claimant must establish on a balance of probabilities through clear and convincing evidence that their state\u2019s protection is inadequate, and the onus is on the claimant to do this. According to NDP Item 6.3, there is a high level of official discrimination against LGBTI persons in Zimbabwe. Authorities continue to violate rights of LGBT people. A Zimbabwe Human Rights Commission report published in July showed continued hostility and systematic discrimination by police and politicians against LGBT people, driving many to live underground. At NDP Item 6.2, LGBTI individuals face arbitrary detention and torture at the hands of law enforcement officials. Police reportedly detained and held persons suspected of being gay for up to 40 hours before releasing them. LGBTI activist groups also reported police using extortion, threats, frequent beatings, mocking, and forced to pay bribes in order to escape custody. Where agents of the state are persecutors, a claimant\u2019s effort to seek state protection need not exhaust all avenues and recourse. In light of the country condition evidence regarding the availability of state protection to those who are similarly situated, I find that the claimant\u2019s efforts in this regard were reasonable and that on a balance of probabilities the state will not afford her adequate protection, and I find she has rebutted the presumption of state protection.\nInternal Flight Alternative, or IFA\n[17] The test for a viable IFA has two prongs, and I must be satisfied of both on a balance of probabilities in order for there to be a viable IFA. First, I must be satisfied that the claimant would not face a serious possibility of persecution and that she would not be personally subjected to a risk to life of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or a danger of torture in the IFA. Second, I must be satisfied that it would not be unreasonable in all the circumstances, including those particular to the claimant, for her to seek refuge there. Once an IFA has been proposed, the onus is on the claimant to show that the IFA is unreasonable. As the Zimbabwean state is involved with the harm and is therefore the agent of persecution and is in effective control of all of its territory, I find there is no viable internal flight alternative for the claimant within Zimbabwe as she would face a serious possibility of persecution throughout the country.\n[18] For these reasons, I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee under s. 96 of the Act, and I accept her claim. Thank you.\n[19] CLAIMANT: Thank you.\n[20] COUNSEL: Thank you very much.\n[21] MEMBER: You\u2019re welcome. Thank you for sharing your experiences with me today, and congratulations.\n[22] CLAIMANT: Thank you.\n[23] MEMBER: Have a nice afternoon, everyone. That is it for today.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n",

I have heard these claims jointly pursuant to rule 55 of the RPD Rules.\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] The full allegations are set out in the claimants\u2019 Basis of Claim forms found at Exhibit 2. However, I will summarize the allegations briefly. The principal claimant is a 52-year-old woman who has converted to Christianity. She was born into a Muslim family in Tehran. Her father was strict with Islam and imposed many of the rules on her. However, her mother was more liberal. The principal claimant was injured in a car accident when she was about 30 and was in a coma. An elderly Christian neighbour who is friends with her mother provided prayer and spiritual support for the principal claimant\u2019s recovery. Once she had recovered from the coma, she began to think of Christianity as benevolent. Unfortunately, her neighbour passed away.\n[4] The principal claimant then came to Canada in XXXX 2019 with her stepson, the associate claimant, where she continued to explore the Christian faith. She began to attend XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and gained knowledge from the church leaders. She states that she has formally converted in XXXX 2020. She also has a sister in Canada, who accidentally advised another Muslim sister in Iran of the principal claimant\u2019s conversion. Her sister in Iran then informed her work, and she was fired. The principal claimant alleges that her conversion to Christianity places her at risk of persecution in Iran from both the state and her family. She believes that she is in danger if she returns to Iran.\n[5] The associate claimant is a 19-year-old man and the stepson of the principal claimant. He came to Canada in order to study. He feels that Shia Islam is superstitious and restrictive. He disagrees with practices that he feels are outdated and has been exploring Christianity also. At the time of his initial claim, he did not yet consider himself to identify as a Christian but stated that his beliefs and lifestyle are un-Islamic and that he has renounced Islam. In addition to being considered an apostate, he also fears an imputed religious conversion, as his stepmother has converted formally to Christianity. Moreover, his allegations note that he fears conscription to the military in Iran.\nDECISION\n[6] I find that the claimants are Convention refugees in accordance with section 96 of the Act.\nIdentity\n[7] I find that the claimants\u2019 national identities as nationals of Iran is established through their testimony and the supporting documentation filed, including their passports found at Exhibit 1.\nNexus\n[8] I find that the persecution feared by the principal claimant has a nexus to the Convention by reason of religion, as she has converted to Christianity. For the associate claimant, I also find there is a nexus to the Convention by way of religion, as his renunciation of Islam is considered apostasy.\nANALYSIS\nCredibility\n[9] The determinative issue in this claim is the credibility of the allegations. Pursuant to the Maldonado principle, it is presumed that sworn testimony is true, unless there is sufficient reason to doubt its truthfulness. In these cases, I find there to be no such reasons. Overall, the principal and associate claimants testified with authenticity and without embellishment at the hearing, and I find them both to be credible. Further, there was sufficient corroborative documents provided which supported the testimony and which I will discuss. I therefore accept what they have alleged in support of their claims. And specifically, I accept that the principal claimant is a Christian convert who subjectively fears persecution in Iran and that the associate claimant has also renounced Islam and is in the process of converting to Christianity and therefore subjectively fears persecution, as he is considered apostate.\n[10] The principal claimant was asked about her conversion to Christianity and baptism. She stated that she attended classes for about 10 months in addition to regular services before being baptized. Her family in Canada also attended her baptism ceremony. And she testified that after, when her sister in Canada sent photos of another family birthday event, she also accidentally attached the baptism photos. This caused an issue with the principal claimant\u2019s family in Iran, and they have not had positive relations since then. On the other hand, both she and the associate claimant testified that her husband and the father of the associate claimant, while remaining Muslim, does not take issue with her conversion. Additionally, her job had allowed her leave of absence, but once the year was up, they contacted her family in Iran to inquire about her return and were told she would not return and that she had converted to Christianity. She was then fired. She also spoke briefly about being interested in Christianity while in Iran but not having the option to attend church there, as it was not allowed. She articulated that she chose Christianity because she wanted peace of mind and tranquility, and due to the interpretation of Islam in Iran that women are not considered equal to men. She stated that she tried different churches, but that her church has Farsi interpretation available, and therefore, she is able to understand the content.\n[11] The associate claimant also expressed that since coming to Canada and attending church with his stepmother, he now identifies as Christian, and he has plans to be baptized in the next few weeks. He testified that he is attending classes on Tuesdays to learn about Christianity and that he also attends services on Sundays. He was able to demonstrate knowledge of Christianity beyond a basic understanding, speaking about the mechanics of a service in particular. The associate claimant was asked to expand on what he disagrees with in Islam, and he stated that he does not like the constant bloodshed and war that he feels exists in the religion. He noted that there is a lot of sadness and limitations in the Islamic traditions in Iran.\n[12] There is persuasive documentary evidence submitted in the claims, which are found at Exhibits 4 and 5. Regarding her conversion to Christianity, the principal claimant submits both confirmation and baptism certificates from Holy Trinity Catholic Church in North Vancouver. She also has a support letter on file from the priest of the church, and copies of text and email communications between herself and other church leaders and attendees, as well as a copy of her dismissal letter from her employer in Iran. There is also some limited documentary evidence regarding the associate claimant. He is also named in the support letter from the church, and there is some evidence of email communication between the church and himself.\n[13] Overall, I find that both claimants are credible and have established a subjective fear of persecution in Iran.\nWell-Founded Fear\n[14] To establish one\u2019s status as a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection, claimants must show that there is a serious possibility that they would be persecuted or, on a balance of probabilities, be subjected to a risk to life, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or a danger of torture, if removed to their country of origin, in these claims, Iran. I find that the claimants have met that burden. The risk that the claimants allege is corroborated by the objective country conditions evidence provided in the National Documentation Package before me at Exhibit 3. Several documents speak to this. Found at 2.1 is the US Department of State report, which describes Iran as an authoritarian, theocratic republic with a governmental human rights record that is extremely poor. Islam is the official state religion. The law prohibits Muslim citizens from changing or renouncing their religion. The country conditions evidence found in Exhibit 3 at Tabs 12.11, 12.14, and 12.15 clearly indicates that religious freedom is virtually nonexistent in Iran, with the government engaged in systematic and ongoing egregious violations of religious freedom, including prolonged detention, torture, and execution. Regarding their religious beliefs or absence of belief, their rejection of Islam may be understood as both a religious and, by extension, even political opinion that is against the theocratic regime in Iran.\n[15] The principal claimant has fully converted to Christianity, which puts her at risk of persecution as apostate from Islam. The associate claimant has been involved with the church in Canada, and given his relationship to his stepmother, who has now fully converted, a perception that he is a convert to Christianity could also be imputed to him. Either way, he rejects Islam, which is considered apostasy and subject to grievous punishment in Iran. I find on a balance of probabilities that the claimants have established a well-founded fear of persecution in Iran with a nexus to the Convention ground of religion. They fear the state and the principal claimant\u2019s family, both. Apostasy is punishable by death, according to Iranian law.\nState Protection and Internal Flight Alternative, IFA\n[16] In these claims, the claimants\u2019 religion as converts to Christianity, or in the process of converting to Christianity, and rejection of Islam is grounds of persecution. There is more than a mere possibility of persecution for both the claimants if they were to return to Iran. I find that it would be objectively unreasonable for the claimants to seek the protection of the state. As the state is feared as an agent of persecution, the claimants would not be able to avail themselves of the protection of the authorities of Iran, and the presumption of state protection has been rebutted.\n[17] Furthermore, as the claimants fear persecution at the hands of the state, they would not be able to relocate to escape the risks that they face, and there is no viable internal flight alternative. I find there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout the entire country of Iran.\nCONCLUSION\n[18] Based on the totality of the evidence, I find that the claimants are Convention refugees under section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. Accordingly, I accept their claims.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n",

I note for the record that the principal claimant has been designated as the representative for the minor claimants.\nDETERMINATION\n[2] For the reasons that follow, I find that the principal claimant, associate claimant, and minor claimant, XXXX XXXX, are Convention refugees as they have each established a serious possibility of persecution on account of at least one Convention ground in Afghanistan. In the case of the minor claimant, XXXX XXXX, in order for claim for refugee protection to be successful, the Act requires that the claim must establish a claim against each of their countries of nationality. In this case, no claim was advanced against the United States by the minor claimant or on her behalf. Indeed, there is no evidence before me that the minor claimant faces a risk of persecution or of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or of torture in the United States. Accordingly, it\u2019s unnecessary to examine the risks she faces in Afghanistan, and her claim for protection must be rejected.\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] You each fear persecution at the hands of the Taliban in Afghanistan due to the principal claimant\u2019s previous employment as a XXXX XXXX XXXX with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, in which he XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in the United States at the XXXX XXXX XXXX in New York. The associate and minor claimants alleged persecution as members of a particular social group as the family members of the principal claimant.\n[4] The former Afghan government collapsed on August 15, 2021, resulting in the principal claimant\u2019s job being terminated and with it, any status as a government employee. After monitoring the situation for a couple of weeks and watching evacuations of Afghans that had previously worked with the US Government, the claimants chose to travel to Canada XXXX XXXX, 2021, and submit claims. They were deferred until XXXX XXXX, 2021, due to border restrictions as a result of the pandemic. The claimants submit that they did not submit claims in the US as they have a family member in Vancouver and due to a long and uncertain asylum process in the USA. It is again noted that the youngest family member, Elina, was born in the USA and thus holds US citizenship.\n[5] The claimants allege that the Taliban targets anyone who has XXXX XXXX XXXX and especially Americans and that they are considered a kafir or infidel. The principal claimant notes that as the Taliban has taken over the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, where he was once employed, that they will have access to his information and, certainly, he and his family will be marked for harm and\/or death. He notes that he has publicly stated his political opinion, which is opposite to that of the Taliban, on social media and that this will further incite persecution from the Taliban. The claimants have also submitted that the female claimants will face gender-based persecution and harm from the Taliban due to their membership in a particular social group as females.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[6] I find that your identities as nationals of Afghanistan have been established by the documents provided at Exhibit 1, namely your Afghan passports. In the case of the female minor claimant, I am satisfied of her identity and citizenship in the United States by her USA passport as well as her citizenship in Afghanistan as per her parents, who are Afghanis, and this is also found at Exhibit 1.\nCredibility\n[7] Pursuant to the Maldonado principle, a claimant\u2019s testimony is presumed to be true unless there is valid reason to doubt their truthfulness, such as with inconsistencies, contradictions, or implausibilities. In these cases, I have no such reason to doubt the testimony of the claimants. There were no relevant inconsistencies in the evidence or contradictions between the evidence and other evidence before me.\n[8] The principal claimant has testified regarding his occupation that he was employed from XXXX 2019 until XXXX 2021 in the USA XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. He explained that they were not offered assistance to remain in the US by the US government and that he did not seek out assistance in the US as it did not appear that, as Afghan employees, the US government would assist. He fears the Taliban to due to his employment in this capacity and especially as someone who worked with the Americans as the Taliban specifically targets people in those positions. The associate claimant also testified to the same fear and additionally testified emotionally regarding her fear for herself and the minor female claimant of having no rights as females in Afghanistan under the Taliban.\n[9] The claimants have provided ample supporting documentations to support their allegations. These are found at Exhibit 5 and include photographs of the principal claimant at various official events in his capacity as an Afghan government representative, copies of his social media posts, and, at Exhibit 1 again, service passports for the principal, associate, and minor male claimant. Upon a review of these documents, I find no reason to doubt their authenticity and therefore place significant weight on them as they serve to corroborate the allegations. I find that the claimants are credible and have established a subjective fear of persecution in Afghanistan.\nWell-Founded Fear\n[10] For equipment to be a Convention refugee, they must have a well-founded of persecution due to a Convention ground. The Convention grounds are race, religion, nationality, membership, in a particular social group, and political opinion. I find that the harm these claimants fear is by reason of multiple intersecting factors, including their actual or perceived political opinion, as the principal payment was an employee of the previous government as well as having been posted to North America, and in the case of the associate and male minor claimants, their membership in a particular social group as members of an employee of the former Afghan national government. As well, the harm feared by the associate claimant is due to her membership in a particular social group as woman.\n[11] I also find that the objective evidence in the National Documentation Package, the NDP, for Afghanistan supports the allegations, including at Items 1.5 and 2.1 as follows. Civilians associated with or perceived to be supporting the former Afghan government, civil society, and the international community in Afghanistan, including the international military forces and international humanitarian and development actors, have been subject to intimidation, threats, abduction, and targeted attacks by anti-government elements, including the Taliban. This may include returnees from Western countries. The Taliban continues to commit human rights abuses, including killings and kidnappings against those who oppose them, and maintains illegal detention centres. The Taliban and other insurgents continue to kill security personnel and civilians using indiscriminate tactics, such as improved explosive devices, IEDs, suicide attacks, and rocket attacks, and to commit disappearances and torture. The Taliban referred to their attacks as martyrdom operations.\n[12] Violence against women remains a widespread, common, and undeniable reality in Afghanistan. Impunity in relation to such violence is reportedly common, despite the previous government\u2019s efforts to promote gender equality. Women who are perceived as transgressing social norms continue to face social stigma and gender discrimination and threats to their safety, particularly in rural areas and areas controlled by anti-government entities or the Taliban. At Item 1.20, the report notes regarding recent political situations that the Taliban states that women\u2019s rights will be permitted within the limits of Islamic sharia. Such norms include a strict dress code as well as requirements that restrict a woman\u2019s freedom of movement, such as the requirement to be accompanied by a male relative chaperone when appearing in public. The level of discrimination that women such as the associate claimant face is sufficiently serious to constitute persecution. The recent withdrawal of international troops from Afghanistan has increased this risk. This is supported by Item 1.14 of the NDP as follows.\n[13] In the wake of the withdrawal of international troops from Afghanistan, there has been rapid deterioration in the security and human rights situations in large parts of the country. Reports emerged from Taliban-held areas of the imposition of restrictions on personal and social freedoms and the erosion of women\u2019s rights and access to services, including education. The Taliban has taken control of a rapidly increasing number of districts, with their advance accelerating in August 2021 to capturing 33 out of 34 of Afghanistan provincial capitals in the space of 10 days, ultimately taking control of the presidential palace and capital. Again, this is at 1.14 in the NDP. This upsurge of violence has had a serious impact on civilians, including women and children. At Item 1.28, we have a UNHCR report that notes that it is concerned about the risk of human rights violations against civilians, including women and girls, and against Afghans who are perceived by the Taliban to have a current or past association with the Afghan government or with the international military forces in Afghanistan or with international organizations in the country. It advises against returns to Afghanistan of those who have fled, including those whose asylum claims have failed.\n[14] I find that the country evidence noted above establishes that those associated with the government and\/or international agents and women who do not abide by traditional Islamic criteria, such as the associate claimant before me and the principal claimant, face persecution by the Taliban in Afghanistan. I therefore find that three claimants, the principal, associate and male minor claimants have established a serious risk of persecution, including death by the Taliban, should they return to Afghanistan.\n[15] Regarding the female minor claimant, as I\u2019ve mentioned, there is no claim advanced against the United States, of which she is a citizen, and therefore, I find her not to have established a well-founded fear persecution in the United States. I find that she\u2019s neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection with respect the United States. Consequently, I need not examine her claim against Afghanistan as she can safely return to the USA.\nState Protection and Internal Flight Alternative\n[16] Based on the objective evidence just discussed, I find that there\u2019s not adequate or operationally effective state protection available in Afghanistan. The former Afghan government pardon has collapsed, turning the entire country, effectively, over to the Taliban. The agents of persecution govern most, if not all of the country. Given the specific circumstances of the principal, associate, and male minor claimants and the very recent occurrences in the country and that the Taliban control most of the country, I also find that there is no viable internal flight alternative for these claimants in Afghanistan.\nCONCLUSION\n[17] I find that the principal, associate, and male minor claimants, are Convention refugees pursuant to s. 96 of the IRPA, and I accept their claims. I find that the female minor claimant is not a Convention refugee pursuant to s. 96 of the IRPA or a person in need of protection pursuant to s. 97 of the IRPA. I therefore reject her claim, and that is the end of decision and reasons for the transcription records.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n",

        "unofficial_text":"Citation: 2022 RLLR 2\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: May 24, 2022\nPanel: Douglas Cryer\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Hachem Hassan Fawaz\nCountry: Lebanon\nRPD Number: VC1-08109\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2022-01960\nATIP Pages: N\/A\nDECISION\n[1] MEMBER: This is a decision of the Refugee Protection Division in the claim of XXXX XXXX, citizen of Lebanon and making a claim for refugee protection under section 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[2] You allege the following. You owned XXXX XXXX, which were forced to close because members of Hezbollah and other religious extremist groups were accusing you of pulling women away from Islam. You did this by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and this is contrary to some people\u2019s beliefs, that women should stay at home and wear the niqab when outside. On XXXX XXXX in 2021, you are at your client\u2019s house in Beirut. You heard gunfire. You looked outside and you recognized one (1) of the members of Hezbollah who was a high-ranking official. When you called out to him, he was shocked that someone actually recognized him. He and his accomplices ran after you and fired gunshots towards you, but you are able to lock yourself and shelter in a building. 10 hours later when the clash ended, you were rescued by some police. The day following this clash, you received a threatening phone call from this Hezbollah member. He said he knew where your family was. He asked you to provide information about the people who sheltered you. He thought that you had taken a cellphone video of him. Out of fear, you did not return home, this based on the advice your father gave you. You fled to the United States before coming to Canada to make your refugee claim.\n[3] INTERPRETER: Excuse me, sir?\n[4] MEMBER: You fled to the United States before coming to Canada to make a refugee claim.\n[5] This is a case where we consider the Chairperson\u2019s gender guidelines. I did not have to make any particular application in relation to credibility. I considered the guidelines throughout.\n[6] At the beginning, we listed the issues. Let us go through them now. Do you meet the definition of a Convention refugee or a person who is in need of protection? A Convention refugee is a person by reasons of a well-founded fear of persecution and for the following reasons. Race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or for political opinion as outside of your country of nationality, in this case, Lebanon, and that you are unable or by reason of your fear unwilling to avail yourself of the protection of the state. The definition for a person in need of protection does not apply here, so I will go over that.\n[7] This is my decision. I find that you are a Convention refugee as you have established that you have a serious possibility of persecution if you return to Lebanon. This is based on your nexus to the Convention grounds. You belong to a particular social group, someone who fears gender-related persecution and for imputed political opinion because members of Hezbollah think that you could harm them. They think you have a video showing their violent actions.\n[8] Next question. Have you established your identity, and do you possess acceptable documentation establishing your identity? I find that your identity as a national of Lebanon is established by your credible testimony and by the documents you provided. There is a certified photocopy of your passport in Exhibit 1.\n[9] Is your claim credible? When you affirmed that you would tell the truth, this created a presumption that your allegations are true unless there are serious reasons to doubt their truthfulness. I had no reason to doubt your truthfulness. Your testimony today was consistent with what you wrote in your narrative. It is corroborated by documentary evidence, including letters of support from your father and your husband, especially.\n[10] Is your fear to your return to your country well-founded? There must be both a subjective and an objective basis for your fear. What we mean by subjective fear is that your behaviour or your actions should be consistent with somebody who fears return to their country. In this case, the incident happened in Beirut and your family warned you not to return to your village. You stayed in hiding until very shortly afterwards you fled your country. These actions are consistent with somebody who would have a subjective fear of return. Is there objective evidence? The answer is yes based on your credible testimony and current country condition reports that you provided in Exhibit 4. Exhibit 3, the National Documentation Package, contains the evidence that people who fear Hezbollah, that Hezbollah has the resources to track people they are seeking. They have the ability to exercise control outside of the traditional legal system in Lebanon and they control large portions of Lebanon. This is described in Item 1.3, the Department of Foreign Affairs report for Australia and Item 7.8, which is a Response to Information Request that shows the extent and reach of Hezbollah.\n[11] Have you provided evidence which establishes on a balance of probabilities that the authorities in your country cannot provide you with adequate protection? There is a presumption that states can protect their own citizens. This can be rebutted in a claimant\u2019s individual circumstances. In this case, there is evidence that Hezbollah has harassed your husband and your immediate family over the months. There is evidence that the clash that you were speaking of, that there were approximately 30 people killed that day. Hezbollah has a reach and an influence that goes beyond Lebanon security forces. And like some other groups, Hezbollah has not given up their weapons. When you read these two (2) documents that I mentioned earlier, it is clear and convincing evidence that the state has an inability to protect from people who fear Hezbollah.\n[12] Concerning the treatment of women in Lebanon, the Department of Foreign Affairs report that I referred to earlier mentions that Lebanon ranks I think 133 out of 144 for treatment of women in the world. This document summarizes that women generally face discrimination. In your own case, you face direct persecution, in that you had to shut down XXXX XXXX because religious extremists did not agree XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. And it is obvious in your case that the police did not offer you adequate protection in this case.\n[13] Finally, we ask the question, would it be unreasonable for you to seek refuge in a different part of your country? Although not mentioned specifically throughout the hearing, Beirut is likely the most viable place that a person could flee to and live there. This is where you faced your own persecution, so it would be unreasonable for you to relocate to Beirut. There is a two-pronged test or two (2) tests. Could you live anywhere without a serious possibility of being persecuted? Since I find that there is inadequate protection for you in Lebanon, I find that there is no viable internal flight alternative.\n[14] These are all the reasons that make you a Convention refugee under section 96 of the Act, and these are the reasons your claim is accepted.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n",

Gayda\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Annie N O\u2019Dell\nCountry: Nigeria\nRPD Number: TB8-20107\nAssociated RPD Number(s): TB8-20130, TB8-20131, TB8-20132\nTB8-20491\nATIP Number: A-2022-00210\nATIP Pages: 000001-000034\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] XXX XXXX XXXX (the \u201cprincipal claimant\u201d) and her four daughters, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (the \u201cminor claimants\u201d), and XXXX XXXX XXXX (the \u201cassociated claimant\u201d), citizens of Nigeria and Italy, claim refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (\u201cIRPA\u201d).1\n[2] These claims were heard jointly pursuant to Rule 55 of the Refugee Protection Division Rules.2 The principal claimant was appointed as the Designated Representative for the minor claimants. She and the associated claimant, who is her 18-year-old daughter, testified on behalf of all the claims.\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] The claimants allege a fear of gender-based persecution resulting from domestic violence at the hands of the principal claimant\u2019s ex-common-law husband, XXXX XXXX XXXX (\u201cKO\u201d) the biological father of her two youngest children. The principal claimant survived domestic violence at KO\u2019s hands in Italy, where the family resided, and the associated claimant also experienced physical violence at his hands. The claimants allege that all her children, the associated claimant and the minor claimants, witnessed her being abused at the hands of KO in Italy for several years. The claimants used to live with KO in XXXX Italy, a city in north-west Italy, west of XXXX.\n[4] In Italy, the claimants allege that state protection is not adequate for them, given their personal circumstances and given their particular past experiences in attempting to obtain adequate state protection. One of the principal claimant\u2019s attempts to obtain protection resulted in KO being charged and eventually convicted in 2018 for physically harming her in 2015. While these charges were pending, he continued to reside, by law, with the claimants and he continued his physical abuse. The principal claimant alleges that KO was sentenced to over a year of \u201chouse arrest\u201d and that this was to occur with him living with the claimants in their shared family home. Fearing this situation would lead to further abuse, the claimants fled to Canada.\n[5] The claimants also allege a fear of gender-based persecution in Nigeria in the form of continued violence from her ex-husband in Nigeria. The principal claimant also alleges that she believes that KO is a member of a transnational criminal gang, the Black Axe Fraternity, and that this heightens the claimants\u2019 risk of harm and their ability to be located in both Italy and Nigeria, by KO himself, KO\u2019s family members and his associates. The claimants also allege to fear that the three minor female claimants would also face gender-based persecution in the form of female genital mutilation (\u201cFGM\u201d) at the hands of members of her family in Nigeria.\nDETERMINATION\n[6] I find, for the reasons that follow, that the claimants have established that they would face a serious possibility of persecution in Italy and Nigeria and hence that they are Convention refugees pursuant to section 96 of IRPA. I therefore accept their claims.\nANALYSIS\nCredibility\n[7] In making this assessment, I have considered all the evidence before me, including the claimants\u2019 oral testimony over three sittings, the evidence as set out in the Consolidated List of Documents, counsel\u2019s submissions, as well as the Chairperson\u2019s Guidelines, specifically Guideline 4 \u2013 Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution3 which highlight that women refugee claimants may face special problems in demonstrating that their claims are credible and trustworthy. Factors that may affect their ability to provide evidence include difficulty in providing testimony on sensitive matters, cross-cultural misunderstandings as well as social, religious and economic differences.\n[8] I have also considered the psychological assessment before me from a registered psychologist for the principal claimant4 in assessing the principal claimant\u2019s testimony. This psychologist provided a report from an in-person assessment in January 2019 with the principal claimant that consisted of a 4.5-hour visit, involving a semi-structured interview and three psychological screening measures. The psychologist found that the principal claimant\u2019s description of symptoms and answers to questions indicated that she was dealing with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, was consistent with her described experience of traumatic events and met the provisional criteria for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX\n[9] I found the claimants\u2019 testimony to be generally credible with respect to the core allegations of their claim. The principal claimant and associated claimant testified consistently with their BOC forms and their corroborating evidence and provided elaborative details in a natural manner about their circumstances and the incidents that led them to flee Italy and why they believe they would face risks in Nigeria. They provided a good deal of corroborating documentation, and reasonable and knowledgeable responses about this documentation when asked. Their responses to my questions were reasonable and did not appear to be evasive or to embellish their fears.\n[10] I find the claimants to be credible with respect to their core allegations of fearing persecution for themselves and the minor claimants in Italy and Nigeria, and that they have credibly established, on a balance of probabilities, that violence and continued threats of violence from the principal claimant\u2019s ex-husband, KO, have caused this fear. Moreover, they have also credibly established the core allegation of fearing gender-related persecution for the minor claimants in Nigeria, in them being subjected to FGM by the principal claimant\u2019s family. The claimants also provided corroborating evidence with respect to core elements of their claim, and this assists in establishing their allegations, on a balance of probabilities. I will refer to some of this corroborating evidence in my analysis below.\nIdentity\n[11] I am satisfied that the personal and national identities of the claimants have been established on a balance of probabilities through the principal and the associated claimants\u2019 testimony and the certified true copies of the claimants\u2019 Italian and Nigerian passports, the originals having been seized by the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) upon the claimants\u2019 arrival in Canada.5 I find on a balance of probabilities that the claimants are dual citizens of Italy and Nigeria and do not hold citizenship or permanent residence in any other country.\nNexus\n[12] The nexus to a Convention refugee ground for the claimants is that of their membership in the particular social group of women and girls fearing gender-based persecution. The claimants fear domestic violence from KO and those who may associate with him in the Black Axe criminal group, or other individuals that KO may hire to harm them in Nigeria and Italy. The principal claimant has also set out a fear of FGM, another form of gender-based persecution, for the minor claimants in Nigeria, at the hands of members of her own family who support this practice and believe that girls in the family should have it done, even though the principal claimant, their mother, does not want them subjected to this cutting.\n[13] I also note that the claimants\u2019 experiences in Italy, and particularly the principal claimant\u2019s experiences in attempting to obtain protection from Italian state authorities, are also impacted by their race, as Black individuals with dual Nigerian citizenship. Race is an enumerated ground in the Refugee Convention. I have considered how both the immutable characteristics of race and gender intersect and affect the risks alleged by the claimants and this includes their experiences in attempting to obtain adequate state protection, and in attempts they would make to relocate in Italy. Since l have found a nexus in these claims, I have analyzed and accepted these claims pursuant to section 96 of IRPA.\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution\nSubjective Fear\n[14] I find that the claimants have established through their credible testimony and reliable corroborating evidence that they are subjectively fearful of returning to Italy and Nigeria. They fled Italy for Canada on XXXX, 2018 and initiated their claims for refugee protection at the airport in Toronto. I find that the claimants\u2019 actions including in the principal claimant\u2019s brief visits to Nigeria at particular points in time prior to them leaving Italy on XXXX, 2018, are consistent with a genuine subjective fear of persecution, in light of their personal circumstances.\nObjective Basis for the Risks alleged\nItaly\nDomestic Violence\n[15] The claimants fear domestic violence in Italy from KO or violence directed at them by his associates in Italy. The country conditions evidence indicates that there are significant concerns with respect to domestic violence against women in Italy. The United State Department of State Report for Human Rights Practices for 2020 in Italy notes that 535 women were killed by domestic partners in the first six months of2020 alone.6 The New York Times in 2018 cites a Eures study that noted that 150 women were killed in Italy each year by abusive partners and that this number makes it one of the highest death tolls in Europe for domestic violence deaths.7 The Eures study also notes that in one third of the fatalities of women at the hands of their domestic partners in Italy, the victims had already complained to the police.8 A 2021 news article notes that one woman is killed every three days in Italy, and that societal attitudes in Italy, even based on a very recent survey, continue to condone and accept violence against women as a normal part of intimate relationships.9 Based on the sum of the country conditions evidence before me, I find that there is a well-founded objective basis for the risks to the claimants of domestic violence from KO in Italy.\nNigeria\nDomestic Violence\n[16] Sources indicate that domestic violence remains \u201cwidespread\u201d and \u201cprevalent\u201d in both urban and rural areas of Nigeria,10 and many viewed it as \u201csocially acceptable.11\u201d It has been attributed to the ongoing power imbalance between women and men in Nigerian society, and deeply engrained societal attitudes about women\u2019s subordination to men, though there is some evidence that these attitudes are changing.12\n[17] I find that the principal claimant has credibly established, on a balance of probabilities, that she survived repeated instances of domestic violence from KO in Italy. I also find that her eldest daughter (the associated claimant) faced physical assaults from KO and witnessed a good deal of the domestic violence suffered by the principal claimant at KO\u2019s hands. The minor claimants were also in the household and witnessed this domestic violence. I find that the claimants have credibly established that KO has sought the claimants out in Nigeria, and that others in his family and those he associates with, have threatened and physically harmed her mother in Benin City, Edo state. I also find that she has credibly established that KO has spoken in a hostile and threatening manner about her and her role in him having been charged and convicted in Italy, as mutual acquaintances in Nigeria, have contacted the principal claimant in Canada to warn her of KO\u2019s statements.13\nThe Black Axe criminal group in Nigeria and its trans-national reach, including in Italy\n[18] I also accept that the claimants have credibly established hat KO is affiliated with a criminal group, and on a balance of probabilities, that it is the Black Axe cult or gang. The principal claimant testified about why she believes KO is involved with this gang, based on his behaviour, the type of music and videos he watched and the number of connections he had in many different places in Italy, other European countries as well as in Nigeria. She also testified about how he would boast that he was able to send his \u201cboys\u201d to deal with persons in Italy and also in Nigeria; in fact, he was able to command his brother as well as his \u201cboys\u201d to go to her mother\u2019s home in Benin City, Nigeria where they physically assaulted her mother and threatened her with more harm if she did not contact the principal claimant. She did not appear to embellish her evidence in testimony, admitting that KO never directly acknowledged his involvement in the Black Axe to her. I find that this is consistent with what is known about the Black Axe gang, in that its origins in Nigeria close to Benin City where the principal claimant and the KO both hail from, is described as a secretive, cult-like society. I find the principal claimant\u2019s testimony to be credible.\n[19] Documentary evidence before me indicates that the Black Axe cult tends to be secretive and began as a fraternity-type organization but has evolved into a criminal gang that has a strong presence in Benin City, which is regarded as the gang\u2019s \u201cheadquarters.\u201d14 The violence and crimes perpetrated by the Black Axe cult or gang in Nigeria and other countries, including the trans-national scale of this gang\u2019s operations that include human trafficking and smuggling, prostitution and money laundering, is set out in the documentary evidence.15 The trans-national nature and the evolution of the criminal operations of this Black Axe gang is also detailed in recent sources provided by counsel.16 I find this reliable and credible evidence. This evidence indicates that there is a heightened risk posed by the principal claimant\u2019s ex-husband to herself and the other claimants, from KO. This heightened risk comes from his affiliation with the Black Axe gang, and his ability to call on others in the gang to do his bidding. The claimant testified that she believes that he has this power and ability to call his \u201cboys\u201d to harm her and her daughters in Nigeria, just as he has called on them, as well as his own brothers, to harm her mother in Nigeria who was beaten by them in XXXX 2018.\n[20] Therefore, I find that the claims with respect to Nigeria, for the principal claimant and her eldest daughter, the associated claimant, are objectively well-founded. I find that they would face a serious possibility of continued violence at the hands of her former husband\/ the associated claimant\u2019s stepfather, and those who are associated with him and act on his behalf, in Nigeria.\nFemale Genital Mutilation (FGM)\n[21] I also find that the claims of the principal claimant\u2019s other three daughters, the minor claimants, are objectively well-founded with respect to Nigeria. The objective country conditions evidence indicates that FGM remains prevalent in Nigerian society.17 The principal claimant is from the Edo ethnic group and from the area of Benin City in south-central Edo state; Edo state is noted to have a FGM prevalence rate of 35.5% of women ages 15-49 in Nigeria\u2019s National Population Commission\u2019s 2018 Demographic and Health Survey.18 The principal claimant alleges that she underwent FGM as an infant and that this is customary in her ethnic group and family.\n[22] The Edo ethnic group is reported to be one of the groups that continue to perform FGM. The European Asylum Support Office (EASO) Guidance report from 2019 found that the Edo ethnic group was one of the ethnic groups with the highest prevalence rates of FGM in Nigeria, between 69 to 77 percent of women and girls having had FGM performed.19 The documentary evidence also notes that some rituals and specific customs are family, village or community\u00ad specific and therefore generalizations concerning the specific aspects of such customs and traditions are difficult to make.20\n[23] She also alleges that her family members had FGM performed on her eldest daughter, the associated claimant, when she was 4 years old. She and her daughter were visiting Nigeria and the principal claimant had left her alone with her family. This was done without the principal claimant\u2019s consent, and she alleges that since that time she has been scared to leave her other daughters, the minor claimants, alone with her family in Nigeria for any reason. The principal claimant testified that she believes an elder sister, XXXX, was responsible for subjecting the associated claimant to FGM, but she is not sure to what degree her mother and other eider sisters who remain in Nigeria (the claimant has five eider sisters residing in Nigeria21) were involved in this. She testified that her mother and her sisters are supportive of FGM, it has been a tradition in her family for herself and her sisters to have it done, and that they believe that the minor claimants should be subjected to FGM.\n[24] She alleges a fear for the three minor claimants in Nigeria of being subjected to FGM against her wishes and that this is a serious infringement on their bodily security as this is not something she had wanted for her eldest daughter, given the health and other risks and implications of this mutilation. The principal claimant alleges that she is fearful that members of her family, particularly her eider sisters in Nigeria, would take her daughters and have this done to them without her consent as their parent. The claimants provided medical documentation, namely confirmation from a registered nurse at the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, who examined the associated claimant and confirmed she had undergone FGM.22 Also, the associated claimant testified credibly and briefly about the fact that she had had this done to her body and had experienced health problems associated with it.\n[25] The documentary evidence about FGM in Nigeria describes that the practice remains rooted in discredited and gender discriminatory customary beliefs, for example that the cutting of the genitals of girls and women will stop them from \u201cpromiscuous\u201d behaviour, including being unfaithful to their husbands, and that uncut girls and women are somehow \u201cunclean\u201d.23 In communities and families where FGM is prevalent, the practice is closely tied to concepts of family honour and girls\u2019 marriageability. Sources note that girls \u201cmay be ostracized, shunned or assaulted by their family or community if they have not undergone FGM\u201d and could face stigma and social exclusion if they do not undergo FGM.24\n[26] The NDP notes sources that indicate that the final decision to subject a girl to FGM is \u201cmost often\u201d up to the parents but that there is \u201cconsiderable variation both individually and among different ethnic groups.\u201d25 Amongst family and ethnic groups that have girls and women undergo FGM, there is often societal and economic pressure put on parents and the threat of social exclusion or alienation from their families or local communities, to induce them to have FGM performed on their daughters.26 FGM is considered a \u201cfamily issue\u201d and parents who refuse to have their girls undergo FGM when other family elders expect it to be done, are those who are \u201cwell off\u201927 [financially] and girls who do not have it done when their family or group expect it, can be \u201costracized, shunned or assaulted by their family or community\u201d if they have not undergone FGM.28\n[27] The 2021 Response to Information Request (RIR) references the 2019 EASO report that notes a \u201cfew cases of relatives disregarding the parents\u2019 decision and subjecting the girl to FGM\/C [have been] reported, although it is considered to be very unusual.\u201d29 Other sources in this 2021 RIR however note that is not unusual for relatives to take a girl to have her cut, amongst groups that continue to practice FGM, and it is particularly elder female members of the family who ensure that FGM is performed on a young girl, even when a parent is opposed to this practice:\n\u2026older [family members] such as grandmothers are keepers of these practice[s] and ensure that new girls in the family are cut\u201d; even if the mother does not want her daughter to undergo FGM\/C, she is \u201calmost helpless\u201d to refuse and FGM\/C \u201cwill most likely\u201d be performed if older family members \u201csupport the practice\u201d (Research Analyst 9 July 2021). The Executive Director of SDI noted that the grandmother will travel to the girl\u2019s home to ensure FGM\/C is performed (SDI 18 Oct. 2021). According to the Executive Director of Value Female Network,\ngrandparents will do everything to make sure their granddaughter is cut. They do not want traditions to end. They will travel from a very far community, pay for accommodation, pay for everything. They will go the extra mile. They will ensure the girl is cut. They will keep it in their mind for years and wait until they can do it. (Executive Director of Value Female Network 7 Oct. 2021)\nAccording to the Program Officer, if a mother refuses FGM\/C for her daughter, the child can be taken by force by the woman\u2019s family (Program Officer 1 July 2021).30\n[28] I therefore find that the principal claimant\u2019s fear for the minor claimants in Nigeria is objectively well-founded. I find that the minor claimants would face a serious possibility of persecution on account of their gender, namely FGM, and being subjected to this at the hands of older relatives, namely their older aunts (the principal claimant\u2019s older sisters), as was experienced by the associated claimant, their own sister, when she was a young girl at the hands of members of the principal claimant\u2019s family when she and the principal claimant visited Nigeria.\nState protection\nItaly\n[29] For the reasons that follow, I find that the claimants have rebutted the presumption of state protection in Italy. I find that the claimants have presented clear and convincing evidence that given their particular circumstances, adequate state protection would not be available to them in Italy. This includes the principal claimant\u2019s own previous experiences in attempting to obtain protection from the state, as well as the objective documentary evidence before me with respect to serious gaps in the implementation of Italy\u2019s domestic violence laws, evidence of the inconsistent and arbitrary implementation of Italy\u2019 s domestic violence laws, partially caused by continuing societal attitudes rooted in discredited myths and stereotypes about sexual assaults and violence against women, and documentary evidence about widespread anti-Black racism in the country.\nThe principal claimant \u2018s own experiences in trying to obtain state protection\n[30] The principal claimant testified about her experiences in seeking protection from the Italian police due to KO\u2019s domestic violence. Prior to 2015, she called the police \u201cmore than four or five times\u201d. She testified that each time she called them, the police came but then just gave KO advice or a warning, saying things like \u201cif you do that next time, we will have to arrest you\u201d, \u201cyou have to stop beating her\u201d, \u201ctake it easy, don\u2019t beat her, she\u2019s pregnant\u201d and then would leave, without investigation or charging her ex-husband. She recalled the police\u2019s visits as brief\u00ad only a matter of minutes, and she remembered one time she called the police, and they did not come at all. She also testified that on one of these occasions she had been clearly injured with blood coming from her mouth and nose, and still the police did not intervene in a serious or effective manner. She testified that she believed that the way police treated her in this manner, in not offering her meaningful protection and viewing what she was going through as something that was \u201cnormal\u201d amongst Nigerian men and women, was impacted by her race, as a Black woman of Nigerian descent. She described that there was a great deal of racism in Italy towards Black persons like herself, and that she had heard of such similar ineffective and racist experiences from another Black female friend in Italy who had previously contacted the police for protection from domestic violence.\n[31] The principal claimant described feeling further discouraged by the police response after the October 2015 assault against her when the police did charge KO and took him in for questioning, holding him for a few hours. She testified that she believes the police did something on this occasion because it was one of the minor claimants, XXXX who called them for help and also because a medical examination and MRI confirmed that had received a XXXX XXXX XXXX. The police released KO while this assault charge was pending, and the police knew he was returning to reside with her and the other claimants. She testified that the police told her that since he was the only financial provider for the family, he was being released. The principal claimant described in her testimony that the police did not offer her any referrals or assistance in contacting a women\u2019s shelter or any other kind of support, despite her request about whether these options were available for her. They also did not offer that any kind of protection or barring order (from him returning to the family residence) was an option for her.\n[32] With this release arrangement, the principal claimant testified that the police called her each day for about one month to check on her to see if she was being beaten by KO. The principal claimant testified that KO noticed when the police stopped calling, and his violence against her resumed when the calls stopped. She testified that KO understood how ineffective the police were and was far from deterred and in fact felt emboldened by his ability to continue to harm her without any real repercussions. He was dismissive about the police response, saying to her: \u201cThey gave me a paper and that is it- they didn\u2019t hold me; this is all they can do.\u201d She testified to learning at one point about KO\u2019s past criminal record in a different district for beating his first wife, and in 2015 when she was questioned by police, it was clear to her that the police knew about KO\u2019s violent criminal record as well, yet this criminal history did not change the police\u2019s response to releasing him to reside with the claimants while the 2015 charges were pending. She testified as well that KO seemed to start exhibiting a particular anger towards the minor claimant, XXXX for her role in calling the police, and the principal claimant testified that she was frightened of him harming her, as well as her other daughters, the other claimants.\n[33] The corroborating documents provided by the claimants from the Italian court and public prosecutor\u2019s office indicate that KO weas sentenced to a XXXX XXXX XXXX imprisonment for assaulting the principal claimant,31 and also that in consideration of a previous offence for domestic violence against his first wife, a one-year, ten-month sentence was also being considered as a sentence.32 The sentencing document from the public prosecutor\u2019 s office from XXXX XXXX 2018 indicates that enforcement of the sentence could be stayed while the offender applied for certain \u201calternative measures to detention\u201d such as \u201chome detention\u201d.33\n[34] The principal claimant testified that KO told her that his lawyer was working towards him getting a sentence of house arrest, so that he would not have to serve time in prison. She testified that KO\u2019s lawyer, the police, and then a social worker asked for her consent to this house arrest, and that she was never asked this question privately on her own, when KO was not there with her. She testified to feeling terrified and helpless, as KO was threatening her that he would kill her if she did not agree to the house arrest. Within this context, the principal claimant indicated that she signed some a letter with KO\u2019s lawyer, indicating that she had forgiven him, and that she agreed to the house arrest. The principal claimant described that the idea of KO having to be home with her and the minor claimants scared her deeply, as did the expectation that she was to inform the police if KO left the home for an unauthorized purpose. The principal claimant testified that she feared that reporting on him would have put her and the minor claimants at increased risk of harm at his hands. She believed that he would also likely take out his stress through violence on all of them while they lived together in this house arrest situation. In her BOC narrative she stated, \u201cI was his victim and the Italian government wanted me to be his jailer.\u201d34\n[35] The principal claimant also provided corroborating documents about KO\u2019s sentencing hearing that took place on July 18, 2018.35 She testified that she did not have a copy of the letter that KO\u2019s lawyer had her sign, as she was scared to ask for this and raise KO\u2019s suspicions and possible retaliatory violence, for thinking that she was going to withdraw her consent. The principal claimant testified that she began to make her plans to flee Italy with the minor claimants when she was informed about this sentencing hearing and after KO and his lawyer had asked her to sign her consent to the house arrest proposal.\n[36] The principal claimant testified that to the best of her knowledge KO\u2019s house arrest is now completed. She heard from mutual acquaintances in Nigeria that KO had travelled to Nigeria in around XXXX to XXXX of 2021. She testified that her sister who resides in Italy informed her that KO was previously seen in the community in XXXX, Italy at parties during the time of him sentence, not apparently following the conditions of his house arrest, but the police did not find out about this. She testified that her sister went to her home after she came to Canada to try and get some of the claimants\u2019 belongings, and that KO did not allow her to enter the apartment, saying in an accusatory way to her sister, that the principal claimant had \u201ccaused\u201d his house arrest.\n[37] She also testified that she believes that KO continues to live in XXXX, Italy, as her sister told her that she saw KO at a bus stop in XXXX a few months ago. The principal claimant also testified that to her knowledge, while KO\u2019s criminal convictions may have caused him problems in obtaining Italian citizenship, he continues to have permanent residence in Italy, giving him the ability to remain living and working in that country.\nRacism in society and from state authorities in Italy\n[38] I find that the principal claimant\u2019s ability to access adequate state protection in Italy is impacted by the intersecting, immutable characteristics of her race and gender. She is an Italian citizen who is also a Black woman of Nigerian descent. The documentary evidence indicates that racism remains a serious problem in Italy, with very real consequences for visible minorities and those of African descent, specifically. In recent years, sources such as the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, in its 2019 Report entitled, Mission to Italy on Racial Discrimination, notes serious concerns that Italy \u201cis experiencing an increase of intolerance, racial and religious hatred, and xenophobia, which in some cases is allowed or even encouraged by political leaders and members of Government.\u201d36 This report also addresses serious shortcomings in Italian police accountability and reporting of racially biased statements and actions of state law enforcement related to migrants and other persons of colour.37\n[39] Based on the evidence before me, discrimination based on race and racially-based incitements to violence are increasing and remain a widespread problem in Italy.38 Sources also report that Italian state officials, elected and those running for office, are implicated in fueling anti-migrant and racist views, and that in addition to increasing acts of racist violence, systemic racism exists in Italy towards those viewed as immigrants and\/or persons of colour.39 This includes attitudes, perceptions and actions of Italians that accept and promote racist policies and outwardly racist statements and treatment of persons of colour40, with one recent study noting that more than half of Italians surveyed responded that racist acts were either always or sometimes \u201cjustifiable\u201d.41\n[40] A 2016 report from the United Human Rights Council, Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent- Mission to Italy, found that despite some efforts of the Italian state, \u201cracial discrimination, Afrophobia and racism persists and people of African descent continue to be the least integrated, most marginalized victims of racial profiling.\u201d42 The authors of this report further found that written legislation and policy measures to combat racial discrimination were not being adequately implemented by the state of Italy.43 Further in this report it is noted: \u201cAfrophobia and racial discrimination are manifest in the lack of protection afforded to people of African descent, a vulnerable group; in the difficulty that people of African descent have in gaining access to justice; and in the failure to prosecute and provide reparation and remedy.\u201d44 This report also notes with concern the frequent racist discourse in Italy\u2019s political system, targeting public figures and politicians of African descent, as well as the immunity that has shielded parliamentarians who make racist remarks.45 The Working Group further reported that: \u201c[t]oo often immunity and impunity for racism creates an enabling environment for racist abuse to be perpetrated at all levels of society, even if some ad hoc punitive measures have been adopted.\u201d46\n[41] I find therefore that the objective country conditions evidence is consistent with the principal claimant\u2019s experiences of racism in Italy, in her encounters with police and in other aspects of her life there as well. I find that the continued systemic nature of racism in Italy impacts and intersects with the principal claimant\u2019s lived experiences as a woman who could not attain adequate state protection in Italy from her abusive husband. I find that as an Italian citizen, she is also a Black woman of Nigerian descent, and based on her own experiences, she did not receive adequate state protection in the past. Based on her personal circumstances that include the immutable characteristics of her race and gender, as well as the country conditions evidence before me, I find that adequate state protection would also not be forthcoming to her in the future in Italy.\nState\u2019s Response to Domestic Violence in Italy\n[42] I note that Italy is making many efforts to address gender-based violence. Domestic violence is criminalized in Italy, and perpetrators are prosecuted. Italy is a sophisticated liberal democracy. Rebutting the presumption of state protection is a heavy burden. Italy ratified the Council of Europe Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence against Women and Domestic Violence, (CETS No. 210), known as the \u201cIstanbul Convention\u201d in 2013.47 Thereafter, Italy is noted by the Council of Europe\u2019s Group of Experts on Combatting Violence against Women and Domestic Violence (GREVIO), an independent group that is responsible for monitoring the implementation of the Istanbul Convention, to have has taken a \u201crange of measures to implement the Istanbul Convention\u201d, including legislative reforms and an extensive set of rules and mechanisms aimed at concrete actions to stop violence against women.48 Highlighted in the GREVIO 2020 Report is Italy\u2019s legislation that has expanded the law on criminal stalking and increased and expanded legislative sanctions for crimes of gender-based violence, and increased national funding for specialist support and protective services to assist women and children fleeing domestic violence.49\n[43] However, despite these efforts, I find that the country conditions evidence indicates that there are some critical shortcomings and problems in the implementation of the domestic violence legislative framework in Italy, including serious gaps with respect to urgent protection order mechanisms. I find these serious deficits in the implementation of Italy\u2019s domestic violence laws are compounded with the impact of racism for these particular claimants. Such serious shortcomings in the state response were illustrated in the claimants\u2019 own attempts to obtain actual protection from domestic violence from the Italian state.\n[44] State protection need not be perfect, and I acknowledge that the Italian state did make an attempt to protect the claimants on one occasion through the prosecution of KO. However, based on the claimants\u2019 particular circumstances and evidence before me, I find that attempt was far from adequate. The claimants were put at increased risk of physical harm through the manner in which the Italian state prosecuted these charges, including the lack of effective and timely protective or restraining orders in Italy for victims of domestic violence while charges are pending, such that KO returned to live with and physically abuse the claimants for over two and a half years while his charges were pending; the state also did not consult with the principal claimant privately about acquiring her consent for KO to serve his sentence under house arrest with her and the other claimants. I find that the way in which state officials acted with respect to this final issue demonstrates a clear misunderstanding or disregard for the imbalance of power in domestic violence situations and the real-world reality faced by victims: asking a woman in the presence of her abusive spouse to agree to a detention arrangement that would have the real possibility of increasing her and her children\u2019s risk of harm is essentially asking her to make this choice under duress without a true opportunity to voice her concerns with such an arrangement: this was not a meaningful or voluntary \u201cchoice\u201d for the principal claimant.\n[45] The evidence before me points to a serious problem of gender-based violence in the country-the United State Department of State Report for Human Rights Practices for 2020 in Italy notes that 535 women were killed by domestic partners in the first six months of 2020 alone.50 Another source from 2018 noted that approximately 150 women are killed by abusive partners each year, and that in one-third of fatal cases, the victims had already complained to the police.51 Advocates for women and critics of the Italian system have noted that tougher legislation is not necessarily the solution; existing laws are adequate, but arbitrarily applied.52 This inconsistency in the domestic violence law\u2019s application is fueled by patriarchal socio\u00ad cultural attitudes in Italy that justify or excuse violence against women, police officers not believing women, those in the investigatory process (police officers, social workers and judges) being unprepared, and a very long judicial process that can take several years to come to a final decision.53 I find that the objective country conditions evidence before me is consistent with the principal claimant\u2019s described experiences of her many calls to the police over the years prior to KO being charged in 2015, in that these interactions with the police did not result in anything more than her abuser being told to treat her better.\n[46] Moreover, I find that there are critical problems with the state\u2019s mechanisms with respect to delays and the inconsistent issuance of protection or barring orders for alleged perpetrators of domestic violence to vacate a shared residence when charges are laid. Such orders are noted to be ineffective by GREVIO in their January 2020 Report entitled, GREVIO Baseline Evaluation Report Italy (\u201cGREVIO report\u201d).54 Sources note that the Italian law does not automatically require that the alleged abuser leave the home when charged with abuse.55 The GREVIO report notes serious shortcomings in a domestic violence victim\u2019s ability to obtain meaningful restraining orders, citing research that Italian authorities do not have measures in place for an immediate response if a victim calls in to report a violation of a protection order. GREVIO stresses that \u201can instant response to these calls is pivotal in light of the well-documented fact that a violation of a protective measure is a strong indicator of a potentially high-risk situation. [emphasis added]\u201d56 The report notes the concern that criminal courts did not collect data on the issuance of restraining and protection orders (termed \u201cprecautionary measures\u201d) and that this impacted the ability of GREVIO to report on the effectiveness of such measures to protect women. Women\u2019s organizations and legal practitioners shared with GREVIO that there were problems for women in obtaining such measures in the first place, noting instances of victims\u2019 requests for such measures remaining \u201cunheeded and the risk they are exposed to is underestimated, leading to courts\u2019 reluctance to issue precautionary measures (particularly where there is no physical violence), delays in their issuance, negligence in their enforcement and minimization of the risks signaled by a breach of such measures\u201d.57\n[47] As further noted in the GREVIO report, a protection order from a criminal court in Italy must be requested by a prosecutor, and as set out above, even if one is in place, there is no process in place of immediate action in case of a reported breach by an abuser. With respect to civilly obtained protection orders, GREVIO notes that the state is also not keeping data with respect to these orders, which represents an obstacle in effectively monitoring their use. Women\u2019s organizations, however, have indicated that these types of civil protection orders can take \u201cseveral months\u201d to be granted and that there exists \u201cuneven and restrictive court practices in assessing the conditions under which protection orders apply and can be extended\u201d.58 GREVIO notes with concern that this undermines women\u2019s protection and that some civil courts take the approach of seeking to reach a compromise between the victim and the perpetrator rather than taking a position on the request for a protection order, an approach which, according to GREVIO, \u201cwould reflect a severe misunderstanding of the dynamics of violence against women.\u201d59 The impact of these problems on the protection of women facing domestic violence in Italy is described in this report:\nthe lack of an automatic reaction on the part of statutory agencies to violations of protection orders sends the message that infringements are tolerated. Once the offender realises he can get away with his misbehaviour, the deterrent potential of protection orders is significantly diminished. This can not only provoke future violations, but it can also seriously discourage the victim, who should not be left alone in having to ensure that protection orders are enforced.60\n[48] The GREVIO report also refers to a 2018 Italian government report, noting the concern about a lack of consistency with the police response to domestic violence in Italy, including that the police arbitrarily conducted risk assessments in domestic violence situations, noting that in \u201cmany cases of gender-based violence, risk assessments are totally omitted, while in others, police officials assess risks based on their experience and intuitive skills instead of structured and standardized parameters.\u201d61 The GREVIO report also reflects findings of a 2018 Italian Judiciary report that \u201cless than 20% of prosecutorial offices and only 8% of adjudicating offices had adopted risk-assessment criteria to enable law enforcement agencies, prosecuting authorities and criminal or civil courts to prevent reoffending and the escalation of violence.\u201d62 GREVIO notes that a \u201cserious underestimation of the risk\u201d in situations of domestic violence was at the heart of the European Court of Human Rights\u2019 judgment in the Talpis v. Italy decision.63 This decision noted several serious shortcomings in the Italian state response to responding to domestic violence, including the inadequate assessment of the victim\u2019s risk, the delayed response to the victim, and that no emergency protection order was issued.64\n[49] The police and state\u2019s dismissive response to violence against women was also illustrated in a recent Toronto Star article from January 2022 describing a Canadian woman in Italy who was seriously beaten in public by a taxi driver. The initial response and actions of the police and hospital staff was to not take the matter seriously. She was visibly injured and there were witnesses to the attack. The police took the man\u2019s statement, and then allowed him to drive off in his taxi. The victim describes the indifference of hospital staff towards her, telling her she was not facing an emergency because she was hit by a man, and that because they were dealing with COVID, they had \u201cbigger issues than a girl crying over a man who hit her.\u201d After a video of this assault was posted on Twitter, there was a large outpouring of support for the woman and state officials have publicly condemned the assault.65\n[50] Also noted in the sources before me is the continued acceptance of \u201churt feelings\u201d defenses by the courts in domestic violence cases in Italy, including in cases of serious bodily injury and femicide, resulting in reduced sentences because the crime is viewed as somewhat understandable due to emotions or passion taking over the aggressor in situations where a victim is viewed as having brought on such violence through her own behaviour.66 While it is laudable that the prime minister in 2019 publicly criticized such reasoning by the courts67, I find that the fact that this kind of reasoning continues to be used by the judiciary on some occasions in recent years, is further indication of the inconsistent and what has been described in other sources as the \u201carbitrary\u201d implementation of the domestic violence laws in Italy by police officers, as well as the judiciary.\n[51] For example, another source from 2018 speaks of two foreign students who accused police officers of rape were themselves accused of being drunk and being dressed inappropriately.68 A further 2018 article describes a woman\u2019s account of a police officer asking her whether she wasn\u2019t \u201cjust having an argument\u201d with her husband, when she had called the police for protection from her husband\u2019s violence.69 An appeal court\u2019s 2017 ruling, condemned by protesters and which was later overturned by Italy\u2019s highest court, was that a woman\u2019s story of being raped was not credible because she looked \u201ctoo masculine\u201d and it was improbable that the accused men would have wanted to rape her.70\n[52] I find that such discriminatory and discredited understandings about gender-based violence as displayed by the police and courts in Italy reflect the information in other sources about socio-cultural attitudes in Italy that show a level of acceptance of certain levels of violence against women in intimate partner relationships as normal and assumptions about sexual violence and intimate relationships that are rooted in gender discrimination and myths and stereotypes about gender-based violence: a 2021 Italian survey presented to the Italian senate indicated that 40 percent of men and 20 percent of women did not consider it violence to \u201cslap a partner in the face if she has flirted with another man\u201d, and that four out of ten men and 3 out of 10 women did not consider it violence to \u201cforce a partner to have sexual intercourse if she does not feel like it\u201d.71\n[53] I also note that the sources indicate that there is a serious shortage of women\u2019s shelters and that this is viewed as being a barrier to women leaving violent partners. One women\u2019s advocate in 2018 noted that Italy\u2019s 100 shelters was woefully inadequate to serve Italy\u2019s population of 60 million. The advocate indicated that six times this number was needed.72 Italy is reported to have provided a good deal of funding in recent years for shelters and \u201canti-violence\u201d centres for women, however, the exact number of shelters as set out in the GREVIO report is noted to be \u201cuncertain\u201d with the government claiming that there are 228 shelters and women\u2019s organizations estimating a considerably lower number of 79 shelters.73 This lack of availability of women\u2019s shelters, compounded with the principal claimant\u2019s described first-hand experiences in her testimony of racism in the past in searching for housing on her own as a Black woman, heightens the claimants\u2019 risk in this claim. This factor is a further way which the state\u2019 s response to her as a Black Italian female citizen requiring protection from domestic violence is inadequate.\n[54] Counsel submitted a great deal of country conditions evidence that points to serious gaps and ineffective implementation of Italy\u2019s laws and policies aimed at protecting women from violence. I have set out some of it in the above paragraphs. I accept that these laws may be adequate for some; and that the country conditions evidence shows that the state has made serious efforts to combat domestic violence in recent years. However, the test that I must consider is whether there is clear and convincing evidence of adequate state protection for these particular claimants. I have therefore considered whether state protection in Italy would be operationally effective for these particular claimants, taking into account their personal circumstances, and this includes the responsiveness of the state and their treatment by Italian authorities as Black women and girls. I find that for these claimants, in light of what the principal claimant experienced in her attempts to obtain state protection in Italy, and in light of the intersectional factor of race, as Black Italian citizens of Nigerian descent, that state protection would not be adequate. The claimants have therefore rebutted the presumption of state protection.\nNigeria\n[55] I also find that the claimants have rebutted the presumption of state protection in Nigeria. I find that there is clear and convincing evidence that adequate state protection would not be available to them in Nigeria. The claimants fear violence from KO himself, his family and his associates within the Black Axe gang. The principal claimant provided evidence that her mother had been physically assaulted and threatened by KO\u2019s brother and KO\u2019s associates in XXXX\n2018 who were demanding that her mother contact the principal claimant, and that KO\u2019s family continued to contact her family in Nigeria after this point. The principal claimant also fears that members in her family, in particular her elder sisters, will forcibly take the three minor claimants to have them undergo FGM without her consent.\n[56] Documentary evidence before me indicates that women in Nigeria rarely tum to the police for assistance in domestic violence matters, and those who do are often turned away by officers who consider it a private or family issue.74 The United States Department of State Report on Human Rights Practices in Nigeria for 2020 states that, \u201c[p]olice often refused to intervene in domestic disputes or blamed the victim for provoking the abuse. In rural areas courts and police were reluctant to intervene to protect women who formally accused their husbands of abuse if the level of alleged abuse did not exceed local customary norms.\u201d75 A number of sources indicate that both implementation and enforcement of laws prohibiting violence against women are lacking throughout Nigeria.76\n[57] Sources indicate that while the level of response depends on the victim\u2019s level of education and the individual police officer taking the report, complainants are sometimes blamed for provoking the abuse, or otherwise mistreated during the intake process. According to other sources, if both parties are present, the male is believed over the female making the complaint.77\n[58] Nigeria\u2019s legal system is a mix of common law, sharia law, and customary law. Sources indicate that there is no comprehensive national law applied throughout the country to combat domestic violence or violence against women.78 Certain sections of Nigerian law also permit men to use \u201ccorrective\u201d force against their partners.79 The 2015 Violence Against Persons (Prohibition) Act (VAPP) was a positive development, prohibiting gender-based violence, including domestic violence and harmful traditional practices such as FGM. However, sources report that as a federal law, the VAPP is only effective in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) of Abuja; only the high court of the FCT has jurisdiction to hear and grant applications, including restraining orders.80 While some states have their own domestic violence and\/or FGM legislation, only a third of states have ratified the VAPP.81\n[59] With respect to FGM, while the VAPP prohibits FGM, the documentary evidence suggests that this prohibition is rarely, if ever, enforced in Nigeria.82 Even with the passing of these laws, FGM in Nigeria remains \u201cwidespread, with low rates of reporting and prosecution\u201d83 Sources note that the Nigeria police are reluctant to provide protection to persons who refuse to undergo family traditional practices, including FGM. Reasons for this lack of enforcement and reluctance from the police include cultural beliefs held by police officers themselves, in that the police have difficulty recognizing the criminal nature of ritual practices, respect for these traditions and customs by the police and the discriminatory treatment and attitude towards women in Nigerian society.84\n[60] Other evidence notes that it \u201cremains extremely difficult for women and girls to obtain protection from FGM\u201d despite the enactment of anti-FGM laws in the FCT and anti-FGM legislation in many states, as community support for the practice of FGM and the traditional attitude of the police help to support such practices.85 The report by the British non\u00ad governmental organization, 28 Too Many, of June 2018 confirms that \u201cknowledge of the [FGM] law and enforcement is generally weak across Nigeria\u201d and that there have been no reported arrests, cases, prosecutions or convictions for FGM in Nigeria.86\n[61] Corruption in the Nigerian government is also reported to be pervasive and widespread, affecting all levels of government including the security forces, with government employees frequently engaging in corrupt practices with impunity.87 Sources note that high levels of corruption, as well as a lack of sufficient funding and training and a culture of impunity and weak oversight, have seriously undermined the effectiveness of the police in responding to violent crimes, including violence against women from intimate partners or former intimate partners.88 A report from the Africa Centre for Strategic Studies describes that Nigerian police commonly demanded bribes in everyday encounters with citizens, and that norms of professionalism and ethics are further weakened in the police through politicized, non-merit based appointments.89\n[62] Therefore, based on the documentary evidence before me, I do not find that claimants would have adequate state protection in Nigeria from either further violence from KO, his family or associates, or from the principal claimant\u2019s family abducting the minor claimants to subject them to FGM, against the principal claimant\u2019s wishes. While the introduction of legislation such as the VAPP that addresses gender-based violence is a positive step by the Nigerian state, the existence of legislation alone is not enough to support a finding of state protection. I find that the that the implementation of the state\u2019s laws with respect to gender-based violence in Nigeria is ineffective, and that therefore the claimants would not have adequate state protection in Nigeria.\nInternal Flight Alternative\nMotivation of KO ta locate the claimants in Italy and Nigeria\n[63] For the reasons that follow, I find that the claimants do not have a viable internal flight alternative (IFA) in either Italy or Nigeria. KO is a citizen of Nigeria and he has status akin to a permanent resident in Italy. I find that KO has a continuing motivation to locate the claimants if they attempt to relocate in either country, and that based on his past violence towards the claimants, I find that he poses a serious risk to their safety. He is the biological father of the two youngest minor claimants, ages 5 and 9, and the principal claimant previously resided with him as his common-law spouse for seven years. KO\u2019s motivation is also demonstrated through his continued, attempted contacts with the principal claimant90 and with at least one minor claimant since they have been in Canada via social media, as well as the claimants\u2019 testimony and evidence that KO has contacted mutual acquaintances in Nigeria in the recent past and that such contact indicated that KO remained angry at the principal claimant, blamed her for his conviction and arrest in Italy and wanted to find her whereabouts.91\n[64] The principal claimant also testified that KO was hostile and blamed her for his conviction and house arrest when he had an encounter with her sister in Italy. Moreover, since she left Italy, KO sent his brother and men to threaten the principal claimant\u2019s mother in Nigeria to discover the claimants\u2019 contact information, and her mother was physically assaulted.\nItaly\nAbility of KO to find the claimants in other locations in Italy\n[65] With respect to Italy, the cities of Rome and Naples were raised as possible IFA locations for these claimants; Rome is about 600 km south and Naples is about 800 km south of the city of XXXX, Italy in the northwest of the country where the claimants formerly lived, and where they believe KO to be living at this point. I find that the IFA test fails on the first prong of the test, in that the proposed IFA locations will not be safe for the claimants, and that KO would likely be able to find them should they return to Italy and attempt to relocate.\n[66] The principal claimant and the 18-year-old associated claimant testified about the social media use of the associated claimant and the eldest minor claimant who is 16 years old. The principal claimant noted that she was not well versed with technology and social media, and that she knew her daughters used social media, but she did not know a great deal about their presence online. The associated claimant testified about how she and her sister use various social media applications such as Instagram, SnapChat and TikTok to communicate with their friends and that she sometimes posts photographs of herself with friends or out doing activities. She testified that she estimated that her 16-year-old sister uses social media a fair bit, and that she and her sister do not tell their mother, the principal claimant, about their online posts and social media use. I find that the testimony of principal and associated claimant is credible about the 18- and 16-year- old\u2019s social media use: it did not appear to exaggerate their use of social media, and details came naturally and spontaneously to the claimants.\n[67] While the social media use of teenagers communicating online for social purposes may not involve political opinion or expression which is necessarily core to one\u2019s human rights, I note that it has become a standard and prevalent way of obtaining information, socializing and starting and maintaining friendships and community networks for young people in society today. Generally, I find that requiring adults, and even young adults, to be cautious with social media use and to do so with heightened precautions and privacy settings, so that an agent of persecution would not be able to locate their whereabouts, would be a reasonable expectation with respect to IFA. However, in the particular circumstances of this claim, I note that with two teenagers ages 16 and 18, and a third daughter about to turn 10 years of age, and with the evidence that KO has already connected with his 16-year-old daughter through social media online for a period of time without the principal claimant knowing of it, that the circumstances before me in this claim are such that the principal claimant would not be able to monitor and control all the content that her daughters (the associated claimant, the 16- year-old claimant, and in the near future one of the other minor claimants) post online or in which they are \u201ctagged\u201d by others online.\n[68] I find that a consideration of reasonable precautions must be assessed in light of the claimants\u2019 ages and maturity and the particular factual circumstances in this claim which include that the agent of persecution had contact with one of the minor claimants via social media without the principal claimant\u2019s knowledge. Upon learning of that contact, the principal claimant had the minor claimant block KO, and that KO has changed his username on at least one occasion and attempted to again contact the claimants. For these teenage claimants, and in these particular circumstances, I find that the associated claimant\u2019s and the minor claimants\u2019 social media use is something that the principal claimant will not be able to fully control and that such social media use is one way in which their location could become known to KO. I also find, on a balance of probabilities, that KO has shown that he has the motivation and ability to reach the claimants online via social media and that in the future, he could find the claimants\u2019 whereabouts from online content that is from or connected to the social media profiles and accounts of the associated claimant and the minor claimants.\n[69] Next, I have accepted that the principal claimant has credibly established, on balance of probabilities, her allegation that KO is involved with the Nigerian criminal gang, the Black Axe. The principal claimant acknowledged that KO never admitted his involvement in this group to her, but that she believed him to be involved in this group for several reasons, including that he would boast that he had \u201cboys\u201d he could use to kill anyone in Nigeria, that on one occasion she knew of he had paid someone to bring a car into Nigeria who then demanded more money and he sent his \u201cboys\u201d to Nigeria to deal with the matter. She also testified that KO had told her in Italy if anyone ever offended her to let him know, as he would send his \u201cboys\u201d to their house. The principal claimant testified that KO seemed to have many Nigerian friends and contacts in many different places in Italy and that he travelled frequently to see them.\n[70] I find that the claimants have also submitted reliable country conditions evidence as to the Black Axe criminal group\u2019s presence and reach in Italy. Documentary sources describe that the Black Axe criminal group as one that employs brutal violence and has become trans-national, involved in crimes such as prostitution, international human trafficking and money laundering.92 Sources note that the Black Axe criminal group has a strong presence in Italy93 and is regarded as \u201cquite powerful\u201d94, with \u201ccells throughout Italy\u201d95 and to be operating in \u201cmany regions of the country\u201d.96 Nigerian criminal networks in Italy are reported to have as many as 1,500 members across the country, and in some locations, they pay a cut to the Italian mafia to allow them to do business, and in other locations they encroach on Italian mafia territory and business.97 Italian police have attempted to curb the criminal activities of the Black Axe organization with arrests in 2016 of between 15-18 Black Axe leaders, and again in 2021, arresting 30 members.98\n[71] I have found the principal claimant credible in her testimony about why she believes KO is a part of, or affiliated with, this group. She testified that KO appeared to have many friends and connections throughout Italy and his friends were mainly Nigerian. She testified about how he would boast that he had \u201cboys\u201d who could take care of anyone who had offended her and that she saw that he would regularly speak with people she did not herself know from Rome, Turin, and Milan. She testified he used to visit Rome about twice a year and for Naples, he travelled there about once a year, but not always every year.\n[72] I find that KO\u2019s affiliation with the Black Axe group means that he poses a heightened risk to the claimants. This heightened risk comes from his ability to call on others in the gang to do his bidding, including in searching for the claimants and reporting back if they are located in another place in Italy. The claimant testified that she believes that he has this power and ability to call his \u201cboys\u201d to locate her, and cause her and her daughters harm, just as he has called on such thugs to harm her mother in Nigeria in XXXX 2018. I also note the principal claimant\u2019s testimony that her sister in XXXX, Italy saw KO at a bus stop there a few months ago, and he attempted to speak with her sister, but she was able to avoid him. I find on a balance of probabilities that KO continues to reside in XXXX Italy, and that his house arrest sentence is now completed.\n[73] Therefore, based on their particular circumstances, I find that the claimants would not be able to safely relocate within Italy and the IFA test fails on the first prong. I find that it is more likely than not that if the claimants were to move at a new location in Rome or Naples, it would become known to KO, through a combination of factors such as the associated claimant and minor claimants\u2019 social media use, and\/or through his connections and ability to use other associates of the Black Axe criminal group to locate the claimants. I find that the serious shortcomings with respect to the Italian state\u2019s response to violence against women and domestic violence specifically, compounded by systemic issues of racism, as set out above, mean that the claimants would not have adequate state protection in the IFA locations if they were located by KO in these locations, or anywhere else in Italy.\nNigeria\n[74] I also find that the claimants do not have a viable IFA in Nigeria. I proposed the large urban centre of Lagos, as a possible IFA location for the claimants. I have set out above my reasons for finding that KO continues to have a strong motivation to locate the claimants, including in Nigeria. The principal claimant testified about KO\u2019s ability to locate her in Lagos, stating that his brother who works as a driver for a rich and well-known traditional chief of Edo state, travels throughout Nigeria with this man and could use such connections to find her. She testified that through either his brother or through his connections with the Black Axe gang, he would be able to learn of their whereabouts in Lagos. She also testified that she and KO had many mutual friends and friends of each of their families who are in Lagos, and that KO knows her eider sister\u2019s address in Lagos having been there many times before. She believes that her sister would resist in telling KO her whereabouts, but that their network of mutual acquaintances would be susceptible to providing information about her whereabouts for payment by KO, who she testified would return to Nigeria and flaunt and spend his Euros.\n[75] The principal claimant acknowledged in testimony that this eider sister in Lagos supports FGM, and that she believes that this sister at least condoned another eider sister who was behind having FGM performed on her eldest daughter, the associated claimant, when they visited Nigeria when the associated claimant was about four years old. Residing with this sister in Lagos would therefore not be something that the principal claimant could do without risking the safety of the minor claimants.\n[76] I have set out, above, my reasons for finding that KO has the continuing motivation to locate and harm the claimants. I have found the principal claimant credible in her testimony about how acquaintances in Nigeria have told her that KO has recently been there, angrily asking about her. I find on a balance of probabilities that he has completed his sentence from 2018 for assaulting the principal claimant and that he is someone with the ability and desire to return to Nigeria, including that he has the financial resources to do so.\n[77] I find that the claimants\u2019 personal circumstances and the particular background of KO also contribute to his ability to locate the claimants in Lagos, and that the claimants would face a serious possibility of persecution in Lagos, as well as throughout Nigeria. These personal circumstances are relevant to both prongs of the IFA test, and I find that in considering them, the first prong of the test fails. First, I note the possibility about KO being able to determine their location via the associated claimant\u2019s and the minor claimants\u2019 social media use, for the reasons I have already set out above.\n[78] Secondly, the principal claimant is a single mother to four female children ranging in age from 5 years old to 18 years old and she would be returning to a new city where she does not have the amount of familiarity and support network as she did in the area where she grew up and where her mother and other siblings (but for the one eider sister in Lagos and another sister in Italy) live, Benin City in Edo state. She testified that the associated claimant and the minor claimants do not speak any local languages, and that the associated claimant and the next eldest, 16-year-old XXXX, speak English and Italian, whereas the younger two minor claimants now only speak English. The principal claimant testified that the associated claimant and minor claimants will be easily identifiable as people of Nigerian descent who have lived abroad for quite some time, as the girls speak English in a particular way and have a European mentality with respect to things such as a personal safety and everyday understandings of customs. The principal claimant noted that her four daughters have only ever visited Nigeria a handful of times (fewer occasions for the younger minor claimants), and that they grew up as Italian Europeans, and now as Canadians since mid-2018. This makes them very unfamiliar with Nigerian ways of life, and this would make them stand out as foreigners and increase their vulnerability. She also testified that she also is less familiar with the Nigeria of today, having moved to Italy in 1997 to work at the age of 21 and resided there since that time, only returning to Nigeria herself for a few visits over the years, although she is more familiar than her daughters are with the country.\n[79] I find that given these personal characteristics and circumstances, that these particular claimants will likely be more visible amongst neighbours and the community in a new location such as Lagos, and that the principal claimant would likely need to call upon one of their mutual friends for help and support in Lagos if they were to attempt to relocate there. In this situation, I find that KO would likely be able to locate them through his family and network of acquaintances in Nigeria or through his associates with the Black Axe criminal group. Sources describe that the Black Axe criminal group has a presence in Lagos99, with one source noting it has a national reach and that \u201c[i]n each community, these groups have leaders that [are] as ruthless as their coordinators at the state and national levels.\u201d100\n[80] I find that while the situation with respect to state protection for women and girls facing violence from a former intimate partner may be better in Lagos than the rest of the country, since in Lagos some sources note that there are improving attitudes amongst the community in not condoning or accepting domestic violence, and that the police in Lagos were better trained to deal with domestic violence and had a more responsive attitude with a dedicated gender desk to receive domestic violence complaints,101 I find that the bulk of the country conditions evidence for Nigeria indicates that adequate state protection would not be available for the claimants in Lagos. The serious problems with police corruption and ineffectiveness in Nigeria mean that KO could use his financial resources and connections in Nigeria to bribe the police anywhere, including Lagos. I find that the weight of the documentary evidence before me does not support a finding that conditions in Lagos with respect to the treatment of women, and with respect to police effectiveness, are different to the extent that it would render state protection adequate in Lagos, given their personal circumstances, and the particular factors involved in their claim. For these reasons, I find that the claimants do not have a viable IFA in Lagos, or anywhere else in Nigeria.\nCONCLUSION\n[81] Based on the above analysis, I determine that the claimants are Convention refugees pursuant to section 96 of IRPA. I therefore accept their claims.\n(signed) Melinda Gayda\nApril 29, 2022\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27, as amended, sections 96 and 97(1)\n2 Refugee Protection Division Rules, (\u201cRPD Rules\u201d), SOR\/2012-256, Rule 55\n3 Guideline on Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution: Guidelines Issued by the Chairperson pursuant to section 65(3) of the Immigration Act, IRB, Ottawa, March 9, 1993, Update: November 1996, as continued in effect by the Chairperson on June 28, 2002 pursuant to section 159(l)(h) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n4 Exhibit 6, pages 46-52\n5 Exhibit 1, Package of information from the CBSA on referral of refugee claim.\n6 Exhibit 3, National Documentation Package for Italy (September 29, 2021), Item 2.1, Italy- Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2020, United States, Department of State, 30 March 2021, page 14.\n7 Exhibit 7, For Italy\u2019s Abused Women, a Legal Labyrinth Compounds the Wounds, New York Times, Gala Pianigiani, 11 August 2018, page 11.\n8 Exhibit 7, Ibid, page 11.\n9 Exhibit 14, Italy draws up plan to fight violence against women, Wanted in Rome, November 24, 2021, pages 323- 324;- Exhibit 12, Italy Survey reveals shocking attitudes towards violence against women, Wanted in Rome, November 25, 2021, page 303; Domestic violence against women escalating in Italy, independent Australia, June 3, 2021, Francesco Bertolucci, page 308.\n10 Exhibit 4, National Documentation Package for Nigeria (November 30, 2021 version) Item 5.3: Domestic violence, including legislation; protection and support services offered to victims (2016-November 2019).
