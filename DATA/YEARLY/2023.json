        "unofficial_text":"2023 RLLR 120\n\nCitation: 2023 RLLR 120\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: December 20, 2023\nPanel: Kate Bilkevitch\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): N\/A\nCountry: Cameroon\nRPD Number: VC3-09637\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2024-00593\nATIP Pages: N\/A\n\nDECISION\n\n[1] MEMBER: This is the decision of the Refugee Protection Division, the RPD, in the claim of XXXX XXXX XXXX as a citizen of Cameroon, who is claiming refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n\nALLEGATIONS\n\n[2] The claimant\u2019s allegations are contained in his Basis of Claim form. To summarise only briefly, the claimant has a fear of persecution at the hands of the Cameroonian authorities because of his background as an anglophone and his perceived support of the separatist movement due to his employment as an XXXX in the conflict zone.\n\nDETERMINATION\n\n[3] I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the Act. He has established a serious possibility of persecution should he return to Cameroon.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nIdentity\n\n[4] With respect to the issue of identity, the claimant\u2019s identity as a national of Cameroon has been established by the sworn statement in his Basis of Claim form, his testimony, a copy of his national identity card, birth certificate, and a copy of his Cameroonian passport. There is a presumption that sworn testimony is true unless there is sufficient reason to doubt its truthfulness. A finding that the claimant lacks credibility may be based on the failure of the claimant\u2019s account to stand up to scrutiny or unexplained inconsistencies, omissions, or contradictions. Further, the presumption of truthfulness does not apply to inferences or speculation for which there is no evidentiary basis. The claimant testified in a detailed manner. His testimony was straightforward, spontaneous, and consistent with his Basis of Claim narrative. The claimant elaborated in-depth on different aspects of the claim, such as his study and subsequent employment as an XXXX, his detention by the security forces in Cameroon, his escape and internal relocation in Cameroon, and his subsequent journey to Canada. I found the claimant overall credible in relation to his experiences in Cameroon in 2022.\n\n[5] Additionally, the claimant provided ample documentary evidence to substantiate his allegations of risk. For instance, the claimant adduced records demonstrating his education and employment, four (4) witness statements, medical certificates, and an arrest warrant. I have no reason to doubt the authenticity of these documents. Consequently, I give these documents full weight as I find them to be authentic, and they are probative of the issue at hand as they confirm the claimant\u2019s allegations. Overall, I accept the following allegations on the balance of probabilities. The claimant worked as an XXXX in war-torn northwest Cameroon. He was arrested and detained twice in 2022, the first time in XXXX and the second time in XXXX of that year. The first time the claimant was arrested on suspicion of collaborating with a separatist on XXXX XXXX, 2022. The claimant worked on XXXX XXXX to the village that was used by separatists to launch their assaults from. XXXX XXXX XXXX by the military, but the claimant made attempts to XXXX XXXX as his extended family and friends lived in that village and struggled without XXXX for several weeks. The claimant was detained and tortured for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The claimant was released upon fee payment produced by his brother. The claimant was forced to sign an undertaking prior to his release.\n\n[6] The claimant had no problem with the authorities after his release and continued his work as an XXXX. However, on XXXX XXXX, 2022, he was stopped at a checkpoint and questioned about some XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX in his possession. The claimant explained to the military that these items were for a contract he had. However, he was perceived to be collaborating with a separatist who needed XXXX XXXX for their hideouts in the bush. The claimant was detained for XXXX XXXX and was set to be executed, like several of his cellmates. However, his former classmate was a guard in the detention centre, and out of compassion, the man assisted the claimant to escape. The claimant hid in another village for about XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX communicating with his wife by phone only. However, in late XXXX, his wife was informed that a warrant for the claimant\u2019s arrest was issued. This led the claimant to decide to leave Cameroon for Nigeria. The claimant could not stay in Nigeria as the country frequently deported Cameroonian refugees back to Cameroon. As a result, he made the decision to travel to Canada, where he had family members.\n\n[7] Since his departure from Cameroon, the authorities visited the claimant\u2019s brother and wife. Both were interrogated and asked about the claimant\u2019s whereabouts. Based on the totality of the evidence before me, on a balance of probabilities, I accept that the claimant has been targeted by the Cameroonian authorities between XXXX and XXXX 2022.\n\nNexus\n\n[8] In order to satisfy the definition of a Convention refugee found in section 96 of the Act, the claimant must establish that he or she has a well-founded fear of persecution by reason of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. In this case, I find the claimant\u2019s allegations established a nexus to the Convention ground of political opinion or imputed political opinion. When considering the claimant\u2019s past treatment by the authorities due to the fact that he had been perceived to collaborate with the separatists on two (2) separate occasions combined with his status as a failed anglophone asylum seeker from the northwest part of Cameroon, I find that the claimant has a well-founded fear of persecution based on his imputed political opinion. As such, I have assessed his claim under section 96 of the Act.\n\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution\n\n[9] I find the claimant would face a forward-looking risk of persecution if returned to Cameroon. This persecution would take the form of physical violence, arbitrary arrest or detention, and psychological and physical abuse from the police authorities in Cameroon. I have accepted the claimant\u2019s testimony that the Cameroonian authorities have already detained and abused him because of his perceived association with a separatist movement. The claimant was also accused by the authorities of helping anglophone separatists. In addition, the claimant is a young man who has now spent a significant amount of time abroad. If returned to Cameroon as a failed refugee claimant, this would also contribute to his profile as a person Cameroonian authorities would likely suspect of having an anti-government political opinion. I have based my findings on the following country condition information, which corroborate the claimant\u2019s allegations and indicate that he would face a forward-looking risk.\n\n[10] At Tab 2.1 of the National Documentation Package for Cameroon, there is the U.S. Department of State report indicating that Cameroonian authorities have in the previous year been known to conduct arbitrary arrests or detentions, unlawful or arbitrary killings including extrajudicial killings by security forces, forced disappearance, torture, and cases of cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment. And this report also indicates there has been abuse and retaliation against family members for offences allegedly committed by an individual. Much of these abuses have been associated with the armed conflict between anglophone militant groups and the majority francophone government. Many unarmed civilians have been affected by this violence and the government is known to use excessive force on civilians. They are known to raid anglophone neighbourhoods in Cameroon while searching for suspected militants.\n\n[11] A report at tab 2.3 of the NDP confirms the conflict between government security forces and anglophone separatists has resulted in widespread civilian deaths and displacement. The same report indicates that anglophone activists have faced harassment, violence, and arrests for their activities. I find that the claimant, who worked as an electrician in the anglophone region of Cameroon and who is perceived to have ties to separatists would on a balance of probabilities be perceived as a person who holds anti-government views. A report at Tab 2.5 of the NDP confirms that government forces have committed widespread human rights abuses including extrajudicial and summary execution across Cameroon since the year of at least 2020. A report at Tab 13.2 indicates Cameroonian authorities have imposed restrictions on anglophone regions including curfews, bans on public meetings, and other restrictive measures. The same report indicates that anglophone Cameroonians who have been living abroad for some time have been arrested upon their return to the Yaound\u00e9 or Douala airports in Cameroon. Those arrested include failed asylum seekers. Failed asylum seekers who are anglophone have been imprisoned, harmed, and fined.\n\n[12] The claimant himself has already been detained and accused of supporting anglophone militants, and his refugee claim is based on these circumstances. I find these circumstances contribute to the risk he would face if he returned to Cameroon, as he would likely be targeted by police for questioning or abuse at the airport, not only due to his previous detention, but also as a failed asylum seeker. Ultimately, I find the claimant has established that he has been arrested, detained, and targeted by the Cameroon state on the basis of his perceived political opinion. I find the claimant, as someone who has already been identified by the state as a person who holds anti-government views and sympathising with the separatist cause faces a serious possibility of persecution if he returns to Cameroon. Given that there are no credibility issues with respect to the allegations of the claimant combined with the documentary evidence set out above, I find that the claimant\u2019s subjective fear has an objective basis.\n\nState Protection and Internal Flight Alternative\n\n[13] As the state is the agent of persecution in this case, I find the state would not be able to provide meaningful or reasonable protection to the claimant. I find the presumption of state protection in this case has been clearly rebutted as the state is the agent that the claimant fears. Further, as the state is the agent of harm in this case, and given that the state has access to the entirety of its territory, I find that the claimant faces a serious possibility of persecution throughout Cameroon. As a result, there is no viable Internal Flight Alternative in all of Cameroon.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[14] For all of the foregoing reasons, I conclude that the claimant is a Convention refugee and I, therefore, accept his claim. This is the end of the decision.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

        "unofficial_text":"2023 RLLR 119\n\nCitation: 2023 RLLR 119\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: December 19, 2023\nPanel: Hannah Gray\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): N\/A\nCountry: Russia\nRPD Number: VC3-07126\nAssociated RPD Number(s): VC3 06774, VC3 06775\nATIP Number: A-2024-00593\nATIP Pages: N\/A\n\nDECISION\n\n[1] MEMBER: So I have considered your testimonies today, and the other evidence in your case and I will now give you my decision orally. And you will also receive a written version of this decision in the mail, okay? So I will begin by telling you that my decision is a positive one (1), and I have accepted each of your claims, so congratulations.\n\n[2] CLAIMANT: Thank you.\n\n[3] ASSOCIATE CLAIMANT: Thank you very much.\n\n[4] MEMBER: You\u2019re very welcome. I\u2019m now going to read you the reasons for my decision, and they\u2019re a bit lengthy, so just bear with me while I read those, okay?\n\n[5] Okay, this is the decision of the Refugee Protection Division in the claims of XXXX XXXX, and his spouse, XXXX XXXX, and their daughter, XXXX XXXX of Ukraine, who are claiming refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, the IRPA.\n\n[6] At the hearing, the associate claimant, who is the mother of the minor claimant, acted as the designated representative for her daughter pursuant to subsection 167(2) of the Act, and Rule 20 of the Refugee Protection Division Rules.\n\n[7] I have considered and applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 4 on Gender Considerations in Proceedings Before the Immigration and Refugee Board, which offers guidance with respect to any gender-specific issues present in this claim.\n\n[8] I\u2019ve also applied and considered the Chairperson\u2019s Guidelines on child refugee claimants, procedural and evidentiary issues as it relates to the claim of the minor claimant.\n\n[9] The claimants were self-represented for their hearing.\n\nDETERMINATION\n\n[10] I find that the claimants are Convention refugees pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA based on their well-founded fear of persecution in Ukraine. I also find that the principal claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA based on his well-founded fear of persecution in Russia.\n\nALLEGATIONS\n\n[11] The specifics of the claim are stated in the claimant\u2019s Basis of Claim forms and narratives in evidence. The claimants are a Ukrainian and Russian family from Ukraine. The principal claimant is a 34-year old Russian male, along with his 34-year old Ukrainian wife and their seven-year old Ukrainian child.\n\n[12] The claimants lived in XXXX (ph), Kyiv, Ukraine. In late XXXX 2022, the claimants fled from Ukraine to Switzerland after the Russian occupation of Ukraine as there was missiles and bombing of their country and their hometown, specifically.\n\n[13] The claimants then came to Canada in XXXX 2022, and made their refugee claim shortly after. The principal claimant is politically opposed to Russia\u2019s military campaign and operation in Ukraine and does not want to participate in any war activities if he were forced to return to Russia now. The principal claimant moved from Russia to Ukraine in 2006 to study and has not been back to Russia since 2013. He received his Ukrainian permanent residency in 2014, and the principal claimant and associate claimant were married in 2015.\n\n[14] The principal claimant\u2019s passport expires \u2014 Russian passport expires in 2025, and he does not want to approach the Russian government to renew it for the purposes of applying for a permanent residency in Canada.\n\n[15] Okay, I will now assess whether there\u2019s any possibility for article 1(e) exclusion for the principal claimant regarding his permanent resident status in Ukraine. An article 1(e) exclusion is whether the principal claimant should be excluded from refugee protection due to his permanent residency in Ukraine. The principal claimant provided his permanent resident permit for Ukraine in evidence. Pursuant to article 1(e), the Convention refugee definition does not apply to a person who\u2019s recognized by the authorities of a country in which they have taken residence as having the rights and obligations which are attached to the possession of nationality of that country. The test for determining whether article 1(e) applies is set out in Zhang and Zhang states that considering all relevant factors to the date of the hearing, does the claimant have status substantially similar to that of its nationals in the third country. If the answer is yes, the claimant is excluded; if the answer is no, then the next question is whether the claimant previously had such status and lost it or had access to such status and failed to acquire it. If the answer is no, the claimant is not excluded under article 1(e), and if the answer is yes, the RPD must consider on balanced factors \u2014 various factors. These include, but are not limited, to the reason for the loss, which is voluntary or involuntary, whether the claimant could return to the third country, the risk the claimant would face in their home country, and Canada\u2019s international obligations, and any other relevant facts.\n\n[16] I find that the claimant had status in Ukraine substantially similar to that of Ukrainian nationals at the time of the hearing. However, in assessing whether an individual has status substantially similar to that of nationals of a third country, the jurisprudence as how a number of basic rights that are associated with nationality, including the right to return to the country of residence, the right to work freely without restrictions, the right to study, and full access to social services. The status should not be a temporary one (1) that must be renewed, and which may be cancelled. The claimant\u2019s permanent residence permit for Ukraine was issued in 2014, as he was first in Ukraine \u2014 as he moved to Ukraine to study in 2006 and lived with his Ukrainian grandmother. The claimant testified that he initially went to Ukraine to study and then met his now wife, who is the associate claimant, and he has not returned to Russia since 2013. He further testified that as a Russian in Ukraine he\u2019s not able to acquire Ukrainian citizenship as he would first have to denounce his Russian citizenship. And Russia does currently not allow any Russians in Ukraine to denounce their citizenship. With that said, I do find that the status or the permanent resident status afforded to the principal claimant did allow him the rights that are substantially similar to those held by nationals of Ukraine. As the claimant was able to travel freely, and he also had the right to obtain employment and experience access to education and other social services in Ukraine.\n\n[17] However, since the Russian invasion of Ukraine the situation has deteriorated, and it is not clear whether or not permanent residents of Ukraine who have Russian citizenship are able to travel freely in and out of the country.\n\n[18] Okay, so based on all the evidence before me, I do find that permanent residents of Ukraine in the past did have rights substantially similar to nationals. That being said, the purpose of article 1(e) is to exclude individuals who do not require protection because they have some form of surrogate protection in another safe country where they enjoy substantially the same rights and obligations as nationals of that country. And while there has been some disagreement in the Federal Court as to whether any risk in the 1(e) country should be examined by the Refugee Protection Division, and whether it should be done at the Pre-Removal Risk Assessment stage, the Refugee Appeal Division decision MB800025 was identified as a jurisprudential guide that states that the preferred interpretation of the Convention is that allegations of risk in any country of residence are to be taken into consideration in the analysis of whether a refugee claimant is excluded from refugee protection under article 1(e). The RAD noted that despite some divergence, the court has consistently endorsed the approach of the RPD and RAD members in assessing the risk in the article 1(e) country. The reasoning being that people who face persecution or serious harm in their country of residence cannot be said to enjoy surrogate protection, as is the case in this claim.\n\n[19] Also, the object and purpose of the Convention in article 1(e) require decision-makers to consider any risk raised by a claimant in their country of residence before they can be excluded from refugee protection. This framework respects Canada\u2019s international obligations that flow from article 1(e). Therefore, I have adopted this framework and assessed the risks to the principal claimant in Ukraine.\n\n[20] The principal claimant testified that he\u2019s a Russian citizen and would not be allowed to re-enter Ukraine using his Russian passport at this time due to the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine which began in February 2022. He testified that even if he were somehow able to re-enter Ukraine, he would face harm as a Russian citizen who would be perceived as being pro-Russian, and he would also face a risk of harm from the ongoing bombings and missiles in Ukraine now.\n\n[21] Therefore, based on the claimant\u2019s testimony, and the objective evidence which will be assessed below, I find that he has established a nexus to the Convention on the grounds of his imputed or actual political opinion as a Russian in Ukraine if he were to return to Ukraine now. I also considered that the claimant would face a risk in Ukraine as someone who could be forced into conscription by the Ukrainian military.\n\n[22] According to the National Documentation Package for Ukraine, at NDP item 2.2, an Amnesty International Report states that members of far right groups target marginalized groups with harassment, intimidation, and violence, and often with total impunity.\n\n[23] NDP article \u2014 item 1.27 is article for a report by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe which state that there are numerous reports of individuals perceived as being pro-Russian supporters who are mistreated and beaten by police, volunteer defence force members and others in territory controlled by the Government of Ukraine.\n\nThe mistreatment, carried out by police officers, members of the territorial defence or civilians, usually consists of such individuals being duct taped to electricity poles or trees, partially or fully stripped, beaten, including with sticks and rods, and sprayed with paint or having the word marauder written on their body or clothes.\n\nThe Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe has documented more than 45 such cases.\n\n[24] But that was as of June 2022, and the number is most likely higher at this point in time.\n\n[25] Based on the totality of the evidence before me, I find the principal claimant has established a subjective fear of persecution that \u2014 and it objectively \u2014 and he has established that his subjective fear is objectively well-founded. And I find the principal claimant would find a risk of persecution in Ukraine based on his imputed or actual political opinion if he were to return now as a Russian citizen.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nIdentity\n\n[26] I am satisfied with the personal and national identity of the principal claimant as a citizen of Russia which is established by his testimony and the copies of his passport in evidence. I\u2019m also satisfied with the personal and national identities of the associate claimant and minor claimant as citizens of Ukraine which is established by the associate claimant\u2019s testimony and the copy of their passports in evidence.\n\nCredibility\n\n[27] When a claimant swears to the truth of their allegations, this creates a presumption that those allegations are true unless there\u2019s reason to doubt their truthfulness. In this case, I find no reason to doubt the truthfulness of the claimants. They testified in a straightforward, forthright, detailed and candid manner, and there were no material inconsistencies, omissions, or contradictions between the claimants\u2019 testimonies and the other evidence in this case. They did not exaggerate or tailor their evidence. And in summary, their testimonies were consistent with the other evidence on the central aspects of their claims.\n\n[28] I find the claimants provided ample details to expand upon their allegations, and they also provided a great deal of evidence prior to the hearing, which included a number of identity documents as well as their birth-certificates and newspaper articles, and they also including, during the hearing, social media posts that the principal claimant wrote on both Facebook and Instagram that he submitted into evidence during the hearing.\n\n[29] Given the claimants\u2019 careful testimonies, I find they have established on a balance of probabilities, the facts alleged in their claims. Including that the claimants are a mixed Russian\/Ukrainian family, and they fear a risk of harm in both Russia, due to their political opinion or imputed political opinion, as well as in Ukraine due to the ongoing war.\n\n[30] In sum, I find the claimants to be credible witnesses and, therefore, believe what they have alleged in support of their claims.\n\nNexus\n\n[31] To qualify for refugee status under the refugee Convention, an individual must demonstrate that they have a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion. The allegations establishing nexus to the Convention for the principal claimant on the ground of his imputed or actual political opinion as a Russian who has publicly shared his anti-Russian views with his community both on social media as well as in person, or on the phone. Furthermore, the associate claimant and minor claimant have established a nexus to the Convention as they are members of a particular social group, as women or girls who face a risk of gender-based violence in a situation of war in Ukraine.\n\n[32] Based on the aforementioned evidence, I will assess their claims under section 96.\n\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution and Risk of Harm for the Principal Claimant in Russia\n\n[33] The principal claimant testified that he will be arrested and harmed if he returns to Russia now as he will be perceived as a foreign agent or a spy as he lived in Ukraine since 2006 and married a Ukrainian. He further testified that he has since the war began he has shared his political views speaking out against the Russian Regime on social media as well as the family members in Russia who strongly disagree with his perspective. The principal claimant fears a risk to his life due to his actual or imputed political opinion in Russia.\n\n[34] According to the National Documentation Package at item 2.23 of the NDP, an Austrian Red Cross Report from May 2022, states that, on the 7th of April 2022, they published an article which deals with the prosecution of anti-war dissidents in Russia. This report notes the following. The authorities are exerting unprecedented pressure on dissenters. There are mass detentions and protest participants are being threatened with criminal prosecution for participating in activities of extremist organizations. The details of criminal cases against those opposing the war are not always known but their overall demeanour and the identities of those persecuted suggests the authorities are using the war as an excuse to crush dissent and totally cleanse civil society. Despite the numerous instances of violence perpetrated by representatives of the authorities who unjustifiably detain people at demonstrations, not a single criminal court case has been filed in response to these acts. Nonetheless, criminal proceedings can taint people against protestors for violence against police officers. Experience has shown that unbiased investigations and due process in such cases are not upheld in Russia. On the contrary, judicial proceedings are characterized by a blatant disregard for procedural norms and evidence for the defence. Penalties are disproportionate even for formal charges.\n\n[35] According to the Russian NDP at item 2.26, it states that media and internet providers or social networks which make information about the conflict in Ukraine accessible to the Russian public, are threatened with criminal prosecution and asked to remove the information. Furthermore, the principal claimant stated that he would be refused \u2014 that he could be forced to be conscripted into the Russian military if he were to return to Russia now.\n\n[36] According to NDP item 8.1, persons refusing to take part in the hostilities in Ukraine, as well as their family members, could face persecution by the authorities. Persons persecuted by law enforcement and convicted prisoners were also reported to be among the involuntary recruits. Human Rights activists reported that interned men who refused their deployment to Ukraine were threatened with contrived criminal proceedings.\n\n[37] In sum, based on all the evidence before me, I find the principal claimant has established that he would face a serious risk to his life if he were to return to Russia now as a Ukrainian permanent resident who lived in Ukraine for many years. His fear is indeed well-founded.\n\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution and Risk of Harm in Ukraine\n\n[38] I also find the associate and minor claimants have established a well-founded fear of persecution in Ukraine based on their actual or imputed political opinion. As well as they could face persecution in Ukraine due to the ongoing war and a particular risk if they\u2019re women or girls.\n\n[39] The National Documentation Package for Ukraine which includes a U.S. Department of State Report at item 2.1 indicates that in Russian controlled areas of Ukraine, Russian-led forces have engaged in unlawful or widespread civilian harm, and forced disappearances, or abductions, and torture or physical abuses of punishment. The report also states that in these areas there are significant human rights issues including arbitrary arrests, political prisoners, serious restriction on free expression, and substantial interference with freedom of assembly and religion. And the associate claimant and the minor claimant could be perceived as being pro-Russian due to their membership in a particular social group as family members of the principal claimant.\n\n[40] NDP item 1.6 for Ukraine states that since the beginning of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine the ACLED records nearly 40,000 political violence events across the country. Three-quarters of these events are shelling, artillery and missile strikes, mostly effecting the north-eastern, eastern, and southern regions of Ukraine.\n\n[41] Meanwhile the long range strikes, including those deliberately targeting civilian infrastructure which pose a permanent threat and continue to induce extreme hardship for communities who are farther afield from the frontline.\n\n[42] Amnesty International Reports at item 1.7 of the NDP for Ukraine that according to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, or UNHCR, nearly one-third of Ukrainians have been displaced by the conflict and 6.2 million people remain displaced within Ukraine, and 7.8 million are estimated to be refugees in Europe.\n\n[43] Regarding any additional risk that the associate claimant and minor claimant may face as women or girls in Ukraine is corroborated in the NDP. The objective evidence, in particular a rapid gender analysis by Care International and U.N. Women at NDP item 5.6 states that women constitute the majority of those displaced within and outside of the country. And they face significantly increased safety and protection risks. Incidents of gender-based violence, particularly domestic violence and conflict related sexual violence. This report further delves into the challenges for women of all ages to access agent services in war torn areas of Eastern Ukraine, and many have fled and faced further hurdles in accessing safe shelters in the Western Region of the country.\n\n[44] Women and girls are also more at risk of conflict-based sexual assault. And NDP item 5.2 states that there is increasing and concerning media reports on conflict related sexual violence emerging in Ukraine.\n\n[45] Based on the totality of the evidence before me, I find that the associate and minor claimant have established a well-founded fear of persecution in Ukraine due to their membership in a particular social group as women or girls, as well as their actual or imputed political opinion as they are in a family with a Russian citizen and, therefore, I find the claimants would face a serious forward-facing possibility of persecution if they were to return to Ukraine now.\n\nState Protection and Internal Flight Alternative in Russia\n\n[46] In all refugee claims the state is presumed to be capable of protecting their citizens unless there is clear and convincing evidence to the contrary. In this case, given that the government is an agent of persecution for the principal claimant in Russia, it appears objectively unreasonable for the principal claimant to seek the protection of the state. Consequently, the presumption of state protection has been rebutted.\n\n[47] With respect to an Internal Flight Alternative, or IFA, I do not find that the principal claimant could safely live in any other part of Russia given that the agent of persecution is the government, and he cannot be expected to hide from the state.\n\nState Protection and Internal Flight Alternative in Ukraine for the Associate and Minor Claimant\n\n[48] I find there is clear and convincing evidence that the Ukrainian state is in a state of complete breakdown as a result of the ongoing large-scale Russian invasion and that for this reason the presumption of state protection has been rebutted. State protection would not be available to the claimants if they were to return to Ukraine now and seek it. Furthermore, in regard to the Internal Flight Alternative, the UNHCR at item 1.23 of the Ukrainian NDP states that it does not consider appropriate to deny international protection to Ukrainians and former habitual residents of Ukraine on the basis of an internal flight or relocation alternative.\n\n[49] Based on this evidence and considering the current state of events in Ukraine, I find there is no viable Internal Flight Alternative available for the claimants there.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[50] For the reasons above, I determine that the claimants are Convention refugees pursuant to section 96 of the Act and I accept each of their claims.\n\n[51] Thank you for bearing with me through that lengthy set of reasons, and congratulations.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

So this is the decision of the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada for the claim of XXXX XXXX XXXX, AKA XXXX XXXX XXXX, AKA XXXX XXXX XXXX, who is seeking refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. I have reviewed and applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline and proceedings before the IRB involving sexual orientation, gender identity, and expression, and sex characteristics.\n\nALLEGATIONS\n\n[2] The claimant fears persecution if she were to return to either Lebanon or Ukraine because of her SOGIESC identity. This is a summary of the claimant\u2019s allegations which are found in the narrative attached to her Basis of Claim form, including her amendments which are found at Exhibit 5. The claimant is a 23-year-old transgender woman. The claimant\u2019s father is Lebanese and her mother is Ukrainian. The claimant was born and raised in Lebanon.\n\n[3] The claimant\u2019s narrative describes the societal abuse she faced growing up. In 2017 when the claimant was 17, she came out to her parents. Claimant\u2019s mother\u2019s side of the family who are primarily in Ukraine, have responded with violence to the claimant. Around 2019, the claimant began XXXX XXXX. The claimant was at university at the time, and this was when she first was getting threats from radical Islamic groups in the university.\n\n[4] The claimant described facing other abuses from other students. The claimant\u2019s narratives also described discrimination faced by LGBTIQ people in Lebanon when it comes to healthcare and employment. After the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, the claimant used the Canadian Ukrainian Authorization for Emergency Travel Program to come to Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2022. In April of 2023, the claimant applied for refugee protection.\n\nDETERMINATION\n\n[5] I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nIdentity\n\n[6] The claimant\u2019s identity as a citizen of both Lebanon and Ukraine has been established on a balance of probabilities by the claimant\u2019s testimony and her passports which are found at Exhibit 1.\n\nNexus\n\n[7] The claimant\u2019s SOGIESC identity establishes a nexus to a Convention ground for the claimant based on her membership in a particular social group. I do note that in general, the country conditions in Ukraine have significantly changed with the Russian invasion in February 2022. That said, given my determination, I find it unnecessary to consider any other nexus to the Convention grounds for the claimant in Ukraine because of the Russian invasion.\n\nCredibility\n\n[8] I find that the claimant was credible. In making that finding and relying on the principle that a claimant who affirms to tell the truth creates a presumption of truthfulness unless there are reasons to doubt their truthfulness. In this case, I have no reasons to doubt the claimant\u2019s truthfulness. The claimant provided personal documents which support her claim which are found at Exhibit 4. These documents include photographs of the claimant with her boyfriend and copies of messages between her and her current boyfriend, as well as some earlier messages with an ex-boyfriend.\n\n[9] The Exhibit also contains letters of support, including from a XXXX from Montreal and XXXX from Lebanon. There are also copies of the claimant\u2019s prescription for her XXXX XXXX and a copy of the claimant\u2019s XXXX report, showing her XXXX XXXX XXXX. I have no reason to doubt the genuineness of these documents, and since they relate to the claimant\u2019s SOGIESC identity, I give these documents great weight to support her claim.\n\n[10] Given the supporting documents, it was unnecessary to have the claimant testify in detail, and in the claimant\u2019s limited testimony, she responded to questions clearly, and there are no inconsistencies or other concerns. I do note that the claimant was in Canada for almost a year before she applied for refugee protection. That said, I make no negative credibility findings against the claimant for the delay. The claimant had valid status during that time in Canada and explained that she believed the program would make her feel safe, but due to discrimination she faced in Canada, she sought greater protection and applied for refugee protection.\n\n[11] I accept the claimant\u2019s explanation for the delay, especially given the status she had in Canada at the time. Given the credibility of the claimant and the documents provided, I find that the claimant has established on a balance of probabilities the facts alleged in her claim, including her SOGIESC identity.\n\n[12] Objective basis, Lebanon. The country condition documents supports the claimant\u2019s fears of returning to Lebanon. The US Department of State report found at Item 2.1 in the National Documentation Package for Lebanon which is found at Exhibit 3.1, indicates that significant human rights issues in the country include crimes involving violence or threats of violence targeting lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, or intersex persons, as well as the existence and enforcement of laws criminal \u2014 criminalising consensual same-sex conduct between adults.\n\n[13] NDP Item 6.9 is a 2021 report that also describes criminalisation of individuals with diverse SGOIESC in Lebanon. That report also states that and I quote, \u201ctranswomen and persons of feminine gender expression are at a particular risk of police targeting and violence.\u201d Further, a 2014 Response to Information Request at NDP Item 6.4 in \u2014 or describes societal views towards SOGIESC individuals in Lebanon. While the report indicates that the conditions are somewhat better in Beirut, it still describes how individuals need to conceal their identity in the city to be safe and how SOGIESC individuals are still strongly condemned in the city.\n\n[14] The RIR also indicates that 66 percent of doctors in Lebanon view SOGIESC individuals as having an illness that can be treated through psychotherapy. The claimant\u2019s own narrative describes how she was forced by her family to go to a XXXX who was transphobic and who tried to treat her as if she had a mental illness.\n\n[15] I find that the claimant has established that the societal discrimination, criminalization, and the ongoing violence towards SOGIESC individuals, including the abuse and discrimination that she has personally suffered from amounts to persecution, and the claimant has established a well-founded fear of persecution because of her SOGIESC identity if she were to return to Lebanon.\n\n[16] As such \u2014 sorry. Objective basis, Ukraine. The country condition document also support the claimant\u2019s fears of returning to Ukraine. The US Department of State report found at Item 2.1 in the National Documentation Package for Ukraine which is found at Exhibit 3.2 also indicates that a significant human right issue in the country are crimes involving violence or threats of violence targeting lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, or intersex persons.\n\n[17] The report states that and I quote, \u201cthere was societal violence against LGBTQI+ persons, often perpetrated by members of violent radical groups, and authorities often did not adequately investigate these cases or hold perpetrators to account.\u201d. Further, that report states that, and I quote, \u201claw enforcement at times condoned or perpetrated violence against members of the LGBTQI+ community.\u201d\n\n[18] This is also indicated in a 2022 report at Item 6.1, that states that and I quote, \u201canti-LGBT hate speech and hate crimes continued to be a severe issue this year.\u201d And a report at Item 6.3 on violence against the LGBT Q+ community in 2001 indicates that far-right groups continue to purposefully monitor and attack community events. The report also notes that police continue to respond extremely passively to reports of already committed attacks on LGBTQ+ organizations and activities, and the practice of investigating hate crimes and other violations of rights has not changed significantly.\n\n[19] I further note that a Freedom House report at Item 2.3 indicate that SOGIESC individuals experience significant societal discrimination and generally do not receive protection from attacks against them. I find that the claimant has established that the ongoing threats of violence and discrimination towards SOGIESC individuals, including the risks the claimant may face from her own family in Ukraine, amount to persecution, and the claimant has established a well-founded fear of persecution because of her SOGIESC identity if she were to return to Ukraine.\n\nState Protection\n\n[20] I have considered whether state protection is available to the claimant in either country, and I find that there is none. In both countries, the country condition documents describe the violence perpetrated by law enforcement. The country condition documents (inaudible) also indicate that police enforced criminal laws targeting SOGIESC individuals. As such, I find that there is no operationally effective state protection available to the claimant in her particular circumstances.\n\nInternal Flight Alternative\n\n[21] I have also considered whether the claimant would have a viable internal flight alternative available to her in either Lebanon or Ukraine, and I find that there is none. In making this finding, I note that the country condition documents provide sufficient evidence to show that there is a location in either country, where SOGIESC individuals do not face discrimination, violence, and in Lebanon there is the ongoing risk of criminal charges.\n\n[22] With respect \u2014 sorry. With the lack of state protection noted above, I find that there is no viable internal flight alternative available to the claimant, as she would face more than a mere possibility of persecution anywhere in either country.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[23] For the foregoing reasons, I determined that the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. The Board therefore accepts her claim.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

She never identified with her gender growing up and had an abusive upbringing, being subject to domestic violence. The claimant did not discuss her gender identity and sexual orientation with her parents, and only discussed this with her very close friends in 2017-2018. She prefers to use XXXX as her name, but her mother did not start addressing her as such much later, until recently. The claimant has lived in various states, including Kentucky, Florida, and California, but has not been provided with health supports \u2013 both mental and physical due to her gender identity and sexual orientation. She met with an accident in 2015 and has struggled with XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX since that time. The claimant has been requesting XXXX XXXX from the US government, but none has been forthcoming. Facing XXXX XXXX XXXX and the prospect of being homeless, she travelled to Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2022 and sought refugee protection.\n\nDETERMINATION\n\n[6] I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee as she has established a serious possibility of persecution for the following reasons.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nIdentity\n[7] I find that the claimant\u2019s identity as a national of USA is established, on a balance of probabilities, based on a certified copy of her American passport on file.[3]\n\nNexus\n[8] For a claimant to be considered a Convention refugee, the well-founded fear of persecution must be by reason of one or more of the five grounds: race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion. The persecution that the claimant fears in this case is because of her gender identity and sexual orientation. I find that she has established nexus to the Convention ground of membership in a particular social group: namely a claimant fearing persecution due to her sexual orientation. As such, her claim is being assessed under section 96 of IRPA and not under section 97.\n\nCredibility\n[9] When a claimant swears to the truth of certain allegations, this creates a presumption that those allegations are true unless there be reason to doubt their truthfulness. (Maldonado [1980] 2.F.C. 302 (C.A.)) In this case, the claimant testified in a detailed manner and explained how the life events unfolded for her in the US. She was quite emotional upon recounting her experiences.\n[10] Apart from her oral testimony, she has provided corroborating documentary evidence[4] to support her claim. I have no reason to doubt the genuineness of these documents and accept them as genuine.\n[11] Among other documents, the evidence includes diagnosis of the claimant\u2019s medical problems, her housing dispute with the authorities in the US, and a XXXX XXXX report, which are consistent with her allegations. Therefore, based on the claimant\u2019s straightforward testimony and the corroborating documentary evidence on file, I find her to be a credible witness and accept her allegations to be true on a balance of probabilities, including her subjective fear of returning to the US.\n\nExclusion under Article 1E\n[12] The claimant got married to a citizen of the United Kingdom (UK) in or around 2015\/2016. This raises the issue of exclusion under Article 1E as the claimant could have access to permanent residency in the UK based on spousal sponsorship. I find that this exclusion does not apply as the claimant never lived in the UK.\n[13] She accompanied her wife to England and lived there for a month in 2017 but did not find the environment suitable for her to relocate their permanently. She separated from her spouse in 2017 as theirs was a long-distance relationship. The claimant has had no communication with her wife since 2021. There was no sponsorship application filed by her wife in the UK for the claimant to move there permanently.\n[14] As well, objective evidence[5] submitted by the claimant\u2019s counsel elaborates on the conditions under which a spouse of a UK citizen can have access to permanent residency. One of the conditions is that the couple has to have been in a common-law or married relationship for at least two years before the UK citizen can apply for the foreign spouse to reside permanently in the UK. Since the claimant\u2019s relationship with her wife was a long-distance one and they ended up separating after less than two years of marriage, this would make the claimant ineligible for being sponsored as a permanent resident of the UK.\n[15] Therefore, I am satisfied that as of the date of hearing, the claimant was not a permanent resident of the UK and did not have access to such status in the past in that country.\n\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution and Risk of Harm\n[16] In order for me to find that the claimant is a Convention refugee, I have to find that the objective evidence establishes that she will face a serious possibility of persecution if removed to the US. I find that the objective evidence supports her subjective fears and establishes a serious possibility of persecution for the claimant if she is forced to return to her country. My reasons are as follows.\n[17] A report by Human Rights Campaign Foundation states that:\nSadly, 2022 has already seen at least 35 transgender people fatally shot or killed by other violent means. We say \u201cat least\u201d because too often these stories go unreported \u2014 or misreported. In previous years, the majority of these people were Black and Latinx transgender women.\nIn 2021, the Human Rights Campaign tracked a record number of violent fatal incidents against transgender and gender non-conforming people \u2014 with 50 fatalities tracked.\nThese victims, like all of us, are loving partners, parents, family members, friends and community members. They worked, went to school and attended houses of worship. They were real people \u2014 people who did not deserve to have their lives taken from them. [6]\n[18] The claimant has been rendered homeless and lost her employment several times due to discrimination in the workplace, and due to unfair and discriminatory treatment by the authorities. She has not had access to hormone therapy due to her gender identity. On the state of the LGBTQ community, Center for American Progress notes that:\nThis comprehensive study of LGBTQ Americans raises important issues for policymakers and other leaders in American life to consider. With more than one-third of LGBTQ Americans reporting some form of discrimination in their personal and work lives, including more than 6 in 10 transgender Americans, clearly more needs to be done to ensure equal treatment in law and in practice for this community. The U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision on June 15, 2020, extending employment protections to LGBTQ workers was a significant victory. However, ongoing discrimination in the workplace, in health care, and in public places needs to be better addressed through comprehensive legislation such as the Equality Act and with targeted resources designed specifically to help this community.[7]\n[19] In a report titled \u2018State Attacks Against LGBTQI+ Rights\u2019, Center for American Progress states that:\nAcross the country, extremist anti-LGBTQI+ and anti-transgender groups are waging a coordinated campaign to restrict LGBTQI+ rights and target transgender youth specifically. According to the Center for American Progress\u2019 partners at the Equality Federation, nearly 400 anti-LGBTQI+ bills were introduced across the country in 2021. In 2022, state legislatures are currently considering approximately 300 anti-LGBTQI+ bills. Unfortunately, legislators in multiple states\u2014such as Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Iowa, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Utah, and others\u2014have already enacted anti-LGBTQI+ bills since the start of 2022. In total, there are currently 14 states with laws categorically banning transgender students from participating in school sports consistent with their gender identity and four have adopted laws or taken executive action to ban or restrict access to medically necessary, best-practice gender-affirming care for transgender youth. These anti-LGBTQI+ attacks endanger the fundamental rights and well-being of LGBTQI+ communities.\nNot only does the passage of these measures directly harm states\u2019 LGBTQI+ communities, but data also show that just the introduction of these kinds of bills \u2014which are often fueled by hateful and misinformed rhetoric\u2014adversely affects LGBTQI+ communities, especially youth. For example, data from The Trevor Project show that 66 percent of LGBTQ youth, including 85 percent of transgender and\/or nonbinary youth, report that recent debates around state laws to restrict the rights of transgender people have negatively affected their mental health. Learn more about the proliferation of anti-LGBTQI+ bills and the 2022 legislative landscape for LGBTQI+ rights here. [8]\n[20] The objective evidence discussed above establishes that sexual minorities in the US face persecution not only from society but the authorities as well. States in the US are passing laws that infringe upon the rights of transgender persons. The claimant in this case has suffered from such discrimination and unfair treatment, being denied basic health care such as mental health therapy and access to XXXX XXXX. She has lost her employment, home, and left to deal with XXXX XXXX XXXX on her own, without adequate support from the US authorities because she identifies herself as a non-binary gendered person.\n[21] Therefore, based on all the evidence before me, I find that the claimant will face a serious possibility of persecution if forced to go back to the US, especially since sexual minorities are persecuted in that country by both state and non-state actors. I find that the claimant\u2019s fears are indeed well-founded.\n\nState Protection\n[22] I find that it would be objectively unreasonable for the claimant to seek the protection of the state of the US authorities in light of her particular circumstances.\n[23] States are presumed to be capable of protecting their citizens, except in situations where the state is in a state of complete breakdown.[9] However, this is a rebuttable presumption.\n[24] As discussed above, there are over 300 legislations currently being discussed that discriminate against the LGBTQ+ community. A lot of the states have already passed such legislation. As well, there is violence against anyone identifying as a transgender person. Therefore, given the objective evidence discussed in the preceding paragraphs that shows that states are enacting legislations or have enacted legislation against the LGBTQ+ community, I find that the US authorities are one of the agents of persecution.\n[25] Therefore, I find that the presumption of state protection has been rebutted in this case.\n\nInternal Flight Alternative (IFA)\n[26] I have analyzed whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for the claimant.\n[27] On the evidence before me, I find that there is a serious possibility of persecution for her throughout the US. The claimant has lived in several states and the treatment meted out to her as a member of the LGBTQ+ community has been similar.\n[28] Therefore, based on this reason and the ones similar to those in relation to that of state protection, I am satisfied that the claimant does not have a viable IFA in her home country.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[29] For the foregoing reasons, I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee under section 96 of IRPA. Therefore, I accept her claim.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n[1] Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n[2] Exhibit 2.\n[3] Exhibit 1.\n[4] Exhibit 4.\n[5] Ibid.\n[6] Exhibit 3, National Documentation Package, United States, 31 January 2023, tab 6.3: Fatal Violence Against the Transgender and Gender Non-Conforming Community in 2022.

Okay. This is the decision of the Refugee Protection Division, the RPD, in the claim of XXXX (sic) (ph) XXXX, the claimant, a citizen of Ukraine, who is claiming refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, the IRPA. In the claimant\u2019s passport and birth certificate, it states her former name as XXXX XXXX. The claimant has since changed her name, and that is how she will be referred to throughout the reasons below, as the changed name.\n\n[2] I have considered and applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 4, gender considerations in proceedings before the Immigration and Refugee Board. I have also considered and applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline on sexual orientation and gender identity and expression and sex characteristics, due to the intersectionality of the claimant\u2019s various identity factors.\n\nDETERMINATION\n\n[3] I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA, based on her well-founded fear of persecution in Ukraine.\n\nALLEGATIONS\n\n[4] The specifics of the claim are stated in the claimant\u2019s Basis of Claim form and narrative in evidence. The claimant is a 23 year old transgender woman from Kiev, Ukraine. She began to realize that she identified as being female around the year 2012. While in school, she saw a classmate of hers being physically assaulted by homophobic classmates. The claimant comes from a wealthy and influential family in Ukraine. The claimant\u2019s families (sic) did not accept their gender identity, and tried to masculine \u2014 masculinize the claimant throughout her \u2014 throughout her youth.\n\n[5] In 2016, the claimant tried to run away from her parents to Poland, but was intercepted by the Ukrainian authorities. In 2017, the claimant was sent to China for studies, and to expand her family\u2019s business in an attempt to exert control over the claimant. The claimant\u2019s parents cut off financial support when the claimant tried to mention their gender identity to their parents. In 2020, the claimant attempted to apply for U.N. refugee status in Thailand during the Covid pandemic, but was told it was not possible as they were from Ukraine. In XXXX 2021, the claimant experienced XXXX XXXX and XXXX, as she became more certain of her gender identity as a transgender \u2014 transgendered person. The claimant came to Canada on a CUAET visa from Thailand in XXXX 2022. Since her arrival, the claimant has committed to a transition plan which includes XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX XXXX, which she has since began.\n\n[6] The claimant fears returning to Ukraine and being harmed by her family, or due to the rampant homophobia by general society, or due to the ongoing war in Ukraine due to the Russian invasion that began in late February 2022.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nIdentity\n\n[7] I am satisfied with the identity of the claimant as a citizen of Ukraine, which is established by her testimony, as well as the copy of her passport with a Canadian visa in evidence that has her former name on it.\n\nCredibility\n\n[8] When a claimant swears to the truth of their allegations, this creates a presumption that those allegations are true, unless there is reason to doubt their truthfulness. I find no reason to doubt the truthfulness of the claimant. She testified in a straightforward, forthright, detailed, and candid manner, and there were no material inconsistencies, omissions, or contradictions between the claimant\u2019s testimony and the other evidence in this case. She did not exaggerate or tailor her evidence, and in summary, her testimony was consistent with the other evidence on the central aspects of her claim.\n\n[9] I find the claimant provided ample details to expand upon her allegations, and she also provided evidence in Exhibit 4, which included her internal passport with her previous name, her birth certificate which also had her previous name on it, the XXXX XXXX document, the letter from XXXX organization from Ukraine, medical documents from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (ph) in Canada, medical documents from XXXX XXXX XXXX, letter from her friend XXXX XXXX XXXX (ph), a letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (ph) which is the claimant\u2019s partner, a letter from XXXX XXXX (ph), a letter from XXXX XXXX (ph), and a letter from XXXX XXXX (ph), as well as educational documents, and country condition articles.\n\n[10] I have no reason to doubt the genuineness of these documents, and since these documents relate to the claimant\u2019s relationships and experiences, in both Ukraine and Canada, and the risks she will face if she were to return to Ukraine now, I place significant weight on these documents to support her claim. The claimant also testified that her partner, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, who also identified as a transgender woman, would be available as a witness if need be. The claimant\u2019s partner provided a letter of support, which is found in Exhibit 4. As I found the claimant to be credible, overall, I found it unnecessary to call her partner as a witness. Given the claimant\u2019s careful testimony and supporting documents, I find that she has established on a balance of probabilities, the facts alleged in her claim. Including that the claimant is a transgender woman in a relationship with another transgender woman here in Canada, and that she faced ongoing discrimination amounting to persecution in Ukraine by her family and by society in general. Therefore, I accept the subjective fear she has of returning to Ukraine now, due to her gender identity, as well as the ongoing war in Ukraine.\n\nNexus\n\n[11] To qualify for refugee status under the Refugee Convention, an individual must demonstrate that they have a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. I find that the persecution the claimant faces has a nexus to one (1) of the five (5) Convention grounds. That of membership in a particular social group, as a member of the LGBTQI+ community, and therefore, this claim will be assessed under section 96 of the Act.\n\nWell-founded Fear of Persecution and Risk of Harm\n\n[12] I find the claimant has established a well-founded fear of persecution based on her gender identity. The claimant testified that she experienced threats and attacks \u2014 sorry, threats of violence due to her gender identity while in Ukraine from her family, as well as from society in general. She also witnessed attacks on other people who are part of the LGBTIQ+ community. The objective evidence supports the claimant\u2019s fears of returning to Ukraine.\n\n[13] The US Department of State report at NDP Item 2.1 in the National Documentation Package for Ukraine, indicates that a significant issue in the country are crimes targeting lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, or intersex persons. The report states that \u201cThere was societal violence against LGBTQI+ persons often perpetrated by members of violent radical groups, and authorities often did not adequately investigate these cases or hold perpetrators to account.\u201d This report also describes how events in the LGBTIQ \u2014 sorry, LGBTQI+ community were regularly disrupted by members of violent radical groups, and how the police did not provide adequate protection for these attacks. Furthermore, this report states that \u201cLaw enforcement at times condoned or perpetrated violence against members of the LGBTQI+ community,\u201d and that public figures sometimes made comments condoning violence against this community.\n\n[14] Excerpts from the NDP at Item 6.2 and 6.3 and 6.4 state that, in recent years, there was not a single LGBTQI+ rally in Ukraine that was not a target of attacks by ultrarightist (sic) and conservative organizations. The right to respect of privacy and family life states that, the LGBTQI+ people in Ukraine have no legal means to register marriage or partnership. There are also no legal means to obtain custody, the way heterosexual people can. This further states that LGBTQI+ people often become subject to discrimination, or fired because of their gender identity and sexual orientation. Lesbian, bisexual, and transgender women often become victims of sexual harassment at work, and in Ukraine, homophobic and transphobic hate crimes are not investigated by law enforcement agencies. At best, they are classified as mere hooliganism.\n\n[15] Based on the totality of the evidence before me, I find that the claimant has established a well-founded fear of persecution if she were to return to Ukraine, by reason of the risks she faces due to her gender identity. Given the country conditions, I find the claimant has established a serious forward-looking risk if she were to return now.\n\nState Protection\n\n[16] In all refugee claims, a state is presumed to be capable of protecting its citizens unless there is clear and convincing evidence to the contrary. To rebut this presumption, a claimant must establish on a balance of probabilities through clear and convincing evidence, that their state\u2019s protection is inadequate, and the onus is on the claimant to rebut this presumption.\n\n[17] I have considered whether state protection would be available to the claimant, and I find that there is no adequate state protection available to her in her circumstances. In making that finding, I have considered the country conditions outlined previously, that describe not only a lack of protection and investigation into crimes against the LGBT \u2014 LGBTQI+ community, but also that police are sometimes perpetrators of violence against this community. NDP Item 6.5 states that the provisions of the Criminal Code that should protect from incitement of hostility, discrimination, or violence are woefully inadequate. Rather than being used to protect minorities, their ambiguity allows their abusive application to silence critical voices. This is in clear violation of international standards on freedom of expression and equality, and underscores the importance of wholesale reform.\n\n[18] In light of the country condition evidence regarding the availability of state protection to those who are similarly situated, I find the claimant\u2019s efforts in this regard were reasonable, and that on a balance of probabilities, the state will not afford her adequate protection. As a result, I find the claimant has rebutted the presumption of state protection.\n\n[19] Internal Flight Alternative or IFA\n[20] I have also considered whether the claimant would have a viable internal flight alternative available to her, and I find that she does not. I find there is nowhere in Ukraine where the conditions would significantly \u2014 would be significantly better for her as a transgender woman. The country condition documents support the claimant\u2019s \u2014 support the claimant\u2019s allegations, and suggest that the situation in the urban areas may even be worse for sexual minorities, and I find the claimant would face a serious possibility of persecution throughout Ukraine, and a risk of harm from the right wing nationalist groups, as well as society in general.\n\n[21] In addition, given the ongoing crisis in Ukraine related to the Russian invasion that is affecting the entire country, I find that it would be unreasonable for the claimant in these circumstances to try to seek refuge elsewhere in Ukraine, and this is reflected in the most recent UNHCR report from March 2022 on the returns to Ukraine, found at NDP Item 1.23. That describes the situation in Ukraine as volatile and uncertain, noting hundreds of civilian deaths which have already been reported, and that was as of over a year ago. The UNHCR report calls on states to suspend the return of nationals to the country. As such, I find the claimant does not have a viable internal flight alternative available to her throughout Ukraine.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[22] For the foregoing reasons, I find the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, and I therefore accept her claim. That is it for today. Thank you for sharing your experiences with me.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

Amana\nCountry: Russia\nRPD Number: VC3-03985\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2024-00593\nATIP Pages: N\/A\n\nDECISION\n\n[1] MEMBER: We are now back on the record. So this is the decision of the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada for XXXX XXXX, who is seeking refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n\nALLEGATIONS\n\n[2] The claimant fears persecution, including a risk to his life, if he were to return to Russia because of his opposition to the Russian invasion and his opposition to serving in the Russian military. The claimant also fears persecution because he will be perceived as being pro-Russian due to his Russian background if he were to return to Ukraine. The claimant is from Moscow, Russia. The claimant\u2019s parents were both born in the territory that is now Ukraine. The claimants parents live in Russia currently. The claimants father has Russian citizenship and the claimant\u2019s mother has Ukrainian and Russian citizenship. On XXXX XXXX, 2021, the claimant came to Canada for school and to pursue his XXXX ambitions. On February 24th, 2022, Russia began the full scale invasion of Ukraine. The claimant and his family have opposed the Russian invasion. The claimant did make a posting in support of Ukraine online on his XXXX page, and that has since been removed because of fears of what they would do to his parents. Since being in Canada, the claimant has received a summons from the Russian military to attend an enlistment office for a medical exam. In November 2022, the claimant applied for refugee protection.\n\nDETERMINATION\n\n[3] I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nIdentity\n\n[4] The claimant\u2019s identity as a citizen of Russia has been established on a balance of probabilities by his testimony, the designated representative\u2019s testimony, and his Russian passport, which is located at Exhibit 1. I also find that Ukraine is a country of reference for the claimant. With respect to the nationality of children whose parents are Ukrainian, according to Article 14 of the citizenship laws of Ukraine, which are found in Item 3.2 of the National Documentation Package for Ukraine, which is found at Exhibit 3.2, it states that, \u201cA child who is a foreigner and one (1) of whose parents is a citizen of Ukraine and the other is a foreigner shall be registered as a citizen of Ukraine upon application of the parent being a citizen of Ukraine.\u201d This is the claimant\u2019s situation, as his mother is a Ukrainian citizen and his father\u2019 is a Russian citizen. As such, it appears that the claimant has access to citizenship in Ukraine through his mother.\n\n[5] The next question is whether the acquisition of another citizenship is within the claimant\u2019s control, where only mere formalities are required such as the completion of paperwork. That appears to be the case here for the claimant. While a report on citizenship at Item 3.8 states that administrative obstacles can delay or prevent people from exercising their right to citizenship, and the report lists the main obstacles, none of those obstacles apply to the claimant\u2019s situation. The claimant and the designated representative testified that they were not aware about the process for obtaining Ukrainian citizenship. I note that there is no evidence to indicate that the claimant\u2019s acquisition of Ukrainian citizenship would require more than the completion of paperwork. As such, I find that both Russia and Ukraine are countries of reference for the claimant, and he needs to establish his claim against both countries.\n\nNexus\n\n[6] The claimant opposes the Russian invasion and in part fears persecution in Russia because of his political opinion. The claimant also fears that he will be perceived as pro-Russian in Ukraine due to his Russian background. For both countries of reference then, these allegations form a nexus to a Convention ground for the claimant based on his political opinion, both actual and imputed. The claimant further fears persecution due to his opposition to conscription in Russia and also being forced into the war in Ukraine.\n\nCredibility\n\n[7] I find that the claimant and the designated representative were both credible witnesses. In making these findings, I am relying on the principle that a claimant who affirms to tell the truth creates a presumption of truthfulness unless there are reasons to doubt their truthfulness. In this regard, the claimant, who was 17, testified in a straightforward manner and was able to answer questions directly. The claimant testified about how he was born in Moscow and moved to Ukraine to live for two (2) years. He returned to Moscow and lived there until he came to Canada in XXXX 2021. The claimant only once returned to Moscow, which was in the XXXX of 2021. The claimant testified about his fears of being forced to serve in the Russian armed forces and that he had already received a letter summoning him for a medical exam for the army. The claimant testified about his opposition to the invasion of Ukraine, how he has family members in Ukraine and how he views it as his homeland. The claimant also testified about how he is unable to express his opposition to the invasion, as those who oppose the war are being jailed in Russia. The claimant testified that even while he is here in Canada, he fears speaking out about the conflict because of the risks that his parents might face in Russia.\n\n[8] With respect to Ukraine, the claimant testified about his concerns if he were to return to the country due to his Russian background and how he\u2019d be perceived as being pro-Russian. The claimant\u2019s designated representative expanded on the claimant\u2019s risks in Ukraine, noting that Ukraine is also sending conscripts to the war. The designated representative confirmed the testimony of the claimant and also testified about how there would be no safe location in either country for the claimant to return to. The claimant provided documents to support his claim, which are found in Exhibit 4. These documents include a Russian military service call up letter requiring the claimant to report to a military office in Moscow. The reverse of the letter indicates that a citizen who fails to appear without good reason is liable under the laws of the Russian Federation. The letter provides lists of good reasons, and those include disease or injury, or if a family members in grave health or other circumstances beyond the control of the citizen, none of which appear to apply to the claimant. I have no reason to doubt the genuineness of this document, and I give it significant weight to support his claim.\n\n[9] Given the credible testimony of the claimant and his designated representative, along with the supporting documentation, I find on a balance of probabilities that the claimant has established the facts alleged in his claim, including that the claimant opposes the Russian invasion of Ukraine and also serving in the Russian military. I also make no negative credibility findings due to the delay in applying for refugee protection. The claimant had a student visa in Canada, and the representative explained that when the claimant\u2019s mother heard that conscripts were being sent to Ukraine, the family made the decision for the claimant to apply for refugee protection. I also note this is a sur place claim, as the country conditions had changed significantly after the claimant came to Canada. As such, I accept the explanation for the delay, especially given the stars the claimant had in Canada at the time. As the claimant is a citizen of both Russia and Ukraine, he must establish his claim against each of these countries.\n\nWell-Founded Fear \u2013 Russia\n\n[10] The country condition documents for Russia in the National Documentation Package, which are found in Exhibit 3.1, support the claimant\u2019s fears for returning to Russia. The US Department of State report at Item 2.1 describes Russia as an authoritarian and political system dominated by President Vladimir Putin, and indicates numerous significant human rights issues in the country, including extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances by or on behalf of government authorities, pervasive torture by government law enforcement officers that sometimes result in death, harsh and life-threatening conditions in prisons, arbitrary arrest and detention, political and religious prisoners and detainees, politically motivated reprisals against individuals located outside the country, severe arbitrary interference with privacy, severe suppression of freedom of expression and media, including violence against journalists and the use of anti-extremism and other laws to prosecute peaceful dissent, severe restrictions on internet freedom, severe suppression of the freedom of peaceful assembly, and severe suppression of freedom of association. The report also states that the government failed to take adequate steps to identify, investigate, prosecute or punish most officials who committed abuses and engaged in corruption, resulting in a claimant of impunity.\n\n[11] With respect to the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the report indicates that Russian armed forces have committed numerous war crimes and other atrocities and abuses, including executions, torture, rape, indiscriminate attacks and attacks that have deliberately targeted civilians and civilian infrastructure which constitute war crimes. The report further notes that authorities have conducted politically motivated arrests, detentions, trials, and torture of Ukrainian citizens in Russia. Oppression of opposition to the invasion of Ukraine is also reflected in the 2023 Freedom House report found at Item 2.5, that describes how excessive use of force, routine arrests, and harsh fines and prison sentences have discouraged unsanctioned protests in the country and how the pervasive, hyperpatriotic propaganda and political repression that has increased since Russian forces invaded Ukraine have prevented individuals from being able to freely express their political views. The report also notes how excessive use of force by police is widespread.\n\n[12] A 2022 Human Rights Watch report at Item 2.18 focuses on the treatment of protesters to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The report describes it as a brutal crackdown on those who disagree with the military offensive in Ukraine, and how thousands of peaceful protesters have been arrested and face excessive use of force by the police. With respect to the claimant\u2019s fears of being forced into the Russian army, an EU report at Item 8.4 on the treatment of military deserters since February 2022 invasion of Ukraine describes how military conscription is for male citizens between 18 and 27 and they are subject to military service, and evading conscription is punishable by fines and imprisonment. I note that the claimant is 17 years old and has received a call up letter for his medical. The EU report also describes how it has been very difficult to obtain information on how Russia is currently treating those who are evading military service, in part due to censorship laws that went into effect on March 4th, 2022. Some media reports indicate that those who refused to sign contracts with the Russian armed forces are threatened with being found to be a deserter. The report also describes media reports for captured Russian soldiers who have spoken about the use of execution squads for deserters. Based on the totality of the evidence, I find the claimant has established a well-founded fear of persecution in Russia due to his political opinion and opposition to the Russian invasion and his opposition to participating in the Russian armed forces.\n\n[13] I further find that given all the risks facing the claimant, including the persecution of opponents to the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the claimant\u2019s call up to the Russian military, that the claimant faces a serious forward-facing possibility of persecution if he were to return to Russia.\n\nWell-Founded Fear \u2013 Ukraine\n\n[14] The country Condition documents for Ukraine in the National Documentation Package found in Exhibit 3.2 also support the claimant\u2019s fears of returning to that country. As noted previously, the country condition documents indicate that Russia has committed significant war crimes against civilians in Ukraine. This is reflected in other parts of the National Documentation Package, including a UN report from March 2023 at Item 1.24 that states that Russian authorities have committed a wide range of violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law in many regions of Ukraine. As for the claimant\u2019s fears of being perceived as pro-Russian, in April 2022, Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe report at Item 1.27 indicates that there are a large number of reports of mistreatment, acts of torture or inhumane and degrading treatment of people viewed as pro-Russian supporters carried out by the police, territorial defence forces, and civilians in Ukraine-controlled parts of the country.\n\n[15] The report indicates that those people perceived as being pro-Russian have been physically assaulted and some have faced detention. For those detained, family members have reported that they have not been advised of where their relatives are being detained or their fate. With respect to detention in Ukraine, the US Department of State report at Item 2.1 lists a number of significant human rights issues, and those include cruel and inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment of detainees by law enforcement personnel, harsh and life-threatening prison conditions, arbitrary arrests or detention, as well as serious problems with the independence of the judiciary. Based on the totality of evidence, I find the claimant has established a well-founded fear of persecution in Ukraine due to his imputed political opinion as a perceived pro-Russian supporter due to his Russian background. I further find that, given all the risks facing the claimant, including the documented targeting of pro-Russian supporters by the territorial forces and the ongoing Russian invasion, that the claimant would face a serious forward-facing possibility of persecution if he were to return to Ukraine.\n\nState Protection and Internal Flight Alternative \u2013 Russia\n\n[16] As for Russia, given the state is the agent of harm, I find that there is no state protection available to the claimant in the country. Further, given the Russian state\u2019s capacity, I find that the claimant would face a serious possibility of persecution throughout Russia. Accordingly, I find that there is no internal flight alternative available to the claimant in the country.\n\nState Protection and Internal Flight Alternative \u2013 Ukraine\n\n[17] I have also considered whether adequate state protection is available for the claimant in Ukraine, and I find that there is none given the claimant faces a risk from state actors and the Ukrainian territorial forces as well as from the invading Russian army. I also considered whether the claimant would have a viable internal flight alternative available to him in Ukraine, and I find that he does not. I find that the ongoing crisis in Ukraine related to the Russian invasion is affecting the entire country, and it would be unreasonable for the claimant in these circumstances to try and seek refuge elsewhere in Ukraine. This is reflected in the March 2022 UNHCR report on returns to Ukraine found in Item 1.23 that describes the situation in Ukraine as volatile and uncertain. The report states that, \u201cIn view of the volatility of the situation in the entire territory of Ukraine, UNHCR does not consider it appropriate to deny international protection to Ukrainians and former habitual residents of Ukraine on the basis of internal flight or relocation alternative.\u201d As such, I find the claimant does not have a viable internal flight alternative available to him in Ukraine.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[18] For the reasons above, I determine that the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the Act, and therefore the Board accepts his claim. Given I am granting protection under section 96 of the Act, I do not find it necessary to consider the claim under section 97.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

The claimant is a 40-year-old male who holds dual citizenship in Russia and Tajikistan. He alleges that he fears persecution at the hands of Russian authorities due to his political opinion on the war in Ukraine, his refusal to be conscripted to participate in the war, and his participation in protests against the war in Ukraine while in Canada. He does not support Russia in its war against Ukraine because Russia is killing innocent civilians and raping women. He stated that the Russian military came to his father\u2019s house in Russia, where he had previously stayed, to ask for him but his father stated that he does not know where he was. He also stated during his oral testimony that some notices to appear were left for him at his workplace to report for military service, but he tore the notices and refused to appear because he does not support the war in Russia.\n\n[3] The claimant stated that he does not support the war in Russia because he believes the war is not just unjustified, but that Russia is also killing civilians and committing other atrocities against civilians in Ukraine. The claimant further alleges that Russians from Tajikistan are overly targeted in the conscription exercise of the Russian authorities at the beginning of the war, but now, everybody is a target. The claimant also alleges that he will not be able to practice Islam should he return to Tajikistan, as he will be labelled an extremist. He stated that he will not be allowed to preach Islam\u2019s orders and he would be required to trim his beard if he goes out in Tajikistan.\n\n[4] The claimant came to Canada through the US in XXXX 2022. Since coming to Canada, he has participated in protests against the war in Russia \u2014 the war in Ukraine. I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee as he has established a serious possibility of persecution in Russia and Tajikistan for the reasons contained below.\n\n[5] On identity. I find that the claimant\u2019s identity as a national of Russia and Tajikistan is established on a balance of probabilities by his Russian and Tajikistan passports submitted to the Board.\n\nNexus\n\n[6] For a claimant to be considered a Convention refugee, the well-founded fear of persecution must be by reason of one (1) or more of the five (5) grounds, race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group, or political opinion. The persecution that the claimant alleges \u2014 that the claimant allegedly faces in Russia has only as a nexus to a Convention ground, that is political opinion. The persecution the claimant allegedly faces in Tajikistan has a nexus to the Convention ground of religion. Therefore, his claim is being assessed under section 96 of the IRPA and not under section 97.\n\nAllegation of Persecution in Russia\n\n[7] On credibility, the Board presumes claimants are telling the truth unless there is a valid reason to doubt it. However, this presumption does not apply to inferences speculations. I note that the claimant did not include some information he related in his oral testimony in the Basis of Claim form. In particular, I note that the information about the military dropping notices to appear at his workplace was not included in his Basis of Claim. The claimant stated that he is only providing more details in his oral testimony as against the brief summary provided when he made his claim.\n\n[8] He stated that when he made his claim, he just came to Canada, had to use an interpreter, and all the stress impacted on his ability to provide further details. I do not accept the explanation of the claimant in this regard. I find that the claimant in this case has had opportunity to update his Basis of Claim form and he provided disclosures to the Board after submitting the Basis of Claim form. I find that the non-inclusion of the information does impact negatively on his credibility. I do not accept the allegation that notices were dropped at the claimant\u2019s workplace in respect of the conscription for military service. However, I do not find that the non-provision of the information in his BOC goes to the root of his claim, considering other evidence provided by the claimant. Based on the presumption of truthfulness, I accept on a balance of probabilities that the claimant fled for Russia in order not to be conscripted to military service in the war in Ukraine, because he believes Ukraine is indiscriminate \u2014 because he believes that Russia is indiscriminately killing civilians in Ukraine and committing war crimes.\n\n[9] I also accept that the claimant participated in protests against the war in Ukraine while in Canada, and that he has been labelled a traitor by his former friend due to the fact that the claimant fled Russia to Canada. I accept that the claimant will not continue to express his opposition to the war in Ukraine if he is removed to Russia, not because he does not want to express his political opinion, but because Russian authorities crack down on protesters and forcefully send them to the warfront.\n\n[10] Apart from his testimony, the claimant also provided corroborating documentary evidence in support of his claim. He provided a chat conversation with a friend who now refer to him as a traitor because he left Russia for Canada rather than fight in the war. He also provided pictures of himself taken in Canada, showing him holding the flag of Ukraine along with other people. The claimant further provided pictures of himself praying in a mosque in Canada and of a plaque he received recognizing his participation in the Islamic community in Canada. I have no reason to doubt the genuineness of these documents, and I accept them as genuine. I thus place full weight on these documents.\n\nFailure to Claim in the US\n\n[11] The claimant entered the US in XXXX 2022 before coming to Canada. And he stated that he told the refugee officials at the US that he would be asking for refugee protection. He stated that he did not stay in the US because his intention was to come to Canada. He says that he does not want to live in the US because of the level of crimes and the fact that people walk with guns, and it is not peaceful \u2014 it is not as peaceful in the US as it is in Canada. I note the claimant entered Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2023. I accept the claimant\u2019s explanation as reasonable. I thus do not to make any negative credibility finding in this regard.\n\nCONCLUSION and Credibility\n\n[12] Based on the claimant\u2019s testimony and the documentary evidence mentioned above, I accept the allegation that the claimant has a subjective fear of persecution. I accept, rather, that the claimant has a subjective fear of persecution in Russia because of his political opinion.\n\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution\n\n[13] To establish his status as a Convention refugee, the claimant has to show that there was a serious possibility that he will be persecuted if he moved to Russia. I find that the evidence presented in support of his allegations establishes a serious possibility of persecution for the claimants if he is forced to return to Russia. My reasons are as follows.\n\n[14] The National Documentation Package at Tab 12.3 shows that political opinion against the authorities is dealt by Kremlin with an iron hand which is against international law. Tab 12.3 states that decades after Boris Yeltsin freed the last of Soviet-Arab political prisoners. The widespread detention of activists, regime opponents, and disfavoured minorities is once again being practiced under the leadership of President Vladimir Putin, since he first became president in 2000 and especially his formal return to the Kremlin in 2012. The Kremlin has engaged in a wide region crackdown on civil society, political opponents, critical voices, unpopular minorities, and anyone else it views unfavourable or as a threat.\n\n[15] The reports at Tab 12.3 goes on to state that this persecution is only increasing. In its February 2015 lists, Memorial Human Rights Centre, one (1) of Russia\u2019s oldest and largest human rights organizations, identified 46 political prisoners in the country. As of March 2019, however, its lists contained 236 individuals, including many in Russia-occupied Crimea. These numbers, however, reflect only cases that have been carefully reviewed and vetted, and thus conform to a rigorous definition of political prisoner. The true number is undoubtedly much higher. The same report continues to states, \u201csome of these prisoners have been accused of crimes they simply did not commit \u2013 murder, sexual abuse, espionage, treason, or possession of drugs or weapons. The majority, however, are charged for engaging in activities that are clearly protected under international law. These latter cases are enabled by an ever-increasing array of law, specifically designed to criminalize acts of everyday life and, therefore, allow the authorities to arrest, detain, and imprison anyone they want.\u201d\n\n[16] A report by Human Rights Watch at Tab 2.18 of the NDP shows that Russia brutally cracks down on anti-war protesters, arresting them and subjecting them to torture and inhuman and degrading treatment. The claimant in this case not only holds a political opinion against Russia on the war in Ukraine, but he has also participated in protests against the war while in Canada. This, coupled with the knowledge of his flight to Canada and the (inaudible) given to him by his friends, heightens his fear of persecution if he returns to Canada (sic).\n\n[17] The objective evidence establishes that political opinion against the government in Russia, whether real or imputed, is seen as dissent and punished. It also establishes that anyone trying to evade the mandatory military call up is then criminally tried. The objective evidence at Tab 8.2 further shows that punishment for evading criminal service in Russia is deprivation of liberty for up to 10 years. The objective evidence before me also shows that ethnic minorities in Russia, such as Russians from Tajikistan, are more likely to be mobilized for military service in the war. The claimant, who is 40 years of age, never served in the military, in the Russian military, and as such is a good candidate to become conscripted into military service. In this case, the claimant is not a conscientious objector to military service as its objection is not a global objection to war, but to the unprovoked killing of civilians and other atrocities being committed by Russia in the war in Ukraine. It is on these ethical grounds that the objection of the claimant of the war is based.\n\n[18] The view that the \u2014 view of the claimant is that Russia is committing war crimes in Ukraine by the indiscriminate murder and raping of women. It is also noted in the documentary evidence before me, particularly in the news release by Global Affairs Canada submitted by the claimant. The same documents also stated that \u2014 stated the view that Russia has committed war crimes in Ukraine.\n\n[19] Excuse me. I say that again.\n\n[20] The same document also stated that the view that Russia has committed war crimes in Ukraine was confirmed in September 2022 by the United Nations Human Rights Council Commission of Inquiry. I find that the reasons raised by the claimant in objecting to military service in the war between Russia and on Ukraine is based on ethical considerations for which a person who objects to military service may be offered protection. As highlighted in Lebedev v. Canada 2007 FC728. Therefore, based on all the evidence before me, I find that the claimant will face a serious possibility of persecution if he is forced to return to Russia. I find that the claimant\u2019s fear are indeed well-founded.\n\n[21] On state protection. I find that it will be objectively unreasonable for the claimant to seek the protection of the state in light of his particular circumstances. States are presumed to be capable of protecting their citizens, except in situations where the state is in complete breakdown. In this case, the claimant cannot be expected to seek the protection of the state since the government of Russia is the agent of harm. The authorities in Russia are in control of the entire territory of the country. And the treatment for anyone indulging in political dissent and refusing conscription service is the same throughout Russia. Therefore, I find that the presumption of state protection has been rebutted. And based on country condition documents, there is no state protection for the claimant in this country.\n\nInternal Flight Alternative\n\n[22] I have also considered whether there is a viable internal flight alternative for the claimant. Using the two (2) prong test developed by the Federal Courts of Appeal in Rasaratnam v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), 1992 1FC 706, which requires the RPD to consider on a balance of probabilities whether one (1), there is no serious possibility the claimant will be prosecuted or subjected to personal risk \u2014 subjected personally to a risk of section 97(1) harm in the proposed IFA, and two (2), whether the conditions in the proposed IFA are such that it will not be unreasonable in all the circumstances, including those particular to the claimant, for him to seek refugee there \u2014 to seek refuge there, rather.\n\n[23] On the evidence before me, I find that there is a serious possibility of persecution for the claimant throughout Russia. There are no parts of the country where he will not face a serious possibility of persecution as the authorities in Russia are in control of the entire territory of the country. Therefore, for reasons similar to those in relation to state protection, I am satisfied that the claimant does not have a viable internal flight alternative in Russia.\n\nAllegation of Persecution in Tajikistan\n\nCredibility\n\n[24] I find the claimant credible in respect of his claim in regards to the acts of discrimination he will face should he return to Tajikistan. The claimant testified in a straightforward manner and submitted documents depicting his practice of Islam. I have no reason not to believe his evidence. In particular, I find that the claimant is a Muslim who goes to the mosque, pray, and associates with other Muslims. I also accepts that the claimant believes that sharing his belief about Islam is an important aspect of his practice of Islam. I accept the allegation that he has been warned about preaching to people in Tajikistan. And as it stands, the risk of being arrested for not trimming his beard in Tajikistan.\n\n[25] On well-founded fear of persecution. Based on the evidence before me, I find that the claimant has a well-founded fear of persecution on the basis of his religion as a Muslim in Tajikistan. I find that the act of discrimination rises to the level of persecution warranting protection. The claimant detailed in his narrative how he was introduced to Islam, his belief that the proper practice of Islam is tied to receiving God\u2019s blessings and how (inaudible) to preach to other \u2014 to others in Tajikistan about Islam. He also stated that he was threatened with jail time by the police and was warned about his frequent activities in Tajikistan in XXXX 2020 and narrated how this prompted him to return to Russia.\n\n[26] In his oral testimony, he stated that that the government has restricted the attendance at mosques to the age of 40, whereas the proper practice of Islam requires teaching children about Islam from the time they are born. He also stated that the government will not allow people to grow their beards in Tajikistan. The essence of the claimant\u2019s allegation against Tajikistan is that the discrimination he faces on his religious practice are persecutory. A significant part of this aspect of his claim relates to his inability to preach about Islam to others. The claimant believes that preaching to others is an integral part of his religion, which has brought blessings to him personally.\n\nNature of the Legal Regime Regarding the Practice of Islam in Tajikistan\n\n[27] The claimant states that he does not wish to return to Tajikistan because the government there has created a legal regime that suppresses the practice of Islam and the expression of one\u2019s faith publicly. While the overwhelming majority of those in Tajikistan are Muslim, the evidence on file is that Tajikistan\u2019s government, has strongly \u2014 sorry \u2014 has strongly authoritarian impulses and that it has taken steps to maintain total control of Muslim activity in the country. On this, I refer to the National Documentation Package for Tajikistan at Tab 12.3.\n\n[28] The government of Tajikistan is not democratic. It generally restricts freedom of expression and security forces commit torture and abuse detainees with impunity. The specific steps that the government as taken to restrict the practice of Islam includes people \u2014 one (1), people must leave the mosque after prayer and only state-dictated summons are allowed to be read by state-appointed imams in state-permitted mosques. I refer to Tab 12.3 of the National Documentation Package for Tajikistan. Tab 12.3 also shows that restriction on religious education without state\u2019s permission, including punishing offenders in this regard, is practiced in Tajikistan producing, distributing, and exporting items of a religious nature or religious literature which has not been censored by the government is banned. Punishments for disobedience includes fines and seizures of equipments used in contravening the law.\n\n[29] Another step used to restrict the practice of Islam includes the ban on the wearing of hijabs and \u2014 excuse me. Another step is that the president has pronounced citizens should stop wearing a hijab and beards. Every society has limits towards its regards as acceptable behaviour. But in some countries, the norms of the society may be so constraining that they interferes with the exercise of human rights. Where these restrictions are entrenched in law and backed up by coercive action and penalties, the claimant who transgresses the conventions of their own land and perhaps at the same time, violating the law may be at risk of serious harm. The refugee system protects those in such situations who have a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason. In this respect, persecution is the sustained or systemic failure of state protection in relation to one (1) of the core entitlements which have been recognized by the international community. I referred to the case of Canada Attorney General v. Ward, 1993 2SCR 689.\n\n[30] The Board\u2019s legal resource on such claims states that when dealing with the norms of other societies, the Refugee Protection Division should bear in mind that \u201can application of the Convention refugee definition involves measuring the claimant\u2019s situation and any actions visited on the claimants against human rights standards which are international. It is not appropriate to simply refer to the notions of propriety favoured by the majority or the rulers in the claimant\u2019s own land.\u201d The central documents describing the rights to religious freedom as international law is the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights. Article 18 of the Covenants states that religious freedom includes the freedom not only to all religious beliefs and values, but also to manifest them. It states \u201ceveryone shall have the right to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion. The right (inaudible) include freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief of his choice and freedom, either individually or in community with others and in public or private.\u201d So, manifest his religion or believe in worship, observance, practice, and teaching.\n\n[31] I refer to the UN General Assembly document on International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, dated 16th December 1966. While inability to practice religion is often enforced or accompanied by other types of serious harm, the deprivation of religious freedom is serious and (inaudible). On this I refer to the book, the Law of Refugee Status, published by Cambridge University Press and authored by Utawaji Foster (ph) in 2014.\n\n[32] As the US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit stated, if a person is forbidden to practice his religion, the fact that he is not imprisoned, tortured, or banished, and is even allowed to attend school does not mean that he is not a victim of persecution. I referred to the case of Bokolades (ph), Seventh Circuit of the US Court of Appeal at 1997 at page 405. Restrictions on the public display of religion have been considered by the Federal Courts. The Immigration and Refugee Board has a legal resource on its website, which summarizes the Canadian law regarding refugee claims involving religious wars. The resource provides a summary of the Federal Court\u2019s decisions regarding when such restrictions shall be considered persecutory and when the merely discriminatory instruments, where the (inaudible) cost does not rise to the level of persecution. I have relied on this resource in formulating this reason.\n\n[33] Turning to the case law. Fosu v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), 1994 90 FCR 182 (ph) dealt with the well-founded fear of persecution of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses in Ghana, which had prohibited religious services and proselytizing. The case stands for the proposition that freedom of religion includes the freedom to \u201cdemonstrate one\u2019s religion or belief in public, or in private by teaching practice, worship, and the performance of rights. It seems that the persecution of the practice of religion can take various forms, such as prohibiting \u2014 prohibition on worshipping in public or in private, giving or receiving religious instruction, or the implementation of serious discriminatory policies against persons on account of their practice of religion\u201d.\n\n[34] In Kaya v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2004 FC 445 (sic), that case considered that proposition in the context of T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s restrictions on wearing hijab in government institutions. It is held that a policy of secularism, supported by a ban on religious dress of any sort being worn in government buildings did not constitute, particularly (inaudible) in the circumstances. The courts in Kaya distinguished Fosu on the facts, finding that Mrs. Kaya was entitled to practice a religion in public in T\u00fcrkiye and to wear her hijab in public. I find that the situation of this claimant in Tajikistan is more akin to this situation in Fosu and less like the situation in Kaya. This is because, unlike the more limited restrictions on wearing hijab in T\u00fcrkiye, the restrictions in Tajikistan amounts to a blanket prohibition of sharing its religious beliefs with others in all public places. This restriction amounts to a limitation on the claimant\u2019s rights. So, manifests is a religion or belief in practice, which infringe upon the claimant\u2019s rights in Article 18 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\n\n[35] There are sceptical limits to Article 18 rights. Article 18(3) three of the Covenant specifies that \u201cthe freedom to manifest one\u2019s religion or beliefs may be subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by law and are necessary to protect public safety or the health or morals or the fundamental rights and freedoms of others\u201d. Indeed, the government of Tajikistan justifies its restrictions on the practice of Islam as necessary to combat \u201cextremism\u201d and to respond to the group of ISIS and as a part of the war on terrorism, noting the security concerns that originates from (inaudible) Afghanistan. On this point, I refer to the reports of the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression on its mission to Tajikistan. The commentary from the UN Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the rights of freedom of opinion and expression have generally concluded that such restrictions on expression are not justifiable limitations on freedom of religion pursuant to Article 18(3).\n\n[36] For example, the aforementioned UN Special Rapporteur conducted a mission to Tajikistan. The resultant reports included the following conclusion. \u201cThe Special Rapporteur is deeply concerned by the allegations on the undue interference of government authorities in manifestation of religious expression and education. The Special Rapporteur is particularly disturbed by the allegations on the repression against individuals based on their (inaudible) adherence to certain religious groups\u201d. The reports dismiss Tajikistan government\u2019s attempted justification for these religious restrictions when calling upon the governments of Tajikistan \u201cto recognize both in law and practice the expression of religious freedom as an individual rights, subject only to those restrictions that are permitted under international human rights law\u201d.\n\n[37] In sum, I conclude that the Tajikistan government is not respecting such rights and that it is restricting, and that these restrictions are not permissible once under the Covenant.\n\nEffects of Legal Regime on Religious Restriction on the Claimant\n\n[38] The restrictions on the claimant\u2019s religious freedom have had a profound effect on him. In fact, the claimant testified that preaching and talking to others about Islam is so important as part of his religious practice that he chose to leave Tajikistan for Russia rather than leave without the ability to preach Islam. During the hearing \u2014 excuse me, please.\n\n[39] When assessing whether there is an objective basis which supports the claimant, I have concluded that Tajikistan in fact has significant restrictions on the practice of Islam. I have concluded that these restrictions violates the claimant\u2019s religious freedom as guaranteed in international human rights instruments. Finally, I have concluded that these restrictions on the claimant\u2019s religious practice are of particular importance to the claimant and that the effect of the restrictions on the claimant of a sufficiently serious character so as to constitute persecution. The consequences of having to hide, change, or renounce his religious practice will significantly interfere with his dignity and security of his person. As such, I find that the claimant has a well-founded fear of persecution in Tajikistan.\n\nState Protection in Tajikistan\n\n[40] I find that it would be objectively unreasonable for the claimant to seek protection of the state in light of his particular circumstances. As stated previously, states are presumed to be capable of protecting their citizens, except in situations where the state is in full, complete breakdown. In this case, the claimant cannot be expected to seek the protection of the authorities in Tajikistan, as the government is the agent of harm. The authorities in Tajikistan are in control of the entire territory of the country, and the treatment for anyone indulging in banned or restricted religious activities is the same throughout the country. Therefore, I find that the presumption of state protection has been rebutted. And based on country condition documents, there is no state protection for the claimant in Tajikistan.\n\nInternal Flight Alternative\n\n[41] I have also considered whether a viable internal flight alternative exist for the claimant. Using the same two (2) prong test in Rasaratnam v. Canada, which requires the RPD to consider only balance of probabilities whether one (1), there is a serious possibility the claimant will be persecuted or subjected to \u2014 or subjected personally to a risk of section 97 harm in the proposed IFA, and two (2), the conditions in the proposed IFA are such that it will not be unreasonable in all the circumstances, including those particular to the claimant\u2019s, for him to seek refuge there. On the evidence before me, I find that there is a serious possibility of persecution for him throughout Tajikistan. There are no parts of the country where he will not face a serious possibility of persecution, as the authorities in Tajikistan are in control of the entire territory of the country. Therefore, for reasons similar to those in relation to that of civil protection, I am satisfied that the claimant does not have a viable internal flight alternative in Tajikistan.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[42] Based on the above analysis, I conclude that the claimant is a Convention refugee as per section 97 of the IRPA. Accordingly, I accept his claim.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

The claimant also fears persecution at the hands of his ex-girlfriend\u2019s family due to their relationship.\n[3] The claimant is a 21-year-old Kurdish man who practices Alevi faith. He commenced a romantic relationship with XXXX, a girl from his area, whose family practices Sunni Islam. When XXXX\u2019s family found out of their relationship through her pregnancy, they attacked his house on XXXX XXXX, 2023 and threatened to kill the claimant, who was not at home at that time. The claimant managed to hide in another city and left T\u00fcrkiye on XXXX XXXX, 2023. He reached the United States (US) on XXXX XXXX, 2023, transiting through Mexico. After being detained in a camp in the US and furnishing a bind for his release, the claimant got out of detention on XXXX XXXX, 2023. He entered Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2023, and filed for refugee protection. The claimant fears for his life as there are warrants out for his arrest for evading conscription and on charges filed by XXXX\u2019s family for impregnating her out of wedlock.\n\nDETERMINATION\n\n[4] I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee as he has established a serious possibility of persecution for the following reasons.\n\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n\n[5] The claimant\u2019s identity as a national of T\u00fcrkiye is established, on a balance of probabilities, based on a certified copy of his Turkish passport on file.[3]\n\nNexus\n\n[6] For a claimant to be considered a Convention refugee, the well-founded fear of persecution must be by reason of one or more of the five grounds: race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion. The persecution that the claimant fears in this case is due to his faith as an Alevi, because he is a Kurd, and due to his conscientious objection to conscription. I find that he has established nexuses to three Convention grounds \u2013 ethnicity, religion, and political opinion. As such, his claim is being assessed under section 96 of IRPA and not under section 97.\n\nCredibility\n\n[7] The claimant testified in a straightforward manner and there were no inconsistencies in his testimony or contradictions between his testimony and the other evidence before me. He did not attempt to embellish his testimony at any time during the hearing.\n[8] The claimant has provided corroborative documentary evidence[4] in support of his claim, including evidence of his Alevi faith and Kurdish ethnicity, photographs of his father being assaulted by XXXX\u2019s family, two warrants of arrest against the claimant, and his photographs with XXXX, which are consistent with his allegations. I have no reason to doubt the genuineness of these documents and accept them as genuine.\n[9] Therefore, on a balance of probabilities, I find the claimant to be a credible witness and accept his allegations to be true, including his subjective fear of returning to T\u00fcrkiye.\n\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution and Risk of Harm\n\n[10] In order for me to find that the claimant is a Convention refugee, I must find that the objective evidence supports his subjective fears, and that there was a serious possibility that he would be persecuted if removed to T\u00fcrkiye. I find that the objective evidence supports his subjective fears and establishes a serious possibility of persecution for the claimant if he is forced to return to his country. My reasons are as follows.\n[11] On the issue of treatment of Alevis by state authorities, objective evidence states that:\nA report by the International Association for Human Rights Advocacy in Geneva (IAHRAG), an organization that aims to \u201cassist, support, guide and sustain victims of human rights violations,\u201d including in Turkey, states that it is \u201cquite common\u201d for individuals in the executive branch to use hate speech toward minorities, including Alevis (IAHRAG May 2021, 3, 4). CSW notes that \u201c[t]he promotion of ultra-nationalism has contributed to a rise in discrimination and in hate speech that encourages violence towards non-Sunni religious communities\u201d which occurs in \u201ceducation, the workplace and religious practice, to day-to-day administrative procedures\u201d (CSW 1 May 2020).[5]\n[12] The Response to Information Request (RIR) on the treatment of Kurds in T\u00fcrkiye, including supporters of the HDP, states that:\nA representative of a confederation of Turkish trade unions, cited in a UK Home Office report, stated that the situation in the areas of south-eastern and eastern Turkey, which are mainly populated by Kurds, can be \u201c\u2018harder\u2019,\u201d with \u201c\u2018problematic'\u201d economic and social issues (UK Oct. 2019, 24). The same representative further stated that the Kurdish regions are less developed than western Turkey and that Kurds in this area suffered \u201cserious forms of human rights violations\u201d by the Turkish government, which has prompted westward Kurdish migration (UK Oct. 2019, 95).[6]\n[13] On the issue of draft evasion, objective evidence states that:\nThe 2019 annual report of the European Bureau for Conscientious Objection (EBCO), \u201can umbrella organisation for national associations of conscientious objectors\u201d (EBCO n.d.), states that \u201cconscientious objectors fac[e] ongoing arrest warrants; a life-long cycle of prosecutions and imprisonment, and a situation of \u2018civil death\u2019 which excludes them from social, cultural and economic life\u201d (EBCO 14 Feb. 2020, 20) The same source further reports that [o]bjectors are still criminalised as call-up\/draft evaders. An unlimited arrest warrant is issued and due to this arrest warrant, they are detained on any occasion when they have to present their ID to the police or gendarmerie, a situation which frequently occurs. On the first detention, the objector is given an administrative fine. But every subsequent detention opens a new criminal case, which can lead to a prison sentence of anything from 2 months to 3 years. To avoid arrest and detention, objectors are forced to live an underground life. In the event that the government declares a military mobilization, conscientious objectors risk being charged with desertion, which is subject to the death penalty under Article 63 of the Military Criminal Code. (EBCO 14 Feb. 2020).[7]\n[14] The objective evidence discussed above establishes that Alevite Kurds are targeted by the Turkish authorities. Such individuals, as the claimant in this case who evade military draft, are fined, and then persecuted to such an extent that they must live in hiding all their lives. This escalates to a death penalty if the government declares military mobilization. In this case, the claimant is already wanted by the Turkish authorities as there are warrants out for his arrest for draft evasion. Therefore, based on all the evidence before me, I find that he will face a serious possibility of persecution if forced to return to his country. His fears are indeed well-founded.\n\nState Protection\n\n[15] I find that the claimant will not be able to access adequate state protection if forced to return to T\u00fcrkiye.\n[16] Since the State of T\u00fcrkiye is the agent of persecution, I find that it will be objectively unreasonable for him to seek protection in his country, and that the presumption of state protection has been rebutted.\n\nInternal Flight Alternative (IFA)\n\n[17] I have also considered whether the claimant has a viable IFA in his country and find that there is none. The government of T\u00fcrkiye is in control of the entire territory of the country and the treatment of Alevi Kurds, including conscientious objectors to conscription, is uniform throughout the country.\n[18] Given the persecution Alevi Kurds and draft evaders face everywhere in T\u00fcrkiye, I find that it is neither safe nor objectively reasonable in all of the circumstances, including the claimant\u2019s circumstances, for him to relocate anywhere within his country. Accordingly, I find that there is no viable IFA available to the claimant.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[19] For the foregoing reasons, I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee under section 96 of IRPA. Therefore, I accept his claim.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n[1] Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n[2] Exhibit 2.\n[3] Exhibit 1.\n[4] Exhibit 4.\n[5] Exhibit 3, National Documentation Package, T\u00fcrkiye, 31 July 2023, tab 12.2: Situation of Alevis, including political and religious rights; treatment of Alevis by society and authorities; state protection (2019\u2013November 2021).

In their claims I have considered and applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9: Proceedings Before the IRB Involving Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Expression, and Sex Characteristics.\n\nDETERMINATION\n\n[2] I find that the claimants are Convention refugees pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA based on their well-founded fear of persecution in Ukraine and in Russia.\n\nALLEGATIONS\n\n[3] The specifics of the claims are stated in the claimants Basis of Claim forms and narrative in evidence as well as their updated Basis of Claim forms. The claimants are a married same-sex capital, aged 26 and 37 respectively. The principal claimant is a citizen of Ukraine, who resided in Moscow and had a temporary \u2014 sorry had a temporary status in Russia. The associate claimant is a citizen of Russia. They met in 2017 and both worked and live together in Moscow Russia. They fled to Canada in XXXX 2022 and made their refugee claim in November 2022. The claimants fear returning to Ukraine and Russia due to the homophobic policies and persecution towards LGBTQ+ persons. They also fear forced conscription in both Russia and Ukraine due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nIdentity\n\n[4] The claimants\u2019 personal identities and their identities as nationals of Ukraine and Russia has been established by their sworn testimonies and the certified copies of their passports in evidence in Exhibit 1. The associate claimant testified that he was born in Kazakhstan and had citizenship there up until 2017 when he moved to Russia. He testified that he is no longer a citizen of Kazakhstan, as they do not allow for dual citizenship. The National Documentation Package for Kazakhstan at Item 3.1 states that citizens of the Republic of Kazakhstan are persons who permanently reside in the republic of Kazakhstan on the date of entry into force of this law, born on the territory of the Republic of Kazakhstan, and are not citizens of a foreign country and acquire the citizenship of Republic of Kazakhstan in accordance with this law. A citizen of the Republic of Kazakhstan is not recognized as a citizen of another country. As the associate claimant provided his Russian passport and testified to living in Russia and being a citizen of Russia, I find that he is no longer a citizen of Kazakhstan, and therefore it is not a country of reference in his claim. I accept that the claimants are nationals of Ukraine and Russia and not nationals of any other countries.\n\nCredibility\n\n[5] When a claimant swears to the truth of their allegations, this creates a presumption that those allegations are true unless there is reason to doubt their truthfulness. I find no reason to doubt the truthfulness of the claimants, they testified in a straightforward, forthright, detailed, and candid manner. And there were no material inconsistencies, omissions or contradictions between their testimony and the other evidence in this case that were not reasonably explained. They did not exaggerate or tailor their evidence and in summary, their testimonies were consistent with the other evidence on the central aspects of their claim. The claimants provided ample details to expand upon their allegations and they also provided evidence in Exhibit 4 which included their marriage certificate from Canada in 2022 and the associate claimant\u2019s military draft subpoena from Russia. I have no reason to doubt the genuineness of these documents and since the documents relate to the claimant\u2019s relationship as a married same-sex couple, and the associate claimant\u2019s requirements to join the Russian forces if he were to return now, I place significant weight on these documents to support their claims. Given the claimants\u2019 careful testimonies and supporting documents, I find that they have established on a balance of probabilities the facts alleged in their claims, including that they are a same-sex couple who are married, and that Russia and Ukraine currently are conscripting military aged men into the armed forces. And therefore, I accept the subjective fear they have of returning to either Ukraine or Russia now. In sum, I find the claimants to be credible witnesses and believe what they have alleged in support of their claims.\n\nNexus\n\n[6] To qualify for refugee status under the refugee Convention, an individual must demonstrate that they have a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion. The allegations here establish a nexus to the Convention for the claimants based on their membership in a particular social group due to their sexual orientation as gay men, who are married to each other and who fear forced conscription. I will therefore assess their claims under section 96.\n\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution & Risk of Harm\n\n[7] I find that the claimants have a well-founded fear of persecution in both Russia and Ukraine based on their sexual orientation.\n\n[8] I will first assess the risk of harm in Russia. I find that the claimants have established sufficient credible evidence to demonstrate that they face more than a serious possibility of persecution if they were to return to Russia now. Discrimination against the LGBTQ+ community in Russia is widespread and severe, including by the authorities, and this can be found at Item 6.7 of the National Documentation Package for Russia. A homophobic campaign continued in state-controlled media, in which officials, journalists and others derided LGBTQ+ persons as \u201cperverts, sodomites and abnormal and conflated homosexuality with pedophilia\u201d. A law prohibiting the propaganda of non-traditional sexual orientation, restricted freedom of expression, association, and peaceful assembly for LGBTQ+ persons and their supporters, and the claimants have testified about this law today in their testimony. There is also no law to prohibit discrimination against LGBTQ+ persons in housing, employment or access to government services and there were reports that government agents attack, harass and threaten LGBTQ+ activists. LGBTQ+ persons were particularly or particular targets of societal violence and police often fail to respond adequately to such incidents. Public officials portray LGBT identities as contradictory to Russian and orthodox values and as a western phenomenon imposed by Europe as part of its agenda to weaken and alienate Russia, and this is found at Item 6.3 of the NDP. Hate speech against LGBTQ+ persons is state-led and legislation severely restricts challenges against the dominant hateful narrative and laws aimed at preventing incitement to discrimination or violence are more likely to be used to prosecute than protect minorities, and this can be found at Item 2.1 and 6.3 of the National Documentation Package for Russia. I find that the claimants have therefore established a future risk that they would be subjected to societal abuse, mistreatment and violence at the hands of the community at large as well as the authorities such as the police due to their sexual orientation if they were to return to Russia now. I therefore find they have established a well-founded fear of persecution in Russia.\n\n[9] I will now assess the situation in Ukraine. The National Documentation Package for Ukraine describes Ukraine as a society that continues to harbor significant anti-LGBTIQ2 sentiment despite some signs of change. NDP Item 6.3 states that when first elected, President Zelenskyy told reporters \u2018We live in open free society where everyone chooses a language to communicate and his orientation. Leave these people alone. Enough.\u2019 The state has shown some signs of a willingness to improve, as reflected by its President\u2019s statement. However, change has been slow and there are significant opposition both socially and from the authorities. The rights of LGBTIQ+ people in Ukraine are not fully protected, leaving them vulnerable to violence and discrimination, and this can be found at Item 6.4 of the NDP. NDP Item 2.1 establishes that events organized by the LGBTQ+ community were regularly disrupted by members of violent radical groups. Police at times did not adequately protect participants from attack before or after the events, nor did they provide sufficient security for smaller demonstrations or events, especially those organized by persons belonging to minority groups or opposition political movements. There was societal violence against LGBTIQ+ persons, often perpetrated by members of violent radical groups, as mentioned earlier. Additionally, Item 6.2 of the NDP states that police also committed violence against LGBTIQ+ people and victims rarely appeal to public associations that protect the rights of them and in about half of the cases, they did not get help. Religious leaders have also made anti-LGBTIQ+ statements and Ukraine has failed to criminalize hate speech, although the state did pull the licence of one (1) media outline broadcasting anti-LGBTIQ statements The LGBTIQ2 human rights group Nash Mir Centre\u2019s annual report documented 369 cases of violence and discrimination against LGBTIQ+ people in 2019. A study on attacks against activists show that LGBTIQ+ activists were the most at risk and this could be found at NDP Item 6.1. Furthermore, NDP Item 2.1 states that when the Russians occupied Crimea, most LGBTIQ+ individuals fled and those who remained lived in fear of abuse due to their sexual orientation or gender identity. The UN Human Rights Council\u2019s Independent Expert received reports of increased violence and discrimination against this community in Crimea, as well as the use of homophobic propaganda employed by the occupation authorities. Therefore, I am satisfied that now with the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, there is an increased threat to any LGBTIQ+ people in any part of the country that may fall under Russian control now or in the future.\n\n[10] Therefore, I find the claimants have demonstrated a well-founded fear of persecution on both a subjective and objective basis and I find they would face a serious possibility of persecution in either Ukraine or Russia as a married gay couple.\n\nState Protection and Internal Flight Alternative\n\n[11] In all refugee claims, a state is presumed to be capable of protecting its citizens unless there is clear and convincing evidence to the contrary. In this case, I find this presumption has been rebutted. To prevent this presumption, a claimant must establish on a balance of probabilities through clear and convincing evidence that their state\u2019s protection is inadequate and the onus is on the claimant to rebut this presumption.\n\n[12] I will first assess the situation in Russia. In the claimants\u2019 particular case, the state is one (1) of the agents of persecution and I find that the objective evidence on file indicates that they would face persecution at the hands of authorities among others if they were to return to Russia. Accordingly, I find it would be objectively unreasonable for them to seek state protection in Russia and consequently, the presumption of state protection has been rebutted. With respect to internal flight alternative, meaning if there were to be somewhere safe for them to live in Russia, I do not find that they could live safely in any other part of the country given that the state is one (1) of the agents of persecution and has control over all of its territory. Furthermore, based on the evidence before me, I find there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout Russia as the situation with respect to LGBTIQ+ persons is consistent throughout the entire country and I find they would face a serious possibility of persecution throughout the entire country of Russia.\n\n[13] I will now assess the situation in Ukraine. In Ukraine\u2019s National Documentation Package at Item 6.5, which was published prior to the Russian evasion, it states that the police are extremely reluctant to investigate cases of homophobic and transphobic crime and most of the victims do not report attacks to the police as they do not trust the system. They fear harassment and violence from the police or having to divulge information about their sexual orientation. The absence of an effective investigation and relevant legal categorization of these offences as hate crime sends a clear message about impunity for such crimes. While country documents indicate that the police have shown some initial signs of improvement in their treatment of the LGBTIQ+ people, there are still homophobic incidents and investigation of homophobic hate crimes is extremely unsatisfactory and even when forced to investigate, it never leads to indictment, and that is at NDP Item 6.3. Currently, Ukraine is at war with Russia since the Russian evasion began in late February 2022. In the Ukraine-held territory, I am satisfied that the state continues to fail to provide adequate and effective protection in a consistent manner to the LGBTIQ+ people as detailed above and if Crimea is any indication, things will be much worse in any areas that fall under Russian control with the state being an active agent of persecution. Accordingly, I find there is no adequate state protection available to the claimants in their particular circumstances and I find that the presumption of state protection has been rebutted. In addition, I find the state of Ukraine is no longer in control of all of its territories and where the Russians have taken over, the situation is even more dire for LGBTIQ+ people. Therefore, I find the claimants face a serious possibility of persecution throughout the entire territory of Ukraine and there is no viable internal flight alternative available to them.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[14] For these reasons, I find the claimants are Convention refugees under section 96 of the Act and I accept each of their claims.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

So I will say your legal full name as well. So XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX or also known as XXXX (ph). I have considered your testimony and the other evidence in the case and I am ready to give my decision orally. So you claim to be a citizen of Venezuela and you are claiming protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. In coming to the decision, I have also considered a Chairperson\u2019s Guidelines number 9 which are proceedings before the Board involving sexual orientation, gender identity, expression and gender characteristic or sex characteristics. And ultimately, my decision is that I find that you are Convention refugee as you have a well-founded fear of persecution in Venezuela.\n\n[2] CLAIMANT: Thank you.\n\n[3] MEMBER: You are welcome. Okay. So from here on XXXX, I will just now read the full \u2014 rest of the decision, which will explain why I have made a positive decision. So this is where the interpreter will not do exact interpretation but instead she will take some notes and she will give a summary to you at the end. So Madam Interpreter, if I am speaking too quickly, please just let me know and ask me to slow down. So that way you can take the notes that you need to take. Okay? Okay. So this is a continuation of the reasons. And so I will also briefly note that the Basis of Claim form and the addendum to the narrative, that they were not signed by you, the claimant. However, at the hearing, Counsel for you confirmed that you had recently signed both of these or all of these documents, but had not had the opportunity to send those in to the RPD yet. You and your Counsel, both confirmed that the signed versions of the Basis of Claim form and the narratives were the exact same and that no changes had been made. You confirmed that you had signed those documents, you had submitted them and that they were interpreted fully to you so you could understand the contents and you confirmed that all of the information in those documents were complete, true and correct.\n\n[4] I will briefly summarize your allegations. You were born as a male. But since you were very young, you have identified as a female. You have at the very least already begun your transition to a female and you identify as a trans woman. Your fear discrimination, harassment, violence and even death at the hands of Venezuelan police and also general society by reason of your gender identity. You described varying instances of verbal, physical and even sexual abuse that you endured at the hands of the police and also general society members throughout your life. You left Venezuela for the first time in XXXX 2017 and you went to the Dominican Republic. You then returned to Venezuela after an approximate XXXX (XXXX) month period. You went then to then go live in Peru in XXXX of 2018 and you remained there for approximately two (2) and a half to three (3) years without any kind of permanent status. You then went to Mexico in XXXX 2021 and you remained there for XXXX (XXXX) months trying to cross the border into the United States so that you can reach Canada. You tried to cross the border into Canada in XXXX 2021. However, the border was closed because of the Covid-19 pandemic. You then finally were able to cross when the border reopened in XXXX 2021 and you made your claim for protection. I find that you have established your identity as a citizen of Venezuela on the balance of probabilities by a copy of your Venezuelan passport, which is found at Exhibit number 1.\n\n[5] I will now turn to the issue of credibility. I have XXXX, that you are a credible witness, and I therefore believe what you have alleged for your claims. You testified in a straightforward manner, and there were no material inconsistencies in your testimony or contradictions between your testimony and the other evidence before me. You told me about how you first started to feel like you were not living in the right body when you were very young. You explained that you lived openly and you did not hide who you were or how you felt. You told me about how you were bullied, harassed and you were even physically abused in school by the other children and how you were not able to obtain employment due to your physical appearance and how you would dress. You stated that you would dress in clothes that which were more fitting to your feeling of being a woman and that you would wear makeup and you would grow out your hair. You were only able to make money to earn a living by working as a XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX and to XXXX XXXX XXXX. This work was not actually legal in Venezuela, but it was very common. These XXXX would often have to pay bribes to the police to continue working, which you also had to do. However, you said that you were treated differently from these other XXXX because of your appearance. The police would insult you, harass and even beat you. They would take the bribe money and all of your earnings and even your product. They would detain you without charges. Also, other than accepting these bribes, they did not do this, any of these behaviors with any of the other vendors because they were considered \u201cnormal\u201d. You told me details beyond the Basis of your Claim form, thereby lending further credibility to your allegations. You told me about how you finally told your mother, how you had been feeling. You told me that you liked a boy in your class and very naively told him your feelings. In response, he and his friends beat you up and harassed you. The parents were called to the school. That is when you told your mother how you had been feeling.\n\n[6] At first, your parents responded by seeking you to have some medical and XXXX treatment. But through this therapy, it was confirmed that this is indeed how you felt. Your family has therefore accepted you from that moment on. You also told me about what happened to you when you tried to renew and get your passport. As you lived openly as a trans woman, you dressed not as what a man would typically or stereotypical dress like. You had long hair and you wore makeup. You said that when you went to get your passport, you were forced to cut your hair, take your makeup off and to dress in men\u2019s clothing in order to even get your passport. You explained that you had always wanted a family and knew that by doing the gender affirming surgery, that this may not be possible for you. So you and a close friend of yours decided to have a baby together, but you were never actually together as a couple. You also provided documents in support of your claim. You provided a letter from your son\u2019s mother confirming that you were never in a romantic relationship together. You provided a letter from XXXX XXXX, which is an agency in Toronto that serves the LGBTQ2S community where they confirmed that you accessed their services and you completed a settlement needs intake in XXXX 2022. You also provided letters from two (2) friends here in Canada who confirm that they know you as a trans woman. You also provided 2 letters of support from your boyfriend here in Canada, who confirms his relationship with you and that you are a trans woman.\n\n[7] You provided various photographs of your daily life, including with your boyfriend, which not only show you as a trans woman, but also they are consistent with you being in a relationship with him. These are all located at Exhibit 5 and 8. I have no reason to doubt the authenticity of these documents, and I place high weight on them. I find on the balance of probabilities, XXXX, that you are a trans woman. I find that what you fear constitutes persecution, and that the persecution has a nexus to the Convention ground of your membership in a particular social group, namely being a trans woman. I will also briefly comment on your time spent in the Dominican Republic, Peru, Mexico and the United States. You told me that in each country, you approached a lawyer to get some advice about how to claim for protection. In each of the countries, you were advised that being a trans was not something to fear in your home country and therefore, it was not an acceptable reason for you to claim protection. You were even told in the Latin American countries that you either had to leave the country or that you needed to fix your problem.\n\n[8] You told me that the reason why you spent nine (9) months in Mexico when you were trying to transit through into Canada is because you did not have a visa and you could not fly direct. You had to cross the border from Mexico into the United States. You said that you attempted this sorry multiple times but each time you were denied at the border and returned back into Mexico. You did not have the money to continue doing this because each time that they turned you away, you had to start for scratch. So you had to work to make more money to try to cross the border again. In the United States, you said that you were turned away because the border was closed due to Covid-19. But you returned as soon as you were able to once the border reopened. I do not find your explanations to be unreasonable. You went and you obtained legal advice and you were given some unfortunate or negative news. You believe the advice that you were given by these professionals. I do not make negative credibility inferences from this.\n\n[9] I have considered the country condition documentation on Venezuela. Although same sex relations are not illegal in Venezuela, the level of discrimination against sexual minorities, including trans, people is significant and homophobia and transphobia is widespread. The National Documentation Package or the NDP at Item 2.1 states that local police and private security forces allegedly prevented LGBTQI persons from entering malls, public parks and even recreational areas. NGOs have reported incidences of bias motivated violence against LGBTQI persons, and Item 2.4 states that although discrimination based on sexual orientation is banned, LGBTQI plus Venezuelans face what is called \u201cwidespread intolerance\u201d and are occasionally even subjected with violence. NDP 6.1 reports that high ranking officials have made homophobic statements or have publicly used discriminatory language against LGBTQI persons without consequences despite the constitutional law against hatred for peaceful coexistence and tolerance. NDP 1.7 notes that even though there\u2019s no legislation that criminalizes homosexuality, there is also no explicit legislation that protects the LGBTQI population. It is reported that Venezuelan authorities in particular are responsible for discrimination against LGBTI people in Venezuela.\n\n[10] NDP 1.6 further reports that law enforcement agencies in Venezuela seldom investigate cases of discrimination or violation of rights of LGBTQI person because they are considered to be minorities. Crimes committed against LGBTQI persons are deemed by authorities to be crimes of passion, the result of settling scores or that the LGBTQI person had it coming. NDP 6.1 notes that sexual minorities face discrimination when accessing healthcare. They face obstacles when obtaining employment, and they even dismissed when the employer finds out that they are an LGBTQI plus person. The same report states how police arbitrarily arrest and detain. They commit other abuses as well against people of different sexual orientation or people who are gender diverse. They intimidate, harass, threaten. They even insult and sexually abuse them. Based on the totality of the evidence before me, including your own, long personal history with harassment and discrimination and violence on the basis of your gender identity, I find that you faced serious possibility of persecution by the state and other actors in Venezuela on the basis of your gender identity, namely that you are a trans woman. I find that your subjective fears are objectively well founded and they are forward facing.\n\n[11] Regarding state protection and internal flight alternative, unless in complete breakdown, a state is considered presumed to be capable of protecting their own citizens. In this case, it is the state and its agents that are one (1) of the agents of persecution against you. Based on all of the country condition evidence which I have already gone through about the treatment of LGBTQI plus persons, I find that the presumption of state protection has clearly been rebutted in your claim. And for similar reasons, due to the fact that the state is a primary agent of persecution and given that they are in control of the entirety of their territory of Venezuela, I find that there\u2019s is no place within Venezuela that you could safely relocate as a transwoman. Therefore, there is no flight \u2014 internal flight alternative available to you. And the conclusion, based on the foregoing everything I have just stated, XXXX, I find that you are a Convention refugee, and I therefore accept your claim. And those are the ends of my reasons.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

The date is March 2, 2023. The Panel has considered the testimonies and their evidence in these claims, and is ready to render a decision orally. The RPD heard these claims jointly pursuant to rule 55 of the rules. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX was appointed as the designated representative for the minor child included in the claim, being XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, who is now known as XXXX XXXX XXXX.\n\n[2] Now, reaching his decision in these claims, the Panel reviewed and applied the Chairperson\u2019s guideline 3, child refugee claimants: procedural and evidentiary issues, as well as Guideline line, proceedings before the IRB involving sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, and sex characteristics. The claimant claims refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. The claimants\u2019 allegations are fully set out in their Basis of Claim forms, as well as their attached narrative. To summarize briefly, the claimants fear harm in Peru due to the sexual orientation of the minor claimant. The minor claimant is a 17-year-old male Peruvian citizen who is transgender, while his mother, the principal claimant, is a 53-year-old Peruvian.\n\n[3] The minor claimant was born and assigned the female gender. He grew up as a girl until his secondary school days, when he discovered that he identifies as a male than a female. He began to wish he could escape his female body. He started to exercise to look masculine and to wear clothing that would hide his female features. He became alienated from the girls in school, finding him to be strange. His attempts to have a romantic relationship with the female classmate, XXXX (ph), ended up with him losing his closest friend. When XXXX\u2019s parents found out that she and the minor claimant had been in a relationship, XXXX\u2019s parents began to tell her that the minor claimant is bad influence from whom their daughter should be kept away. As a result, the minor claimant began to experience abuse, insults, and verbal assaults from other students.\n\n[4] In 2020, the minor claimant revealed his sexual identity to his parents, who initially felt shocked, but decided to embrace and support him as their only child. Afraid of the harm the minor claimant may face if his sexual identity became widely known, the parents decided that he should leave Peru for safety. The claimants arrived in Canada in XXXX 2022 for the minor claimant to pursue further education, with the principal claimant providing the (inaudible) support. A few months later, they were advised that their fears of returning to Peru could benefit from protection under the refugee process, and they decided to make a claim. Having considered the totality of the evidence, the Panel finds the claimants are Convention refugees pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA, as there exists a serious possibility of persecution should they return to Peru. The Panel finds that the claimants\u2019 personal identities and nationalities as Peruvians have been established on a balance of probabilities by their testimonies as well as the copies of their Peruvian passports in Exhibit 1.\n\n[5] The Panel finds the claimants to be credible witnesses. They testified in a forthright manner and their were no material inconsistencies, omissions, or contradictions within their oral testimonies or between their oral testimonies and the other documents before the Panel. The minor claimant testified about when he discovered his sexual identity as well as the challenges he had faced. The principal claimant gave testimony about the persecution and discrimination the minor claimant had faced, as well as the lack of opportunity for him to access the needed therapy for him to be who he is. She testified as to how she and the minor claimant\u2019s father have had to keep his sexual identity secret, not only because of the harm he could face, but also the rejection and the father would face from their relatives and the larger society, who would regard them as failing their parental duties.\n\n[6] In assessing the claimants\u2019 credibility, the Panel also considered the documentary evidence provided at Exhibit 4. This included a letter of authorization from (inaudible) XXXX XXXX, the father of the minor claimant, providing consent for him to travel and reside in Canada with he principal claimant, (inaudible) of texts and social media messages between the minor claimant and friends, where he conversed about his sexual identity, saying, \u201d I do not want to be yelled at anymore,\u201d \u201cI do not want to suffer anymore,\u201d \u201cI am scared,\u201d etcetera. And assessment report and treatment plan from the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in Richmond, BC underscoring the minor claimant\u2019s gender identity, as well as the recommended therapy for him and transition, a copy of the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. On a review of these documents, the Panel finds no valid reason to doubt the authenticity. The Panel assigns them significant weight as having probative value in substantiating his allegations.\n\n[7] Taking into consideration provisions of Guideline 9, proceedings before the IRB involving sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, and sex characteristics, in regards to the fluidity of sexual orientation, the Panel finds that based on the claimants\u2019 words and testimonies the minor claimant has established on a balance of probabilities his profile as transgender and a sexual minority. The Panel finds that the minor claimant\u2019s allegations have a nexus to the Convention ground of membership in a particular social group as a sexual minority, while the principal claimant\u2019s allegations have a nexus to the Convention ground of membership in a particular social group as a family member and carer of a SOGIESC individual. The Panel therefore assessed the claimants pursuant to section 96 of the Act.\n\n[8] The principal claimant was asked to explain the risk faced by both claimants if they were to return to Peru. She stated that the family had to hide the sexual identity of the minor claimant to avoid harm in Peru, and that they could not do so for long. She testified that she fears rejection of family members as well as harassment and physical attacks if they were to return to Peru. Given that there are no serious credibility issues with respect to the claimant\u2019s allegations, coupled with the documentary evidence set out below, the Panel finds that the claimants have established that sexual minorities and LGBTIQ2S persons currently face a level of violence, harassment, and discrimination that may result in harm in Peru.\n\n[9] Objective evidence indicates that while same-sex relationships are not criminalized in Peru, and that there has been some progress made in recent years to protect the rights of sexual minorities, serious problems do remains. According the NDP 6.1, it states that sex between consenting adults of the same sex are not penalized, but that LGBTIQ2S personals are generally negatively perceived by the conservative Peruvian society. They face discrimination because of their sexual orientation, and they may face acts of violence such as murder, rape, arbitrary arrest, and inhuman and degrading treatment in Peru. NDP 2.1 states that discrimination, harassment, and abuse of transgender individuals like the minor claimant, including by police and other authorities, was a serious problem in Peru.\n\n[10] The constitution does include a broad prohibition against discrimination, and individuals in Peru can file legal claimants of discrimination based on sexual orientation. However, there are few national laws that mention sexual orientation as an explicit category for protection, leaving room for interpretations that overlook the rights of sexual minorities. Guideline 9 further underscores the fact that the absence of laws that criminalize or discriminate against LGBTIQ2S individuals in the country does not signify a lack of discrimination in that country, nor does it indicate that state protection is available, and that laws of general application can be selectively applied and enforced against LGBTIQ2S individuals in a discretionary way that may amount to persecution. NDP 2.3 reports that there exists serious discrimination against sexual minorities in Peru, including (inaudible) on the grounds of sexual orientation or sexual identity or gender identity which created barriers to access to rights as healthcare, education, employment, and housing. It was reported that the state did not have effective mechanisms in place to deal with the problems and to protect the LGBTIQ2S population. The same report gave evidence of the societal attitude, where the president reported as being opposed to legalizing same-sex marriage. In a speech on the campaign trail, he said recognition of trans people was an idiosyncrasy that should be thrown in the garbage. He has also expressed opposition to including gender (inaudible) in the school curriculum. NDP 6.4 shows that 56 percent of the LGBTIQ2S population was afraid of expressing their sexual orientation, and 72 percent of these people fear being discriminated against or attacked because of their sexual orientation.\n\n[11] The claimants have testified that they are forced to hide the minor claimant\u2019s sexual identity, and would have to conceal his sexual orientation if made to return to Peru. According to Guideline 9, having to hide one\u2019s sexual orientation constitutes a serious interference with fundamental rights that may amount to persecution. The Panel finds that given the evidence of risk of violence and societal discrimination that sexual minorities like the minor claimant face in Peru, these conditions would compel the claimants to conceal the minor claimant\u2019s sexual orientation in an attempt to protect him and the family members\u2019 physical safety. Based on the totality of the evidence, the Panel finds that the claimants have demonstrated an objective basis for their subjective fear of persecution. The Panel finds that based on the minor claimant\u2019s sexual orientation as transgender, and the principal claimant\u2019s position as a mother who is providing emotional and psychological support to her child, considered by the larger society as (inaudible), the claimants face a serious possibility of persecution if they were to return to Peru.\n\n[12] The Panel has considered whether state protection would be available to the claimants if they returned to their country, and has concluded that it is not, for the following reasons. The claimants are required to approach the state if protection might be reasonably be forthcoming, or if it is objectively reasonable to have sought protection. However, there is no requirement risk one\u2019s life seeking ineffective protection. According to objective evidence already cited, (inaudible) made by the police to protect sexual minorities, and the educate police officers on anti-discrimination regulations, there is still discrimination of LGBTIQ2S persons by law enforcement and providing protection against risk, and that law enforcement officers have been guilty of abuse against members of sexual minorities. The Panel therefore finds that on a balance of probabilities, the state would be unwilling or unable to provide adequate state production to the claimants if they were to return to Peru. The presumption of state protection is therefore rebutted in these claims.\n\n[13] The Panel also considered whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for the claimants in Peru. The Panel finds that the claimants would face a serious possibility of persecution throughout the country. In line with Guideline 9, which applies that an IFA is not viable for an individual if they must conceal their sexual identity in order to live in the suggested location, the Panel finds that there is no viable internal flight alternative for the claimants within their country. Consequently, for the reasons given, and upon consideration of the whole of the evidence, the Refugee Protection Division determines that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, who is now known as XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, are Convention refugees as defined in section 96 of the Act. Accordingly, the Panel accepts their claims.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

Further, he is Kalmyk, an ethnic minority in Russia, who lived most of his life in the republic of Kalmykia, and has been subjected to discrimination, profiling, and physical assaults.\n[3] When the claimant finished high school, he attended XXXX at the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. He completed his mandatory military service while in XXXX. He testified that not completing this would have limited his career options and that even if he did not complete it while in XXXX, he would have been sent to the army. Upon completing his education, he remained in Moscow for work. He describes experiencing discrimination based on his appearance there, including being stopped by police who checked his identification. He was also the victim of racist attacks in 2008 and 2009 where he was physically assaulted. He left Moscow in 2015 after having been falsely accused by police of having committed a crime and was only released after the victim stated he was not involved. He returned to Kalmykia.\n[4] He testified that he has been against Putin since his ascendancy to power. He felt that a country like Russia with its geographic and population size should not have been as underdeveloped and backward as it was. He blamed the national government and its corruption for the country\u2019s condition. He shared these views with friends and family but he did not get involved in any direct action against the government partly because work kept him busy. Also, as noted in his narrative, his experience of being a minority in Russia living far from the centre of power and away from the elite made him feel powerless.\n[5] When the war in Ukraine was announced in February 2022, he became more outspoken about his opposition to the war. He was shocked by the news of the invasion, thought it was a mistake and that it would be over shortly. He said that as someone who speaks English, he was able to read foreign media and contrasted this information with the reports presented in Russian media, quickly realizing that the Russian stories were misrepresenting events and he came to believe that the Russian military was committing war crimes and crimes against humanity. As his friends could not read the same material because they could not understand English, he tried to persuade them to see the injustices of the war. He did not participate in protests against the war because he knew it was dangerous to do so as he could have been jailed and, as he said, he would not have been able to help people. At the time, he was caring for his parents since he was their only child left in Russia as his sister lived in Canada. He said that some friends were reluctant to discuss politics as they were afraid of being reported to the Federal Security Bureau (FSB). Others disagreed with his views and threatened to report him to the FSB themselves.\n[6] He had been thinking of leaving Russia prior to the invasion of Ukraine but his family responsibilities dissuaded him from departing earlier. His mother\u2019s health was not good. However, when the partial mobilization was declared in September 2022, he knew he had to leave as soon as possible. He wanted nothing to do with Putin\u2019s war efforts, which he already saw as erroneous and horrible. He knew he would be called up as his army book declared him fit for military service. Within a day of the announcement, friends and extended family members received their call up notices. He left for XXXX, crossing there on XXXX XXXX, 2022. He said that Kalmyks like him had their passports photographed, phone numbers taken, and were interrogated for a long time unlike other Russians who were crossing. He learned that the military had come to his home on XXXX XXXX, 2022 to serve his summons.\n[7] He traveled from XXXX to XXXX before arriving in XXXX on XXXX XXXX, 2022. From there, he crossed into the United States on foot. Authorities there took a copy of his passport, gave him some forms, and informed him that if he wanted to make a claim, he would have to attend court. He did not wish to stay there as his sister was in Canada and he needed her support. He left the US arriving in Canada on XXXX XXXX.\n[8] Since his arrival in Canada, the claimant has participated in a demonstration in support of Ukraine in Calgary and has made donations to help children there. He continues to share his negative views of the invasion of Ukraine with people. He says that his mother suffered a XXXX XXXX after he left. While he does speak occasionally to some friends in Russia, these communications are less and less frequent and with fewer and fewer people as the government has imposed further restrictions on communications and increased penalties for those who violate them. The claimant fears being arrested and jailed if he is returned to Russia where, as he said, he will likely be sent to fight in Ukraine anyway. He said that he would be viewed as a traitor.\nDETERMINATION\n\n[9] I find the claimant to be a Convention refugee as he has established a serious possibility of persecution.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[10] I find that the claimant\u2019s personal identity and nationality as citizen of Russia is established, on a balance of probabilities, by the copy of his passport, birth certificate, and internal Russian passport that is in evidence.[3]\n\nNexus\n\n[11] For a claimant to be considered a Convention refugee, they must have a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion.[4] I find the claimant has a nexus to the Convention ground of political opinion.\nCredibility\n\n[12] When a claimant swears to the truth of certain allegations, this creates a presumption that those allegations are true unless there be reason to doubt their truthfulness.[5] However this presumption does not apply to inferences (conclusions drawn from facts) or speculation (for which there is no evidentiary basis).\n[13] The claimant testified in a straightforward manner and I found him to be credible overall concerning the central allegations of his claim and of his political opinion. The claimant\u2019s testimony demonstrated that his negative opinions about Putin and the Russian government, which he described as corrupt, existed before the invasion of Ukraine and his desire to leave the country existed before both the invasion and the partial mobilization were declared. I find that the fact that he held these views before he was served a summons from the Russian military strengthened the credibility of this asserted political opinion.\n[14] The claimant provided several items in support of his allegations including copies of his educational and employment documents, a copy of his birth certificate that mentions his ethnicity, his military identification and certificate showing that he was a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX deemed fit for service, and his internal Russian passport. As well, he provided medical documents concerning his mother\u2019s medical condition and treatment along with a letter from her confirming his allegations that military officials appeared at her home to give the claimant his summons and that they did not leave the document with her as she informed them that he had left the country. There are translated text messages from his phone from someone who explained what was going on with Kalmyck people crossing into XXXX and what actions to take. A copy of his US immigration files shows that he did not make an asylum claim in the US. He has provided copies of his receipts showing he has made donations to XXXX specifically to help children in Ukraine and photos of him attending a demonstration in support of Ukraine where he is holding a sign that states \u201cStand with Ukraine.\u201d[6]\n[15] I have no reason to doubt the authenticity of the documents nor the veracity of the photographs and find them relevant and probative. I find they credibly support the claimant\u2019s allegations and give them high weight.\n[16] I note that the claimant traveled to both XXXX and the United States and did not claim asylum in either of those countries before coming to Canada. He testified that he was emotionally unwell and really needed the support of his sister who lived in Canada and so was fixated on reaching her. I find his explanation to be reasonable and do not find his failure to claim in either of the two countries negatively affects his overall credibility nor does it lesson his subjective fears.\n[17] I find that the claimant has credibly established his subjective fears based on his political opinion as he holds very negative views of Vladimir Putin and the Russian government and of their actions in Ukraine.\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution\n\n[18] Given that there are no serious credibility issues with respect to the claimant\u2019s allegations, coupled with the documentary evidence set out below, I find that the claimant has established a prospective risk of being subjected to the following harms: the risk of arrest, detention, and state violence. This risk is corroborated by the following documents in the National Documentation Packages (NDP).\n[19] Within Russia there are credible reports of enforced disappearances on behalf of government authorities, torture by law enforcement officers that sometimes resulted in death, repression against Russians living outside of the country, severe repression of free expression including the use of what is described as \u201canti-extremism\u201d against peaceful dissenters, severe repression on the freedom of assembly and severe restrictions on internet usage and arbitrary interference in privacy. New amendments to existing laws banning the criticism of the armed forces were adopted on March 23, 2022, and were expanded to include criticism of all government actions. Police were reported to use electrical shocks, suffocation, sleep deprivation, and stretching. Prison conditions are described as harsh and life threatening as inmates faced overcrowding, food shortages, and abuse at the hands of guards. Officials accused of committing abuses were not investigated. Reports state individuals attending demonstrations were arrested days later as security forces are using facial recognition software. As well, people were reported as having been arrested for holding signs that say \u201cPeace\u201d, blank signs, and even wearing the colours blue and yellow together. People arrested for politically motivated reasons were charged with \u201cterrorism,\u201d \u201cseparatism,\u201d \u201cextremism,\u201d or \u201cespionage.\u201d Those accused of antiwar speech faced charges of \u201cdiscrediting the military\u201d and spreading false information, which could lead to sentences of up to 15 years in jail. People who published information about demonstrations online faced charges of \u201cinciting minors to participate in dangerous activities.\u201d Punishment for social media posts increased. Government media labeled those who expressed views different from the government as being \u201ctraitors\u201d and \u201cforeign agents.\u201d Authorities were reported as monitoring private communication as a means of intimidating the population. They are also known for punishing family members for offenses committed by individuals. This report further notes that non-Russian ethnic groups have been disproportionately mobilized to fight in Ukraine.[7]\n[20] Regarding the issue of freedom of expression in Russia and the treatment of those who disagree with Putin and his government, Human Rights Watch says that Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine is being used by Russia to eliminate all dissent in that country and not just against those who specifically criticize the war. For example, it states that bloggers have been issued warnings about attracting users on Facebook or Instagram as this could be considered as \u201cextremist activity.\u201d[8] Country information submitted by the claimant and his counsel include an article confirming this as it reports on an 18-year-old Instagram user who said police showed up at her family home and threatened her with jail time for using Instagram. Her posts are on fashion. The article confirmed with the legal head of Roskomsvoboda, a digital rights group in Russia fighting online censorship, that asking someone to follow them on Instagram could result in the person receiving a fourteen-year prison sentence. Other articles of interest in this disclosure includes a report from the Independent that says a Russian pensioner who called Ukraine\u2019s president \u201chandsome\u201d was charged with discrediting the Russian military and was fined. A teacher in Siberia was also charged with discrediting the Russian military and fined because he reacted by placing an emoji as a positive response to a video made by the actor Arnold Schwarzenegger calling on Putin to end the war in Ukraine. Additionally, they included an article from Al-Jazeera and dated March 17, 2022, that quoted a speech made by Putin on Russian TV describing people who do not support his efforts in Ukraine as being \u201cscum\u201d and \u201ctraitors\u201d and that Russians would \u201csimply spit such people out like a gnat that accidentally flew into their mouths.\u201d[9]\n[21] Based on all the evidence before me, I find that the claimant would face a serious possibility of persecution if he were to return to Russia.\nState Protection\n\n[22] In all refugee claims, the state is presumed to be capable of protecting their citizens unless there is clear and convincing evidence to the contrary. Given that the state is the agent of persecution, it appears objectively unreasonable for the claimant to seek the protection of the state. Consequently, the presumption of state protection has been rebutted.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n\n[23] With respect to an internal flight alternative, I do not find that the claimant could live safely in any other part of Russia as the state has effective control of all the territory. I find that the claimant would face a serious possibility of persecution throughout the country. Accordingly, I find that there is no viable IFA for him.\nCONCLUSION\n\n[24] Having considered all of the evidence, I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee as set out in section 96 of the Act. His claim is therefore accepted.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n[1] Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n[2] Exhibit 2\n[3] Exhibits 1 & 5\n[4] Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, SC 2001, c 27.\n[5] Maldonado v.

This guideline establishes guiding principles for decision makers in adjudicating cases involving SOGIESC, including an understanding of the challenges faced by the individuals with diverse SOGIESC.\n\nALLEGATIONS\n\n[3] The full allegations are contained in the claimant\u2019s Basis of Claim form and are summarized basically very shortly that the claimant fears persecution in Rwanda because of the sexual orientation.\n\nDETERMINATION\n\n[4] I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA.\n\n[5] With regards to the identity, the claimant\u2019s identity is established on a balance of probabilities by a copy of Rwandan passport on file.\n\n[6] With regards to credibility, pursuant to the Maldonado principle, when a claimant swears to the truth of certain allegations, this creates a presumption that those allegations are true unless there would be reason to doubt their truthfulness. There were no material inconsistencies or contradictions between the claimant\u2019s Basis of Claim form and other evidence before me. In this case, I have no reason to question the claimant\u2019s allegations. The claimant has also adduced substantial documentary evidence to support allegations. These include letters from several LGBTQ organization attesting to the claimant\u2019s membership and robust volunteer involvement in the organizations and in the events. I find that cumulatively these documents corroborate the claimant\u2019s sexual and gender orientation and the allegations, and I accord substantial weight to these supporting documents, as thus, I find the claimant credible and find on a balance of probabilities that the claimant has established a subjective fear of persecution in Rwanda based under his sexual and gender orientation.\n\n[7] With regards to nexus, I find that the persecution the claimant faces has a nexus to the Convention ground of \u2014 has \u2014 on the part of being membership in a particular social group of transgender, non-binary, and queer persons, and therefore this claim will be assessed under section 96.\n\n[8] With regards to well-founded fear of persecution, the objective country conditions documentation, which is National Documentation Package for Rwanda, says that while same-sex relations are not criminalized in Rwanda, there are no laws that prohibit discrimination based sexual orientation or gender identity. One (1) report notes that which the Constitution provides for equal protection on the law, that protections under the following law, which is law number 95 2008 on the prevention and punishment of gender-based violence, does not provide adequate protection for people when addressing gender-based violence because it defines gender-based violence as violence or harmful to an individual because they are female or male. The recent report notes that in Rwanda, public order, public indecency, and vagrancy offences are used to target transgender and gender diverse people, and the report goes on to note those with diverse SOGIE face discrimination, social stigma, homophobia, and that there are still barriers to full acceptance of people with diverse SOGIE. A Reuters article also reports that LGBT+ does say they are often fired, evicted, labelled as satanic, or ostracized by family and friends if they come out, with violent threats forcing some to flee the country. So, despite the legal frameworks which do not allow charges for crimes based on sexual orientation or gender identity, other charges can be used to detain people of diverse SOGIE, and harassment and illegal arrest and detentions are still reported. Some police still perceive and treat people with diverse SOGIE as deviant people and these people are treated with de facto criminalization. Advocates report law enforcement officials routinely abused in transit centres with transgender persons targeted for particular severe hate speech and violence, and the government did not report investigating any of these cases. So, the evidence highlights that many of the claimant\u2019s allegations that they \u2014 that the claimant has experienced discrimination, stigma due to their gender identity and sexual orientation, the claimant has established a well-founded fear of persecution based on the subjective fear and the objective evidence.\n\n[9] With regards to state protection, states are presumed to be capable of protecting their citizens except in situations where the country is in state of complete breakdown. The responsibility to provide international protection only becomes engaged when national state protection is unavailable to the claimant. To rebut the presumption of state protection, a claimant must provide clear and convincing evidence of the state\u2019s inability to protect its citizens. The claimant is required to approach the state for protection if protection might reasonably be forthcoming. However, a claimant is not required to risk their life ineffective \u2014 to seek ineffective protection. In this case, the objective evidence highlighted before confirms with while there is some legislation protecting all persons that is in the place, state protection on the ground is inadequate. It is noted within much of the evidence that transgender people are particularly mistreated by authorities and that authorities do not effectively or consistently apply legal protections. I find that the claimant could not have effective state protection available and that the presumption of state protection is therefore rebutted.\n\n[10] With regards to internal flight alternative, I have considered whether there would be a place anywhere in Rwanda where the claimant would be safe and could go to. There is no such place. In this case, I note that Rwanda is geographically compact and that the attitude is prevalent in the society and authorities are the same throughout the country. I find there would be no place in Rwanda where the claimant could go to escape the discrimination, stigma, and harassment which are faced by members of the LGBTQ community in Rwanda. I find that the claimant faces serious possibility of persecution throughout Rwanda.\n\n[11] In conclusion, based on the totality of the evidence, I find that the claimant has established on the balance of probabilities that they are a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA, and accordingly, I accept the claim.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

In short, the claimants fear returning to Norway because members of the PC\u2019s family \u2013 especially an uncle named XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX \u2013 has been targeting the PC and other family members with abuse for years.\n[6] The PC is a 35-year-old, Pakistan-born woman who came to Norway in 2002. Claiming with her are her 41-year-old, Afghanistan-born husband, as well as the couple\u2019s three children (the minor claimants).\n[7] While growing up in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the PC was sexually assaulted and abused by XXXX XXXX and another maternal uncle, XXXX XXXX.\n[8] In 2002, XXXX XXXX \u2013 a Norwegian citizen \u2013 helped the PC and her family come to Norway. Members of the family, including the PC and her sister, endured years of sexual abuse, violence and control from XXXX XXXX and his wife. XXXX XXXX, for instance, ordered the PC and her sisters to wear the burqa and avoid going to any extracurricular school activities; if they disobeyed him, he assaulted them.\n[9] In 2005, XXXX XXXX went to jail for attacking his cousin, but he was later released from jail.\n[10] In 2006, the PC escaped from the home because her family was forcing her into a marriage. The PC complained to Norwegian police about the abuse, but they did not initially take action.\n[11] However, when the PC\u2019s uncles found her in a women\u2019s shelter, police took steps to protect her, giving her a secret location and a new name.\n[12] However, a family friend of XXXX XXXX\u2019s wife who worked in Norwegian social services provided the uncles with the PC\u2019s confidential SIN number, allowing the agents of persecution to track her to different addresses around Norway. Sometimes, her uncles\u2019 friends would visit her and assault her. At other times, she would receive threatening phone calls or notes pasted on her home. Another time, a man threw water at her, stating that they would throw acid at her the next time.\n[13] In 2011, the PC went to visit relatives in Pakistan, but she cut short her two-week trip because her sister said XXXX XXXX was travelling to Pakistan to kill her.\n[14] In 2018, Norwegian police contacted her because XXXX XXXX\u2019s sons had complained about his years of abuse. At the time, she also received alarms and panic buttons from police, who additionally placed the claimants in a bulletproof house.\n[15] During this time, XXXX XXXX\u2019s wife, XXXX XXXX, placed an anonymous call with child welfare services, alleging that the PC and AC were planning to marry off MC#2 in an Islamic wedding.\n[16] Norwegian police eventually told the claimants that they should leave Norway and Europe because of the threat from her uncles.\n[17] The claimants fled to Canada in XXXX 2019. In XXXX 2020, the PC testified against XXXX XXXX by videolink in a court case. In part because of her testimony, XXXX XXXX was sentenced to five years in jail.\n[18] Around the same time, XXXX XXXX\u2019s wife also spent around two months in jail as police investigated her role in accessing the PC\u2019s social insurance records.\n[19] In August 2020, the claimants applied for refugee protection in Canada.\n[20] In 2022, XXXX XXXX was released from prison.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[21] The claimants\u2019 personal identities and identities as nationals of Norway have been established by their sworn testimony and copies of their Norwegian passports in evidence.[5]\n\nCountry of Reference\n[22] I find that Norway is the only country of reference for all the claimants.\n[23] The PC was born as a Pakistani citizen in Pakistan in 1987. When she was about 14, she moved to Norway. In 2009, she obtained Norwegian citizenship, forcing her to renounce her Pakistani citizenship. Norwegian police duly accompanied her to her uncle\u2019s home so that she could pick up her Pakistani passport and return it to the Pakistani Embassy in Oslo.\n[24] For his part, the AC was born as an Afghan citizen in Afghanistan in 1982. When he was about 25, he came to Norway. He successfully claimed refugee status in Norway and became a Norwegian citizen in 2014.\n[25] The first of the children born was XXXX (MC#2) in 2010. XXXX was born to the PC and a man who was a Norwegian citizen originally from Afghanistan. Together, the adult claimants had two more children: XXXX (MC#3) in 2012 and XXXX (MC#1) in 2015.\n[26] Pakistan\n[27] I do not find that Pakistan is a country of reference for any of the claimants.\n[28] The PC gave birth to the three minor claimants in 2010, 2012 and 2015 \u2013 all of which followed the renunciation of her Pakistani citizenship in 2009.\n[29] The National Documentation Package (NDP) for Pakistan discusses the modes of reacquiring citizenship. According to Pakistani legal experts interviewed for a Response to Information Request (RIR) for the Board, any of Pakistan\u2019s provisions for resuming citizenship apply merely \u201cto children whose parents renounced their Pakistani citizenship upon becoming citizens of another country while the child was still a minor.\u201d[6]\n[30] In this case, the PC did not renounce her Pakistani citizenship after they were born, but before, so I do not find that the minor claimants have the option of obtaining Pakistani citizenship because they were born to non-Pakistani citizens. Accordingly, I do not find that Pakistan is a country of reference for the three minor claimants.\n[31] In the case of the PC herself, there is the question of whether she can reacquire Pakistani citizenship. But in a separate RIR for the Board, the same Pakistani legal experts state that \u201c[u]nfortunately the 1951 Act and the 1952 Rules are silent on the issue of resumption of Pakistani citizenship by adults who voluntarily renounced their citizenship.\u201d[7]\n[32] Accordingly, I find that there is insufficient evidence to establish that adults who renounce their Pakistani citizenship can reobtain it automatically because Pakistani law is silent on the matter. As such, I do not find, on a balance of probabilities, that it is within the PC\u2019s power to reobtain Pakistani citizenship given the lack of legal clarity on the issue.\n[33] Because of that, I find that Pakistan is not a country of reference for her.\n\nAfghanistan\n[34] I do not find that Afghanistan is a country of reference for any of the claimants.\n[35] The AC was born as an Afghan citizen but renounced the citizenship no later than 2014, when he obtained Norwegian citizenship. XXXX (MC#3), who was born in 2012, was the only child to be born to the AC while he was still an Afghan citizen, raising the likelihood that MC#3, too, was born an Afghan citizen but lost it as well as his father became solely a Norwegian citizen in 2014.\n[36] Since the takeover of the Taliban, I find that there have been no updates to the Afghanistan NDP regarding the group\u2019s new citizenship policies, if any. As such, I will rely on the last available documents regarding the country\u2019s citizenship laws before the country\u2019s fall to the Taliban.\n[37] According to Article 35 of the pre-Taliban citizenship law, \u201cthe Afghan nationality of a person who has lost it and wants to get it restored can be restored after the approval of the Council of Ministers and later by Amirul mo\u2019min\u00een.\u201d[8]\n[38] Critically, Article 35 states that the citizenship \u201ccan be restored\u201d following approval from senior officials. Such language indicates that the process is not automatic but dependent on the discretion of minister and the Amirul mo\u2019min\u00een. As such, I do not find that it was within the power of the AC and MC#3 to automatically obtain Afghan citizenship on the date of the hearing.\n[39] Because of that, I find that Afghanistan is not a country of reference for the AC or MC#3. And in summary, I find that Norway is the only country of reference for all the claimants, meaning I will assess their claim against Norway alone.\n\nNo Exclusion Against PC Under Article 1(F)(b) for Potential Child Abduction\n[40] I considered whether there were reasons to exclude the PC according to Article 1(F)(b) because of potential child abduction, but I find that there are no serious reasons for considering that she brought the MC#2 to Canada without the latter\u2019s father\u2019s consent.\n[41] MC#2 (XXXX XXXX) is the PC\u2019s daughter, but she is not the biological daughter of the AC. Rather, she is the daughter of the PC\u2019s ex-husband. (She is also the oldest of the PC\u2019s children, but she was listed as the second minor claimant in the refugee claim.)\n[42] Based on the PC\u2019s testimony and the supplementary evidence, I do not find that there is any reason for concern that MC#2\u2019s biological father did not give consent for her to relocate to Canada.\n[43] The PC testified that MC#2\u2019s father never wanted the child and that her daughter has never been in contact with her biological father. The claimants also submitted Norwegian state documents regarding parental responsibility for each of the minor children. For MC#1 and MC#3 both the PC and AC are listed as the parents responsible,[9] but for MC#2, only the PC is listed as responsible.[10]\n[44] I have no reason to doubt the authenticity of the documents, while I also find them probative of the matter at hand. As such, I attach them high weight in corroborating the PC\u2019s allegations that XXXX\u2019s birth father is not involved in his daughter\u2019s life and that she, as the PC, is the sole parent responsible for her daughter.\n[45] As such, I find that there are not serious reasons for considering that 1(F)(b) applies to the PC in a case of potential child abduction. And because of that, I find that the PC is not excluded from refugee protection.\n\nNexus\n[46] To satisfy the definition of a \u201cConvention refugee\u201d found in section 96 of the IRPA, a claimant must establish that they face a serious possibility of persecution on account of their race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion in their country of nationality.\n[47] The PC alleges that she was targeted by her ultraconservative uncles, particularly XXXX XXXX, with sexual and other violence. Moreover, she alleges that she was subjected to severe restrictions, such as limitations on her movements outside the home and directives that she wear the burqa, because she was a girl.\n[48] Accordingly, I find, on a balance of probabilities, that XXXX XXXX and the other agents of persecution harmed the PC when they were young because she was a girl and that they continue to target her because she has been most instrumental in testifying against XXXX XXXX in Norwegian court. While I acknowledge that the agents of persecution\u2019s motivations for pursuing the PC now appear to be vendetta-related in nature, I note that the genesis of their hostility towards stems from her gender. Accordingly, I find that the agents of persecution have mixed motives for targeting the PC, but in line with the Federal Court finding in Canada vs. B344 \u2013 namely, that \u201cit has been recognized that mixed motives of persecution may form the basis of a well-founded fear of persecution. Nexus is established when at least one of the motives is based on a Convention ground\u201d[11] \u2013 I find that the PC has established a nexus to the Convention ground of membership in a particular social group: girls and women.\n[49] Because of that, I have assessed her case based on section 96 of the IRPA.\n[50] As for the other claimants, I find that they also have a nexus to the Convention since they are being targeted by the agent of persecution because of their family connection to the PC \u2013 a person who is being targeted, in part, on a Convention ground (membership in a particular social group \u2013 girls and women). Accordingly, I have also assessed their claim according to section 96 of the IRPA.\nCredibility\n[51] I found the claimants to be credible witnesses.\n[52] In line with the Federal Court\u2019s decision in Maldonado v. Canada, a claimant\u2019s sworn testimony creates a presumption that the individual\u2019s allegations are true unless there is a reason to doubt their truthfulness.[12] In this case, I found the claimants who testified \u2013 the PC and AC \u2013 to be credible, consistent, sincere and forthright in their testimony.\n[53] The PC testified extensively and credibly about her numerous efforts to escape the abuse from XXXX XXXX and her extended family but that the agents of harm were able to track her because Norwegian authorities refused to change her social insurance number (SIN) and because of a Norwegian friend in the child protection services, XXXX XXXX.\n[54] Regarding the SIN, the PC stated that the agents of persecution could track her because that number never changed, even though police changed her address and her name (they changed her last name to the Norwegian \u201cXXXX\u201d). At one point, the PC asked authorities to also change the SIN because her uncle or his associates were always finding her, yet police told her that \u201cthere has to be extreme harm against you for that.\u201d The PC retorted, noting that there had been attempted murder (XXXX XXXX\u2019s attack on his cousin), yet the official said their hands were tied because there are rules.\n[55] During the hearing, I also asked the PC how she knew that XXXX had secretly updated XXXX XXXX and his wife about her different addresses over the years, resulting in continued threats against her. The PC stated that XXXX XXXX (XXXX XXXX\u2019s wife) and XXXX had grown up together in Norway and had remained friends later in life. The PC stated that she did not personally meet XXXX in her office until 2013 but that, growing up, she had heard her name occasionally and that XXXX XXXX would buy Christmas and Easter gifts for XXXX.\n[56] I asked why XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX routinely bought gifts for a Norwegian official on Christian holidays given their profile as ultraconservative Muslims who forbade women in the family from leaving the house if at all possible. In response, the PC stated, \u201cIn the house, they call the non-Muslims pigs,\u201d adding that XXXX XXXX would say, \u201cIf I need them [white Norwegians], I will buy them.\u201d Hearing such comments from her uncle, the PC once asked him, \u201c\u2018If they are all pigs, why don\u2019t you go to Pakistan?\u2019 So he slapped me and said, \u2018Why are you so free to everybody?\u2019\u201d\n[57] The PC added that she eventually went to XXXX\u2019s office in 2013 to confront the woman, asking how she could assist XXXX XXXX when he knew of his violence. XXXX, however, simply told the PC that XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX are \u201cmy good friends, and I could not go against that.\u201d\n[58] I am satisfied by this testimony, finding that the PC has provided sufficient credible evidence to establish, on a balance of probabilities, how the agents of persecution successfully tracked her over the years despite Norway\u2019s ostensible safeguards against such abuse from within the system.\n[59] The claimants also submitted numerous documents in support of their claims. I give high weight to the following documents, as I find them to be authentic and probative in establishing, on a balance of probabilities, the credibility of their allegations that the agents of persecution have been targeting them, particularly the PC, and that Norwegian police encouraged them to leave the country.\n\u00b7 Exhibit 4.9: A letter from XXXX XXXX, a police chief in Oslo, confirming that the PC has been the primary witness in a family case and that she been the victim of violence. XXXX, who wrote the letter in XXXX 2020 \u2013 after the claimants fled to Canada \u2013 stated that it was his belief that there was a \u201chigh risk\u201d that the PC and her family would be subjected to reprisals and violence if she returned to Norway because of the court case against XXXX XXXX and that the threat would remain even if the suspect were convicted.\n\no I initially had concerns about the authenticity of XXXX\u2019s letter, as it was written in English, rather than Norwegian. Asked how she received the letter, the PC stated that XXXX headed the police investigation unit in Oslo and that she did not have any dealings with him while in Norway. The PC stated that after coming to Canada, she avoided claiming refugee protection because she was waiting to hear word from Norwegian authorities about whether it was safe to return to Norway. On this front, a police official that was assisting her, XXXX XXXX, asked her to wait. Later, XXXX said she would provide information on the case, ultimately providing XXXX\u2019s letter. The PC testified that she was surprised to receive a letter in English, rather than Norwegian, and that she was shocked that the letter did not say \u201cwe can give you this kind of protection,\u201d but rather just \u201cthrew me out of the country.\u201d I am satisfied by the PC\u2019s explanation, accepting her testimony that she was genuinely not expecting to receive an English-language letter that, far from inviting her back to Norway, encouraged her to remain outside the country. Accordingly, I accept XXXX\u2019s letter as authentic;\n\n\u00b7 Exhibit 4.10: A signed summons from Vest police officer XXXX XXXX instructing the PC to come to the XXXX sheriff\u2019s office on XXXX XXXX, 2019, and XXXX XXXX, 2019, to assist with a criminal case;\n\n\u00b7 Exhibit 4.11: A Norwegian-language letter (with accompanying certified English translation) from XXXX XXXX, the superintendent of police and coordinator for vulnerable persons in Bergen, dated XXXX XXXX XXXX, 2019. XXXX stats that \u201cit will be very beneficial for XXXX XXXX XXXX and her family to move from Norway in relation to her situation;\u201d\n\n\u00b7 Exhibit 4.12: A report from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX from XXXX XXXX, 2019, in which an anonymous caller complains that the PC has been acting violently towards her children and that she is considering marrying off MC#2 in an Islamic wedding;\n\n\u00b7 Exhibit 4.13: A copy of an indictment against XXXX XXXX from the Oslo Regional Public Prosecution Office accusing him of committing violence against family members from 2002 until 2018;\n\n\u00b7 Exhibit 4.14: A court decision from XXXX XXXX, 2020, sentencing XXXX XXXX to five years in jail for domestic violence. The sentence also prohibited him from having any contact with two of the PC\u2019s sisters for five years;\n\n\u00b7 Exhibit 4.15: An email from XXXX XXXX, a superintendent of police in Oslo and the PC\u2019s point person with Norwegian authorities, confirming that XXXX XXXX was released from prison by XXXX 2022.\n\n\u00b7 Exhibit 7: A long-form article from journalists XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX of XXXX, Norway\u2019s XXXX XXXX, titled \u201cXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.\u201d The story, which was published in XXXX 2020, follows the process against XXXX XXXX and includes interviews with XXXX XXXX. The piece provides a long expose into the PC\u2019s case, including her escape from the family home in 2006 and her joy that police were finally summoning her to hear her story in XXXX 2019. Although the article identifies the PC as \u201cXXXX,\u201d it includes several of her pictures, including ones of her in her new life on \u201ca different continent\u201d (Canada) and her picture as she testifies in a Norwegian courtroom by videolink. As such, I find, on a balance of probabilities, that XXXX is the PC and that the XXXX story collaborates many of the PC\u2019s allegations of longstanding abuse at the hands of XXXX XXXX.\n\nNo Negative Inference Due to Claimants\u2019 Delay in Claiming Protection\n[60] I make no negative inference about the claimants\u2019 delay in applying for protection in Canada.\n[61] The claimants arrived in Canada on XXXX XXXX XXXX, 2019, and filed for protection in April 2020.\n[62] As alluded to in the discussion about Exhibit 4.9, the PC stated that she and her family left for Canada in the expectation that Norwegian police would contact her again to explain what kind of measures they could take to protect her in the future from XXXX XXXX. \u201cI called them, should I come back? I asked XXXX XXXX, but she said, \u2018I will get back to you,\u2019\u201d the PC said in her testimony, adding that XXXX finally sent her senior Oslo police official XXXX\u2019s aforementioned letter and told her to \u201cshow it to immigration in Canada.\u201d\n[63] I accept the PC\u2019s testimony about this matter, finding it reasonable that she and her family did not claim protection in Canada for roughly XXXX months because they were expecting Norwegian police to detail a plan for protection. When Norwegian police, however, instead told them to remain outside Scandinavia, the claimants immediately file for protection.\n[64] Accordingly, I make no negative inference about their delay in claiming protection.\n\nFinal Credibility Findings\n[65] Ultimately, I found the claimant\u2019s testimony to be consistent and devoid of major inconsistencies, while I have also given significant weight to the aforementioned documents. Furthermore, I accept as reasonable the PC\u2019s explanation as to why the claimants delayed in claiming protection in Canada. As a result, I accept the following allegations as fact:\n\u00b7 That XXXX XXXX and his wife subjected the PC to years of physical and sexual abuse, as well as draconian restrictions on her movements;\n\n\u00b7 That the PC escaped her difficult living situation in 2006;\n\n\u00b7 That Norwegian police moved the PC to different addresses and provided her with a new name but that her uncle and his wife continued to stalk and threaten her because a family friend in Norwegian social services, XXXX XXXX, informed them of the PC\u2019s whereabouts;\n\n\u00b7 That the PC acted as a witness in a criminal investigation against XXXX XXXX in which a Norwegian court ultimately sentenced him to five years in jail in XXXX 2020;\n\n\u00b7 That XXXX XXXX was released from jail by XXXX 2022;\n\n\u00b7 That XXXX XXXX continually made threats against the PC and her family (i.e., the other claimants) and that he falsely accused the PC of attempting to marry off the MC#2 in an Islamic wedding when she was just 9 years old;\n\n\u00b7 That more than one high-level Norwegian police official advised the PC and her family to leave Norway because of the threat that XXXX XXXX poses.\n[66] Because of these findings of fact, I find that the claimants have established, on a balance of probabilities, that they have a genuine subjective fear of persecution in Norway.\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution\n[67] Based on the claimants\u2019 testimony and the available documentary evidence, I find that they have a well-founded fear of persecution in Norway.\n[68] The PC endured decades of abuse at the hands of her uncle XXXX XXXX because she was a woman who challenged his ultraconservative restrictions on her life. The PC escaped from her uncle\u2019s home in 2006, yet she continued to face threats and attacks over the next decade even though Norwegian authorities had ostensibly moved her to safe addresses in different places in Norway. During the court process, XXXX XXXX also made threats against the rest of her family.\n[69] Police, furthermore, have even told the PC that the threats against her and her family \u201cwill remain even when [the] perpetrators are convicted.\u201d\n[70] Given XXXX XXXX\u2019s pattern of behaviour, as well as senior Norwegian police officials\u2019 belief that he is likely to continue to pose a threat even after conviction, I find that XXXX XXXX has demonstrated the enduring means and motivation to pursue the PC and her family in Norway.\n[71] As such, I find that the claimants have established that they have a well-founded, serious possibility of persecution in Norway.\nState Protection\n[72] I find that adequate state protection is not available to the claimants.\n[73] States are presumed to be capable of protecting their citizens, except in cases of complete state breakdown. The more democratic the country, the more the claimant must do to show that they have exhausted all available means of obtaining state protection.[13] Claimants are expected to approach the state for protection unless it is unreasonable to do so.\n[74] In this case, Norway has a stable, functioning democratic government, meaning it is presumed to capable of protecting its citizens. Indeed, the objective evidence indicates that Norway is a highly functioning democracy that enjoys the rule of law. Its judiciary, for instance, is independent, and civilian authorities maintain effective control over the security forces. Norway is also one of the least corrupt countries in the world.[14]\n[75] The U.S. Department of State (DOS) report on human rights practices for 2021 also reported that there were no significant human rights abuses in Norway and that the Norwegian government investigated officials who allegedly committed violations of human rights. Furthermore, the U.S. DOS noted a number of avenues by which individuals or organizations may seek civil remedies for human rights violations.[15]\n[76] Freedom House, furthermore, gave Norway maximum marks in terms of its political rights and civil liberties, stating the following: \u201cNorway is one of the most robust democracies in the world. Elections are free and fair, and power regularly rotates between parties. Civil liberties are respected, with independent media and civil society actors holding the government to account. Discrimination against Roma and other marginalized groups remains a problem.\u201d[16]\n[77] But while I acknowledge the objective evidence that paints the robustness of Norwegian institutions in a glowing light, I find that adequate state protection ultimately does not exist for the claimants in their particular circumstances.\n[78] In both Loaiza[17] and Leon Davila,[18] the Federal Court has instructed decision-makers to conduct a contextual analysis of the claimants\u2019 personal circumstances. Additionally, I note that there have been debates over whether the level of state protection must be adequate or effective but that the Federal Court has ruled in Zalzali that the degree of protection required is not perfection, but adequacy.[19]\n[79] Crucially, the Federal Court has noted in Burai and other decisions that the adequacy of state protection is not dependent simply on the state\u2019s efforts or intentions, but the adequacy of the protection at the operational level. In Burai, the Federal Court reiterated that an appropriate state protection analysis requires an assessment of the adequacy of a state\u2019s protection at the operational level, rather than just its efforts or intentions.[20] Similarly in Gonzalez Camargo, the Court stated, \u201cThe Board failed to correctly recognize that the assessment of the adequacy of state protection involves more than a consideration of state efforts. This caused the Board to focus on state efforts and not consider the operational adequacy of state protection for the applicants and individuals in like circumstances.\u201d[21]\n[80] In what follows, I will discuss the claimants\u2019 efforts to obtain the Norwegian state\u2019s protection, as well as the operational adequacy of the state\u2019s protection.\n[81] Claimants Have Exhausted All Efforts to Access State Protection\n[82] I find that the claimants have done everything in their power to access state protection. I also find that the state has made numerous efforts to provide the claimants protection but that, ultimately, it proves inadequate.\n[83] Starting in 2006, the PC fled her uncle\u2019s home to find help with the authorities. Norwegian officials changed her name and sent her to different addresses in Oslo, Bergen and other places in southern Norway. Citing rules and the lack of an extreme threat against the PC, however, officials refused to change her SIN number, thereby allowing the agents of persecution\u2019s family friend to pass along the PC\u2019s changing addresses to her assailants. Later, the PC helped testify against her uncle, resulting in his conviction for domestic abuse.\n[84] During the trial but before the claimants fled to Canada, the PC was summoned to the XXXX sheriff\u2019s office twice in XXXX 2019 as part of the case against XXXX XXXX. Following those meetings, the PC had an appointment with police security officials in which Norwegian authorities offered her a \u201ccode 6,\u201d the country\u2019s top security code, and a panic button. They also moved the family into a bulletproof house after XXXX XXXX reportedly threatened a police lawyer in court during a hearing.\n[85] And even after the claimants fled to Canada, they still made regular inquiries with Norwegian officials about a return, expecting that senior police officials like XXXX XXXX would provide direction as to how authorities would protect the claimants after XXXX XXXX completed his sentence. But after waiting for roughly XXXX months, they received correspondence from the top police investigation official in Oslo, XXXX XXXX, advising them to remain abroad because the PC \u201cand her family will not be safe in Norway, particularly not after [XXXX XXXX\u2019s] case [has] been in court.\u201d[22]\n[86] In summary, the PC first approached police in 2006, and she approached authorities during every step of her problems with the agents of persecution, right up to the top police investigation official in Oslo. I also find that there is no evidence in the National Documentation Package (NDP) for Norway that there are any other avenues that were available to her.\n[87] Accordingly, I find that the claimants exhausted all domestic avenues of state protection in Norway.\n\nNorwegian State\u2019s Protection Is Ultimately Inadequate on Operational Level\n[88] I also find that Norway is unable to offer adequate state protection at an operational level.\n[89] In making this finding, I acknowledge that the Norwegian state extended numerous efforts over more than a decade to provide protection to the PC, as would be expected from a highly functioning democracy. On the other side, I also agree with the claimants that racism within Norwegian institutions such as the child welfare system and in some aspects of society in general \u2013 a point highlighted in the claimants\u2019 disclosure[23] \u2013 likely paid a role in authorities essentially washing their hands of the claimants (who, to reiterate, are of Pakistani and Afghan origin) by encouraging them to remain outside of Norway.\n[90] Ultimately, however, I find that the issue of racism is not determinative of the adequacy of Norwegian state protection on an operational level. That is, I do not find Norwegian state protection is ultimately inadequate on an operational level because of racism within the country\u2019s institutions but because there simply does not exist any state protection that could protect the claimants in their particular circumstances.\n[91] Consider the following testimony from the PC regarding her conversations in Norway with XXXX XXXX, the superintendent of police and coordinator for vulnerable persons in Bergen, when she was discussing the options of protection during the trial: \u201cXXXX asked, \u2018What will happen if your uncle is coming out of jail? He also threatened the police lawyer in court. We recommend that you move from Norway, Europe and Scandinavia.\u201d During the same conversation, XXXX added: \u201cIt will be too expensive to protect you all your life. We can protect you one year, but what happens after two years? [XXXX XXXX] is violent. If he did it before against his cousin [the incident for which XXXX XXXX was jailed in the 2000s], he will do it again against you.\u201d\n[92] XXXX\u2019s comments to the PC indicate that, even if officials had not seemingly washed their hands of the issue once the claimants had left Norway, no protection in Norway is ever going to be effective against an agent of persecution whose means and motivation to harm the claimants has been established since the 2000s.\n[93] I am mindful of the Court\u2019s ruling in Zalzali that state protection need only be adequate, rather than perfect. However, I find that it would be a dereliction of moral duty for Canada to similarly wash its hands of the claimants by refusing to extend protection by invoking the rule that the Norwegian state has offered adequate state protection through its numerous efforts throughout the years to offer the claimants protection. For all decision-makers, the question in every hearing ultimately boils down to where a claimant will be safe: Will they be safe, for instance, because there is no forward-facing risk, because they can avail themselves of state protection or because there is an internal flight alternative (IFA)? Or are none of these available, meaning that Canada\u2019s surrogate protection is necessary to extend safety to the claimant?\n[94] In the claimants\u2019 particular circumstances, I find the evidence is clear that the Norwegian state is unable to provide adequate protection to the claimants from this highly motivated agent of persecution. The answer to the question of whether Canada\u2019s surrogate protection is necessary in these unique circumstances is a resounding yes \u2013 especially as Norwegian state authorities have stated themselves that they can no longer protect the claimants after exhausting all other avenues to stop the agents of persecution.\n[95] Importantly, Canada can provide meaningful surrogate protection to these claimants because the agent of persecution does not have the means to locate them in Canada. When such a straightforward solution to the claimants\u2019 particular circumstances is readily available, I thus find that it would be inexcusable to reject their claim for protection by hiding behind Court rulings that indicate that state protection need not be perfect, but only adequate \u2013 even if the evidence indicates that making such a decision would, on a balance of probabilities, consign the claimants to a serious possibility of persecution in Norway.\n[96] For these reasons, I find that the presumption of state protection has been rebutted.\n\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[97] I also find that the claimants do not have a viable IFA in Norway.\n[98] As noted previously, the agents of persecution have demonstrated the means and motivation to pursue the PC around Norway, even when authorities had changed her name and her address. After she married the AC and the couple had their children, the primary agent of persecution, XXXX XXXX, also threatened the other claimants. Senior police officials in the country, moreover, advised the entire family to leave, arguing that XXXX XXXX is likely to insist on revenge after the PC\u2019s court testimony helped put him behind bars.\n[99] Given, thus, the agents of persecution\u2019s demonstrated pattern of locating and threatening the claimants at different locations around Norway, I find that there is no viable IFA available to them in Norway.\nCONCLUSION\n[100] For the forgoing reasons, I determine that the claimants are Convention refugees pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA; as such, the Board accepts their claims.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n[1] Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n[2] Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (IRB) Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 4: Gender Considerations in Proceedings Before the Immigration and Refugee Board, July 2022.\n[3] Exhibit 2.\n[4] Exhibit 4.1.\n[5] Exhibit 1.\n[6] Exhibit 3.3, National Documentation Package, Pakistan, 31 January 2023, tab 3.2: Whether a former Pakistani citizen can reacquire his\/her Pakistani citizenship, including requirements and procedures (2012- November 2015).

In rendering my reasons, I have considered and applied the Chairperson\u2019s guidelines on women refugee claimants fearing gender-related persecution as well as the Chairperson\u2019s guideline on proceedings before the IRB involving sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, and sex characteristics to ensure that appropriate accommodations are made in questioning you, as well as the overall hearing process, and in assessing your claim.\n\nDETERMINATION\n\n[2] I find you are a Convention refugee as you have established a well-founded fear of persecution based on a Convention ground.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nIdentity\n\n[3] Your passport lists your first name as XXXX and your gender as male. However, you are a transgender woman and you prefer XXXX and the female pronouns. According to the CBSA notes, when you first came to Canada, you used the name XXXX in the past, and this is recorded in the XXXX 2022 interview with CBSA in Exhibit 1. I also note that the medical reports vary. Some use XXXX and some use XXXX, with the same last name. So, I find that your identity as a national of Lebanon is established by your testimony as well as the supporting documentation on file, which includes a certified true copy of your passport in Exhibit 1.\n\n[4] You told me that you were not sure if your father holds Armenian citizenship but that he might. And, in fact, during the break, you conferred with your brother, who said, no, he does not. I would be inclined to agree with you based on the Armenian law as well in Tab 3.1, the law of the Republic of Armenia on the citizenship of the Republic of Armenia states under article 1 that you are not allowed to hold citizenship simultaneously in Armenia and in another state. Article 11 states that any children born to Armenian parents are Armenian regardless of where they were born. However, you are a Lebanese citizen, and I am satisfied that even if \u2014 and this is a big if based on what you have told me \u2014 your father had held Armenian citizenship when you were born, you are not able to hold Armenian citizenship because holding citizenship in another state \u2014 because you hold citizenship in another state, Lebanon.\n\n[5] So, your allegations are set out in your Basis of Claim form and by your testimony. The following is an extremely brief summary. You are transgender and you fear persecution as a transgender women if you were to return to Lebanon.\n\nCredibility\n\n[6] A presumption before me is that what you tell me is true. However, this can be rebutted in appropriate circumstances, such as omissions, lack of detail, contradictions, et cetera. In your case, you provided detailed answers to my questions. You seem very well-aware of and well-informed. And I really found nothing to disbelieve you on. In fact, I accept what you have told me as credible.\n\n[7] Furthermore, you provided credible documentation in support of your claim, including Canadian medical documents reporting XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX over time in response to treatment. Upon review of the lab results, I find no reason to doubt their authenticity and, therefore, place significant weight on them as they serve to corroborate what you have been telling me.\n\n[8] So, I found you to be credible witness and you have backed it up with your documentation as well. So, I believe what you have alleged in support of your claim.\n\nNexus\n\n[9] I find the persecution you face has a nexus to the Convention grounds. You have demonstrated a well-founded fear of persecution based on your membership in a particular social group, as a transgender woman. Therefore, I have assessed your claim under section 96.\n\n[10] Now, a well-founded fear of persecution must include both a subjective and an objective basis for that fear and it must be forward-looking. Based on your testimony, and supporting documents, as well as the country condition documents for Lebanon, I do find you have a well-founded fear of persecution for these reasons.\n\n[11] So, in terms of subjective fear, you came to Canada on XXXX XXXX of 2020 on a student visa. That student visa in Exhibit 1 shows it was valid until XXXX of 2024. You applied for asylum, signing your Basis of Claim form on January the 4th of 2022, while that student visa was still valid. You explained to me that you did not apply for asylum until over a year after your arrival because you thought at first that you would be able to apply to stay in Canada on a permit after graduation, but later, this felt too uncertain and risky to you to take a chance on that. You also told me that you sought out medical assistance with XXXX shortly after arriving in Canada and you were able to start XXXX XXXX within a few months of arriving. So, I find that you have adduced sufficient credible evidence to establish your subjective fear of returning to Lebanon.\n\nObjective Basis\n\n[12] I asked you what would happen if you went back to Lebanon to live as XXXX, and you said you would face legal as well as health issues. You said that it is not a good situation for transgender people in Lebanon. You said you had gone to doctors in Lebanon who refused to treat you when you were 17. You also told me that you researched the discrimination you would face in the workplace, that you have read news stories about that, and that you would not be able to have your state identity documents reflect your true gender. You told me that you would risk being killed, and, minimally, would suffer mentally, and that you had had a really difficult time when you were in Lebanon as well. And you told me quite clearly that you just simply would not be able to live as yourself in Lebanon.\n\n[13] There is abundant objective country evidence in the current National Documentation Package for Lebanon which confirms the situation for transgender women, such as yourself, in Lebanon. NDP 6.10, the Queer Refugee Hearings Program reported that while there are no specific stats, that LGBTQ activists estimate there are a couple of thousand transgender individuals in Lebanon and transgender women face systemic discrimination in education, employment, housing, and the provision of health care. They are also at greater risk of arbitrary arrest, which is often accompanied by physical violence by law enforcement officials. Trans women also face routine violence and the threat of violence by members of the public and they are denied police protection, which compromises their ability to live in safety and positions them in a perpetual state of precarity. This discrimination, which emanates from severe social stigma and isolation, is worsened by a lack of resources tailored for trans people\u2019s needs and by their difficulty in obtaining identification documents that reflect their true gender and expression.\n\n[14] NDP 6.3 says many of the same things about the systemic discrimination and education, which you, in fact, described to me your experiences in education when you were in grade school, employment, housing, and the provision of health care, greater risk for arbitrary arrest. Now, while the Lebanese law does not specifically explicitly criminalize being trans, article 534 of the Penal Code punishes any sexual intercourse contrary to the order of nature with up to a year in prison. And the law has been regularly enforced to arrest transgender women who are misidentified as gay men. Trans people are also targeted under laws of violating public morality, incitement to debauchery, and secret prostitution. This is NDP 6.4. The most common patterns for arrests are based on individuals visually inscribed with non-normative gender looks or through collecting mobile data mostly accessed during the investigation without any written judicial authorization.\n\n[15] So, I mentioned a bit about the police targeting and violence, and a 2015 study identified anecdotal evidence from local trans women who reported either themselves or their friends had been arrested several times on the streets for masquerading as women and were often detained for long periods of time without receiving information or legal assistance. A 2019 report by Helem, Human Rights Watch, and MOSAIC found that transgender women are at greater risk of arbitrary arrest and physical violence at police checkpoints. That is NDP 6.9. In addition to the state, there is considerable non-state violations of the rights of LGBTQ people, including abuse, assault, and an absence of legal protection for these human rights violations, according to NDP 6.5.\n\n[16] So, I am satisfied that this ongoing systemic discrimination, harassment, and, in fact, violence, and other forms of mistreatment of transgender women both from state and non-state sources denies you your key human dignity and your core human rights to live and be who you are, and that, therefore, this amounts to persecution. Accordingly, I find that your fear of persecution in Lebanon is well-founded.\n\nState Protection and Internal Flight Alternative\n\n[17] In this case, a primary agent of persecution is the state, so the persecution that you would face if you return to Lebanon would be at the hands of the authorities. And accordingly, find there is no state protection available to you and the presumption of state protection is rebutted.\n\n[18] The state is in control of all of its territories and the mistreatment of transgender women is found across society throughout the country. Therefore, on the evidence before me, I find that you would face a serious possibility of persecution throughout Lebanon. There is no viable internal flight alternative where you could safely relocate given your particular circumstances.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[19] Based on all the evidence before me, I conclude that you are a Convention refugee, and therefore, I am accepting your claim.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

This uncle, according to the claimant, wanted to obtain money from the claimant\u2019s mother, and to take possession of some family assets. When unsuccessful, he took revenge by causing the death by \u201cmystical means\u201d of several close family members of the claimant \u2013 his mother, in 2016; his sister, in 2022; and his father, in 2023. The claimant alleges that these three family members were in good health when they suddenly passed away from illnesses that the doctors could not diagnose. The claimant left Haiti after his mother\u2019s death and lived in Chile from 2017 to 2021; he alleges that he was unable to obtain permanent resident status there. He claims that his uncle in Haiti continued to utter threats and to this day intends to harm the claimant as an act of revenge.\nDETERMINATION\n\n[3] For the reasons that follow, I find that the claimant is a person in need of protection in the meaning of section 97(1) of the IRPA.\nANALYSIS\nThe claimant\u2019s identity is established\n\n[4] The claimant\u2019s identity was established on a balance of probabilities through his oral testimony and the certified true copy of his Haitian passport,[2] which is on file.\nThe claimant is not excluded Article 1E of the Convention\n\n[5] Given the claimant\u2019s prior residence in Chile, the Tribunal notified[3] the Minister of the possibility that the claimant might be excluded under Article 1E of the Convention. The Minister responded[4] to the invitation, informing the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) that they would not intervene in the hearing of the claim.\n[6] Article 1E of the United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees stipulates:\nThis Convention shall not apply to a person who is recognized by the competent authorities of the country in which he has taken residence as having the rights and obligations which are attached to the possession of the nationality of that country.\n[7] This article has been incorporated in s. 98 of the IRPA:\nA person referred to in Section E or F of Article 1 of the Convention is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection.\n[8] The applicable legal test for Article 1E exclusion was established by the Federal Court of Appeal in the case of Zeng.[5] Under the Zeng framework of analysis, the first step is to establish whether, at the time of the hearing, the claimant has status in another country that is substantially similar to that of its nationals. If the answer to this question is yes, then the claimant should be excluded under Article 1E of the Convention. If the answer is no, then the Panel must consider whether the claimant previously had such status and lost it or had access to it and failed to acquire it. If the answer to this question is yes, then the following factors must be considered in deciding whether the claimant should be excluded: the reason for the loss of status (voluntary or involuntary); whether the claimant could return to the third country where he had status; the risk the claimant would face in the home country; Canada\u2019s international obligations; and any other relevant facts.\n[9] In the present case, when questioned at the hearing about the nature and validity of his residence status in Chile, the claimant testified that he had obtained a temporary resident status in Chile some time after his arrival and that this status expired a long time ago. He testified that he was unable to present any document, such as a residence card, since his belonging had been stolen on the way to Canada. He further explained that he had attempted to prolong his residency rights in Chile and\/or to obtain a permanent residence status, and had submitted an application to the Chilean authorities, but he never received any response, in spite of his continued checking and following up; he claimed that he had been repeatedly told to wait. I have no reason to disbelieve the claimant\u2019s testimony on this question, and in the absence of evidence to the contrary, I accept on a balance of probabilities that the claimant\u2019s status in Chile was temporary and that he did not obtain a residence status, such as permanent residence, that would accord to him rights and responsibilities essentially similar to those accorded to Chilean nationals. Therefore, the answer to the first and second questions of the Zeng test is \u201cno\u201d. The determinative question, therefore, is whether the claimant had access to such status, but failed to obtain it. Having found earlier that his testimony that he tried to do so but was unsuccessful in that he got no response over a long period of time, to be credible on a balance of probabilities, I find that the answer to this question is also \u201cno\u201d.\n[10] For the above reasons, applying the Zeng test to the present circumstances, I find that the claimant is not excluded under Article 1E of the Convention and proceed with examining his allegations against his country of origin, Haiti.\nNexus to a Convention ground is not established\n\n[11] The claimant\u2019s core allegations when it comes to Haiti consist of fearing for his life and physical integrity because of an extended family member\u2019s intent to harm him, driven by jealousy and a desire to take revenge. It is not alleged, and it does not arise from the evidence before me, that the claimant fears persecution on the basis of any of the enumerated Convention grounds \u2013 race, nationality, religion, membership in a particular social group or political opinion. For this reason, I find that a connection to a Convention ground has not been established. There is also no evidence that the claimant may be exposed to a risk of torture in the meaning of section 97(1)a of the IRPA. Therefore, I have assessed the claim under s. 97(1)b of the Act.\nThe claimant\u2019s key allegations are credible\n\n[12] In the case of Maldonado[6] the Federal Court established the principle of presumption of truth, where a refugee claimant\u2019s sworn testimony is presumed truthful unless there is a reason to doubt its veracity. In the present case, I found the claimant\u2019s testimony to be direct and spontaneous, sufficiently detailed, and consistent with his Basis of Claim (BOC)[7] narrative and the documentary evidence[8] presented in support of his allegations. He submitted in evidence copies of death certificates for his mother, sister and father, as well as letter of testimony from a friend of the family, corroborating the claimant\u2019s allegations regarding the conflict with the said uncle and the latter\u2019s jealousy, that the death of the claimant\u2019s mother was unexplained by medical professionals, and that the claimant left Haiti as a result of fearing his uncle.\n[13] I find that, on the basis of his testimony and the documentary evidence, the claimant has established the following circumstances on a balance of probabilities:\n[14] There was a conflict in his family stemming form jealousy on the part of an uncle, where he uttered threats and wanted to claim some assets.\n[15] Three family members of the claimant, his mother, his sister and his father died within a period of six years, and in the absence of a specific medical explanation, the claimant, as well as others close to the family, believe that their deaths were caused by that uncle through \u201cmystical\u201d means.\n[16] The alleged agent of harm has maintained his grudge and has an ongoing desire to exact revenge on the claimant as a member of the family.\nNature of the risk of harm\n\n[17] Having found that the above circumstances have been established on a balance of probabilities, I have examined the nature of the alleged risk of harm for the claimant. I have no doubt that the claimant sincerely and strongly believes that his close family members\u2019 deaths occurred as a result of a voodoo curse cast by his uncle or at his request. While the death certificates presented in evidence do not identify the cause of death, thus, there is no evidence contrary to the claimant\u2019s allegations that all three were in good health and the doctors could not identify a particular medical condition that led to the loss of life, I am not prepared to accept a novel interpretation of the natural word, one where it is possible to cause someone\u2019s death through mystical means. I have, therefore, examined the available objective evidence found in the National Documentation Package (NDP) for Haiti[9] in view of illuminating the basis of the belief that the use of voodoo can inflict actual physical harm and death.\n[18] According to Item 1.29 of the NDP, the official religions in Haiti are Catholicism and voodoo, where voodoo is practiced by about 2.1% of the population. Item 1.7 states that as many as 50%-80% percent of Haitians incorporate some elements of voodoo culture or practice in addition to another religion. Different sources in the NDP, such as Items 1.18, 1.41 and 12.2, indicate that, in Haiti, under the influence of voodooist beliefs, calamities, epidemics and even socio-political problems are commonly attributed to supernatural causes, such as evil spirits and curses. An ethologist cited in Section 1.2 of Item 12.2 of the NDP describes voodoo as \u201ca general system of practices and knowledge related to illness, care and healing [\u2026]\u201d (translation); voodoo, in addition to being an African religion, is defined in this source as a system of care with magical-religious aspects that is relied upon in a similar manner that medicine is relied upon in Western societies.\n[19] When it comes to the actual or perceived use of voodoo in interpersonal conflicts or as a form of revenge, Item 7.4 of the NDP mentions a 2019 report about two voodoo practitioners who were killed because they were believed to have used \u201coccult powers\u201d to kill their neighbours. According to Item 7.6, voodoo curses are a known form of revenge in Haiti. A report by the French refugee and stateless persons protection office \u2013 OFPRA, at Item 12.2 of the NDP, elaborates on the use of \u201cwitchcraft\u201d for criminal purpose in Haiti, including in the context of intra-family conflict. This source describes what seems to be an elaborate system of beliefs and concepts related to the possibility of influencing the combat between the spirits responsible for the life and protection of one individual against another, where rituals and ceremonies are used to this end and turning a family member into a zombie is mentioned as form of harm inflicted in an internal familial dispute. Notably, according to the same source, such activities are penalized by law where Art. 246 of the Criminal Code specifies that using substances to produce death or a lethargic state in another person qualifies as poisoning constituting murder or attempted murder. I find that this definition of the offence is an indicator that, while some people may believe that a death was caused by purely spiritual or \u201cmystical\u201d means, in the context of voodoo practices in Haiti when they are used for criminal purposes, much more conventional means, such as poisoning, may be employed. Thus, I find that it is not clearly implausible, that, in the present case, the claimant\u2019s family members\u2019 deaths were caused by non-mystical conditions, such as poisoning, even though he strongly believes otherwise.\n[20] On the basis of the above, I find that the risk faced by the claimant is a risk to his life or physical integrity. I find that this risk is personal to him, as it stems from the desire of a family member to exact revenge against the claimant specifically and is not faced by the general population in Haiti. It is not a risk arising from the application of lawful sanctions, and it is not caused by the inability of the state to provide medical care.\n\nState protection\n\n[21] The NDP for Haiti contains abundant information speaking to the inability of the state to provide protection to its citizens from criminal acts, which are widespread and committed with impunity. According to Item 7.6, there is little to no protection in Haiti from acts of revenge; the Haitian police lack resources to protect targets of revenge and policemen are often themselves targeted. The judiciary, according to the same source, is also under-resourced, as it is ineffective and susceptible to corruption. Further evidence in this respect can be found at Items 7.9, and 10.2, among others. For this reason, I find that the presumption of state protection has been refuted by clear and convincing evidence and that the claimant cannot rely on such protection in Haiti.\n\nInternal Flight Alternative\n\n[22] The objective evidence similarly indicates an absence of a viable Internal Flight Alternative (IFA) for the claimant in Haiti. Item 7.6 of the NDP points out that the principal means by which an assailant would locate their target in Haiti is through the use of informal networks and word-of-mouth. This is an effective means of locating victims, according to the same source, as outsiders to a particular area are easily recognized and rumours quickly spread. It is also important to consider that merely travelling to an IFA location would expose the claimant to significant risks of generalized criminality, given the evidence, at Item 14.1, that persons returning from abroad are more likely to be kidnapped for ransom, and that criminal gangs exercise control over some of the main routes. Therefore, I find that the claimant does not have a viable IFA anywhere in Haiti.\nCONCLUSION\n\n[23] Based on the reasons provided above, I find that the claimant is a person in need of protection under s. 97(1) of the IRPA.\n[24] The claim is accepted.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n[1] Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27, as amended, sections 96 and 97(1).\n[2] Exhibit 1.\n[3] Exhibit 4.\n[4] Exhibit 5.\n[5] M.C.I. v.

        "unofficial_text":"2023 RLLR 103\n\nCitation: 2023 RLLR 103\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: September 28, 2023\nPanel: Laurie Letheren\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): N\/A\nCountry: Russia\nRPD Number: TC3-03236\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2024-00593\nATIP Pages: N\/A\n\nDECISION\n\n[1] MEMBER: So, this is the decision in the claim for refugee protection made by XXXX XXXX, TC3-03236. You claim to be a citizen of Russia and you are claiming refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n\n[2] Your allegations in support of your claim are set out in your Basis of Claim form, which is marked as Exhibit 2.\n\nSummary\n\n[3] You fear harm and persecution from Russian society, police, and state authorities due to your sexual orientation, your gender identity and expression, as you identify as a gay man. I find that you have established a serious possibility of persecution from Russian society, police, and state authorities if you were to return to Russia.\n\n[4] Making my determination, I have considered and applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9: Proceedings before the Immigration and Refugee Board involving Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Expression and Sex Characteristics.\n\n[5] As I indicated earlier, I have found that on a balance of probabilities you establish both your personal identity and your identity as a Russian citizen based on your passport and other identity documents in the file, particularly your passport at Exhibit 1.\n\n[6] Your allegations of fear of persecution and harm due to your sexual orientation and gender identity expression as a gay man, and this is a nexus to a Convention ground of membership in a particular social group, and for that reason I have assessed this under section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n\n[7] You testified in a very earnest, responsive manner, you provided sufficient details to the questions, and your questions were \u2014 or your answers were spontaneous. I found that you were a very credible witness today.\n\n[8] You also submitted a number of documents in support of your allegations, were \u2014 a letter of support from your parents, a longtime friend, a letter of support from the XXXX XXXX XXXX for members of the LGBTQ community. You also had screenshots of conversations that you identified to be conversations on Grindr, Tinder, WhatsApp chat, which you said were conversations between you and other members of the LGBTQI community who identified as men and that you had used \u2014 you use these types of apps to try to meet other people who identify as men. And these also had photos which you described as your attendance at a Pride event this past summer. They showed you and your mother attending many events, speaking to people who were handing out pamphlets and other information, products, and that this was the first time you had been able to attend such an event.\n\n[9] So based on all of your credible testimony and your corroborating evidence, I find on a balance of probabilities your evidence demonstrates that you do identify as a gay man. I accept your evidence relating to your self awareness of your sexual orientation and your detailed evidence about your inability to share with others that you identified as a gay man, due to the homophobic attitudes in Russia and the risk of harm you would face as a gay man, if you were revealing this to other people. I accept your evidence of the fears you experienced which prevented you from attending clubs or other places where you could potentially meet other gay men in Russia, and how at one (1) point when you were meeting up with someone that you had connected through an app, that person tricked you and threatened you, as that person was there with a group of people and you ended up having to pay money to get them to stop threatening you. The fear lingered and you were unable to comfortably meet gay men while you were living in Russia, and this lasted until you left and came to Canada.\n\n[10] I accept your evidence that since coming to Canada you have lived openly and that, as you explained, the biggest change for you is that you no longer have to live in fear, that you can be open about being a gay man and not face threats or the threat of risk to your physical harm. You also explain that some of your friends here in Canada are away \u2014 aware that you are a gay man, and they accept this. Your parents are also aware and support you.\n\n[11] You explain that you have not yet had any long-term relationships as you have only been here in Canada for one (1) year, and you are still trying to be completely comfortable with living openly as a gay man. So, I find that your evidence demonstrates on a balance of probabilities to subjective fear if you were to return to Russia. Also, your fears are objectively well supported based on the objective evidence in the National Documentation Package for Russia.\n\n[12] The objective evidence paints a picture of mounting intolerance, discrimination, oppression, and repression of the rights of the LGBTQIA community. Item 2.2 of the National Documentation Package for Russia indicates that in December 2022, legislation was adopted extending the prohibition of propaganda for non-traditional sexual relationships, gender assignment and that \u2014 and from that aimed at minors and all age groups. Provisions of this legislation, including blocking websites, banning the sale of material, content containing information prohibited under the law, states fine for the vaguely defined administrative offence of propaganda, demonstrations of non-traditional sexual relations with preferences and providing information to the LGBTQIA community.\n\n[13] Item 6.2 of the NDP elaborates that the law prohibits positive and neutral information about LGBTQIA people to minors as well as adults. In an article dated January 1st, 2023, which you and your Counsel provided titled \u201cThe Russians\u2019 Crackdown On Gay Propaganda\u201d, indicates that since the law has passed, which expanded the scope of what is considered propaganda, increased the penalties, judges in Russia have ruled on five (5) times as many propaganda cases, as these cases displays anything \u2014 expand their use of the term propaganda to anything that displays LGBTQI relationships in movies, TV, books, music, news articles, internet pages, or even video games, which have all been blacklisted.\n\n[14] Item 6.2 The NDP describes the intensified anti-LGBTQIA hate speech throughout the year of 2022 and in context to this new propaganda law. For instance, in March, the head of the Russian Orthodox Church in endorse the invasion of Ukraine and identified one (1) of the causes as the struggle of the people of the Donbas against the Pride Marches. An MP co-launched a homophobic reality TV show entitled \u201cI Am Not Gay\u201d, where contestants have to guess who among them is gay. And as well, the head of \u2014 there have (inaudible) of Russians who have called out members of the trans community in NATO and the head of the National Cross-Country Ski Association called trans people disgusting and stated that LGBTQI people should be banned from the Olympics.\n\n[15] Item 6.2 reports the hate crimes against LGBTQI people have increased, including murder, physical violence, and extortion, and that the authorities have failed to classify them as anti-LGBTQI hate crimes, and this also indicates that several of LGBTQIA people came victims of fake dates in the year 2022.\n[16] As well \u2014 members of the LGBTQIA community faced discrimination with respect to essential goods and services such as housing, employment, or access to government services such as health care.\n\n[17] Item 3.1 indicate there is no law to prohibit discrimination against LGBTQI persons in housing, employment, or other services. Public officials portray LGBTQIA identities as contradictory to Russian and Orthodox values and described it as a Western phenomenon imposed by Europe as part of its agenda to weaken and alienate Russia. Hate speech against LGBTQI people is state led.\n\n[18] So, I find there is an abundance of cogent evidence for your fear of persecution and discrimination in Russia because of your sexual orientation, your gender identity, and expression as a person who identifies as a gay man. So, therefore you have a well-founded fear of persecution.\n\n[19] I have to consider whether there would be any protection \u2014 state protection from this persecution available to you, but considering the Kremlin\u2019s targeting of the LGBTQIA community in its expanded propaganda law, and the new legislation against LGBTQI rights, and also considering homophobia that is rampant within the country and its efforts to position itself in traditional values in opposition to the West, I find that there would be no state protection available to you, should you face this persecution.\n\n[20] As well, I have to consider whether there will be any place that is safe for you within Russia to live openly as a gay man. However, regarding the evidence that the homophobia, intolerance, hatred, and this law would apply throughout the country, I find that there is no safe and viable internal flight alternative that is available to you.\n\n[21] So, based on all of this evidence, both fear evidence and the objective evidence, I have concluded that you would face a serious possibility of persecution. You are a Convention refugee, and I have accepted your claim.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

The claimant is a citizen of Russia and is claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act or IRPA.\n\nALLEGATIONS\n\n[2] The allegations in support of the claim are set out in the claimant\u2019s Basis of Claim form marked as Exhibit 2. In summary, the claimant fears harm and persecution by members of a crime group headed by XXXX XXXX (ph), or XXXX (ph), who have targeted his business for a forced takeover. He also fears being charged for evasion and desertion under the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation for refusing conscription due to his opposition to the war in Ukraine.\n\nDETERMINATION\n\n[3] I find on a balance of probabilities that the claimant faces a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment at the hands of the crime organization headed by XXXX XXXX if he were to return to Russia.\n\nNexus\n\n[4] The claimant\u2019s fear of harm arises from criminality and corruption, and I find that there is no nexus to any of the five (5) Convention grounds.\n\nIdentity\n\n[5] The claimants\u2019 identity is established on a balance of probabilities by a certified true copy of his Russia-issued passport.\n\nCredibility\n\n[6] The claimant testified in a detailed, spontaneous, and straightforward manner with regard to the central elements of his claim. There were no inconsistencies or omissions which were material or which went to the core of the claim. I find that the claimant was a credible witness. The claimant also submitted documentary evidence which corroborated elements of the claim. He submitted certificate of registration, the charter of the corporation balance sheet, a statement of transactions and personal account of the company, and other documents to establish on a balance of probabilities his ownership of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The claimant also submitted a doctor\u2019s note with regard to his injuries and treatment on XXXX XXXX, 2022. He also submitted witness statements with attached passports of two (2) employees of his XXXX company with regard to the visits to the company on XXXX XXXX, 2021, and XXXX XXXX, 2022, of XXXX XXXX\u2019s men. He also submitted a statement from a neighbour regarding visits from unknown men to the claimant\u2019s apartment and inquiries about him, as well as the mailing of summons from the military enlistment office to the claimant\u2019s address. I have no reason to doubt the veracity of these documents, and as such I place great weight on them in support of the claim.\n\n[7] Based on the credible testimony and the corroborating documents, I find on a balance of probabilities that the claimant was a XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX of the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The XXXX company was engaged in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The business was very successful and profitable, and in 2021 its annual turnover was XXXX XXXX rubles. I find on a balance of probabilities that in the year 2020, the claimant started receiving intimidating phone calls from people who demanded sale of the company. The claimant refused to entertain these calls or engage in any conversation about the sale of his business. He largely ignored these phone calls or refused to answer these calls.\n\n[8] I find on a balance of probabilities that on XXXX XXXX, 2021, a man who introduced himself as XXXX (ph) showed up at the company office at Tver with two (2) well-built men. They offered to buy out the company for (inaudible) of XXXX XXXX XXXX rubles under threat that, if he refused, the claimant and his wife would not live to see the following year. I accept that on the very same day, the claimant went to the XXXX XXXX police department of the city of Tver and submitted a statement about the situation. The police investigator sneered and told him that he did not understand the complaint, and that these people likely came to him with a legitimate commercial offer which he did not like. The claimant believed, and I accept, on a balance of probabilities, that the investigator likely knew what was going on and was protecting or complicit with the men.\n\n[9] The claimant testified, and I accept, that he communicated with his suppliers and other directors of other companies about his situation, and he described XXXX and his men, and these people told him that he was dealing with XXXX XXXX\u2019s guys, who are known criminals in the region who engage in business racketeering, including extortion of a roof for protection of businesses. I find on a balance of probabilities that again, on XXXX XXXX, 2022, XXXX came to the office and told the claimant that his time was up and that they should be signing an agreement soon on the sale of the company. The claimant did not respond, deferring the decision in order to buy time to allow his wife to obtain a visa to Canada.\n\n[10] I accept that in XXXX of 2022 XXXX and his men came to the office several times and inquired about his whereabouts. The claimant was in Armenia at that time, attending to vaccination requirements for travel to Canada. I find on a balance of probabilities that on XXXX XXXX, 2022, the claimant was getting out of his car when two (2) unknown persons attacked him from behind. They hit him on his head and he lost consciousness. When he regained consciousness, the claimant saw a horrible sight at the back seat of his car. His dog lay dead. They killed his dog. He understood this to be his final warning and that the next time he would be killed. After receiving hospital treatment, the claimant and his wife packed two (2) suitcases, left their residence, and moved to his nephew\u2019s place in the village of XXXX , XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. On the way to the XXXX, they passed by a village where the claimant and his wife buried his dog. They stayed in XXXX until the claimant flew to Canada.\n\n[11] I accept on a balance of probabilities that on XXXX XXXX, 2022, the claimant spoke with a prosecutor\u2019s office in the city of XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The prosecutor interviewed him and told him that they would contact him. After two (2) weeks, the claimant had not heard from anyone, and so the claimant went to the prosecutor\u2019s office again. He was told that they had no information and the prosecutor asked him to leave his office and not to disturb him again. At that point, the claimant decided it was time to leave.\n\n[12] Since leaving for Canada, the claimant has heard from his neighbour that unknown people of muscular build have repeatedly come to his apartment building looking for him. The neighbour also advised that in the claimant\u2019s mailbox he found summons from the military enlistment office issued to the claimant\u2019s name with a demand to appear at the military registration and enlistment office at the place of registration. The claimant is opposed to military service and opposed to the \u2014 what he calls the criminal war in Ukraine. He does not want to fight in this illegal war.\n\nParticularized Risk\n\n[13] I find that the claimant\u2019s fear or risk arises from his ownership, and XXXX, and XXXX of a multimillion XXXX enterprise in Russia which has been targeted by a crime organization protected and supported by the state security apparatus. I find that this risk is particularized and personal to the claimant, and it is distinct from the generalized risk faced by the rest of the population in Russia.\n\nForward-Looking Risk\n\n[14] The objective evidence reveals links between organized crime and Russian state powers. Item 1.4 of the National Documentation Package for Russia, which is Exhibit 3 at page 192, describes the most dangerous types of police corruption in Russia, referring to high-order activities related to invisible, well-coordinated services which the police provide to organized crime groups, along with business racketeering. I note that Item 1.4 specifically identifies shakedowns, forced takeovers, selling assets, and the so-called roofing.\n\n[15] Exhibit 7 is a March 23, 2018, article entitled, Gangster\u2019s Paradise: how organized crime took over Russia, by Mark Galeotti, published in The Guardian. It describes the following, and I quote. \u201cA key characteristic of organized crime in today\u2019s Russia is the depth of its interconnectedness with the legitimate economy. Unpicking dirty from clean money in Russia is a hopeless task, not least because in the 1990s it was next to impossible to make serious amounts of money without engaging in practices that were ethically questionable at best, and downright illegal at worst.\n\n[16] \u2018Raiding\u2019 \u2013 the seizure of assets and companies through physical or legal coercion remains a serious problem, but it depends less on violence than it did in the past. One (1) British-based businessmen told me\u201d \u2014 the author \u2014 that in 2009 he had to fly to Moscow at a moment\u2019s notice on two (2) separate occasions because of attempts to steal one (1) of his properties. The first time, thugs appeared at the door and marched their way past the security guard. The businessmen had to call in favours from the local police on order to have them thrown out. The second time, though, the raiders came in the form of lawyers and bailiffs, bearing documents alleging the property had been signed into their possession in order to discharge a (non-existent) debt. Whereas getting rid of the thugs took a few hours and, I suspect, a moderate bribe to the police chief, dealing with the legal challenge took weeks, and large amounts paid out in legal fees and illegal inducements.\n\n[17] This does not make the new gangster-businessmen champions of the rule of law. They appreciate a degree of predictability within the system, and also \u2013 now that they are rich \u2013 a state apparatus dedicated to preserving property rights. However, they are also well aware that an honest, well-functioning police force and a dedicated, incorruptible judiciary would be a serious threat to them. As a result, they have a strong interest in preserving the current, compromised status quo.\u201d\n\n[18] Exhibit 6 is an October 12, 2012, article entitled, The Russian Mafia and organized crime: how can this global force be tamed?, published by openDemocracy. It states the following: \u201cRussian organized crime enjoys significant levels of state protection. In Russia and other countries of the Former Soviet Union, it is not just a question of organized crime being big business. Big business is organized crime. And, given that no big business in Russia can operate without government approval (just ask the numerous exiles who left Russia in 2003 after the arrest of Mikhail Khodorkovsky) it follows that the state and organized crime are inextricably linked. Russian Transnational Organized Crime has other features which are less familiar to Western law enforcement agencies operating in countries where the rule of law is paramount. It has connections. There are close, almost seamless, links with the \u2018deep state\u2019 kleptocracy of government, parliament, civil service, law enforcement and business at all levels, as well as the military and, above all, the security services.\u201d\n\n[19] Item 7.5 of the NDP, which is Exhibit 3, indicates that some elected Russian officials have been found guilty of associating with organized crime groups or those with criminal records. In some cases, they form organized and persistent criminal enterprises which engage in a range of criminal activities and are largely dependent on their specific positions in government. As a result, gangs within the security agencies are particularly powerful. It indicates that virtually every major illicit market is controlled by mid to high-level members of the security forces under the tacit supervision and control of higher-level political elites, both at the local and federal level. Additionally, the state deals with large and violent criminal groups by allowing some crime bosses to operate both on the black market and in legitimate businesses on the condition of not drawing public attention through violence. Many past criminal leaders went into legitimate business or politics in the period following the fall of the Soviet Union, and those who still try to operate independently are typically outgunned by the law enforcement protection bracket.\n\n[20] I find that organized crime in Russia has an entrenched links to Russian state powers and, above all, to law enforcement and state security officers on a balance of probabilities. I find on a balance of probabilities that organized crime groups engage in, among others, business racketeering, including business seizure and raiding, and forced takeovers of business, and this a serious problem in Russia. While the article suggests that raiding depends less on violence in today\u2019s Russia, the article does not rule out violence. I find credible the claimant\u2019s evidence that he was attacked and rendered unconscious, and his dog killed, certainly showing what the crime groups are capable of doing, and sending a warning of violence if he were to refuse their demands.\n\nState Protection\n\n[21] Given the links between organized crime in Russian security apparatus, I find that state protection will not be available on a balance of probabilities to the claimant. I note that the claimant tried to report the threats and the attack to the police and the prosecutor of XXXX, and they did not take his statement or extend any protection, or even start any investigation on his behalf.\n\n[22] I also note that according to Item 1.4 there is a performance evaluation system in place for Russian police which creates an incentive that undermines the integrity of police work. Item 1.4 describes the high pressure on police officers to produce acceptable statistics, which results in a tendency for officers to only open cases that they know can be solved. This apparently is most prevalent in the area of criminal investigations. When a criminal case has been filed, the decision to open a formal investigation depends not only on the prospect of finding and apprehending a suspect, but also on the evaluation of the officers, whether the case will lead to official charges. If a case is passed on it without leading to official charges, none of the time spent by the frontline officer on the initial investigation tends to be credited to him personally or to his department as a whole. Therefore, the performance evaluation rewards the decrease in the number of complaints and penalizes the termination of a case for rehabilitation or acquittal of the suspect. A cited study concludes that utter refusals by police officers to initiate criminal investigations, up to 90 percent intended to hide crimes that are difficult to solve. Refusals can be made by convincing the crime victim not to report or by officially refusing to start a criminal investigation, and I note that this is what happened to the claimant.\n\n[23] I find that on a balance of probabilities this was also at play when the Tver police and the XXXX prosecutor refused to start an investigation or to even accept this report. I find on a balance of probabilities that the presumption of state protection has been rebutted, and that the claimant will not be able to avail of state protection in Russia.\n\nInternal Flight Alternative\n\n[24] The Panel suggested Saint Petersburg as a possible internal flight alternative location. I have considered the nexus between the organized crime and state security apparatus. I have considered the size and profile of the claimant\u2019s XXXX business. I have considered the evidence of continuing inquiries about the claimant\u2019s whereabouts, even as he arrived \u2014 or moved to Canada. I find that there is motivation on the part of his agents of harm to pursue him and locate him wherever he may relocate. I also accept, based on the objective evidence, that the claimant will be required to register his personal information with the Russian authorities upon return to the country. Per Item 14.one of the NDP, according to the law on the rights of the citizens of the Russian Federation to the freedom of movement, citizens of the Russian Federation are obliged to register their place of permanent or temporary residence with the authorities. I find on a balance of probabilities that the claimant can therefore be tracked by his agents of harm and will, on a balance of probabilities, be pressured and harmed to legally transfer his business. Or, if the business has in the meanwhile been already transferred illegally, he will be pressured and harmed to coerce his validation of such transfer and\/or he will be eliminated to preclude any legal challenge from him.\n\n[25] I also find on the balance of probabilities that, with his residence being registered, he will be subject to summons to be mobilized to the war in Ukraine. The claimant, being opposed to the war, will refuse to be mobilised. And according to Item 8.2 and 8.4 of the NDP, he will be subject to prosecution for draft evasion or for desertion under article 328, 337, and 338 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation. I therefore find that there is no safe and viable internal flight alternative location for the claimant anywhere in Russia.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[26] I therefore find on a balance of probabilities that the claimant faces a serious risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if he were to return to Russia. I find that the claimant, XXXX XXXX, is a person in need of protection under section 97(1)(b) of the IRPA. The claim is therefore accepted.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

He claims that he joined the party in 2011, because it reflected his views on the direction the country should take and was introduced to it by a mentor of his in university, who is one of the party\u2019s XXXX and was later the claimant\u2019s boss when he worked for the non-governmental organization \u201cXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX\u201d. The claimant alleges that, while still in Haiti, he participated in manifestations protesting the government\u2019s policies and politics, which manifestations were violently cracked down upon by the government forces. He claims that he was personally targeted and threatened by members of the PHTK. The claimant came to Canada in XXXX 2019, to attend a conference on behalf of XXXX, and prolonged his stay waiting for the situation in Haiti to calm down. In that period, he was receiving information of repressions on the part of the government of many of his fellow party members. In XXXX 2019, he claims, a press statement that was critical of the government was published by his party, and the persecution increased, where the party\u2019s headquarters were vandalised. The claimant\u2019s residence in the Delmas zone in Port-au-Prince was attacked by unknown armed persons, who terrorized his younger sister, who was living there; she was helped to escape by a neighbour and ultimately left the country to settle in the Dominican Republic. The claimant alleges that he continues his political activity from abroad and participates in online meetings and other activities as a member of the opposition party XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.\nDETERMINATION\n\n[3] For the reasons that follow, I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee under s. 96 of the IRPA on the basis of his political opinion.\nANALYSIS\nThe claimant\u2019s identity is established\n\n[4] The claimant\u2019s identity was established on balance of probabilities through his oral testimony and the certified true copy of his Haitian passport,[2] containing a Canadian visitor visa, which is on file.\n\nNexus to a Convention ground is established\n\n[5] The claimant alleges that he fears persecution in Haiti on the basis of his membership in an opposition pollical party and political activities opposing the government in place in Haiti and the ruling party. Since political opinion is one of the five grounds enumerated in the Convention, I find that a connection to a Convention ground has been established and have, accordingly, assessed the claim under s. 96 of the IRPA.\nThe claimant\u2019s allegations are credible\n\n[6] I found that the claimant has established on a balance of probability his key allegations regarding his political engagement and his subjective fear. His testimony at the hearing, which benefits from a presumption of truth,[3] was direct, spontaneous, and consistent with his Basis of Claim (BOC)[4] narrative. The claimant, who represented himself, was a sophisticated witness and delivered a testimony that demonstrated a level knowledge and understanding commensurate with his alleged political involvement and activity. He was able to explain in detail the reasons for which he became a member of the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX party, its ideology and positioning on the political landscape in Haiti; he knew the names and roles of its executives and testified spontaneously and in detail on his relationship specifically with the current XXXX of the party, who was also his director at XXXX; he also named fellow members who had been subjected to repressions on the part of the authorities since the claimant\u2019s departure from the country, and was convincing in his testimony on the events that unfolded which led him to decide to apply for protection in Canada.\n[7] The claimant supported his allegations with documentary evidence[5] that I found to be probative and reliable, including letters from his employer, showing that, as alleged, he worked for the organization XXXX from 2014 to the moment he left Haiti; evidence that he came to Canada to attend a conference on behalf of this organization; a copy of the press release from the party XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, dated XXXX XXXX, 2019, in which the regime in place in Haiti and the ruling party PHTK are criticized; photographs of the claimant participating in anti-government manifestations. There was nothing on the face of the documents or the manner they were obtained to lead me to doubt their authenticity, and I have accorded to them significant evidentiary weight. The claimant also explained at the hearing that, when it comes to establishing his membership in the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX party, he did not have a membership card, as the party did not issue such cards; he also stated that he had tried to obtain documentary evidence to corroborate the attack on his home in XXXX 2019, but had been unable to do so, since his sister had left the country and his mother had passed away since he left the country, thus limiting his ability to have family members assist in collecting documentary evidence. I find that these explanations are reasonable, and that the documents he did provide, along with his testimony that I found to be credible on a balance of probabilities, are sufficient to establish his key allegations and his subjective fear of persecution in Haiti.\n\nObjective basis\n\n[8] The available objective evidence contained in the National Documentation Package (NDP)[6] for Haiti supports the claimant\u2019s allegations and establishes that his subjective fear has an objective basis and is well-founded.\n[9] According to documents found in the NDP, political parties in Haiti, particularly dominant ones such as the PHTK, the current party in power, are reportedly in collusion with armed criminal gangs. Reports at Items 1.41 and 10.8 indicate that politicians do not hesitate to use gangs against their political rivals. According to Items 10.7 and 2.1, politically motivated killings are widespread in the country. Political demonstrations against the government have been violently suppressed in recent years, according to Items 4.23, 4.32 and 4.33. Freedom House in its report found at Item 2.6 of the NDP classifies Haiti as \u201cnot free\u201d and states that pervasive insecurity and criminal violence impair political activity in Haiti; political opposition leaders are subjected to threats and abductions, and protests organized by opposition parties are met with repressive force on the part of the government, according to this source. The same report further indicates that organized crime and corrupt patronage networks limit Haitians\u2019 political choice, with politicians often relying on money from drug trafficking and other illicit activity to finance their campaigns. Political rivalries, according to Item 7.6, are a common motive for revenge, which may take various forms, including threats, kidnapping and murder.\n[10] Based on the above-mentioned sources, I find that the objective evidence supports the claimant\u2019s subjective fear of persecution in Haiti.\nState Protection\n\n[11] While states are presumed able to offer protection to their citizens, unless the state is in a complete breakdown, this presumption can be refuted with clear and convincing evidence. In the case of present-day Haiti, the objective evidence is unequivocal that the Haitian state has lost control to pervasive violence committed by criminal gangs, who have proven to be more powerful and better resourced by the police, according, for instance, to Items 7.1 and 10.2 of the NDP. The judiciary is practically non-functioning and is susceptible to corruption and political influences, according to the objective sources.\n[12] For these reasons, I find that the presumption of state protection has been refuted with clear and convincing evidence and that the claimant cannot rely on such protection in Haiti.\nInternal Flight Alternative (IFA)\n\n[13] Considering that the agents of persecution in the present claim are state actors, that, according to the objective evidence, targets of revenge on the part of armed gangs based on political rivalries can be easily found through word-of-mouth as well other formal and informal networks, that Haiti is a small country and freedom of circulation is obstructed by the pervasiveness of armed gang violence, I find that, on balance of probabilities, the claimant does not have a viable IFA in Haiti.\nCONCLUSION\n[14] For the above-stated reasons, I find that the claimant meets the definition of Convention refugee under s. 96 of the IRPA.\n[15] The claim is accepted.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n[1] Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27, as amended, sections 96 and 97(1).\n[2] Exhibit 1.\n[3] Maldonado v.

Adolph\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Tina Hlimi\nCountry: Turkey\nRPD Number: TC2 25778\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2024-00593\nATIP Pages: N\/A\n\nDECISION\n\n[1] XXXX XXXX is a citizen of T\u00fcrkiye. He is claiming refugee protection pursuant to Sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA)[1].\n\nPreliminary Matters\n\n[2] At the end of the hearing, counsel requested that she provide written submissions due to a time constraint on the hearing day. The panel accepted. Counsel\u2019s submissions were provided on time[2] and were considered. The following week counsel made an application for post-hearing disclosure: she requested the panel recall that she had only recently been retained \u2013 the claimant had been unrepresented prior to her engagement \u2013 and therefore she had not been able to properly assist him in the gathering of documentary evidence to support his claim. The panel found the package submitted at Exhibit 10 was both relevant and probative. The panel also found that a reasonable explanation for the post-hearing disclosure had been provided. The panel therefore accepted the post-hearing disclosure.\nALLEGATIONS\n\n[3] The claimant\u2019s allegations are fully set out in his BOC form and narrative at Exhibit 2. In summary, he is making his claim on the basis of his Alevi religion and his opposition political opinion, as a supporter of the Halklar\u0131n Demokratik Partisi (HDP) also known in English as the People\u2019s Democratic Party. He fears persecution by the authorities in T\u00fcrkiye.\nDETERMINATION\n\n[4] Having considered the totality of the evidence, the panel finds the claimant to be a Convention Refugee pursuant to section 96. He faces a serious possibility of persecution on a balance of probabilities on the basis of his religion and political opinion.\n[5]\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n\n[6] The panel finds the claimant established his personal and national identity on a balance of probabilities. The panel relies on the copy of his Turkish national identity card and the copy of his passport\u2019s identity page at Exhibit 8. Both documents contain the same national identity number, and I find this is sufficient to establish that he is who he says he is, and the country of reference is T\u00fcrkiye.\n[7] The panel did notify[3] the Minister because a US biometrics match returned a different passport number than the one the claimant supplied at Exhibit 4. The Minister replied[4] to say they had nothing to add and would not intervene in the claim. The panel asked the claimant for an explanation for this discrepancy, and he replied that he did not know. He testified that he had presented his one and only Turkish passport to the US authorities at the border with Mexico, and that they had taken it and not returned it to him. The panel accepts his response and description of the circumstances of his entry into the US. In the panel\u2019s experience as a hearer of the claims of persons who transit into Canada via Mexico and the US, this kind of discrepancy between the number on their passport and the number entered by the US authorities occurs frequently and rarely do claimants have a full explanation. The panel notes that the US biometrics match provides a number, but no photograph of the passport it refers to. The panel finds this introduces the possibility of error. The panel draws no negative inference on the claimant\u2019s identity and credibility and finds the claimant succeeded in establishing his identity on a balance of probabilities.\nNexus\n\n[8] The panel finds there is a link between the claimant\u2019s fear of return and the Convention grounds: religion and political opinion. The claim is assessed under s. 96.\n\nCredibility\n\n[9] A claimant is presumed to be credible unless there is reason for doubt. The panel found the claimant to be a credible witness. He testified in a clear, direct, spontaneous and unembellished manner about both his Alevi faith and his opposition political opinion. There were no inconsistencies, omissions or discrepancies of note. The panel found no reason to disbelieve him that the authorities perceive him as a political opponent because of his Alevi faith and his support for the Halklar\u0131n Demokratik Partisi, (HDP), an opposition political party. His testimony is presumed to be true.\n\nAlevi faith\n\n[10] The claimant testfied that he is Alevi, that he has Alevi beliefs and values, that he is from an Alevi family and that the authorities view Alevis as opponents because Alevis do not have the same values as members of the Turkish Sunni majority. He testified he has attended at an Alevi ritual centre as part of his spiritual practice.\n[11] The claimant provided a detailed letter from an Alevi spiritual leader, who also includes documentary evidence of his credentials as well as an identity card. In this lengthy letter, this Alevi leader states that he comes from a long family line of Alevi spiritual leaders, and that his father and grandfather all have known the claimant\u2019s family over the years. The writer himself has known the family for two decades, and that the family has in the past offered their own home as an Alevi meeting place.\n[12] I accept this documentary evidence and find that on a balance of probabilities, the claimant comes from an Alevi family.\n[13] But the letter does not mention the claimant himself. As such the panel finds this letter does not directly corroborate the claimant\u2019s allegation that he is a true believer, or that he is seen by the authorities as an Alevi.\n[14] However, the writer states: \u201cwe the Alevis are still not sure whether to carry out our rituals in secrecy or in public. Simply because being blacklisted is a high risk for those Alevis attending open rituals in Alevi ritual centres that are not allowed to be registered as ritual centres, the police could detain all the people praying there with the accusation that they\u2019re involved in illegal political (subversive or separatist) gatherings. T\u00fcrkiye is a Muslim country, at least that is what it practically is. This means anyone who openly declares themselves as Alevi may be accused of being involved in \u201cseparatism\u201d under the accusation that the prayers are aiming to divide the unity of the nation on sectarian lines.\u201d\n[15] I accept this this letter from an Alevi spiritual leader and give it full weight. I find on a balance of probabilities the meaning of this passage is that that, if found engaging in collective religious expression, Alevis are imputed by the authorities to have an opposition political opinion. I find this letter-writer established himself to be qualified to provide this evidence, since he established himself to be from a long line of Alevi spiritual leaders. On a balance of probabilities, he himself conducts Alevi rituals and therefore faces this risk himself. I also find this evidence to be corroborated by the objective evidence which will be discussed later. I therefore find that since the claimant testified credibly that he has attended Alevi houses of worship, on a balance of probabilities he faces a risk of being seen by the authorities as both an Alevi and a separatist political opponent.\n\nPolitical involvement\n\n[16] The claimant alleges that he is not an official member of the HDP, but that he is an active supporter of the party. The claimant provided a letter from his father at Exhibit 10 which discusses the claimant\u2019s political involvement, to which the panel assigns full weight. On a balance of probabilities, the claimant is a supporter of the HDP as he alleges.\n\nSubjective Fear\n\n[17] The claimant testified to four arrests, in XXXX 2018, XXXX 2019, XXXX 2020 and finally, in XXXX 2021. The first three were for his pro-HDP political activity including XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX. The fourth arrest came minutes after he left the company of other pro-HDP volunteers. He testified that it was the treatment he received during this arrest that shook him: he provided details in his narrative. He testified, consistent with this narrative, that he was told he was involved with a separatist party. He was told he could only be released if he worked with the police in the future. Upon release, he testified, they told him to report to the police once a week, and also to show up whenever required. Upon release, he learned that family members who had gone out to police stations to look for him had also been detained. I find the claimant established his past arrests, that the police expect the claimant to report to them, and that on a balance of probabilities he has missed many reporting appointments by now. I find that on a balance of probabilities, his return without a passport would trigger official interest at the airport. I find the claimant has established his subjective fear of return.\n\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution\n\n[18] The National Documentation Package contains several documents which report that people who oppose the current AKP government face persecution in T\u00fcrkiye, and that Alevis and HDP supporters in particular face a risk from the authorities.\n[19] The National Documentation Package lists multiple examples of the use of \u201cterrorist\u201d and \u201cseparatist\u201d by the authorities to identify people with political opinions viewed as threatening. The US State Department[5] reports that even in the last year, there were credible reports of arbitrary killings, suspicious deaths of people in custody, arbitrary arrest and the continued detention of thousands of people viewed by the authorities as political opponents, often as \u201cseparatists\u201d and often for purported ties to terrorism. Supporters of the claimant\u2019s HDP are frequently dubbed separatists[6] and terrorists[7], though the HDP is an opposition political party and not a terrorist or separatist movement[8]. The panel accepts the objective evidence and finds that people viewed by the authorities as political opponents face a risk of charges on serious crimes which can result in long detentions and worse. The panel finds, based on the objective evidence and on a balance of probabilities this includes HDP supporters.\n[20] In addition to suppressing opposition political movements, Turkish authorities have also enforced a view of the country as Sunni Muslim and ethnically Turkish. According to a report entitled The Myth of Tolerance[9] by the European University Institute, T\u00fcrkiye sees itself as a Turkish Sunni Muslim nation. According to this report they can also expect harsh treatment if they are seen as going against the Sunni Turkish social order.\n[21] Alevis are religiously different from Sunnis[10] and often ethnically and linguistically different from Turks, according to this report. Alevis often experience suppression of their religion. Alevi houses of worship are still not recognized by the authorities as legitimate: they have no legal status[11]. Police use harsher methods in neighborhoods with a large Alevi population[12]. Government attitudes are mirrored in public attitudes: there have been instances in which Alevi homes have been vandalized, with an X to imply the occupants should be killed, or with expressions such as \u201cget out.\u201d [13] The European court of Human rights has ruled that T\u00fcrkiye violates the rights of Alevis[14]. The government denies Alevis the right to establish places of worship. The number of Alevi houses of worship in the country is not sufficient to meet the demand[15]. The panel accepts the documentary evidence and finds it establishes that Alevis are persecuted in T\u00fcrkiye.\n[22] The religious leader cited earlier states that Alevis found to be worshiping by the authorities can be accused of separatism, of trying to divide the country along sectarian lines. I find the objective evidence is consistent with this evidence, because it establishes that T\u00fcrkiye sees itself as a Sunni nation and suppresses religions that are not Sunni Islam.\n[23] The panel finds the objective evidence corroborates the claimant\u2019s allegation that the authorities would see him upon return as an Alevi and pro-HDP political opponent. His subjective fear of return has an objective basis. He has a well-founded fear of persecution.\n\nState Protection\n\n[24] There is a presumption that a state can protect its own citizens unless it is in total breakdown. T\u00fcrkiye is a functioning state. However, the panel finds that it would be objectively unreasonable for the claimant to seek the protection of the state given that the main agent of persecution is the state. The panel therefore finds, in the claimant\u2019s particular circumstances, there is no adequate state protection for him.\n\nInternal Flight Alternative\n\n[25] Since the claimant fears the Turkish authorities, and they control the entirety of the country, the panel finds that the claimant would face a serious possibility of persecution throughout T\u00fcrkiye, and accordingly there is no viable internal flight alternative available to him.\nCONCLUSION\n\n[26] Based on the totality of the evidence, the panel finds the claimant to be a Convention refugee on the grounds of his political opinion and religion. He faces a serious risk of persecution in T\u00fcrkiye.\n[27] His claim is accepted.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n[1] Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27, as amended, sections 96 and 97(1).\n[2] Exhibit 9.\n[3] Exhibit 5.\n[4] Exhibit 6.\n[5] National Documentation Package, T\u00fcrkiye, 31 July 2023, tab 2.1: Turkey (T\u00fcrkiye).

Amana\nCountry: Zimbabwe\nRPD Number: TC2-23720\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2023-01721\nATIP Pages: N\/A\n\nDECISION\n\n[1] MEMBER: This is the decision for the following claimant, XXXX XXXX XXXX, file number TC2-23720. I have considered your testimony and the other evidence in the case, and I am ready to render my decision orally. In reaching this decision, the Panel applied Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9, proceedings before the Immigration and Refugee Board involving sexual orientation, gender identity and expression and sex characteristics.\n\n[2] You are claiming to be a citizen of Zimbabwe and are claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n\nDETERMINATION\n\n[3] I find that you are a Convention refugee because you face a serious possibility of persecution for the following reasons.\n\nALLEGATIONS\n\n[4] You allege the following. You are a transgender woman and victim of child sexual abuse who cannot live openly in Zimbabwe. You fear arrest, torture, murder or other ill treatment at the hands of the government family or community members, should you return to Zimbabwe, because of your gender identity. You allege that there is no state protection for you or any internal flight alternative.\n\nIdentity\n\n[5] Your personal identity as a citizen of Zimbabwe has been established by your testimony and the supporting documents filed in the exhibits, including a certified true copy of your Zimbabwean birth certificate. I, therefore, find, on a balance of probabilities, that identity and country of nationality have been established.\n\nNexus to Section 96 or Section 97\n\n[6] I find that there is a link between what you fear and one (1) of the five (5) Convention grounds, specifically your membership of a particular social group as a transgender woman. Therefore, this claim has been assessed under section 96.\n\nCredibility\n\n[7] In terms of your general credibility, I have found you to be a credible witness and I, therefore, accept, on a balance of probabilities, what you have alleged in your oral testimony and in your Basis of Claim form. Your testimony is presumed to be true. In support of your claim, you provided documents in Exhibit number 6, including photos, letters of support and a letter from your Canadian doctor assisting with your XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, confirming your identity as a transgender woman. The Panel finds these documents to be consistent with your Basis of Claim and testimony and to be credible on a balance of probabilities. The Panel, therefore, assigns this evidence significant weight.\n\n[8] Your testimony about your realization of your gender identity and what you fear you might happen to you if you return to Zimbabwe was also straightforward, seemingly unrehearsed, responsive to questioning and was in keeping with your Basis of Claim form and there were no significant inconsistencies or omissions. In reaching these findings, the Panel applied both Chairperson\u2019s \u2014 applied Chairpersons\u2019 Guideline 9, particularly, sections 6 and 7. I, therefore, believe what you have alleged in support of your claim and I find the following to be credible.\n\n[9] That on a balance of probabilities, you are a transwoman form Zimbabwe and you have credibly established your subjective fear of persecution, including fear of severe physical violence at the hands of community members, widespread societal discrimination and verbal or physical abuse condoned or even encouraged by state actors.\n\nPersecution Risk\n\n[10] The objective documentation supports your allegations that individuals in your circumstance face persecution.\n\n[11] One (1), the documentary evidence indicates that consensual same-sex conduct is criminalized in Zimbabwe and that there is a lack of investigation and accountability for gender-based violence, including crimes against women and girls. NDP 2.1, 2.2.\n\n[12] Two (2), the documentary evidence indicates that LGBTI+ persons were vulnerable to blackmail because of the criminality and stigma associated with same-sex conduct. NDP 2.1.22, page 49.\n\n[13] Three (3), there were credible reports that LGBTI+ persons face discrimination in education and had higher rates of unemployment and homelessness. NDP 2.1.22 page 49.\n\n[14] Four (4), the documentary evidence indicates that Zimbabwean society holds a widespread discriminatory and violent attitude towards sexual and gender minorities. Senior public figures, including even a human rights commissioner, have issued hostile statements against LGBTI people. NDP 6.1.19 page 2.\n\n[15] Five (5), the documentary evidence also indicates that impunity for violators of human rights was widespread. NDP 2.1.22, page 2.\n\n[16] Six (6), homophobia permeates Zimbabwean society unchecked and manifests itself in different forms, ranging from verbal and physical assault to discrimination of LGBTI+ people on the basis of their sexual orientation or gender identity. NDP 6.2, page 5.\n\n[17] Consequently, I find that there is a serious possibility that you could face arrest, imprisonment, torture and or serious physical harm should you return to Zimbabwe. I find that you have established an objective basis for your subjective fear, and therefore, you have a well-founded fear of persecution.\n\nState Protection\n\n[18] I find that adequate state protection would not be available to you were you to seek it in Zimbabwe. The objective documentary evidence indicates that the state police and security forces have effective reach throughout Zimbabwe and that same-sex conduct is criminalized in Zimbabwe and same-sex relationships, of any kind, are stigmatized and susceptible to violence with impunity and stigmatization. States are presumed to be capable of protecting their citizens, except in situations where the state is in a complete breakdown.\n\n[19] However, based on the claimant\u2019s personal circumstances, as well as the country documentation referred to above, the Panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant has rebutted the presumption of state protection with clear and convincing evidence. Adequate state protection is not available to her as she fears persecution from agents of the state themselves, family members of the police and security forces, whose reach extends everywhere in Zimbabwe as well as from community members.\n\nInternal Flight Alternative\n\n[20] I have also considered whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for you. The country documentation indicates that the situation for individuals in circumstances such as yours is the same throughout the country and that you would face a serious possibility of persecution or risk to life anywhere in Zimbabwe. The Panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that there is a serious possibility of persecution of the claimant anywhere in Zimbabwe, were she to live openly, as is her fundamental right. As such, I find there is no viable internal flight alternative for you in Zimbabwe.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[21] Based on the totality of the evidence, I find the claimant to be a Convention refugee as she faces a serious possibility of persecution because of her membership of a particular social group as a transgender woman. Your claim is, therefore, accepted.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

        "unofficial_text":"2023 RLLR 97\n\nCitation: 2023 RLLR 97\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: July 20, 2023\nPanel: Vicki Macdonald\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Nicholas Woodward\nCountry: Poland\nRPD Number: TC2-19651\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2024-00593\nATIP Pages: N\/A\n\nDECISION\n\n[1] MEMBER: So, this is a decision in TC2-19651. You claim to be a citizen of Poland and are claiming refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, the IRPA. In deciding this claim, I have considered the claimant\u2019s testimony and the totality of evidence in this case. Additionally, I have considered the social and cultural context, difficulties which claimants can face in obtaining documents, the milieu of the hearing room, and the stress of responding to oral questions, all in the course of arriving at my finding. I have also considered and applied Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9 on Proceedings Before the IRB Involving Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Expression, and Sex Characteristics, SOGIESC.\n\nDETERMINATION\n\n[2] I find that you have credibly established that you are a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA as you belong to a particular social group, being a transgender man.\n\nALLEGATIONS\n\n[3] You allege the following: that you are a transgender man and that you have been socially and medically transitioning; that your parents are very conservative, traditional Catholics who strictly believe in typical \u2014 stereotypical gender roles; that growing up you knew there was an unease and discomfort inherent in presenting as female, but that you did not have the language to identify your gender dysphoria; that it was not until you came to Canada in 2018 that you began to learn more about the LGBTQ community, including trans identities; that it was only through connecting with members of the LGBTQ community at your job here in Canada that you began to research and understand your gender identity; that you started to understand your gender identity in or around XXXX 2019 but did not inform anyone until 2021, fearing harm and persecution;\n\n[4] That you returned briefly to Poland in XXXX 2019 and came to the conclusion that the atmosphere was too dangerous to return to Poland for LGBTQ+ people; that after returning to Canada, you became aware of your gender identity and starting in XXXX 2021, you shared your gender identity with your husband and several close friends; that you only learned your gender identity was a ground for refugee status in 2022, and after learning this, you immediately took steps to make your claim; that since disclosing to your parents that you are a transgender man, that they have persistently misgendered you and you fear if returned to Poland, they would seek to change you; that you fear the general Polish society, police forces and fear that if it was discovered you have transitioned, that you would face harm at their hands.\n\nIdentity\n\n[5] You have established your personal and national identity on a balance of probabilities through your oral testimony and submission of both your Polish passport at Exhibit 1 and your Ontario photo ID at Exhibit 4.\n\nCredibility and Fact Finding\n\n[6] In terms of general credibility, I found you to be a credible witness and therefore believe what you have alleged in your oral testimony and in your Basis of Claim form. I found you were spontaneous and detailed and that there were no contradictions in your testimony which go to the core of your claim. You established your credible testimony when you spoke regarding your realization of your gender identity, your continued fears regarding being discovered, and your euphoria as presenting properly and being recognized as the man you are.\n\n[7] I find the following documents support your allegations: the Ontario photo ID and social media profiles at Exhibit 4 support your allegations regarding your social transition; the clinical assessment and letter from your XXXX as well as your prescriptions all at Exhibit 4 all establish that you have XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX; the letter from your husband and seven (7) letters of support from your friends all at Exhibit 4 supporting your timeline of events and your social transition; the country condition news articles at Exhibit 4 supporting the allegations around similarly situated persons; the emails from your parents at Exhibit 4 supporting your allegations of their reactions to your transition. I have no reason to doubt the veracity of these documents and therefore assign them full weight.\n\n[8] As a result, on a balance of probabilities, I find you have established the following: that you are a trans man; that you have socially and medically transitioned; that you have a genuine reason to believe your parents would be at best unsupportive of your transition; that you acted diligently in proceeding with your claim when you learned you could make a claim for refugee status.\n\n[9] I considered and applied Guideline 9\u2019s guidance on understanding the challenges faced by individuals with diverse sexual orientations and gender identities in establishing their orientation and gender identities in their refugee hearings. The Guideline informs the Panel that individuals with diverse SOGIESC recognize and may act on SOGIESC differently, and that an individual\u2019s self-awareness and self-acceptance may present as gradual or non-linear in process. I kept this in mind in considering all of the evidence in the claim before me. I find that you have established your subjective fear and that this is established by your credible testimony, and I believe what you have alleged in your Basis of Claim form and your testimony on a balance of probabilities.\n\nObjective Basis\n\n[10] Item 2.1 mentions that there have been significant human rights issues regarding violence and threats of violence targeting transgender people in Poland. Although the Constitution prohibits discrimination for any reason whatsoever, it does not specifically mention grounds of sexual orientation or gender identity. Hate crime and incitement laws also do not identify a gender identity or sexual orientation as grounds of discrimination to be prohibited. There are laws in place which prohibit discrimination with respect to employment, but that these are frequently not applied, and it does not specifically prohibit discrimination based on gender identity.\n\n[11] Item 2.3 highlights that although LGBTQ+ people enjoy full political rights and electoral opportunities, that homophobic rhetoric by government figures, including but not limited to the President and Minister of Education is commonplace, and the governing party has frequently used homophobic rhetoric warning of the alleged danger of LGBTQ rights to stoke intolerance across the country. This item also speaks extensively about the major setbacks in LGBTQ+ rights since 2019 as the Law and Justice Party and parts of the Catholic Church have stoked fears relating to the LGBTQ+ community. As Poland\u2019s laws against inciting hatred do not cover crimes motivated by sexuality or gender identity, public figures remain free to use slurs that would be prosecuted if targeted at other marginalized groups.\n\n[12] Item 6.1 and 6.2 also speak about this, noting that there have been some judicial intervention to remove legislation and bylaws which target LGBTQ+ people, but that political speeches and leaders continue to levy hate speech against transgender people, such as comments made by the Minister of Education and the Ombudsperson for children. The Ombudsperson for children has even called for penalties and fines to be issued against LGBTQ+ organizations. That note \u2014 item also notes that there is some legal protection afforded to transgender people in Poland \u2014 went through proceedings in July 2021, but that by and large, employers continue to openly discriminate against employers \u2014 employees and customers. 6.4 highlights that Poland continues to breach its EU obligations over LGBTQ+ rights. The Law and Justice Party, the current governing party of Poland since 2019, intensified its anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric making LGBTQ+ rights a key battle ground in parliamentary elections. With the re-election of the party, they have doubled down and have done their best to curb any and all LGBTQ rights.\n\n[13] Based on this objective evidence, I find your \u2014 and the subjective fear, I find you have a well-founded fear of persecution on the basis of your gender identity.\n\nState Protection\n\n[14] There is a presumption of state protection, but I find in the particular circumstances of this claim, that presumption is rebutted. While you have not been specifically targeted by agents of the state, there is clear objective evidence which shows that the state would, on a balance of probabilities, persecute you should you ask for protection. It is unreasonable to require you to seek protection from (inaudible) where in doing so, you would be open to further harassment and violence. Item 6.2 indicates that less than four (4) percent of LGBTQ+ people who experience hate crimes report it to the police.\n\n[15] Item 6.1 details a frequent establishment of legislation which targets individuals, including the transgender community, with politicians like the Minister of Education and Ombudsperson for children seeking to instill penalties and fines against LGBTQ+ organisations. It is clear that there is an ongoing effort to suppress the community and in doing so, a frequent attack on the rights of any person belonging to that community. Moreover, as previously mentioned, 2.3 highlights that anti-discrimination laws do not include gender identity as a specific clause, and that laws do not mention gender identity as a ground on which hate speech is prohibited and the law on inciting hatred does not extend to gender identity.\n\n[16] As a result, when combined with the general atmosphere in Poland, which is commonly held by security forces, I find state protection would not be available to him as the police would be unwilling to assist to you.\n\nInternal Flight Alternative\n\n[17] I have considered whether there is a viable internal flight alternative available to you. Poland is a state which is in full control of its territories. I note that there is some information at Item 6 about Warsaw\u2019s mayor attempting to protect LGBTQ+ rights, but the evidence indicates that in doing so, there has been a substantial backlash by state officials. As the treatment of transgender people by and large does not vary across the country, I find you would face a serious possibility of persecution throughout Poland. As a result, there is no viable internal flight alternative available to you on a balance of probabilities.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[18] Based on the totality of evidence before me, including your credible testimony, I find you have established a serious possibility of persecution based on your membership in a particular social group as a transgender person. As a result, I find you have established that you are a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA and your claim is therefore accepted.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

This is the decision for the following claimant, XXXX XXXX, also known as XXXX XXXX (ph). Your claim is accepted.\n\n[2] COUNSEL: Thank you, Madam Chair.\n\n[3] CLAIMANT (without interpreter): Thank you.\n\n[4] MEMBER: You are claiming to be a citizen of Iran and are claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n\n[5] CLAIMANT (without interpreter): Thank you.\n\n[6] MEMBER: Given the nature of this claim, I have taken into consideration the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline for Proceedings Before the Immigration and Refugee Board Involving Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Expression, and Sex Characteristics.\n\n[7] INTERPRETER: Sorry, Madam Member. Could you please repeat the last part of what you just said?\n\n[8] MEMBER: Sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, and sex characteristics.\n\n[9] INTERPRETER: Sorry, Madam Member. I still missed the last one (1).\n\n[10] MEMBER: Sex characteristics. Given that it is a guideline, Madam Interpreter, I strongly recommend you become familiar with it.\n\n[11] INTERPRETER: Sure, Madam Member.\n\n[12] MEMBER: You will receive a non-edited transcript of this oral decision in the mail in approximately three (3) weeks. Your Counsel will also receive a copy and can answer any related questions you may have at that time.\n\n[13] I find that you are a Convention refugee on the grounds of membership in a particular social group, namely transgender individuals, for the following reasons.\n\nAllegations\n\n[14] You allege the following. You are a citizen of Iran. You were born female but you identify as male and are attracted to women. You realized your gender identity and attraction to other girls as an adolescent. Your mother disapproved of your gender identification and took you to see a XXXX in Iran whom you saw for treatment over a one-year period. You have had two (2) relationships with girls in Iran. Your mother learned of your last relationship and threatened to report you to the Basij. You came to Canada to study in XXXX 2021 and have been identifying yourself to the community as a male and by your chosen name, XXXX. Your mother called you in XXXX 2022 and said she was disowning you due to posts you made on social media identifying your chosen gender. You made a claim for refugee protection shortly thereafter.\n\nIdentity\n\n[15] Your personal identity as a citizen of Iran has been established by your testimony and the supporting documents filed in the exhibits, particularly the certified true copies of your Iranian passport and Canadian visa on file. I find that on a balance of probabilities you are who you say you are and that the country of reference is Iran.\n\nNexus\n\n[16] I find that there is a link between what you fear and one (1) of the five (5) Convention grounds, membership in a particular social group as a transgender person and therefore I have only assessed the claim under section 96.\n\nCredibility\n\n[17] In terms of your gender credibility, I have found you to be a credible witness and I therefore believe what you have alleged in your oral testimony and in your Basis of Claim form. You testified in a spontaneous and straightforward manner and did not attempt to embellish your evidence. You were forthcoming with information and were able to provide relevant details when requested by me. You convincingly described how you feel about your gender and your struggles in Iran to express yourself as a boy to your parents. You testified about the efforts you have made in Canada to transform your identity to a male. You have submitted a letter from a doctor at the XXXX XXXX XXXX in Toronto dated XXXX XXXX, 2023, confirming that you had been XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX since XXXX 2022. You testified about your fear of returning to Iran and being subject to harm at the airport and from your family, particularly your mother who has disowned you and told you that you have brought dishonour to the family.\n\n[18] Based on all of the above, I believe on a balance of probabilities, I believe that you are a transgender male. I believe that although you were born female you have always felt like a male and that you are actively seeking to establish your identity as a male in Canada. I also believe that you have been mistreated by your family in Iran due to your gender identity and that you are fearful to return to Iran because you may be harmed or killed by your family or the authorities due to your gender identity. I therefore find that your subjective fear is established by your credible testimony and the corroborating documents and I believe what you have alleged on a balance of probabilities.\n\n[19] I also find based on a review of the National Documentation Package for Iran that your fear is objectively well-founded. The documents indicate that the law criminalizes all sexual relations outside of traditional marriage and Iran is among the few countries where individuals can be put to death for consensual same-sex conduct. Security forces harass, arrest, and detain individuals they suspect of being LGBTQ+. In some cases, security forces have raided houses and monitored Internet sites for information on LGBTQ+ persons. It is reported that members of the LGBTQ+ community face harassment and discrimination, though the problem is underreported due to the criminalized and hidden nature of these groups in Iran. It is also reported that honour killings against sexual and gender minorities in Iran are often carried out by family or community members for bringing shame or dishonour on a family. I find that the objective evidence indicates that you have a well-founded fear of persecution in Iran.\n\nState Protection and Internal Flight Alternative\n\n[20] States are presumed to be capable of protecting their own citizens except in situations where the state is in a state of complete breakdown. Given that same-sex conduct is criminalized and punishable by death and that security forces actively police LGBTQ+ individuals, the state is an agent of persecution and therefore there is no state protection or internal flight alternative available to you in Iran.\n\n[21] INTERPRETER: Sorry. I just need to get some water. Sorry.\n\n[22] MEMBER: I find the country condition information to be clear and convincing evidence to rebut the presumption of state protection.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[23] Based on the totality of the evidence, I find you to be a Convention refugee and I accept your claim.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

The claimants are citizens of Russia and are claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act or IRPA.\n\nALLEGATIONS\n\n[2] The events and circumstances alleged in support of the claim are set out in the claimant\u2019s Basis of Claim forms marked as Exhibit 2.1 and 2.2. In summary, the claimants fear persecution and harm at the hands of state authorities and their agents due to the principal claimant\u2019s political opinion and activities and their recent opposition to the \u2014 to Russia\u2019s actions in the war in Ukraine. The principal claimant, specifically, fears criminal prosecution and jail time in accordance with Russian law, which prohibits any speech or activity that discredits the Russian army.\n\nDETERMINATION\n\n[3] I find that the claimants are Convention refugees under section 96 of the IRPA.\n\nNexus\n\n[4] I find that the claims bear a nexus to a Convention ground, that of the principal claimant\u2019s political opinion and that of the associate claimant\u2019s membership in a particular social group as wife of a person identified as an individual opposed to the Putin regime and the war in Ukraine.\n\nIdentity\n\n[5] The claimants\u2019 identities were established, on a balance of probabilities, by certified, true copies of their Russian Federation passports.\n\nExclusion Under Article 1F(a)\n\n[6] Section 98 of the IRPA states, \u201cA person referred to in section E and F of article one (1) of the Refugee Convention is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection.\u201d Article 1F(a) of the Convention reads as follows. \u201cThe provisions of this Convention shall not apply to any person with respect to whom there are serious reasons for considering that he has committed a crime against peace, a war crime or a crime against humanity, as defined in the international instruments drawn up to make provisions in respect of such crimes.\u201d\n\n[7] The principal claimant was a conscript in the Russian Army and with the rank of XXXX from XXXX 1972 to XXXX 1974. He was officially assigned to the XXXX XXXX as a XXXX, but in reality, he was part of the XXXX XXXX of the army and participated in competition among members of the Soviet Union in XXXX XXXX. The principal claimant showed the Panel maps relating to XXXX XXXX and explained that the competition involved XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. He testified that he was never in a combat zone, that he did not handle or use a weapon, that he did not supervise any unit or individuals. Asked why he indicated that he was assigned to the XXXX XXXX and his details of military service, he explained that he believed he had to write down his official position and duties. I accept as plausible that the claimant believed he had to provide official information that would check out against any official documentation. Further, the principal claimant\u2019s spontaneity and candor in showing the Panel the maps that were used in the XXXX XXXX competitions, persuade me, on a balance of probabilities, of the truth of his claim.\n\n[8] I am unable to find any evidentiary basis that would support a conclusion that there are serious reasons to consider that the claimant committed any work crimes or crimes against humanity during his two (2) year mandatory military service. I note that the Minister initially notified that it would intervene on the basis of article 1F(a), but withdrew on January 4, 2023, indicating that the Minister has no further information to provide. I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the principal claimant is not excluded from refugee protection under article 1F(a) of the Refugee Convention.\n\nCredibility\n\n[9] The principal claimant testified in a detailed, spontaneous and straightforward manner. He was eager to show the Panel documents, which were part of his archive, in support of his claim, but not otherwise submitted. These included documents like his campaign materials, a photo of his wife at a rally, and he was looking for a book published that featured him and his political biography, but could not find the same. There were no inconsistencies or omissions which went to the core of the claims. I believe what the principal claimant has alleged in support of the claims.\n\n[10] The claimants also submitted other documentary evidence. A letter from XXXX XXXX confirming his membership and role and confirming his activism in XXXX and participating in protests and rallies against the war in Ukraine. The claimants also submitted an excerpt from the book, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (ph) providing details of his political and public growth and activities, and which contained an excerpt from one (1) of the principal claimant\u2019s several XXXX XXXX. I have no reason to doubt the voracity of these documents and as such, I place great weight on the in support of the principal claimant\u2019s profile as a known political figure, oppositionist and activist.\n\n[11] Based on the principal claimant\u2019s testimony and the corroborating documents, I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the principal claimant has been active in politics since 1987 and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX of the democratic movement in Russia in 1989. In XXXX of 1990, while serving as XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (ph) region in Moscow, he left the Communist Party of the USSR and began to oppose the communist regime and XXXX democratic organizations. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I accept his evidence and find, on a balance of probabilities, that he was XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and, thereafter, the XXXX XXXX XXXX. And thereafter, he XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. He was also XXXX XXXX XXXX of the XXXX XXXX XXXX and member of the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX led by XXXX XXXX.\n\n[12] The principal claimant also XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. He XXXX XXXX XXXX of the political party, People\u2019s Freedom Party, on the basis of the Solidarity Movement and was XXXX of the XXXX XXXX XXXX. In 2012, he left People\u2019s Freedom Party and took part in the XXXX of the XXXX XXXX. And to this day, is still a member of this party and XXXX the XXXX XXXX XXXX. I accept the principal claimant\u2019s evidence and find, on a balance of probabilities, that he XXXX and participated in several opposition rallies and marches in Moscow, protesting the actions of the Putin regime. I accept and find, on a balance of probabilities, that the associate claimant also attended these rallies and marches along with her husband. I accept and find, on a balance of probabilities, that the principal claimant XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX condemning corruption and the criminal elements in Putin\u2019s government, fraudulent elections. He also XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I accept and find, on a balance of probabilities, that the principal claimant was involved in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX for state and Moscow regional XXXX, for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, district of Moscow region, where he did XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in Moscow region and XXXX XXXX in campaign events. I also find, on a balance of probabilities, starting in 2014, when Russia (inaudible) the claimant started opposing Russia\u2019s actions. And thereafter, when Russian invaded Ukraine on February 24, 2022, he participated in protests against a war and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX condemning the war and discrediting the Russian army and president Putin.\n\n[13] And further, the principal claimant was threatened with criminal prosecution by local police. And on XXXX 2022, would have been arrested by police that came to his door, except that he was not home. He was being sought for his anti-war protests and XXXX. I further accept that since coming to Canada, the claimant has participated online in an anti-war forum and that he signed an appeal condemning Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine. I find, on a balance of probabilities, that he, and other signatories of the appeal, were declared enemies of Russia by Putin. And as such, are subject to immediate arrest and criminal prosecution if they were to return to Russia.\n\nSubjective Fear\n\n[14] I find that the claimants have established, on a balance of probabilities, a subjective fear of persecution and harm at the hands of Russian authorities due to the principal claimant\u2019s political opinion, opposed to the Putin regime and Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nObjective Basis\n\n[15] The claimants submitted a Human Rights Watch article, dated March 7, 2022, entitled, \u201cRussia Criminalizes Independent War Reporting and Anti-War Protests\u201d, which explains that Russia enacted two (2) laws that were brought into force on March 4, 2022, criminalizing independent war reporting and the protesting of the war. With penalties of up to 15 years in prison. The laws also make it illegal to spread, so called, fake news about the Russian armed forces, to call for an end to their deployment and to support sanctions against against Russian targets. The laws also impose strict censorship on all discussions of Russian\u2019s war with Ukraine, with Russian authorities banning the description of the aggression as war or an invasion.\n\n[16] The claimants also submitted another Human Rights Watch article dated March 9, 2022, entitled, \u201cRussia Brutal Arrests and Torture, Ill Treatment of Anti-War Protesters\u201d, which reported that Russian authorities have arbitrarily arrested thousands of peaceful protesters at anti-war rallies across Russia. In line with their increasingly brutal crackdowns on those who disagree with Russia\u2019s military offense in Ukraine. The article reports that the police used excessive force against protestors, while detaining them. And in several instances, inflicted abuse, amounting to torture or inhumane and degrading treatment on those in custody, including administering electric shocks, water boarding, kicking and beating with police baton, punching and threats to shoot and threats of sexual assault.\n\n[17] A 26-year-old woman managed to record the audio while she was being interrogated by a police officer, who slapped her, hit her in the face with a water bottle, grabbed her by the hair, threatened to give her electric shocks and snatched her phone. The police officer, heard in the audio, said, \u201cDo you think I will be punished somehow? Putin told us to kill you all. Putin is on our side. You are enemies of the state. You are enemies of the nation. We will get a bonus for this.\u201d The article also reports that authorities have carried out raids on human right defenders\u2019 homes, arresting them because they had, allegedly, participated in the peaceful anti-war movement. Human Rights Watch director was quoted as saying, \u201cThat Russian authorities continued to deny people their right to freedom of assembly and stifle the voices of those who disagree with Russia\u2019s war in the Ukraine. The escalated police violence illustrates the length to which Russian authorities will go to intimidate and silence dissent.\n\n[18] The claimants also submitted a 2021 Amnesty International article entitled, \u201cRussia No Place for Protests,\u201d which discussed how Russian authorities generally have used increasingly repressive measures to restrict and suppress peaceful protests, enforced through unfair trial and founded in disproportionate sanctions and excessive use of force against protestors and dissidents. I find that there is cogent objective basis for the claimants\u2019 fear of persecution and harm at the hands of Russian authorities due to the principal claimant\u2019s political opinion opposed to the Putin regime and Russia\u2019s war against the Ukraine.\n\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution\n\n[19] Based on their subjective fear grounded on an objective basis, I find that the claimants have established, on a balance of probabilities, a well-founded fear of persecution at the hand of state actors in Russia.\n\n[20] At this juncture, I need to mention that the associate claimant, also, faces a serious possibility of risk of persecution based on her membership in a particular social group, as wife of a known political dissident. We only need to recall the story of Skripal family, whereby the target was the father of the Skripal family, but the daughter was, as well, poisoned because of the incident. In this regard, I find that the associate claimant\u2019s familial relationship with the principal claimant renders her vulnerable and exposed to the serious possibility of persecution and harm as a result of her relationship to her husband as well.\n\nState Protection\n\n[21] The agent of persecution is the Russian state through state actors. The objective evidence in Item 2.1 is clear that the Russian authorities use harsh and violent methods to suppress dissent, up to and including torture. Item 4.14 at page 2 indicates that time and time again, Russian authorities have suppressed free speech and peaceful protests through police brutality, violence and mass arrests. Item 2.2 indicates that police enjoyed impunity for the unlawful use of force, including their use of stun guns and \u2014 against peaceful protesters. Item 2.1 states that the government failed to take adequate steps to identify, investigate, prosecute or punished most officials who committed abuses and engaged in corruption, resulting in a climate of impunity.\n\n[22] The objective evidence is therefore clear that the state will not provide adequate protection. In fact, the police forces, themselves, will be the agents of persecution against those who speak out against the government. I find that adequate state protection would not be available to the claimants in the circumstances.\n\nInternal Flight Alternative\n\n[23] Given the nationwide repression and the crushing of political dissent described in the objective evidence, I further find that there would be a serious responsibility of persecution for the claimants anywhere in Russia. Tab 14.1 of the NDP indicates that citizens must register their residence if they move and that new laws, signed into force in 2013, have made registration requirements stricter and imposed harsh penalties for not registering. So even if the claimants managed to relocate somewhere safely, they would have to register their new residence with the government. The government will, therefore, know where they are and risk being arrested and imprisoned or they may risk having to live unregistered and living illegally. And as well, being arrested and imprisoned for breaking those registration laws.\n\n[24] Given the claimants \u2014 the principal claimant\u2019s convictions against the Putin regime and the war in Ukraine, given his long history of political activism and his continued activism through the online forum founded by Gasparo (ph). I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the principal claimant will continue to attract the negative attention of Russian authorities. That is to say, that their agents of persecution will always have reason and motivation to persecute them anywhere they may relocate in Russia. There is no safe internal flight alternative anywhere in Russia for the claimants.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[25] I, therefore, find that the claimants face a serious possibility of persecution if they were to return to Russia, based on the political claimant\u2019s political opinion and activism and the associate claimant\u2019s membership in a particular social group, as the spouse of a known political opponent of the regime. I find that the claimants are Conventional refugees under Section 96 of the IRPA. Their claims are, therefore, accepted.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

The claimant is a citizen of Jamaica claiming refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97 (1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n\nALLEGATIONS\n\n[2] The details of the claimant\u2019s allegations are fully set out in the claimant\u2019s Basis of Claim form and narrative. In short, the claimant fears persecution in Jamaica because he is a trans man.\n\nDETERMINATION\n\n[3] Having considered the quality of the evidence, the Panel finds that the claimant has satisfied the burden of establishing a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground based on his membership in a particular social group as a trans man. In deciding this claim, the Panel has taken into consideration the Guideline 9: proceedings before the IRB if involving sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, and sex characteristics.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nIdentity\n\n[4] With respect to the issue of identity, the claimant\u2019s identity has been established, on a balance of probabilities, through a Jamaican passport, copy of which was provided to the Board. The claimant testified about the steps he had to take in order to renew his passport with his chosen name at the Jamaican Embassy. However, the claimant testified that it was not possible to change the identity markers in the passport, hence why the letter F is still on his passport under the mention sex. The Panel accepts the explanations of the claimant on the balance of probabilities.\n\nCredibility\n\n[5] In assessing the credibility of the evidence presented by a claimant in support of his refugee claim, the Panel is guided by the principles established in the Federal Court of Appeals decision of Maldonado. When a claimant affirms to tell the truth, this creates a presumption of truthfulness unless there is evidence to the contrary. In this case, the claimant\u2019s narrative is detailed and intricate. At the hearing, the claimant has provided some spontaneous details in support of his allegation. For example, the reason he chose his name. Based on the evidence, the Panel finds the claimant to be a credible witness and therefore believes what he has alleged in support of his claim.\n\n[6] The evidence demonstrates, in detail, the claimant\u2019s story in regard to his gender identity and expression. The claimant made bodily changes using medical and other means to align his sex characteristics with his gender identity. The claimant provided substantial and intricate documentation to corroborate his allegation regarding his gender identity. The claimant presented reliable evidence, including medical and XXXX reports, a letter confirming his XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, letters of support from friends and school personnel, and pictures detailing his transition. On the face of it, the Panel has no reason to doubt the authenticity of the extensive documentary evidence the claimant has disclosed and finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the evidence supports and corroborates the allegations of the claimant. The Panel therefore assigns the evidence full weight in corroborating the claimant\u2019s core allegations.\n\n[7] The claimant arrived in Canada in XXXX 2015. He was accepted to the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and graduated in 2018. After his graduation, the claimant had a work permit. However, after 2021, the claimant did not have a valid immigration status. It is important to note that the claimant was unable to apply to refugee protection because he was XXXX and physically unwell as it appears from the evidence. The Panel therefore accept that the claimant is a trans man and that he has a subjective fear of persecution if he returns to Jamaica on a balance of probabilities, because of his gender identity and expression as a trans man.\n\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution\n\n[8] The Panel finds that the objective evidence supports the claimant\u2019s subjective fear and establishes a serious possibility of persecution for the claimant if he is forced to return to Jamaica. The Panel\u2019s reasons are as follows: According to the objective documentary evidence, homophobia and transphobia remain high in Jamaica. LGBT people are regularly subjected to discrimination and violence. There have been consistent reports of severe discrimination and violence being committed against LGBT people in recent years, including assaults, harassment, extortion, and denial of basic human rights and services. According to the objective evidence, homophobia and transphobia in Jamaica has admittedly led to loss of employment, discrimination in the workplace and educational settings, poor health outcomes, and poverty. Accordingly, the law, in its current state, makes LGBT people in Jamaica extremely vulnerable to discrimination, abuse, violence, and extortion. For these reasons, the Panel finds that the claimant\u2019s fear of returning to Jamaica is well-founded according to objective evidence, and that the claimant faces a serious possibility of persecution if he is forced to return to Jamaica.\n\nState Protection\n\n[9] The Panel finds that it would be objectively unreasonable for the claimant to seek the protection of Jamaica. The objective evidence indicates that the state is, at best, ineffective in ensuring the safety of its LGBT citizens. The objective documentary evidence indicates that the LGBT community is being targeted in Jamaica and that the government\u2019s failure to protect its sexual minorities and its failure or unwillingness to hold accountable those responsible for their persecution has helped foster a climate of impunity for perpetrators. The Panel finds that the documentary evidence supports the claimant\u2019s allegation that he would not be protected by the state. Therefore, the Panel finds the presumption of state protection is rebutted.\n\nInternal Flight Alternative\n\n[10] The Panel notes the evidence of discrimination against members of the LGBT community is prevalent throughout Jamaica. The Panel finds there is no particular city or location the claimant could live in without having to hide their personal identity in order to live without persecution. Therefore, there is no IFA for the claimant in Jamaica.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[11] For the foregoing reasons, the Panel concludes that the claimant faces a serious possibility of persecution if returned to Jamaica on the basis of his membership to a particular social group as a trans man, and that the claimant is a Convention refugee under section 96 of the IRPA. Therefore, his claim is accepted. Thank you very much.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

The claimant is unmarried.\n\n[4] On XX XX, 2021 the claimant participated in a demonstration asking for justice for President Jovenel Moise, the president who had been assassinated in July 2021. Demonstrators were attacked by a group of bandits; the claimant was beaten with a baton.\n\n[5] On XX XX, 2021 the claimant received a call from his neighbour. The claimant was informed that armed bandits had attended his home and kidnapped his mother. The claimant\u2019s mother has not been heard from since. The neighbour advised the claimant that he would be killed if he returned home. With the help of his father\u2019 s friend, the claimant travelled north. The following day, armed bandits came north looking for the claimant. The friend of the claimant\u2019 s father assisted the claimant in fleeing Haiti by boat.\n\n[6] The claimant arrived in Canada on XX XX, 2023 and made a claim for refugee protection shortly thereafter.\n\nThe Hearing\n\n[7] The hearing was held by videoconference using Microsoft Teams.\n\nDETERMINATION\n\n[8] I find that the claimant, XXXXX, is a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA based upon his political opinion.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nIdentity\n\n[9] The claimant\u2019 s personal identity and country of citizenship have been established, on a balance of probabilities, as per a copy of his passport,3 his National Identity Card,4 and his birth certificate5.\n\nCredibility\n\n[10] In assessing the credibility of the evidence presented by the claimant, I kept in mind the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in Maldonado,6 wherein the Court stated, in part, \u201cwhen a claimant swears to the truth of certain allegations, this creates a presumption that those allegations are true unless there be reason to doubt their truthfulness.\u201d I find the claimant to be generally credible.\n\n[11] I had some concerns regarding the claimant\u2019 s oral testimony when compared with information in his BOC. For example, there were omissions in the claimant\u2019s written narrative when compared to his oral testimony. I find in some instances this can be explained by embellishment on the claimant\u2019 s part, such as when he testified that when he was in hiding, he learned from his former neighbours that the agents of persecution continued to search for him at his home. In other instance the omissions from his BOC, such as his membership in the Parti Haitien Tet Kale (PHTK), are found in the officer\u2019 s notes in the port of entry notes and in Schedule A, question 7. I accept, as counsel submitted, that this information compliments the claimant\u2019 s allegations in his written narrative of attending a protest seeking justice for the former leader of the PHTK.\n\n[12] More importantly, I found that the claimant\u2019s testimony regarding his involvement with the PHTK was forthright and detailed. His testimony was internally consistent, and plausible with objective evidence. When asked, the claimant provided a cogent explanation for his motivation in joining the party. He described the party meetings he attended and described in detail what ensued at and after the protest he attended on XX XX, 2021 which led him to ultimately flee Haiti. There were no serious contradictions between the claimant\u2019s testimony in this regard and information contained in his BOC narrative.\n\n[13] The claimant submitted a letter from his brother which provides evidence of the kidnapping of the claimant\u2019 s mother and the lack of success of the family in locating his mother.7 I assign significant evidentiary weight to this letter.\n\n[14] As a result of this analysis, I find the claimant has on a balance of probabilities established his subjective fear. I have therefore considered the abject evidence in this claim.\n\nObjective Evidence\n\n[15] I find that the objective evidence supports the claimant\u2019s subjective fears. My reasons follow.\n\n[16] The June 5, 2023 report of the Congressional Research Service (CRS)8 states the following:\n\nHaiti, located on the western third of the island of Hispaniola and bordering the Dominican Republic, remains mired in interrelated political, security, and humanitarian crises. As of June 2023, Haiti lacks an elected president, legislature, and mayors following the July 2021 assassination of President Jovenel Mo\u00efse9\n\n\u2026\n\nSince Mo\u00efse\u2019 s assassination, violent gangs have threatened to overwhelm the Haitian government and businesses, many of which have long been the gangs\u2019 primary benefactors. The symbiotic relationship between the gangs in Haiti and the country\u2019s political and economic elite is well established. Many of Haiti\u2019s past presidents and other prominent politicians have used and received support from gangs. Generally, gangs provide political elites with services such as campaign support, voter intimidation, bribery, fundraising, vandalism, and disruption.10\n\n[17] One Response to Information Request (RIR) provides the following information.\n\n\u201cCriminal groups [are] often directed and used by the government in power.\u201d When it is not possible to use the police \u201cto attack or destroy an opponent,\u201d leaders resort to Haiti: The situation of political parties and the treatment of political opponents, including\u2026 \u201ccriminals.\u201d In \u201csome areas,\u201d \u201ccriminals prevent public gatherings.\u201d 11\n\n[18] One BBC on-line article, issued December 5, 2022, provided by the claimant states the following:\n\nExperts say that armed groups have ties to corrupt political figures \u2013 in power and in the opposition. They supply the gangs with weapons, or finance, or political protection. In return the gangs do their dirty work, generating fear, support, or instability, as required.12\n\n[19] Numerous independent documents report on the prevalence of kidnappings in Haiti.13\n\nState Protection\n\n[20] For the following reasons I find there is no adequate state protection for the claimant in Haiti.\n\n[21] The country documents confirm that in most cases the police in Haiti are unable to help even if they were willing. An RIR from 2019 notes that Freedom House states there is \u201clittle protection from the illegitimate use of force\u201d14 in Haiti. Another source states that \u201cthe Haitian population is left to its own devices and is powerless against the rise of insecurity in the country\u2026 no concrete measures have been taken by the authorities concerned to ensure the safety of citizens.\u201d15 An Assistant Professor quoted in this RIR suggests that police officers do not engage in crime prevention, and rarely conduct criminal investigations. The Assistant Professor notes that they do not have confidence in their own ability\/expertise to do so. The objective evidence suggests that the police are overwhelmed by rising insecurity and are unable to protect even their own staff.16\n\n[22] The judicial system is overburdened, under-resourced, and subject to a lack of oversight. The US Department of State (DOS) report notes that corruption plagues the system, resulting in underqualified individuals being appointed to positions, political tampering with process, and often impunity for certain individuals.17\n\n[23] In light of these weaknesses in state institutions, and given the profile of the agents of persecution, criminals providing support to political factions and some police as well, I find that adequate state protection would not be reasonably forthcoming to the claimant. I find that the presumption of state protection has been rebutted.\n\nInternal Flight Alternative\n\n[24] The test for a viable IFA has two prongs. First, I must be satisfied that the claimant would not face a serious possibility of persecution and that they would not be personally subjected to a risk to life, of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or danger of torture in the IFA. Second, I must be satisfied that it would not be unreasonable in all the circumstances, including those particular to the claimant, for him to seek refuge there. Once an IFA has been proposed, the onus is on the claimant to show that the IFA location is unreasonable, which requires the existence of conditions which would jeopardize their life and safety.\n\n[25] Haiti is a small country, of 11 million people contained within 27,750 square kilometers,18 which lacks adequate state protection. Country condition evidence suggests that communities in the country tend to be quite localized, meaning that locals take notice of newcomers to the area.19 During the hearing the claimant testified that his photograph was taken by the criminals attacking the protestors in XX 2021 and he could, thus, be identified by those opposed to his political views.\n\n[26] An RIR on returnees to the country notes that freedom of movement in Haiti is restricted, and twenty-three armed gangs exist just in Port-au-Prince. Roads are dangerous, and police cannot access the victims of armed gangs who effectively control the civilian populations living in these areas.20\n\n[27] The 2002 report from Austrian Red Cross. Austrian Centre for Country of Origin and Asylum Research and Documentation21 indicates that Human Rights Watch (HRW), in a March 2022 report notes that\n\nGiven the security conditions in Haiti, civil society groups and organizations assisting returnees expressed concern that people expelled or deported to Haiti are at risk of kidnapping and extortion by criminal gangs, which may believe returnees have money for travel or relatives abroad who can pay ransoms.\n\n[28] The Austrian Red Cross report also provides information from an IRB RIR:\n\nIn an August 2020 query response on the situation of Haitians returning to their country after having lived abroad, the IRB quotes several local sources that such individuals faced a higher risk of being targeted by criminals because they were \u201cconsidered to be wealthy\u201d or considered \u201cto have access to money\u201d. IRB notes that according to some sources, society might consider repatriated Haitians \u201ccriminals or wrongdoers\u201d, as repatriation is often associated with being guilty of an offense (IRB, 27 August 2020).22\n\n[29] The claimant testified that the bandits are powerful and have a large sphere of influence. They kidnapped his mother and searched for him at his home in the north of the country where he was in hiding.\n\n[30] Given the small size of the country, the objective documentation on the difficulties of relocation, and the motivation and means of the bandits, including their past ability to locate the claimant after his relocation, I find that the claimant would face a section 96 risk throughout the country. I thereby find that there is no viable IFA in this claim.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[31] As a result of the above analysis, I find the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA. I accept his claim.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c.27, sections 96, 97(l)(a) and 97(l)(b).\n2 Exhibit 2\n3 Exhibit 6\n4 Exhibit 1\n5 Exhibit 5\n6 Maldonado v.

Williams\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): James Hill Lawson\nCountry: Russia\nRPD Number: TC1-05617\nAssociated RPD Number(s): TCl-05624\nATIP Number: A-2024-00593\nATIP Pages: N\/A\n\nDECISION\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n[1] These are the reasons for the decision in the refugee protection claim of principal claimant, XXXXX, and her son, minor claimant, XXXXX, who claim to be citizens of Russia and are claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n\n[2] In rendering these reasons, the panel has applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 4: Gender Considerations in Proceedings Before the Immigration and Refugee Board.1\n\nALLEGATIONS\n\n[3] Details of the claimants\u2019 allegations can be found in the principal claimant\u2019s Basis of Claim form. In summary, the principal claimant alleges that she and her son face persecution at the hands of the principal claimant\u2019s ex-husband, Mr. XXXXX, as the principal claimant experienced domestic violence abuse at the hands of her ex-husband since the year 2011 and he has threatened her life.\n\nDETERMINATION\n\n[4] The panel finds the claimants to be Convention refugees as the principal claimant has established a well-founded fear of persecution based on a Convention ground, namely her membership in a particular social group, women facing gender-based violence; and the associated claimant has established a well-founded fear of persecution based on a Convention ground, namely his membership in a particular social group, as the immediate family member of a woman facing gender-based violence.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nIdentity\n\n[5] The panel finds the claimants\u2019 identities and Russian citizenship has been established, on a balance of probabilities, by the principal claimant\u2019s testimony and the supporting documentation provided, including copies of the claimants\u2019 Russian Federation Passports filed in exhibit 1.2\n\nCountry of Reference\n\n[6] The principal claimant stated in her written narrative that the minor claimant\u2019s father was born and raised in Uzbekistan and acquired Russian citizenship around XX months after marrying the principal claimant on XX XX, 2008. The panel has considered whether the minor claimant has the right to Uzbekistan citizenship on account of his status as the child of a person born in Uzbekistan.\n\n[7] The law of the Republic of Uzbekistan on Citizenship of The Republic of Uzbekistan states \u201ca child, one of whose parents at the moment of the child\u2019s birth was a citizen of the Republic of Uzbekistan, and the other one was a person without citizenship, or was unknown, shall be a citizen of the Republic of Uzbekistan, regardless of the birthplace.\u201d3\n\n[8] Upon review of the minor claimant XXXXX\u2019s birth certificate,4 the minor claimant\u2019s father, Mr. XXXXX, is recognized as a Russian citizen. The principal claimant testified that Mr. XXXXX is not a citizen of Uzbekistan. She explained that Mr. XXXXX was forced to give up his Uzbekistan citizenship at the time he acquired Russian citizenship. The principal claimant testified that Mr. XXXXX did not have a permanent place of residence in the territory of the Republic of Uzbekistan at the time of their child\u2019s birth.\n\n[9] The objective evidence is in line with the principal claimant\u2019s testimony. Uzbekistan citizenship is derived by birth within the country\u2019s territory or from one\u2019s parents.5 For a child to acquire citizenship by descent, at least one parent must be a citizen of Uzbekistan. Dual citizenship is not recognized in Uzbekistan.6 Article 10 of the Law of the Republic of Uzbekistan on Citizenship of the Republic of Uzbekistan addresses the non-recognition of foreign citizenship for citizens of the Republic of Uzbekistan, stating \u201cA person, who is a citizen of the Republic of Uzbekistan cannot be recognized as a citizen of a foreign State.\u201d7 On the subject of citizenship for children whose parents are not both citizens of the Republic of Uzbekistan, the law states, \u201cWith different citizenship of parents, if one is a citizen of the Republic of Uzbekistan when the child is born, the child shall be a citizen of the Republic of Uzbekistan: 1) if he was born in the territory of the Republic of Uzbekistan; 2) if he was born beyond the boundaries of the Republic of Uzbekistan but the parents or one of them at that time had a permanent place of residence in the territory of the Republic of Uzbekistan.\u201d8\n\n[10] In the case of minor claimant XXXXX, the child was born outside the territory of the Republic of Uzbekistan, at the time of his birth his father was already recognized by Russian Federation authorities as a Russian citizen, and the child\u2019s father did not have a permanent place of residence in the territory of the Republic of Uzbekistan. Considering these factors, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the minor claimant\u2019s father did not hold Republic of Uzbekistan citizenship at the time of the child\u2019s birth and does not hold Republic of Uzbekistan citizenship at this time. Accordingly, minor claimant XXXXX does not have an automatic right to citizenship in Uzbekistan, on a balance of probabilities.\n\n[11] The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that acquiring Uzbekistan citizenship is not within the control of the claimants. Therefore, the panel finds Uzbekistan is not a country of reference in this matter. The panel finds Russia is the only country of reference for principal claimant, XXXXX, and her son, minor claimant, XXXXX.\n\nCredibility\n\n[12] The panel finds the claimant to be a credible witness on a balance of probabilities. The claimant testified in a straightforward manner. There were no relevant inconsistencies in the claimant\u2019s testimony, nor were there contradictions between the claimant\u2019s testimony and the other evidence before the panel.\n\n[13] The claimant has credibly established that she married Mr. XXXXX in XX 2008 and suffered domestic violence abuse throughout their marriage. The physical abuse intensified as years went by and the principal claimant received threats to her life by her husband. The principal claimant described incidents of physical assault that occurred after she divorced her husband, including violent physical assaults that occurred in the year 2019 at which time Mr. XXXXX threated to kill the claimant if she ever \u201cgot a new man\u201d, and pressured the principal claimant to resume living together with him. In the principal claimant\u2019s oral testimony, she described ways in which she observed her husband to use their son \u201cas a leverage\u201d in order to harm the claimant or control her. The principal claimant described her son having been affected by witnessing the abuse that she had suffered at the hands of her husband. Following these acts of violence perpetrated against the claimants, the claimants fled Russia, entered Canada in XX 2019, and applied for refugee protection.\n\nSubjective Fear\n\n[14] The principal claimant testified that she traveled to Canada to visit her mother for a period of approximately four months (XX 2008 to XX 2019). The claimant explained the reason she did not apply for refugee protection in Canada at that time is because she had already separated from her husband, and she hoped that the matter would have \u201csettled down\u201d by the time she returned to Russia. The claimant testified that when she returned to Russia the abusive behaviours continued, and her husband began to engage in stalking behaviours and became fixated on the idea of the two of them reuniting. The claimant testified that these behaviours, and threats to the claimant\u2019 s life, continued even after their divorce was finalized.\n\n[15] The panel finds the claimant\u2019s explanation to be reasonable. The panel accepts, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant believed the acts of domestic violence would stop because she and her husband had separated and because some period of time had passed, as the principal claimant has alleged in her oral testimony. The panel finds, under the particular circumstances of the claimant, her decision to return to Russia after visiting her mother in Canada, and her decision not to claim asylum in Canada during that trip, does not detract from her overall credibility or undermine her subjective fear.\n\nDocumentary Evidence\n\n[16] The principal claimant provided documentary evidence in support of her allegations, which includes her marriage certificate issued XX, 2008,9 and certificate of dissolution of marriage issued XX, 2018,10 as evidence of the history of her relationship with Mr. XXXXX. In addition, the claimant provided letters of support from members of her community which include statements of their knowledge of the agent of persecution having neglected his child, abused alcohol, and was observed to be aggressive.11 The claimant also provided medical reports which demonstrate that she was hospitalized on several occasions and was treated for various injuries including bruises and mild concussion after being \u201cassaulted and battered\u201d. Medical reports indicate the claimant was reportedly \u201cassaulted and beaten up by ex-spouse\u201d.12 A letter of support from the principal claimant\u2019s friend XXXXX, includes statements of Ms. XXXXX\u2019s experiences having been approached by the agent of persecution after the principal claimant fled Russia. Ms. XXXXX states that Mr. XXXXX behaved aggressively and has threatened to find principal claimant through the \u201cagency of Interpol\u201d and \u201ctake their son.\u201d13 The principal claimant submitted a XXXXX report which provides details of XXXXX she is facing, including XXXXX, following her experiences of abuse and intimidation by her ex-husband.14\n\n[17] The panel finds the documentary evidence on file to be detailed, relevant and to corroborate the central allegations of this claim. The panel finds the principal claimant\u2019s subjective fear and credibility have been established on a balance of probabilities.\n\nObjective Basis\n\n[18] The panel has reviewed the country condition documentary evidence on file. The National Documentation Package (NDP) for Russia is found at Exhibit number 3.15 Sources throughout the NDP, including but not limited to, NDP item numbers 2.2, 4.12, and 5.1 provide evidence that violence against women is prevalent in the Russian Federation, there is no specific law on domestic violence in the country, and that many constituent elements of domestic violence (insults, threats, obtrusive harassment, economic and psychological violence) cannot be addressed by law and remain unpunished. There is a lack of services available to victims of domestic violence, including emergency shelters, health services and hotline for victims.16 Considering the evidence before the panel, the panel finds the claimants\u2019 fear of persecution is objectively well founded.\n\nState Protection\n\n[19] The principal claimant testified that she reported the domestic violence abuse to police on numerous occasions, however police were dispassionate and stated this was a family matter. The principal claimant stated that her husband was never charged, nor was a restraining order ever issued.\n\n[20] The panel finds claimant\u2019s testimony is in line with the country documentation regarding gender-based violence and treatment of women facing domestic violence in Russia. The panel finds there is clear and convincing evidence before the panel to demonstrate that the state is unable or unwilling to provide the clamant with adequate protection. Sources state:\n\ni. \u201cAccording to the NGO Stop Violence against Women, Russian police do not receive training in handling cases of domestic violence (723). They are hesitant to respond to and register violent crimes of domestic nature. Instead, officers tend to treat domestic violence as a private matter or a personal problem for the affected woman. The work of the police in cases connected to domestic violence is also hampered by a lack of legal options for police to remove or detain a suspected perpetrator unless the officer personally has witnessed the violence. In cases when formal charges are pressed the victim of domestic violence may qualify for state protection (724).\u201d17\n\n[21] In August, a study by the Women\u2019s NGOs\u2019 Consortium found that significant efforts to address the issue of domestic violence against women were absent, with the draft law on domestic violence, stalled from previous years, still failing to make the parliamentary agenda.18 United State Department of State Country Reports on Human Rights Practices in Russia highlights significant human rights issues, including lack of investigation of and accountability for gender-based violence and violence against women. The same source states the government failed to take adequate steps to identify, investigate, prosecute, or punish most officials who committed abuses and engaged in corruption, resulting in a climate of impunity.19 In light of this evidence, the panel finds the presumption of state protection has been rebutted.\n\nInternal flight Alternative\n\n[22] The panel has considered whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for the claimants in Saint Petersburg. The claimant testified that the agent of persecution would be able to locate her in the IFA location as he could obtain information about her whereabouts when she registers her son in school and notifies government authorities of her new address. Furthermore, the claimant testified that her ex-husband has connections with police; and that he could obtain the help of police officers to locate the claimants in the IFA location. The principal claimant provided consistent and straightforward testimony of her personal experiences having witnessed the agent of persecution associating with police officers and having police \u201ccover\u201d for him at times when he has engaged in illegal activities in the past. The panel accepts, on a balance of probabilities, that the agent of persecution associates with police officers.\n\n[23] With respect to the claimants\u2019 requirement to register their personal information with Russian authorities upon return to the country, the objective evidence demonstrates that, \u201cAccording to the Law on the right of citizens of the Russian Federation to the freedom of movement, the choice of a place of stay and residence within the Russian Federation, citizens of the Russian Federation are obliged to register their place of permanent or temporary residence with the authorities.\u201d20\n\n[24] Corruption and abuse of power by Russian officials is well documented in the objective evidence before the panel.21 Corruption in the law enforcement in Russia remains a serious problem,22 including endemic bribery and corruption among the police services.23\n\n[25] The panel finds the principal claimant\u2019s testimony is in line with the objective evidence regarding the requirement to register personal information, including address, with government authorities; and is also in line with the objective evidence regarding the issue of government officials engaging in acts of corruption and abuse of power. Accordingly, the panel finds the agent of persecution has the means of locating the claimant by use of personal identifying information about the claimants which he could obtain on account of his family status as the principal claimant\u2019s ex-husband, and father of the associated claimant. The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that this information may be used by the agent of persecution to obtain information from authorities, including police services, in order to locate the claimants in the IFA location.\n\n[26] The panel finds the agent of persecution has demonstrated his motivation to pursue the principal claimant through a number of abusive actions and ongoing harassment. The panel finds the agent of persecution\u2019 s actions of physically abusing the claimant for many years, threatening the claimant\u2019 s life, and harassing the claimants\u2019 relatives, even after the claimant separated from him, demonstrates the agent of persecution\u2019 s firm intent to maintain control of the principal claimant. The principal claimant has provided evidence of the agent of persecution\u2019s history of making threats to harm their son and use of their son as a means for him to exert control over the principal claimant. Accordingly, the panel finds the agent of persecution would also be motivated to harm the minor claimant, on a balance of probabilities.\n\n[27] The panel finds the agent of persecution has the means and motivation to locate the claimants in the IFA location. Therefore, the panel finds a viable internal flight alternative does not exist for the claimants.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[28] Having considered all the evidence in this case, and based on the foregoing analysis, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that there is a serious possibility that the claimants would be persecuted if the claimants were to return to Russia. Therefore, the claim is accepted, and the panel concludes that the claimants are Convention refugees according to section 96 of Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n1 Chairperson \u2018s Guideline 4: Gender Considerations in Proceedings be\/ore the Immigration and Refugee Board, Guidelines Issued by the Chairperson pursuant to section l 59(l)(h) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, effective July 18, 2022\n2 Exhibit 1, Claim referral information from CBSA\/IRCC\n3 National Documentation Package, Uzbekistan, 31 May 2022, tab 3.1: Law of the Republic of Uzbekistan on Citizenship of the Republic of Uzbekistan.

The claimant is a citizen of Iran, claiming refugee protection in Canada pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n\n[2] In hearing and deciding your claim, I applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9, on sexual orientation and gender identity and expression.\n\nDECISION\n\n[3] I find that you are a Convention refugee under section 96 of the Act, as you face a serious possibility of persecution in Iran related to the Convention ground of your membership in a particular social group (person). Accordingly, I accept your claim.\n\n[4] So, I will now just go through the analysis then. You can relax, you can stand back and relax while I read through the analysis. Okay?\n\nALLEGATIONS\n\n[5] Your detailed allegations are contained \u2014 sorry. In summary, you submit you are transgender and will be sentenced to lashes, forced surgeries, and possibly death if you return to Iran. You allege that you \u2014 when you told your family about your gender identity, they threatened to force you to undergo hormone boosters and conversion therapy to make you more masculine. You testified that you identify as transfeminine and plan to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.\n\n[6] You submit that in Iran, non-binary gender identities are not recognized, and that people are either identified as male or female based on their genitalia. As such, you allege that if you return to Iran, you will be forced to either live as a heterosexual male based on your sex at birth or forced to undergo feminization surgeries and live as a heterosexual woman. You testified that you are attracted to feminine people and that if you do transition to a woman, you would be forced into a relationship with a man because same-sex relations are against the law in Iran.\n\n[7] You departed Iran to study in Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2017, and you filed for refugee protection on August 29th, 2022.\n\nIdentity\n\n[8] Your identity as a national of Iran was established by certified copy of your Iranian passport.\n\nNature of Harm\n\n[9] I find that the harm you face in Iran constitutes persecution that is linked to the Convention ground of your membership in a particular social group. Accordingly, your claim was assessed under section 96 of the Act.\n\nCredibility\n\n[10] Testimony provided under oath is presumed to be true unless there are valid reasons to doubt the claimant\u2019s truthfulness. Overall, I found you to be a credible witness and believe the allegations in your claims. You testified in a straightforward manner, without any relevant inconsistencies or omissions in your testimony and the evidence before me. The testimony was detailed, and you were able to describe in depth your experiences of coming to terms with your gender identity and sexual orientation. You also testified in detail about the difficulties you have had with your family, and your fears of being forced to live a life that is untrue to your identity if you return to Iran.\n\n[11] In light of your credible testimony, I find that you have an established on a balance of probabilities that you are a transgender person who faces a serious possibility of prosecution in Iran.\n\nObjective Basis\n\n[12] The objective evidence in the National Documentation Package for Iran at Tabs 2.1 and 6.1 to 6.12 supports your allegations about the treatment of sexual minorities in Iran. It is reported that sexual minorities face constant threats, insults, harassment, and abuse by both state and non-state actors. Iranian law criminalizes same-sex relations and gender-variant expression with penalties ranging from lashing to the death penalty. Due to the discriminatory laws, people often feel emboldened to perpetrate acts of violence and other abuses against members of the LGBTQ community. It is further reported that LGBTQ persons face a variety of abuses by government authorities, including beatings, verbal assaults, rape assaults, and torture.\n\n[13] Considering the documentary \u2014 the objective evidence, I find that you have established on a balance of probabilities that your fear of persecution in Iran is objectively founded.\n\nState Protection\n\n[14] Considering that the state is an agent of harm, I find that it would be unreasonable for you to seek state protection in Iran. There are several reports in the NDP about police brutality against sexual minorities in Iran, and state authorities using discriminatory laws to carry out human rights abuses against the LGBTQ community. Accordingly, I find that the state \u2014 presumption of state protection is rebutted.\n\nInternal Flight Alternative\n\n[15] I considered whether you have a viable internal flight alternative in Iran. Again, the documentary evidence indicates that the treatment of sexual minorities is the same throughout the country, and additionally, that the laws against same-sex relations and gender expression would affect you anywhere you go in the country. Accordingly, I find that you do not have a viable internal flight alternative in Iran.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[16] So, having considered all the documentary evidence and your testimony, I conclude that you, XXXX XXXX, face a serious possibility of persecution under section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, related to the Convention ground of your membership in a particular social group. Accordingly, I find that you are a Convention refugee and I, therefore, accept your claim for refugee protection.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

In rendering this decision, I have considered and applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guidelines on proceedings before the IRB involving sexual orientation, gender identity, and expression, and sex characteristics that offers guidance to promote greater understanding of cases involving gender identity and expression and the harm individuals may face due to their non-conformity with socially accepted norms in a particular cultural environment.\n\n[2] Mr. XXXX, you allege you were assigned female at birth, and you now identify as a transgendered male. You fear persecution in Hong Kong, China from your family, from the government, and from society in general due to your gender identity and expression.\n\n[3] I find you are a Convention refugee pursuant to 96 of the Act for the reasons that follow.\n\n[4] I find your personal and national identity is established on the balance of probabilities by a copy of your Hong Kong Special Administrative Region passport in evidence. Based on your testimony at the hearing and the documents in evidence, I have noted no serious credibility issues. You testified in a straightforward manner, and there were no inconsistencies between your Basis of Claim narrative and your statements at the hearing.\n\n[5] You also provided documentary evidence in support of your claim, including a letter from your aunt with whom you lived as a young person and who accompanied you through the stages of your gender transition and is also with you in Canada. You also provided your Hong Kong passport and ID documents showing your sex as female. I place full weight on these documents in assessing your claim. I find you have established on a balance of probabilities that you are a transgendered male citizen of Hong Kong and no other country. Overall, I accept the central allegations of your claim on a balance of probabilities. I find that you have established subjective fears of persecution in Hong Kong.\n\n[6] I find your allegations establish a nexus to the ground of membership in a particular social group, specifically due to your gender identity and expression as a transgendered male. As such, I have examined this claim under section 96 of the Act. And based on all the evidence before me, I find you have a well-founded fear of persecution should you return to Hong Kong.\n\n[7] The National Documentation Package or NDP for Hong Kong at Tab 2.10 says that Hong Kong\u2019s present anti-discrimination ordinances do not cover sexual orientation, gender identity, or sex characteristics. The NDP at Tab 2.1 notes that with respect to sexual orientation, Hong Kong has laws that ban discrimination on the grounds of race, sex, disability, and family status. However, no law prohibits companies or individuals from discriminating on the grounds of sexual orientation or gender identity. There are also no laws that specifically aid in the prosecution of bias motivated crimes against members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgendered, or intersex communities. Tab 6.4 tells us there is currently no legislation in Hong Kong which provides for the recognition of the reassigned, acquired, or preferred gender of a person for all legal purposes. Government departments and private bodies are not required by law to accept a sex entry on a person\u2019s HKIC as that person\u2019s legal gender. Neither is there any mechanism to have the sex entry on a person\u2019s birth certificate amended to reflect his or her assigned, acquired, or preferred gender.\n\n[8] Your testimony today corroborates this. You stated that the government of Hong Kong is unwilling to change the sex status on your ID to a male identity. You mentioned the difficulties this presents in your everyday life actions as simple as using a public washroom or observing public decency laws related to gender or simply showing your ID at security checks when entering buildings make it impossible for you to live in Hong Kong, free from discrimination and with dignity. You also testified that Hong Kong is generally a conservative, traditional Chinese culture, holding heteronormative views that reject transgendered individuals. You face stigma and discrimination in all aspects of your life. Further, that your family has not recognised your gender identity and still insists on treating you as a female as though nothing has changed.\n\n[9] Also, China has failed to live up to its international responsibility with respect to Hong Kong by enacting legislation which violates its autonomy and threatens to strangle its freedoms. This is in Item 1.11, and according to the United States Department of State report, found at 2.1 China undermined Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy through an escalating erosion of civil liberties and democratic institutions throughout the year. In June 2020, with the support of the Hong Kong chief executive, the Chinese National People\u2019s Congress unilaterally imposed the national security law on Hong Kong. Significant rights abuses included allegations of police brutality against protesters, arbitrary arrests, and serious restrictions on free expression. While the SAR has laws that ban discrimination on the grounds of race, sex, admissibility and family status, no law prohibits companies and individuals from discriminating on grounds of gender identity. And this source representing submissions from multiple LGBTQ organizations, reports that Hong Kong refused to take legislative steps to protect human rights of LGBTQ persons. And this is at Item 6.3.\n\n[10] Finally, a United Nations document at Tab 6.4 tells us that China still lacks policies or laws that recognize sexual and gender minorities or protects them from discrimination and unfair treatment on the basis of their gender identity or sexual orientation. However, a number of institutional policies on health care and education, as well as school based, or workplace rules have an impact on their everyday life. Based on the objective evidence and your subjective fears of returning to Hong Kong, I find you face a serious possibility of persecution in Hong Kong because of your gender identity and expression, as you would be required to preserve your female status on your ID even though you identify as a male, your documents continue to be marked \u2014 continue to mark you as female while appearing as male, subjecting you to discrimination and harassment amounting to persecution.\n\n[11] There is clear and convincing objective evidence in the NDP specifically at Tabs 2.1 and 6.3 that the state of Hong Kong has failed to protect transgendered individuals. On that basis, I find you have rebutted the presumption of adequate state protection in Hong Kong. And, according to the Chairperson\u2019s Guidelines, being compelled to conceal one\u2019s gender identity constitutes a serious interference with fundamental human rights that may therefore amount to persecution. And a claimant cannot be expected to conceal their gender identity as a way to avoid persecution in their country of reference. Therefore, I find on a balance of probabilities that you face a serious possibility of persecution throughout Hong Kong as the state is in control of all of its territories and no internal flight alternatives would be available to you.\n\n[12] For all of the foregoing reasons, I conclude you are a Convention refugee and I therefore accept your claim.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

The claimants are claiming refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. In this proceeding, the principal claimant acted as a designated representative for the minor claimants, pursuant to subsection 167(2) of the Act, that is the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, and rule 23 of the Refugee Protection Division rules. The minor claimant was not present at the hearing. The Panel heard the claims jointly pursuant to rule 55 of the Refugee Protection Division rules. The principal claimant is the mother of the minor claimant.\n\nALLEGATIONS\n\n[2] The claimants allege threats to their lives by a criminal group called Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia, that is FARC, because the primary claimant\u2019s ex-partner refused to be recruited into the group. The primary claimant, in her Basis of Claim narrative and in her oral testimony, stated that her early years as a child was spent fleeing from FARC, who targeted her family because her father, who was a member of FARC, disassociated himself from the group. She was raised in the care of nuns, including her godmother, who ensured she had a good education and kept her safe until she turned 18. She further claimed that her relationship with her ex-partner put her in danger of FARC members again because her ex-partner refused to be recruited by FARC. After a series of contacts and escape from FARC members, she decided to quit the relationship with her ex-partner in the hope that going separate ways will keep FARC members off her tail and the tail of the minor claimant, who is the child of both the primary claimant and her ex-partner. However, FARC members continued to search for her and continued to threaten her and her son they will kill them both if they do not find the principal claimant\u2019s ex-partner.\n\nDETERMINATION\n\n[3] The Panel finds that the claimants are Convention refugees pursuant to section 96 of the Act, as the claimants will face a serious possibility of persecution in Colombia due to their ethnicity as an indigenous Colombian, in the case of the primary applicant, and an Afro-Colombian in the case of the minor claimant.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nIdentity\n\n[4] The Panel finds that the personal identities of the claimants as nationals of Colombia are established on a balance of probabilities by copies of their Colombian passports submitted to the Board.\n\nNexus\n\n[5] Regarding nexus, the claimants allege that the claimants fear harm from an organised group named FARC in Colombia. The claimants also allege that they would face discrimination in Colombia. One (1) way to perceive these claims would be to consider them under section 97 of the Act, as the claimants fear becoming victims of a criminal group. It does not necessarily appear that the claimants were targeted for the violence and the harm specifically due to their ethnicity. However, the country evidence before me establishes, for example, at Tab 13.1, that Afro-Colombians and indigenous communities are more likely to be victimized by organized criminal groups in Colombia. The primary claimant also described, both in her testimony and in her narrative, how she had experienced harmful racial discrimination in Colombia amounting to persecution. The Panel has an obligation to assess this on the lying profiles, as well as the circumstances that led the claimant to flee Colombia and to claim asylum in the first place. The Panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the threats the claimants have suffered in Buenaventura and Bucaramanga stem in part from their indigenous and Afro-Colombian ethnic background, which makes the claimants disproportionately attractive and vulnerable targets for harm by criminal gangs.\n\n[6] The Panel thus finds that the allegations do have a nexus to the Convention ground of race. As such, the Panel has assessed their claims under section 96 of the IRPA. That is the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n\nCredibility\n\nFailure to Claim in Mexico and US\n\n[7] The Panel notes that the claimants traveled through Mexico and the United States and did not make a refugee claim in both countries. When asked why, the principal claimant explained that they did not make a claim for protection in Mexico because her ex-partner was kidnapped in Mexico, and because FARC has strong business in Mexico. As such, it did not cross her mind to ask for refugee status in Mexico. As regards not claiming in the US, the principal claimant stated that she wanted to come to Canada because her son\u2019s father, that is her ex-partner, is in Canada and it was her ex-partner\u2019s mom who provided her with funds to travel in the hope that she and the minor claimant will go to Canada where her son is. She stated that she only transited through the US and had no intention of staying there. The Panel notes that the claimants left Colombia for Mexico on XXXX XXXX, 2023, arrived in the US in XXXX 2023, and arrived in Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2023. This explanation seems reasonable in their alleged circumstances and therefore does not very significant concerns with respect to the subjective fear of persecution or the claimant\u2019s credibility.\n\n[8] Another element of credibility, the Panel finds the primary claimant to be a credible witness and therefore accepts what the primary claimant alleged in support of their claim. The principal or primary claimant testified in a straightforward manner, and there was no relevant inconsistencies in her testimony or contradictions between her testimony and the other evidence before me. The primary claimant testified about her relationship with her ex-partner, whom the FARC wanted to recruit. She testified about how three (3) men from FARC invaded her partner\u2019s home while she was with him and his family in Buenaventura. The principal claimant also testified through her narrative about how she and the minor claimant fled to Bucaramanga, and how members of FARC trailed them and further threatened them. She testified about how she broke up and separated with her partner in the belief that that would stop members of the FARC from coming after her but how men of the FARC disbelieved her and still threatened her when they found her.\n\n[9] She also stated how she and the minor applicant moved to Bogota in a bid to escape from the FARC member after the FARC members located them in Bucaramanga. The principal claimant also stated that while they registered with the registry of victims, they did not report the incidents to the police because they believed that the FARC worked in collusion with the police. Among the documents the claimants provided to the Board are letters from the principal claimant\u2019s ex-partner and the ex-partner\u2019s mom, and registration as victims of violence made by the principal claimant and her ex-partner. After reviewing the documents and hearing from the principal claimant, I have no reason to doubt their authenticity. The ex-partner of the primary claimant also gave his consent for the use of the documents you submitted for his earlier refugee application made in 2014. The Panel notes that the ex-partner was granted refugee status in 2014 because FARC members not only sought to recruit him but had killed both his uncle and his cousin because they were unable to find the primary claimant\u2019s ex-partner.\n\n[10] The Board further notes that the ex-partner of the primary claimant stated in his letter that he went back to Buenaventura in 2019 because he believed at that time that since the FARC had signed an agreement with the government on halting violence, it would be safe if he returned to Colombia. Even though the Panel finds this reasoning not to be reasonable in the light of the killings of the ex-partner\u2019s family members prior to the approval of his refugee status in 2014, the Panel notes that the essence of this hearing is not to rule on the wisdom of the ex-partner\u2019s decision in going back to Colombia, but to assess whether the claimants are refugees or persons in need of protection as defined by the IRPA. The Panel finds that there is nothing in the claimants\u2019 testimony and documents provided in support of their claim which suggests that they did not experience what they are alleged to have experienced. As such, the claimants enjoy the presumption of truthfulness. What is more, the Panel notes that there was a ceasefire agreement between the government of Colombia and FARC in 2016, which the NDP at Tab 13.8 notes has not brought much benefits to Afro-Colombians in terms of the violence they experienced from armed groups.\n\n[11] Based on the primary claimant\u2019s straightforward testimony, coupled with the corroborative documentary evidence noted above, the Panel finds the primary claimant to be a credible witness and accepts her allegations as true. Specifically, the Panel finds the claimants to have established their fear of racism amounting to persecution in Colombia, and also their fear of being targeted by the FARC criminal group, on a balance of probabilities.\n\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution\n\n[12] Based on the evidence before me, I find the claimants would face a serious possibility of persecution on account of their race as indigenous Colombian, in the case of the primary claimant, and Afro-Colombian in the case of the minor claimant. I find that the cumulative acts of discrimination rise to the level of persecution warranting protection. The Federal Court of Appeal in Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v Munderere, 2008 FCA 84, at paragraph 42 writes, \u201cThese authorities make clear that the Board is duty bound to consider all of the events which may have an impact on a claimant\u2019s claim that he or she has a well-founded fear of persecution, including those events which, if taken individually, do not amount to persecution, but if taken together, may justify a claim to a well-founded fear of persecution.\u201d\n\n[13] This line of reasoning continues to be followed by the federal court in Pava v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2019 FC 1239, reported in CanLII, where the federal court stated, \u201cThe Federal Court Of Appeal and this Court have consistently held that a series of incidents of discrimination in different spheres of life, for example, education, healthcare, housing, or employment, may amount to persecution when considered in their totality. This requires an analysis of whether the discriminatory conduct is serious or systemic enough to be characterized as persecution.\u201d The primary claimant\u2019s ex-partner was the target of recruitment by a criminal gang, leading to the death of his uncle and his cousin. The primary claimant lived the first seven (7) years of her life fleeing from FARC due to the decision made by her own father, who was a FARC member, to leave FARC, and subsequently spent the next five (5) years of her life changing schools due to the fear of being found and killed by members of FARC. The primary claimants also gave oral testimony about the difficulty experienced by Indigenous people in accessing basic amenities, and the different treatments they face in Colombia. She further states that she believes her son, who has features of an Indigenous person, that is facial features, and is also dark-skinned, would face the kind of violence she and her ex-partner experienced in Colombia.\n\n[14] The objective evidence with respect to discrimination against Indigenous and Afro-Colombians show that they face systemic discrimination in a number of different spheres of life, including access to clean water and healthcare, employment, systemic poverty and exclusion from society, and are disproportionately impacted by violent crimes. Tab 13.3 shows that many Indigenous people continue to be displaced, threatened, their minors recruited, and their women and girls raped under victims of crimes in Colombia. Tab 13.4 states that Indigenous people, who are about 3.3 percent of Colombia\u2019s population, accounts for 6.6 percent of the total people displaced in Colombia as a result of armed violence. Tab 13.8 shows that the FARC and other paramilitary groups in Colombia have a history that spans more than 60 years and have caused the deaths of over 260,000 people, and the displacement of over eight (8) million people. According to Tab 13.8 of the NDP, many of these murdered and displaced people belonged to the indigenous Afro-Colombian and rural communities of Colombia. Tab 13.8 also shows that Indigenous and Afro-Colombians continue to be affected by the displacement and violence caused by armed conflicts, even after the 2016 peace agreements by the government and the FARC, and they also continue to face increased vulnerabilities caused by \u201cProfound social disparities,\u201d including, \u201chigh levels of unemployment, widespread poverty, and limited access to essential services such as healthcare.\u201d\n\n[15] Tab 13.1 states that millions of Colombian citizens identify as black or Afro-Colombians. One (1) recent survey estimates that Afro-Colombians make up almost 10 percent of Colombia\u2019s population, while other researchers estimate that as many as one (1) in four (4) Colombians are Afro-Colombians. Colombia\u2019s Afro-Colombian population is concentrated along the Pacific coast. Tab 13.1 also states that Afro-Colombians face, \u201cPersistent structural and historical discrimination,\u201d resulting in, \u201chigh level of poverty and social exclusion.\u201d It further states that there is an unspoken, yet socially shared antagonism against Afro-Colombians by the rest of the Colombian society. Afro-Colombians suffer the worst conditions in terms of literacy, income, and employment, poverty, and general well-being. Most Afro-Colombians in the Pacific Region, where about 90 percent of Afro-Colombians live, have no access to potable water, electricity, healthcare, and food security. A majority of residents of one (1) Afro-Colombian major city have no access to water, garbage collection, and sewage. For that, I refer to Tab 13.1 of the NDP. According to Tab 2. 1, in that city, which is Choco, almost 80 percent of residents lived below the poverty line, compared to 32 percent of Colombia\u2019s population as a whole. The Panel further notes that 32 percent includes the Afro-Colombian population, and the poverty rates for non Afro-Colombians would even be lower.\n\n[16] Tab 2.15 shows that Afro-Colombian and Indigenous children have low rates for receiving scheduled vaccinations and a high risk of chronic malnutrition. Tab 13.1 shows that endemic racism faced by Afro-Colombians impacts even urban and middle-class Afro Colombians in all aspects of life, from major events like finding employments, to every day events like trying to enter a restaurant. Afro-Colombian men in highly professional positions, including directorships, earn only one (1) fifths of what their non Afro-Colombian colleagues earn. As a result of actions by armed groups in Buenaventura, the city now has the highest rates of forced displacement in Colombia, according to government data quoted by the UNHCR. See Tab 1.7 of the NDP. The UNHCR also states that violence perpetrated by armed groups disproportionately affects Afro-Colombians such as the claimants, and according to the agency, there has been an increase in violence and notably murders of Afro descendant individuals in areas in the Pacific coasts. According to another RIR at Tab 7.15, some active groups in Buenaventura have a reputation for committing atrocities in the city, including abducting and dismembering people. A Human Rights Watch report cited in the RIR states that this violence restricts residents\u2019 movements, recruits children, extorts their businesses, and routinely engage in horrific acts of violence against anyone who defies their will.\n\n[17] Also, with respect to the situation of actual Colombians in relation to paramilitaries, the Panel notes that the United Nations Humanitarian Needs Overview for 2022 echoes the UNHCR\u2019s finding regarding the difficult plight of the Afro-Colombian population. It is estimated that about 1.4 million children, teenagers, and young adults, the majority belonging to farmers, Indigenous, and Afro-Colombian communities, have humanitarian needs of protection against the risk of recruitment and use of non-state armed groups, child labour, violence and sexual exploitation, displacement, deaths, mutilations, and other effects of accidents, particularly in Antioquia, Cauca, Choco, Narino, North Santander. See Tab 1.6 of the NDP for more information. On a wider level, the latest US Department of State report for Colombia at Tab 2.1 notes that violence, extortion, and murder by armed groups is a major problem in the country. Tab 2.1 states, and I quote, \u201cArmed groups, as well as narcotic traffickers, are significant perpetrators of human rights abuses and violent crimes, and committed acts of extrajudicial and unlawful killings, extortion, and other abuses such as kidnapping, torture, human trafficking, bombings, restriction of freedom of movement, sexual violence, recruitment and use of child soldiers, and threats of violence against journalists, women, and human rights defenders.\u201d\n\n[18] Tab 13.1 shows that Afro-Colombians and Indigenous Colombians are much more likely to be targeted and victimized by armed groups and criminal gangs. This targeting results in rates of violence described as a grave humanitarian crisis, and restricted movements and access to goods, services, and livelihood. Tabs 2.3 and 2.15 show that Afro-Colombian and Indigenous communities are disproportionately targeted by armed groups for displacement and recruitment of children, and by human traffickers. The primary claimant was a target of violence at a tender age and is now also the target of violence due to her relationship with individuals whose membership the FARC gang sought. Considering all the evidence before the Panel, the Panel finds that the claimants would face a serious risk of racial discrimination as an Afro-Colombian and as an Indigenous Colombian, in the case of the primary claimants, if they return to Colombia. The discrimination may include violence from armed groups and criminal gangs targeting them, their community, and lack of access to employment and basic services. The claimants would not be able to participate in the Colombian society with a basic level of dignity based on their race as Indigenous or Afro-Colombians. The discrimination is persistent, pervasive, and serious, and amounts to persecution.\n\nState Protection\n\n[19] Except in situations where the state is in a complete breakdown, states must be presumed capable of protecting their citizens. To rebut this presumption, the onus is on the claimant to establish, on a balance of probabilities, and through clear and convincing evidence, that their state\u2019s protection is inadequate. The more democratic a state is, the harder it is to dismiss this presumption. The Panel finds that there is clear and convincing evidence before the Panel to rebut the presumption of adequate state protection in the claimant\u2019s particular circumstances. The country reports from the National Documentation Package confirm that state protection in Colombia is not effective. As noted in the UNHCR report on eligible guidelines, the ability of the government to provide protection is severely constrained, both by lack of capacity as well as by corruption and complicity of state authorities. According to the US Department of State report, members of Colombian security forces are accused of collaborating with or tolerating the activities of organized crime gangs, which includes some former paramilitary members. For more information, see Tab 2.1 of the National Documentation Package.\n\n[20] Such information is echoed elsewhere in the NDP, including the Colombian corruption report from GAN Integrity that indicates that police, the security forces, and the judiciary are whole unreliable and corrupt. See Tab 7.12 of the NDP. And regarding Buenaventura specifically, an RIR indicates that the Colombian state has a low level of effectiveness in the city, and that the inhabitants suffered the greatest vulnerability rates in the country. The RIR also notes that more than 2000 investigations into cases of disappearances and forced displacements had been opened, even though none had lead to convictions. On this, see Tab 7.15 of the National Documentation Package. The National Documentation Package on Colombia also notes that there is a lack of political will to implement measures protecting Afro-Colombians and Indigenous persons from discrimination amounting to persecution, and also to respond adequately to their needs. Tab 2.1 of the NDP indicates that state efforts to prevent racist targeting of Afro-Colombians is disorganized when it exists, and the government fails to comply with orders in Colombia\u2019s constitutional courts directing the state to implement specific programs for Afro-Colombians. Tab 13.1 indicates that any programs that do exist are simply symbolic and lack resources to provide effective assistance.\n\n[21] Tab 2.10 indicates that Afro-Colombians and Indigenous communities are disproportionately affected by inadequate state protection and presence in their communities, to such an extent that it is described as abandonment. Item 2.1 describes significant human rights issues in Colombia, including unlawful and widespread killings and corruption of security agencies. Another report at Tab 1.7 indicates widespread distrust of police in Colombia. Those that complain about police corruption often face reprisal. The Panel notes that the fear of reprisal is the reason the primary claimant and her ex-partner decided not to report FARC to the police. And lastly, the Panel will comment on Item 13.1 of the NDP, which indicates that many Afro-Colombians have actually filed formal complaints of racial discrimination against individuals within their governments, while the process turns out to be lengthy and difficult and rarely produces any meaningful results. The Panel finds that, despite the Colombian government\u2019s declared intention to combat racial discrimination, there are simply inadequate practical steps to provide relief from discrimination, and in practice, Afro-Colombians and Indigenous Colombians continue to experience racial discrimination amounting to persecution without adequate state protection. The Panel therefore finds that the presumption has been rebutted.\n\nInternal Flight Alternative\n\n[22] The Federal Court of Appeal in Rasaratnam v Canada, Minister of Employment and Immigration, 1992 1 FC 706, developed a two (2)-pronged test when assessing internal flight alternative, which entails a consideration of two (2) matters. The RPD must be satisfied, on a balance of probabilities. That is one (1). There is no serious possibility the claimant will be persecuted or subjected personally to the risk of section 97 harm in the proposed IFA, and two (2), that the conditions in the proposed IFA are such that it would not be unreasonable, in all of the circumstances, including those particulars to the claimants, for them to seek refuge there. The Panel examined whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for the claimants. Based on the evidence on file, the Panel finds that the claimants would face a serious possibility of persecution throughout Colombia. The Panel has noted the claimants moved from Buenaventura to Bucaramanga, and then to Bogota, all in a bid to find a place to stay. The evidence is clear in the NDP documents cited above that Indigenous and Afro-Colombians face racial discrimination throughout the entire country. There is no place that they will not face racial discrimination that I find would amount to persecution, and there is no place that the Panel finds that they will be able to live with dignity that they are entitled to in all of Colombia. As a result, the Panel finds that there is no viable internal flight alternative for the claimants.\n\nConclusion\n\n[23] The Panel finds that the claimants are Convention refugees pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA. Accordingly, the Panel accepts their claims.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

The claimant felt she had no choice in the matter, so she married him.\n\n[7] The claimant\u2019s marriage was not a good one, and she frequently battled with XXXX. When she gave birth to a son in XXXX 2012, she was initially unable to care for him because of her XXXX.\n\n[8] In 2016, the claimant began a XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX. She graduated in 2019, the same year she began studying XXXX at XXXX XXXX. At the same time, she also began work as a XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX in Kfar Saba.\n\n[9] Following the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, the claimant\u2019s then-husband became more controlling, subjecting her to physical abuse as both were largely confined to the house by health restrictions.\n\n[10] In XXXX 2021, the claimant went on a holiday to Belize alone to recuperate. When she returned, she realized that she could not continue the marriage.\n\n[11] In XXXX 2022, she told her mother that she wanted to divorce her then-husband. In response, her mother said if that happened, one person would be in the grave (the claimant) and one person would be in the jail (the family member who killed her \u2013 likely her unbalanced brother XXXX).\n\n[12] The claimant contacted social workers and the police. Officers said they could place her in a shelter but that she would not be able to work.\n\n[13] In XXXX 2022, the claimant told her then-husband she wished to divorce him, but he refused to permit to her to do so. He also prevented her from going outside, but with the help of a friend, the claimant was able to fly to Canada in XXXX 2022 and claim refugee protection.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nIdentity\n\n[14] The claimant\u2019s personal identity and her identity as a national of Israel has been established by her sworn testimony and the certified copy of her Israeli passport in evidence.[4] I accept that she is a national of Israel and no other country.\n\nNexus\n\n[15] I find the claimant has established a nexus to the Convention.\n\n[16] To satisfy the definition of a \u201cConvention refugee\u201d found in section 96 of the IRPA, a claimant must establish that they face a serious possibility of persecution on account of their race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion in their country of nationality.\n\n[17] The claimant fears gender-based violence from her family and her ex-husband because of her desire for a divorce.\n\n[18] I find such allegations have a nexus to the Convention ground of membership in a particular social group \u2013 woman facing domestic violence. Because of that, I have assessed her claim according to section 96 of the IRPA.\n\nCredibility\n\n[19] I found the claimant to be a credible witness.\n\n[20] In line with the Federal Court\u2019s decision in Maldonado v. Canada, a claimant\u2019s sworn testimony creates a presumption that the individual\u2019s allegations are true unless there is a reason to doubt their truthfulness.[5] In this case, I found the claimant to be credible, consistent, sincere and forthright in her testimony.\n\n[21] The claimant testified in a straightforward fashion, highlighting how she feels trapped in a culture that she cannot escape. I find that the claimant did not seek to embellish or exaggerate the threats she has faced from her family in Israel. For instance, she emphasized that, while she never wished to marry her then-spouse, her marriage was essentially manageable until Covid-19 because the couple\u2019s respective schedules (she would go to school and work in the day, while he would leave at 3 p.m. to open his XXXX and only return when she was asleep) meant she rarely saw her then-husband. Even then, though, the claimant noted he would still try and control her by gaining access to her WhatsApp and telling her colleagues to stay away from her.\n\n[22] The claimant explained that Covid-19 made things impossible to continue. Because her then-husband could no longer go to work, she was stuck with his presence whenever she came home from her job at the XXXX in Kfar Saba. Living under the same roof, she said, gave him the opportunity to abuse her more often and prevent her from engaging in any activity except working for the family.\n\n[23] The claimant also painted a nuanced portrait of the threats she faces from her family. The claimant stated that her mother controls the household and that even her father, a former XXXX XXXX, has to abide by what she says at home. For instance, when her mother chose her future spouse as a partner, the claimant\u2019s father and sympathetic older brother, XXXX, tried to dissuade the mother, saying the man was too old for the claimant. The mother, however, refused to heed any criticism, saying she knows best and that, because the man had money from his XXXX, the claimant could marry and continue her studies.\n\n[24] The claimant further explained that, when she decided to tell her family in XXXX 2022 that she wished to divorce her spouse, she first did so while her mother was out. In response, XXXX agreed with her, acknowledging that it was not a good match for her. When the mother learned of the discussion, however, she threatened to have XXXX kill the claimant.\n\n[25] I find her testimony regarding her family dynamics to be credible. Rather than paint her family as a monolithic institution that is bent on harming her, she explained that it is her mother who is the driving force in demanding that she remain in the marriage and that everyone else in the home simply acquiesces to her whims. Given that it would be easier for the claimant to exaggerate that everyone in her family is determined to harm her over her wish for a divorce, I thus found her credible when she explained that the picture is more complicated.\n\n[26] The claimant also submitted documents in support of her claim. I give high weight to the following documents,[6] as I find them to be authentic and probative in establishing, on a balance of probabilities, the credibility of her allegations.\nA copy of an email that the claimant sent to colleagues on XXXX XXXX XXXX, 2022, explaining that she had had to quit because \u201cof a conflict with her family;\u201dA copy of WhatsApp correspondence between the claimant and a friend about finding police assistance;Pictures of the claimant\u2019s bruises due to physical abuse.\n[27] Ultimately, I found the claimant\u2019s testimony to be devoid of major inconsistencies, while I have also given significant weight to the aforementioned documents. As a result, I accept that the claimant faced abuse in her marriage and that her desire for a divorce ignited a conflict in her family. Because of these findings of fact, I find that the claimant has established, on a balance of probabilities, that she has a genuine subjective fear of persecution in Israel.\n\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution\n\n[28] Based on the claimant\u2019s testimony and the available documentary evidence, I find that she has a well-founded fear of persecution in Israel.\n\n[29] The claimant suffered abuse at the hands of her husband over the course of their relationship \u2013 abuse that worsened with the onset of the pandemic. Moreover, once she told her family that she wished to divorce her husband, her mother threatened to kill her.\n\n[30] I find that the National Documentation Package (NDP), as well as disclosure from counsel, provides an objective basis to the claimant\u2019s subjective fears of persecution in Israel.\n\n[31] According to the latest U.S. Department of State (DOS) report for Israel, 24 women and girls were killed by their partners or other family members in 2022. The item also quoted the Israel Women\u2019s Network as stating that more than 200,000 women lived in situations of domestic violence in the country.[7]\n\n[32] A report from United Nations shows that \u201c[b]etween 2014 and 2015, about 200,000 women were victims of domestic violence. Yet, according to the Government, only 17,939 cases of domestic violence were opened in 2014, of which 80 per cent were filed by women. This shows a serious underreporting by women.\u201d According to the same item, a U.N. rapporteur believes that patriarchal attitudes and gender stereotypes are deeply entrenched in Israeli society. In the context of conflict and occupation, these attitudes and stereotypes are tolerated, and have rigidified constituting root causes of gender-based violence against women.[8]\n\n[33] Other studies have noted that there is an uptick in the number of \u201cnon-Jewish\u201d women who have been murdered in femicides in recent years. In 2018, for instance, 17 of the 29 women murdered in Israel were \u201cnon-Jewish;\u201d in 2019, that figure was 10 of 18.[9] The authors of the study criticized Israeli authorities for refusing to reveal whether \u201cnon-Jewish\u201d meant Arab, but in light of the study\u2019s findings that a high number of Arab women are murdered every year in Israel and reports that non-Jewish and non-Arab communities account for no more than 3.9% of Israel\u2019s population,[10] I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the \u201cnon-Jewish\u201d femicide victims are mostly Arab, as there is no evidence to indicate that femicides disproportionately affect the country\u2019s small non-Jewish and non-Arab population.\n\n[34] There is other evidence that domestic violence especially affects Arab women. According to a chapter in an academic book about femicide penned by an Arab member of the Knesset, honour killings especially impact the community. \u201cArab tradition generally accords \u2018ownership\u2019 over the woman to her birth family \u2026 It is therefore seen as the responsibility of close male blood relatives in the natal family to \u2018punish\u2019 women, and it is their family\u2019s honour that must be regained.\u201d The chapter continues, noting that, while sexual relations outside marriage are the primary reason for honour killings, the concept of honour has expanded to include any behaviour by women that is not approved, including challenging male authority and taking responsibility for their own lives.[11]\n\n[35] In this case, I acknowledge that there is no evidence that the claimant had sexual relations with someone other than her ex-husband, but I accept that she falls within the ambit of people who are targeted in honour killings as an Arab woman has tried to take responsibility for her own life by divorcing her husband and trying to pursue her career.\n\n[36] In sum, the claimant\u2019s mother has threatened the claimant with death for desiring to divorce her husband. The objective evidence, meanwhile, indicates that domestic violence and femicide is a profound problem in Israeli society that especially affects Arab women. Based on the totality of this evidence, I find that the claimant has established that she has a well-founded, forward-facing risk of persecution in Israel.\n\nState Protection\n\n[37] I find that the claimant cannot avail herself of adequate state protection in Israel.\n\n[38] States are presumed to be capable of protecting their citizens, except in cases of complete state breakdown. The more democratic the country, the more the claimant must do to show that they have exhausted all available means of obtaining state protection.[12] Claimants are expected to approach the state for protection unless it is unreasonable to do so.\n\n[39] In this case, I find that the claimant has rebutted the presumption of adequate state protection.\n\n[40] The documentary evidence reveals that even with the laws and resources in place, and state intervention in cases of domestic violence,\nthere is a concern that the \u201cprevalence of domestic violence against women and girls has not decreased significantly\u201d (\u2026). Sources reports that, according to a WIZO [Women\u2019s International Zionist Organization] representative, there are \u201cdifficulties\u201d in the implementation and enforcement of protection orders for women victims of violence (\u2026). The WIZO representative is quoted by the Times of Israel (ibid.) and the Jerusalem Post (\u2026) as saying that the \u201c\u2018lack of enforcement'\u201d puts women at risk with their violent spouses.[13]\n\n[41] The claimant testified that she had approached authorities for protection because of the threats against her. In response, the police offered her a place in a shelter but noted that she would not be able to leave the premises, meaning she would not be able to work.\n\n[42] The objective evidence indicates that there are just 14 shelters in the country, just two of which are for Arab women.[14] And while I note that the claimant, as a fluent Hebrew speaker, would not have linguistic problems at shelters like other Arab women, I note that the objective evidence also indicates that she can only stay at such a shelter for three months before she must leave.[15]\n\n[43] And while I acknowledge that the claimant identifies herself first and foremost as an Israeli \u2013 rather than, for instance, a Palestinian or an Israeli Arab \u2013 I nevertheless note the objective evidence from organizations like Amnesty International that states that the Israeli state has effectively imposed a system of apartheid on Arabs under their control, whether in Gaza, the West Bank or Israel itself. This system is \u201cintended to prevent Palestinians from claiming and enjoying equal rights to Jewish Israelis within Israel and the [occupied Palestinian Territories], and thus intended to oppress and dominate the Palestinian people.\u201d[16]\n\n[44] Given that the claimant is an Arab woman, I find, on a balance of probabilities, that she is even less likely to receive adequate state protection from authorities who have been accused of subjecting Arabs under their control to apartheid.\n\n[45] Based on the totality of this evidence, I find that the claimant has rebutted the presumption of adequate state protection with clear and compelling evidence.\n\nInternal Flight Alternative\n\n[46] I also find that the claimant does not have a viable internal flight alternative (IFA) in Israel.\n\n[47] In Rasaratnam,[17] the Federal Court of Appeal developed a two-prong test to assess whether an IFA is viable. The test entails the consideration of two matters: (1) Whether the claimant would be at risk in the IFA, and (2) whether it is reasonable in all the circumstances, including those particular to the claimant, for him to relocate there. In this case, I proposed the cities of Tel Aviv and Haifa as potential IFAs at the outset of the hearing.\n\n[48] For the proposed IFA to be viable, it must fulfill both prongs of the test.\n\n[49] In the claimant\u2019s case, however, I find that neither city is viable. All of Israel is only just slightly larger than the U.S. state of New Jersey.[18] Moreover, the two proposed IFAs are located within no more than 100 kilometres of the claimant\u2019s hometown of XXXX. Moreover, I accept counsel\u2019s submissions that the Arab population of Haifa and Tel Aviv is comparatively low,[19] meaning the claimant would be more visible.\n\n[50] Given Israel\u2019s small size and the claimant\u2019s family motivation to harm her for engaging in actions that threaten the honour of her family, I find that the claimant does not have a viable IFA in either Tel Aviv or Haifa.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[51] For the forgoing reasons, I determine that the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA; as such, the Board accepts her claim.\n\n(signed) Stefan Martens\n\nDecember 8, 2023\n\n[1] Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n\n[2] Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (IRB) Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 4: Gender Considerations in Proceedings Before the Immigration and Refugee Board, July 2022.\n\n[3] Exhibit 2.\n\n[4] Exhibit 1.\n\n[5] Maldonado v.

Ouchakov\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Mirna Farahat\nCountry: Israel\nRPD Number: VC3-00122\nAssociated RPD Number(s): VC3-00123, VC3-00125, VC2-11202, VC3-00124\nATIP Number: A-2023-01721\nATIP Pages: N\/A\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n[1] This is the decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) in the claims of XXXX XXXX (the \u201cprincipal claimant\u201d), his wife, XXXX XXXX (the \u201cfirst associate claimant\u201d), and their children, XXXX XXXX (the \u201csecond associate claimant\u201d), XXXX XXXX (the \u201cthird associate claimant\u201d), and XXXX XXXX (the fourth associate claimant\u201d). The claimants are citizens of Israel, and they are making claims for refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).[1]\n\nALLEGATIONS\n\n[2] The claimants\u2019 allegations are fully set out in their Basis of Claim (BOC) forms and the accompanying narrative.[2] In summary, the claimants fear returning to Israel because they have been threatened by a criminal group.\n\n[3] The claimants lived in the Northern District of Israel. The principal claimant successfully ran a XXXX XXXX and a XXXX XXXX, while the associate claimant was a XXXX at a XXXX XXXX. The other associate claimants were either in university or registered to being their university studies.\n\n[4] In XXXX 2022, the principal claimant was approached by an unknown person to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. As part of the process, the principal claimant required the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, however, the man refused to do so. The principal claimant opted not to do the job. Hours later, armed men entered his office threatening the principal claimant, saying that the XXXX belonged to A.L. family and he better do the job, or they would come after him and his family.\n\n[5] The principal claimant called his brother who owned a XXXX XXXX XXXX and told him what had happened. His brother confided that he was approached weeks earlier to support some illegal business which he refused to do and reported to the police. With the encouragement of his brother, the principal claimant went to the police and filed a complaint. A few days later, a person called on behalf of the A.L. family, threatening that the principal claimant would regret reporting them to the police and that his family would pay the price. The principal claimant reported the threats to the police. The principal claimant was scared, thus he stopped going to work for a few weeks. When he returned, he found that the tires on his trucks had been slashed and there was a note on his window indicating that this was only the beginning. In early XXXX 2022, the vehicles belonging to the principal claimant\u2019s brother were set on fire.\n\n[6] A.L. is a criminal group comprised of one family, who controls the north of the country and are connected to other gangs in the rest of Israel. They engage in threats, extortion, indiscriminate shootings, and offering protection in exchange of money. The A.L. family began to infiltrate government institutions and people are afraid to file complaints against them because the police do not take action against them.\n\n[7] On XXXX XXXX, 2022, the principal claimant received a call from the police indicating that his brother had died from a shooting incident. The principal claimant was very scared because of what happened to his brother, particularly since the A.L. family knew where he lived and worked. On XXXX XXXX, 2022, the principal claimant found a note on his car windshield which said \u201cyou and your family are next in line to be killed. We will kill you one by one.\u201d\n\n[8]\nThe principal claimant applied for electronic travel authorization (eTA) the same day and purchased his children\u2019s tickets to Calgary. They left on XXXX XXXX, 2022. The first associate claimant\u2019s passport had to be renewed, so the principal claimant stayed with her until the passport was renewed. The principal and first associate claimant left Israel on XXXX XXXX, 2022. The claimants made claims for protection shortly after their arrival in Canada.\n\nDETERMINATION\n\n[9] I find that the claimants are persons in need of protection pursuant to section 97(1), as they have satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that they would personally be subjected to a risk to their life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or a danger of torture, should they return to Israel.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nIdentity\n\n[10] The claimants\u2019 identities as nationals of Israel are established by the sworn statements in their BOC form[3] and the certified copies of their Israeli passports in evidence.[4]\n\nNexus\n\n[11] For claimants to be considered Convention refugees, the well-founded fear of persecution must be by reason of one or more of the five grounds enumerated in the Convention: race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion. The fear that the claimants face is due to threats by a criminal group, after the principal claimant refused to work with them. I find that there is no nexus between the claimants\u2019 allegations and the Convention. Although the claimants are Arab and Christian, their issues in Israel do not arose because of their nationality or their religion. Their problems are criminal in nature. As such, I find that there is no nexus to the Convention in these cases. Therefore, I have assessed these claims under section 97(1) of IRPA.\n\nCredibility\n\n[12] There is a presumption that sworn testimony is true unless there is sufficient reason to doubt its truthfulness.[5] When a claimant swears to the truth of certain allegations, this creates a presumption that those allegations are true unless there is reason to doubt their truthfulness.[6]\n\n[13] The principal claimant provided most of the testimony at the hearing, and all other claimants based their allegations on his narrative. I found the principal claimant to be a credible witness. His testimony was consistent and forthright. He testified in a clear and concise manner and did not embellish his testimony. Furthermore, he provided ample details and expanded upon his allegations.\n\n[14] The principal claimant testified that he lived in an Arab town. He experienced discrimination due to his nationality as it relates to work. The principal claimant owned a XXXX XXXX, and he was not allowed to do work with Jewish people, he could only work with Arab companies. The principal claimant\u2019s parents live in Israel, and he has 3 brothers. One lives in Canada, one lives in Jerusalem, and one has died. The principal claimant does not have a close relationship with the brother who lives in Jerusalem, and in fact, they had not communicated for approximately 20 years. The principal claimant saw this brother when they held the funeral for his other brother; however, the relationship is not close.\n\n[15] The principal claimant testified that he fears the A.L. family because they have threatened his life, and the life of his family. The principal claimant refused to perform work for the A.L. family, which resulted in them targeting the claimants. The principal claimant reported the threats to the police; however, nothing was done. On the contrary, the threats increased because the A.L. family found out that they had been reported to the police. The principal claimant explained that this family is involved in the military and that they have access to government services, including the police. Thus, they become aware when they are reported to police. Furthermore, after the principal claimant went to the police, the A.L. family told him that he would be sorry that he went and complained to the police.\n\n[16] The principal claimant explained that the A.L. family is comprised of 4 brothers who have approximately 800 persons working for them. He learned of the A.L. structure through the news. The A.L. family controls the northern portion of Israel, and they have close ties with the criminal family who controls the southern portion of the country. The principal claimant described the A.L. family as having no mercy and having no fear to kill anyone. He mentioned an example of a case where a child was murdered by the A.L. family in front of his father. In addition, the principal claimant testified that the A.L. family has a lot of money and are very well connected with the police and Israeli authorities.\n\n[17] The principal claimant testified that his brother had been experiencing difficulties due to the A.L. family as well, and in fact, he encouraged the principal claimant to report the A.L. family to the police. In XXXX 2022, the principal claimant\u2019s brother was killed. A few months later, the principal claimant received a note on his vehicle which said that he was next. The principal claimant believes this is clear indication that the A.L. family is responsible for his brother\u2019s murder.\n\n[18] In addition to the credible testimony before me, I have considered the documentary evidence submitted in this case.[7] In support of their claim, the claimants have submitted evidence of their religion, evidence of the death of the principal claimant\u2019s brother, evidence of the damage done to the principal claimant\u2019s truck, a copy of the threatening message left for the claimants, evidence of the claimants\u2019 businesses, and letters of support. I find that the documentary evidence corroborates the claimant\u2019s allegations.\n\n[19] I note that the principal claimant\u2019s brother, who resides in Canada, was available to testify; however, his testimony was not required.\n\n[20] Based on the totality of the evidence before me, I find that the claimants are credible and as such, I accept their allegations.\n\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution and Risk of Harm\n\n[21] In Ward[8], the Supreme Court of Canada held that the test for establishing a fear of persecution is bi-partite in nature. Refugee claimants must establish both that they have a subjective fear of persecution if they return to their home country and that their fear is well-founded in an objective sense. The subjective component relates to the existence of fear of persecution in the mind of the refugee and the objective component requires that the refugee\u2019s fear be evaluated objectively to determine if there is a valid basis for that fear.[9]\n\n[22] Based on the claimants\u2019 testimony and evidence, I find that they have established with credible and trustworthy evidence, that they genuinely fear returning to Israel. I have also considered that the claimants left Israel shortly after the threats intensified and they made claims for protection a couple months after arriving in Canada. I find that their actions demonstrate a subjective fear.\n\n[23] In addition to showing that they have a genuine fear, the claimants must show that their fear is well-founded in an objective sense. I have reviewed the evidence submitted by counsel, which indicates that Arab society is witnessing an escalation in violence and crime in Arab towns, despite the presence of the police.[10] The evidence before me is that there is growing strength of organized crime in Israeli Arab society, and the Israeli police allow members of crime organizations to operate freely.[11] This is consistent with the claimants\u2019 experience, given that nothing was done after they reported the threats by the A.L. family to police. Gang leaders in Palestinian communities feel that there are no repercussions for their actions, which has led to a spike in crime in those areas. [12]\n\n[24] The United States Overseas Security Advisory Council report before me states the following:\nIsrael-based organized crime syndicates remain a serious concern to Israeli law enforcement, and the country saw an increase of such incidents in 2020. There were 65 assassination attempts related to these criminal organizations, including 18 car bombs and 47 shootings resulting in 31 deaths and 48 injuries, including five civilian deaths.[13]\n\n[25] I find that the country condition evidence before me establishes that criminal organization are a serious problem in Israel. The information before me is also consistent with the claimants\u2019 experiences. As such, I find that the claimants have established that their fear is objectively well-founded.\n\nState Protection\n\n[26] There is a presumption that countries can protect their citizens. The claimant bears the burden of rebutting that presumption. The evidence before me is that the Israeli government has created a two tiered-citizenship structure, resulting in Palestinian citizens, such as the claimants, having a status inferior to Jewish citizens by law.[14] The newly adopted \u201cBasic Law: Israel \u2013 The Nation State of the Jewish People\u201d declares Israel to be a Jewish state. It defines Israel as the historical homeland of the Jewish people and exclusively grants the Jewish people the right to national self-determination in the country.[15]\n\n[27] Furthermore, Israeli authorities did not always apply the same laws to all residents, and they disproportionally devote enforcement actions to Palestinian neighbourhoods. Furthermore, there is serious violent behavior by Israeli police cited as occurring against Palestinians in Jerusalem.[16] Israeli police are reported to have failed to protect Palestinian citizens of Israel from premeditated attacks, even when plans were publicized.[17]\u2019\n\n[28] I have also considered that the claimants sought police protection as the principal claimant reported the threats to police. However, rather than help them, it appears that the police disclosed the reports to the agent of harm. As a result of the reports to police, the threats against the claimants increased in seriousness.\n\n[29] Given the police\u2019s failure to help the claimants, their disclosure of the police reports to the agent of harm, and the discrimination faced by Palestinian Israelis at the hands of the police, I find that state protection is not available in this case. As such, I find that the claimants have rebutted the presumption of state protection as there is clear and convincing evidence before me that it would be unreasonable for them to seek the protection of the Israeli state.\n\nInternal Flight Alternative\n\n[30] Section 97(1) of the Act states the following:\n97 (1) A person in need of protection is a person in Canada whose removal to their country or countries of nationality or, if they do not have a country of nationality, their country of former habitual residence, would subject them personally\n\n(a) to a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture; or\n\n(b) to a risk to their life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if\n\n(i) the person is unable or, because of that risk, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of that country,\n\n(ii) the risk would be faced by the person in every part of that country and is not faced generally by other individuals in or from that country,\n\n(iii) the risk is not inherent or incidental to lawful sanctions, unless imposed in disregard of accepted international standards, and\n\n(iv) the risk is not caused by the inability of that country to provide adequate health or medical care.[18]\n\n[31] According to 97(1)(b)(ii), the risk to the claimants must be faced in every part of that country and is not faced generally by other individuals in that country. The Federal Court has accepted, in several decisions, that the IFA analysis is the same under section 97(1) as under section 96.[19]\n\n[32] The Federal Court of Appeal in Rasaratnam,[20] developed a two-prong test when assessing whether an internal flight alternative (IFA) is viable, this test entails a consideration of two matters: (1) would the claimant be at risk in the IFA, and (2) is it reasonable for the claimant to relocate there. Both prongs of the test must be satisfied to find that a claimant has an IFA. Once the issue of IFA has been raised and potential IFAs identified, the burden of proof rests with the claimant to show that they do not have an IFA.\n\n[33] The cities identified as possible IFAs in this case are Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.\n\nRisk\n\n[34] The principal claimant testified that the claimants cannot relocate to Tel Aviv or to Jerusalem because the A.L. family would be able to find them anywhere in the country. First, the principal claimant explained that Israel is very small. He likened it to driving from one end of Calgary to another, which takes approximately 1 hour. He stated that in this same time, you could travel through three fourths of Israel. The cities identified as IFAs are close to his hometown. Tel Aviv is approximately 65 kilometers away and Jerusalem is approximately 100 kilometers away,\n\n[35] The principal claimant testified that the A.L. family is very powerful. They have infiltrated government departments and in fact, one of their leaders is a retired government employee. The A.L. family also has close ties to the criminal family who controls the south of Israel, thus the claimants fear that through their connections, the A.L. family would be able to find them anywhere. The principal claimant explained that if he relocated, he would have to register his new address with the government. Similarly, if he opened a new business, by law, he must register the business. He fears that the A.L. family would have access to that information, thus they would be able to locate him.\n\n[36] The principal claimant testified that since his departure from Israel, unknown persons have been seen around his home. Furthermore, the first associate claimant\u2019s brother-in-law was directly contacted asking for the whereabouts of the claimants. The principal claimant believes that the A.L. family will look for him because when they decide that someone needs to be eliminated, they need to follow through in order to keep their powerful image in front of others. They need to show the public that they deliver on their promises, and they use such cases as examples in order to control the population.\n\n[37] I find that the claimants have established that the agent of harm is motivated to find them and that they have the means and resources to do so. The A.L. family is large, they have approximately 800 members. Furthermore, they are well connected. One of the leaders worked for the government, and they have clearly infiltrated the police given that they were able to find out that the principal claimant reported them to the police. In addition, they have a reputation to uphold. I find it credible that the organization\u2019s modus operandi is to keep control over the population through fear. Therefore, it is important for the organization to act on their threats. I also find that the evidence before me establishes that the A.L. family is able to and willing to act on their threats, as evidenced by the murder of the principal claimant\u2019s brother. Given the A.L. family\u2019s infiltration within the police and government, I find it credible that they would be able to find information regarding the claimants, such as their new address, given that they would have to register their relocation with government authorities. Based on the totality of the evidence before me, I find that the claimants have established that the A.L. family has the means and motivation to find them throughout Israel. As such, I find that they would be at risk anywhere in the country.\n\nReasonableness\n\n[38] Although I have found that the IFA test fails on the first prong, I have also assessed the second prong, and I find that the test also fails on the second prong. The second prong of the IFA analysis is whether it is objectively reasonable, in all the circumstances, including those particular to the claimant, for the claimant to seek refuge elsewhere. The burden placed on the claimant is high to show that the IFA is unreasonable. It requires nothing less than the existence of conditions that would jeopardize the claimant\u2019s life and safety in the IFA location.[21]\n\n[39] The principal claimant testified that discrimination exists against Arabs in Israel. For example, the village next to his is Jewish, and Arabs are not allowed to rent or purchase homes there. He testified that Tel Aviv is predominantly Jewish, and that Arabs in Jerusalem are segregated. Therefore, the claimants would be unable to live in either city.\n\n[40] The evidence before me is that Palestinian citizens of Israel continue to experience marginalization in a range of areas, including housing, access to services, and employment.[22] Arabs remain segregated from the Jewish majority, with most living in Palestinian majority towns, what are among the poorest and most marginalized areas in the country.[23] Furthermore, Palestinian Israelis are subjected to wide-ranging discrimination in housing, social welfare, education, criminal justice, and other areas.[24]\n\n[41] The claimants are Arab and have lived in an Arab-majority town. They were able to thrive in that environment; however, if they had to relocate, I find that they would be subjected to discrimination which would hamper their ability to find employment and housing. Therefore, I find that relocation within Israel is not reasonable in the claimants\u2019 particular circumstances.\n\n[42] Having found that the claimants face a risk throughout Israel, and that relocation is unreasonable, I find that an IFA is not viable for the claimants.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[43] For the above noted reasons, I find that the claimants are persons in need of protection as per section 97(1) of IRPA. As such, their claims are accepted.\n\n(signed) Zonia M.

This is the decision of the Refugee Protection Division in the following claims. VC2\u201110309 XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, VC2\u201110310 XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, VC2\u201110311 XXXX XXXX XXXX, VC2\u201110312 XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. All citizens of Colombia who are claiming refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and 96(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n\nALLEGATIONS\n\n[2] The claimants allege that XXXX is a child, a minor under the age of 18 years, and a family member who is in the process of transitioning from male to female. XXXX is presently 17 years of age. The claimants allege that if they were to return to Colombia, that XXXX would be in danger of persecution, of a serious possibility of persecution because of her sexual identity. The claimants further allege that the remaining three (3) family members, because of the societal structure and biases within Colombia, would also face harassment amounting to persecution because of XXXX\u2019s sexual identity. I have reviewed and applied Chairperson\u2019s Guideline number 9 Proceedings before the IRB involving sexual orientation, gender expression, and identity. I am mindful of the socio-cultural context of a sexual minority person and family who live in a country where transitioning is not approved in general society and where social norms based on religion incite harassment and violence towards sexual minorities.\n\n[3] I look at Guideline 8.5.5 dealing with minors. A minor who is identified as or is perceived to be a SOGIESC individual may be particularly vulnerable for harm. Examples of the harm that may amount to persecution for a minor who identifies or is perceived to be SOGIESC may include sexual and physical violence, forced procedures, hormone therapy, sexual orientation conversions, forced confinement. Examples of discriminatory treatment experienced by minors who are identified as or perceived to be SOGIESC that may cumulatively amount to persecution in the particular circumstances of the case include family rejection, social ostracism, denial of education, expulsion from school, harassment in school and bullying. I find that section 8.5.5 is particularly on topic with respect to XXXX. And I find that she and her family members are Convention refugees pursuant to section 96 of the Act for the reasons that follow.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nNexus\n\n[4] In order for a claimant to have a successful refugee claim, there has to be a nexus to one (1) of the five (5) grounds found in the United Nations Convention on the status of refugees. In this case, I find that XXXX is a member of a particular social group, being a person in transition. I also find that her parents and brother are members of a particular social group, being close family members of a person undergoing transition. As such, I have assessed this claim in accordance with section 96 of the Act.\n\nIdentity\n\n[5] In Exhibit 1, I am able to find passports and supporting visas from the United States and Canada for the claimants, and I believe that they are \u2014 have established their personal identity as citizens of Nigeria (sic).\n\nCredibility\n\n[6] The claimants testified today in a very straightforward manner. I heard from the mother and father of XXXX and of XXXX. There was no relevant inconsistencies between the testimony that they provided and the other evidence before me, which include the several Basis of Claim forms and a lengthy narrative. XXXX testified in a manner that showed intelligence and courage as a 17-year-old in dealing with very serious and detrimental problems concerning her sexual identity. She testified that as a child of about four (4) years old, she realized that she was not a boy, but rather a girl and began living her life as a girl. She is presently 17 years of age and is undergoing XXXX XXXX in Canada consistent with a person of that age receiving normal treatment in transition. I found that the other claimants, being XXXX\u2019s parents, also testified in a straightforward manner and provided details of the things that have occurred in XXXX\u2019s life and her own life, their own lives. I find that XXXX suffered ongoing harassment that arises \u2014 rises to the level of discrimination as she was expelled from four (4) schools. She received \u2014 she was ostracized, stigmatized, and isolated in her communities by her neighbors and close family members. She was harassed and bullied in school. And all of these cumulatively identified to me that the harassment she received as a person in transition amounts to persecution.\n\n[7] The parents also described the isolation, social stigma and familial ostracization that they incurred, along with their minor son, that they have been threatened not only by their neighbors, but by rebel groups who have become aware of XXXX\u2019s sexual identity. They have at one (1) point had to commence a lawsuit against the government in Colombia in order to secure education and medical treatment for XXXX that should have normally been available to her but was only denied to her because of her sexual orientation. The \u2014 I find that \u2014 sorry, the claimants have stated that should they return to Colombia, that XXXX would continue to be the object of persecution, especially at this stage of her transition where she would have difficulty in obtaining the medical support necessary for her to complete transition and that in society she would be stigmatized and would be persecuted in trying to find medical treatment, education, and employment. I find that the family members would also be subject to harassment that is tantamount to persecution because they have received threats from neighbors and rebels. They have been stigmatized. They have been isolated from their family, and they have had to take extreme steps of going to court, which has stigmatized them within the government. Concerning their subjective fears. I find that they have a well-founded fear of returning to Colombia because the harassment would continue, and it would be cumulative to persecution.\n\n[8] Dealing with the objective evidence, I rely on a number of documents found in the National Documentation Package for Columbia, Item 5.13, Item 6.1, and Item 6.4. However, I refer directly to Item 2.15, which is a report from the United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees. And note the following, that the High Commissioner \u2014 sorry, the Human Rights Council, not the High Commission on Refugees, the Human Rights Council has noted that there are a number of problems and impediments in society for people of different sexual identities. And it has recommended that Colombia continue to and step up its efforts to combat stereotypes in society and prejudice against lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex people. The document further states that the Human Rights Committee is also concerned about instances of ill treatment of persons who are deprived of liberty, including members of the lesbian, gay, transgender, and intersex population. And that the Office of the High Commissioner of Human Rights has reported in detail about killings, attacks, threats, arrests and detention, infringements on the rights to privacy, enforced disappearances, and sexual violence affecting male and female human rights defenders, journalists, trade unionists, and people of gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex groups, as well as socially and human rights activists. Based on the objective evidence and their subjective fear, I find that the claimants have a well-founded fear of persecution in Colombia if they were to return there.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[9] For the foregoing reasons, I find that the claimants are Convention refugees pursuant to section 96 of the Act, and I accept their claims and I welcome them to Canada.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

I note your identity documentation on record reflects your birth as male. However, I will address you by your chosen name and pronouns in accordance with section 4.1 of the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9 on Proceedings Before the IRB involving Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Expression, and Sex Characteristics. Indeed, in hearing and deciding your claim, I have considered and applied this guideline.\n\n[3] I have considered your testimony and the other evidence in this case, and I am ready to proceed with the decision orally. You are self-represented. You have no legal representation at this hearing, so I gave you an opportunity to state on the record if you understood what the hearing was about. You confirmed your understanding of the process. As a result, I ensured various procedural safeguards were in place, such as going over the procedure of the hearing in detail, and including the issues in the claim. Throughout the explanations, I continued to check in with you, and you continued to advise that you understood the process of the hearing.\n\nDETERMINATION\n\n[4] I find that you are Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the Act, and you have a well-founded fear of persecution in Fiji by being a member of a particular social group of being a transgender woman for the following reasons.\n\nALLEGATIONS\n\n[5] You are 27 years old. You self-identify as a transgender woman. You were born male, but always identified with feminine interests from a young age and have been subjected to mental and physical abuse for it. You have experienced harassment from your family and society while living in Fiji. You were bullied in school and had continued difficulties, which resulted in you relocating to Suva, the capital city, in 2014, after high school, where you state that you continued to experience abuse. You allege that you have had to endure constant threats and abuse from family and society because of your failure to adhere to gender norms. You state that you are not safe in Fiji.\n\n[6] You came to Canada in XXXX 2022, and you made a claim soon after. You allege that if you return to Fiji, you will not be able to exercise your basic human rights, as you will not be able to live life as you want, or dress as you want. You fear that you will be killed for being transgender.\n\nIdentity\n\n[7] Your identity has been established by a copy of your passport from Fiji and your testimony today.\n\nNexus\n\n[8] I have established this claim under section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, as I conclude that the risk you face constitutes persecution based on at least one (1) of the grounds prescribed in the Refugee Convention. Specifically, your membership in a particular social group, being a transgender woman in Fiji.\n\n[9] I speak to Credibility. You testified it in a straightforward and honest manner. You did not embellish or elaborate. When you did not understand my question, you asked for clarification. Your testimony was consistent with your Basis of Claim form, and I find you are a credible witness today. You spoke about your childhood, how you felt different growing up, which you started noticing from about 12 years of age while you were in primary school, but you fully confirmed in high school after interaction with others. You talked about how you are your father\u2019s only son and expected to carry on the family name, and how the family wanted you to do masculine activities. However, you preferred to play with your cousins who are girls. This also happened at school, as you preferred to play traditional female sports instead of male sports.\n\n[10] You testified that since coming to Canada, you have started XXXX XXXX for your physical appearance, and you will start XXXX XXXX towards the end of the year. You further stated that you feel free, and you do not feel at risk in Canada, as there is freedom for members of the LGBT community.\n\n[11] I will speak to lack of corroborative documents. A claimant must provide acceptable documents establishing their identity and other elements of their claim. The claimants who do not provide acceptable documents must explain why they did not provide the documents, and what steps they took to obtain them. However, there is no general requirement for a claimant to provide corroborating documents. I note that you are self-represented, and you have no legal assistance in this process, and you testified that you were not aware about obtaining documentation. I also note that the SOGIESC Guideline under section 3.2 states that an individual\u2019s testimony may be the only evidence of their SOGIESC, where, in a given case, corroborative or additional evidence is not reasonably available. Given the presumption of truth set out in Maldonado, the credibility of your testimony today, as well as the SOGIESC Guideline, I do not make negative inference from your lack of corroborating documents. Based on the presumption of truthfulness, your consistent testimony, and information provided by you in this claim, I accept that you are transgender and that you have a well-founded fear of persecution based on your gender identity as a transgender woman. I therefore find that your subjective fear is established by a credible testimony, and I believe what you have alleged on a balance of probabilities.\n\n[12] Given that there are no serious credibility issues with respect to your central allegations, coupled with the consistent manner that you have testified today, as well as the documentary evidence that I set out below, I find that you have established a prospective risk of being subjected to harassment and threats or other actions related to your status as a transgender woman in Fiji. The allegation of risk is corroborated by the following documents in the National Documentation Package, which I will refer to going forward as NDP, for Fiji, which is dated May 31, 2022. The objective evidence demonstrates that individuals who are transgender face treatment in Fiji that amounts to persecution. NDP 2.1 states that the constitution prohibits discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation, gender, and gender identity and expression. Nevertheless, there have been complaints of discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, or intersex persons in employment, in housing, in access to care, and in other fields.\n\n[13] NDP 2.3, a Freedom House report, states that lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and related communities face discrimination in employment and access to health care. You have indicated that you will start hormone therapy soon. However, this will not be permitted in Fiji. NDP 6.2 states that it is not possible for transgender people to change their gender markers on identity documents, and there is no legal recognition of Fiji\u2019s traditional third gender persons. There is some social space for trans women in Fiji. However, the work opportunities and cultural roles involve stereotypes of significant limitations. Non-heterosexual sexual orientation is especially a taboo. You would not likely be able to change your gender assigned legally in Fiji. I find that this requirement is in itself persecutory. Individuals who cannot obtain a legal change of gender are by extension unable to change their gender on their identity documents. You have also testified that you would not be able to obtain hormone treatments in Fiji.\n\n[14] I find that you will face a significant level of stigma in Fiji, as you have in the past, if you are not identified as male on the identity documents but you present as female. I find that you will not be able to exercise your fundamental rights as an individual. I find that the level of discrimination you will face in employment, accessing health care, and other services, as well as the threats of harassment and violence, is sufficiently serious to be persecution. You cannot live openly as a transgender in Fiji without facing a serious possibility of persecution. Based on the presumption of truthfulness and your credible testimony, I accept that you are a transgender woman, and I find that you will face persecution in the society at large on this basis, and you will not be able to live safely as a transgender woman in the Fiji society. Based on the totality of evidence, I find that you have established a well-founded fear of persecution in Fiji.\n\n[15] Now I speak to state protection. So, the next question is whether you may be able to go to the Fiji authorities for protection, and I find that you would not. According to the SOGIESC Guideline at 8.6.5, the criminalization of same-sex relationships must be carefully considered to determine whether state protection is adequate at an operational level. And it states that I, as a Member, need to examine the degree of actual implementation, the effectiveness, and durability of this legislative or other improvements in light of how state actors and general society continue to treat SOGIESC individuals. In this case, although the Fiji constitution prohibits discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity, there is still discrimination in the society.\n\n[16] NDP 2.3 states that LGBT+ people continue to face discrimination within Fijian society, although there is a growing movement in support of marriage equality. However, Prime Minister Bainimarama has been criticized for making prejudiced remarks in the past, and declared in August 2019 that so long as FijiFirst, a political party, remained in power, same-sex marriage would be outlawed. This indicates that there are significant obstacles for justice for SOGIESC individuals in Fiji, including, as noted, harassment, and violence, and threats of arrest from police, police refusal to file complaints submitted by LGBTI persons owing to bias or stereotypes, and the Prime Minister reiterating that as long as his political party remains in power, there would be no same-sex marriage. You have attempted to report an assault to the police in XXXX 2022, after an assault and robbery, and was made fun of, and asked embarrassing questions, and asked why you were the way you were.\n\n[17] NDP 6.2 gives instances where SOGIESC individuals have detailed their fears, including the non-responsiveness of police to crimes in the LGBT community. NDP 10.1 states that there are allegations of human rights abuses against the police and the military, with figures showing Fiji police officers being charged with 400 serious offences in five (5) years, including murder, manslaughter, rape, and abduction. Your fears are consistent with the information in the country reports in the ND as stated above. It is clear that state protection would not be reasonably forthcoming to you as a sexual minority and as a transgender woman. I find that the presumption of state protection has been rebutted by clear and convincing evidence. There is very little protection for the rights of SOGIESC individuals in Fiji. Therefore, I find that state protection is not available to you in your particular circumstances.\n\n[18] I have also considered whether there is a viable international flight alternative for you in Fiji. Based on the evidence regarding being a SOGEISC individual, particularly a transgender woman in Fiji, I find that a risk extends beyond your localities where you have lived and includes risk from state authorities and society at large. There is a strong societal bias against LGBTI individuals throughout Fiji. As such, there is no safety for you. I have considered the size and population of Fiji. NDP Tab 1.2 states that the total area of Fiji is about 18,000 square kilometers, and the population of Fiji is at 935,000, which is less than one (1) million people. I have also considered that you, hiding your gender identity in order to live safely, would be unreasonable in Fiji. You have already moved from your place of birth, XXXX, to the capital city in Suva, and you still experienced discrimination in different forms. Therefore, I find that you will face a serious possibility of persecution everywhere in Fiji. Accordingly, I find that there is no internal flight alternative available to you.\n\n[19] In conclusion, for the foregoing reasons, I find that you have established that you are a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the Act, and I accept your claim.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

So there are, therefore, two (2) countries of reference in this claim. She is claiming refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and section 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n\n[2] And for the purposes of clarification, the claimant\u2019s immigration documents and identity documents are in the name she was given at birth which is XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. But the claimant no longer uses that name.\n\nALLEGATIONS\n\n[3] The claimant\u2019s allegations are fully set out in the Basis of Claim form and detailed narrative. In summary, the claimant fears she will be \u2014 she will face discrimination, harassment, threats, violence and possibly death from members of society, generally, and the police, in both Kuwait and Egypt, because she is a transwoman. The claimant also fears that her family, who do not currently know that she is a transwoman, may force her to undergo some sort of, \u201cTreatment or ritual,\u201d in order to, in her words, \u201cFix her.\u201d\n\nDETERMINATION\n\n[4] I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to Section 96 of the IRPA as she has a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention ground, namely, for membership in a particular social group as she is a transwoman. And in arriving and \u2014 at this determination, I have considered and applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guidelines pertaining to sexual orientation, gender identity and expression and sex characteristics.\n\nIdentity\n\n[5] The claimant\u2019s identity as a citizen of Egypt is established by the passport in Exhibit 1. And the passport shows that she was born in Kuwait and she has provided her birth certificate at Exhibit 6. The passport contains multiple residency permits for Kuwait. And I note from her Basis of Claim form that her parents and brother currently live in Kuwait. The claimant\u2019s evidence is that she has never lived in Egypt. I accept on a balance the probabilities, the claimant has the rights and responsibilities of a permanent resident in Kuwait and, therefore, Kuwait is rightfully a country of reference in this claim. And I see no issue of exclusion, pursuant to article 1FE (sic) \u2014 1E. I note the Minister was notified about the potential of a 1E exclusion and, by letter, which is Exhibit 5, states that they did not believe 1E was an issue in this claim.\n\nNexus\n\n[6] I find that there is a nexus between the claimant\u2019s allegations and the Convention ground of membership in a particular social group, namely transwomen, in Egypt and Kuwait. And I have, therefore, considered this claim under section 96 of IRPA.\n\nCredibility\n\n[7] The Federal Court has held in Maldonado, that when a claimant swears to the truth of certain allegations, it creates a presumption that those allegations are true unless there is a reason to doubt their truthfulness. In this case, I have no reason to doubt the truthfulness of the claimant. The claimant provided a detailed narrative and extensive evidence to support her allegations that she is a transwoman. The evidence included multiple letters from friends in Canada, some of whom have known the claimant for years, and who met the claimant before she identified as a transgender woman. And she provided the letter from her boyfriend, XXXX, who has known her for approximately five (5) years and has been her partner for one (1) and a half years. She provided photographs of herself with her friends over the years, which show her both pre and post-transition. And I find the evidence provided to be credible as it supports her allegations that she identifies as a woman. She also provided a letter from a doctor who indicates she was diagnosed with XXXX XXXX and has been receiving XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX since XXXX 2020, as well as a letter from her XXXX.\n\n[8] I need not repeat the claimant\u2019s Basis of Claim narrative in this decision and I found the narrative to be detailed and compelling. She explains how she was constantly teased, as a child growing up in Kuwait, for being a feminine boy and how family members approached her mother with their concerns that she might be gay. And that her mother told her she had to, \u201cShut down these concerns.\u201d Her mother took her to weekly meetings, at one (1) point, for several months to, \u201cFix her aura.\u201d The claimant writes that he \u2014 that she felt that she had two (2) choices in Kuwait at the time, either never act on her attraction to men and live a solitary hidden life, or to be herself and suffer severe harassment and abuse and be told she will, \u201cBurn in hell.\u201d The claimant states that she was XXXX throughout middle and high school and decided to come to Canada to study in 2017. In Canada, she has met a supportive group of friends who accept her and love her as she is. And she states that being in Canada has been, \u201cVery liberating,\u201d for her and she feels that for the first time she has a community that she can call her own.\n\n[9] In her narrative, she describes her medical decision to XXXX XXXX such as XXXX, why she did that and how her, \u201cBody finally felt like a part of her rather than a detached vehicle that she lives in.\u201d She also describes changing her name to XXXX and her use of personal pronouns, she and her. I find that the claimant has established, on a balance of probabilities, that she is a transwoman.\n\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution\n\n[10] I find that the claimant\u2019s subjective fear is objectively well-founded. I will consider Kuwait first. Item 2.1 of the NDP is the United States Department of State report, which indicates, \u201cPolice incited, perpetrated, condoned and tolerated violence against LGBTQI+ persons.\u201d Transgender persons reported cases of repeated harassment, detention, abuse and rape by police who blackmailed and raped them without fear of reprisal. Consensual same sex sexual conduct between men is illegal. The law criminalizes consensual same sex sexual activity between men, older than age 21, with imprisonment of up to seven (7) years. And these penalties are enforced. The 2.1 item describes one (1) instance of a transgender woman, in October 2021, being sent to prison for two (2) years for the crime of, \u201cImitating the opposite sex,\u201d in her online activities and she was held in solidarity confinement at central prison for men. The Court of Appeal, on November 22 \u2014 2021 amended that verdict to one (1) month imprisonment and a fine.\n\n[11] The report further states, \u201cDue to social convention and potential repression, LGBTQI+ organizations neither operated openly nor held any events or pride marches.\u201d Since then, as the claimant provided an update in Exhibit 6, Kuwait\u2019s Constitutional Court has overturned the law which imposed a fine and imprisonment for one (1) to two (2) years \u2014 one (1) to three (3) years for persons imitating the appearance of the opposite sex in public, saying it violated personal freedom. But the article notes that the judiciary is historically transphobic and cite Shariah law in its judgments denouncing, \u201cSex change,\u201d as, \u201cThe work of the devil and against Islamic and Kuwaiti values.\u201d Item 6.2 is a Human Rights Watch report from June 2020, which details a transgender woman\u2019s treatment by police in Kuwait. She had been summoned four (4) times to the police station for the former crime of imitating women, and states she was raped and beaten senseless by police and detained seven (7) months in 2019. The Human Rights report states, \u201cTransgender women have reported multiple forms of abuse at the hand of the police, while in detention, including degrading and humiliating treatment such as being forced to strip and being paraded around police stations, being forced to dance for officers, sexual humiliation, verbal taunts and intimidation, solitary confinement and emotional and physical abuse that could amount to torture.\u201d\n\n[12] Item 6.1 is the 2019 report issued by the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association, which states that in 2013, the government banned gay men and transgender persons from even entering the country. And the director of public health announced that the country had developed, \u201cA technology to detect such persons.\u201d So this 2019 report was quoting an Atlantic article which was entitled, \u201cKuwait Thinks its Gaydar is Good Enough to Ban Gays From the Country.\u201d I find the objective evidence corroborates the claimant\u2019s fear that she faces a serious possibility of arrest and physical abuse at the hands of the police in Kuwait due to being a transgender woman. Furthermore, the objective evidence indicates that society does not support a person who is \u2014 who wishes to be openly gay or transgender in Kuwait. One (1) article, provided by the claimant, states that the Kuwaiti government, less than one (1) year ago, launched an extensive campaign against LGBT slogans, most notably the rainbow flag. The claimant\u2019s evidence that she was continually harassed and insulted for being a feminine, when she was in Kuwait, and that her family tried to, \u201cFix her.\u201d\n\n[13] Considering the evidence before me regarding the treatment of LGBTQ community in Kuwait by the state and the laws in place, and her own experience growing Kuwait, I find that the claimant\u2019s fear is objectively well-founded and there is a serious possibility she will face discrimination as a transgender woman in the form of harassment, threats and violence by members of society and the police. And possible arrest amounting to persecution.\n\n[14] Now regarding Egypt, the 2021 US DOS human report (sic), which is at 2.1 states although law does not explicitly criminalize consensual same sex activity, LGBTQI+ persons were arrested and prosecuted in Egypt on charges such as debauchery, prostitution and violating family values. For which the law provides prison sentences of up to 10 years. According to a local rights group, there was more than 250 reports of such arrests since 213 (sic). Rights groups and activists reported harassment by police, including physical assault and forced payment of bribes to provide information concerning other LGBTQI+ individuals or to avoid arrests. There were reports of authorities using social media, dating websites and mobile phone apps to entrap persons they suspected of being gay or transgender.\n\n[15] Rights groups reported that authorities, including the forensic medical authority, conduct forced anal examinations, which rights groups indicated primarily targeted LGBTQI+ individuals. The law allows for conducting forced anal exams in cases of debauchery. Authorities did not use anti-discrimination laws to protect such individuals. Legal discrimination and social stigma impeded LGBTQI+ persons from organizing or advocating publicly in defense of their rights. In May 2021, border guard prevented two (2) transgender Israelis from entering the Sinai for tourism because they did not appear to belong to the sex listed in their passports. According to LGBTQI+ rights organizations, in a 2020 annual report issued in January, Authorities arrested 25 individuals in 2020 and conducted forced anal exams on six (6) persons.\n\n[16] According to Item 6.1 of the NDP, the laws against debauchery have been used liberally to imprison men in recent years and it also notes that in January 2019 a television host was sentenced to one (1) year imprisonment for just interviewing a gay man on television. Item 6.2 states, \u201cEgyptian authorities do not only target gay and transwomen, but also bisexual men, intersex and gender non-conforming individuals. Simply put, they persecute anyone who looks as if they do not fit social norms. The violations of the rights of LGBTQI+ persons in Egypt means the deterioration of the rule of law that affects all individuals expressing ideas or behaviours that do not align the narrow and cis-heteronormative conception of what Egyptian society should resemble.\u201d\n\n[17] So like in Kuwait, the Egyptian authorities are targeting and attacking transgender persons and arresting them for debauchery. A television host was sentenced to a year imprisonment just interviewing someone who was gay on his show. The objective evidence overwhelmingly indicates that there is social stigma against LGBTQI+ persons in Egypt. Considering the evidence before me regarding the treatment of the community in Egypt by the state and the laws in place, I find that the claimant\u2019s fear in Egypt is objectively well-founded and there is a serious possibility she will face discrimination as a transgender woman, including harassment, threats and violence by members of society and the police in Egypt. And possible arrest amounting to persecution.\n\nState Protection\n\n[18] I find that there is no adequate state protection for the claimant in either Kuwait or Egypt. The objective evidence discussed, as I have already stated, indicates that both countries have either enacted laws against LGBTQI+ persons or use other laws, such as debauchery, against the community and they enforce them. As the state is one (1) of the agents of persecution, I find that the claimant has rebutted the presumption of state protection in both countries.\n\nInternal Flight Alternative\n\n[19] I find that there is no viable internal flight alternative for the claimant in either Kuwait or Egypt. The respective laws against same sex relationships are in effect throughout the two (2) countries and are enforced, often violently. The homophobic attitude and treatment that the claimant experienced growing up in Kuwait by members of her own community and from members of her own family, would continue if she would were to return to her home country as a transwoman. And those attitudes will be shared in any potential IFA in Kuwait and Egypt. The claimant states that in Canada, for the first time in her life, she has a community she calls her own. I find the claimant would not have such a safe community anywhere in Egypt or Kuwait.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[20] Considering all of the foregoing, I find that the claimant has established that there is a serious possibility she will face persecution if she were to return to Kuwait or Egypt and I accept her claim.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

Can you tell me your full name? Just because I note the Board had tried to contact you based on your Basis of Claim form and your documents. So, there is a middle name which was not on your Basis of Claim form. So, can you just confirm your full legal name?\n\n[2] CLAIMANT: It is XXXX XXXX XXXX.\n\n[3] MEMBER: Okay. Perfect. Okay. So, I will add that. Okay. So, thank you for indulging me with the long break. And I have considered all of the evidence and your testimony, and I am going to grant you your claim for refugee protection. So, for this part, what I am going to do is, I have reasons as to why I am granting your claim and I have to read them into the record. It is lengthy. So, what I am going to ask you to do is to just go on mute, and I will read the decision into the record, and then you will also receive a copy in writing.\n\n[4] CLAIMANT: Okay. Just to confirm, the decision, is positive?\n\n[5] MEMBER: Positive, yes. I have granted your claim.\n\n[6] CLAIMANT: Okay. That \u2014 that is improving overall, I was anxious a little. It decides my life. So, thank you so much.\n\n[7] MEMBER: You are welcome. So, for this part, yes. I will just ask you to please go on mute and I will let you know at the end when I am finished.\n\n[8] So, I am ready to decide this matter now. This is a decision of the Refugee Protection Division in the claim of XXXX XXXX XXXX, a citizen of India. The date is November 28th, 2023. I am going to be giving you the reasons for this decision orally, but you will be provided with these reasons in writing shortly. The written reasons that you receive will reflect those that I am giving to you now, but they may, however, be edited for general readability, or to add references to legal citations or country documents.\n\nThe Law\n[9] You are claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, IRPA, I-R-P-A.\n\nThe Decision\n\n[10] In coming to my decision today, I have considered your testimony and the other evidence before me. I find you are a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA. I have considered and applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9 in coming to this decision today.\n\nALLEGATIONS\n\n[11] You allege the following in your Basis of Claim form, and narrative which is found at Exhibit 2. You are a transgender person and cannot live openly and freely in India. You came to Canada to claim protection. You allege if you return, you face persecution. You allege there is no state protection for you or an internal flight alternative.\n\nIdentity\n\n[12] Your personal identity and Indian citizenship have been established on a balance of probabilities by your testimony and supporting documents filed, which namely include a copy of your passport, found at Exhibit 1.\n\nNexus\n\n[13] I find there is a link between what you fear and the Convention ground out of particular social group, of transgender persons. And your claim has therefore been assessed under section 96.\n\nCredibility\n\n[14] In terms of your credibility, I find you to be a credible witness, and I therefore believe what you have alleged in your oral testimony and in your Basis of Claim form. Your overall testimony was spontaneous, detailed, and consistent with your narrative and most compelling. You provided additional details requested in a forthright manner. You testified that you described yourself as a transgender woman.\n\nYou testified about living with bullying and harassment as a child in school and in an environment where you could not trust anyone. You had a hard time making friends in school. Your parents were emotionally, verbally, and physically abusive towards you since you were a child, and forced you to act masculine. You testified about your realization of being transgender in college. You experienced XXXX and felt like an outcast.\n\nYou approached your parents to seek help and also tried to connect with an organization in India to support LGBTQ+ individuals. However, there was only so much they could do due to lack of resources. Your parents took you to see XXXX and did not accept the diagnosis that you were given a XXXX XXXX. It was clear from your testimony that your family, particularly your father and mother, were not supportive of you or the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nFurther, you testified your mother is part of the political community in India. In your Basis of Claim, you state your mother\u2019s political group, Maharashtra Navnirman Sena, MNS, is a group of religious and orthodox values which even suppressed basic human rights under the name of religion and promote violence as they see fit in their form of justice.\n\nYou testified about the medical treatments you are considering concerning your gender identity in Canada, and to being disowned by your parents once they found out about this while you were studying in Canada. You described a pervasive culture, intolerant \u2014 sorry. You described a pervasive culture of intolerance in India, despite attempts by the government to implement legislation which aim to protect LGBTQ+ communities. You said that police would not help you because in most cases they are the ones committing abuse against LGBTQ+ individuals.\n\nYou testified that during your own crisis where you XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, a police officer told you that you should be ashamed and next time you would be arrested for being trans. You testified that you felt accepted and free to express yourself in Canada. You were clearly passionate about pursuing a career in Canada, perhaps in XXXX XXXX. You said you were able to live your life \u2014 your real life in Canada where female clothing, long hair \u2014 and are accepted by society. You said this would not be possible in India. You said you plan to fully transition to a female and you want to live an honest life without having to look over your shoulder. A life where you do not have to hide your true self.\n\nTo corroborate your testimony and narrative, you submitted a support letter from your doctor in Canada, dated XXXX XXXX, 2022, corroborating you were under care for XXXX XXXX and were on a waitlist since XXXX 2020, with a first visit in XXXX 2021; a letter from a XXXX at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, dated XXXX XXXX, 2022, corroborating your identity as transgender and that you were receiving XXXX for XXXX XXXX and further stating you reported abuse by your parents who did not support your XXXX; a copy of the referral note from the doctor in India referring you to be tested for XXXX XXXX in XXXX 2018 while you were in India.\n\nI have no reason to doubt their \u2014 the authenticity of these documents and give them full weight in corroborating your allegations. And I find you are a transgender woman who fears harm in India based on your gender identity and member of the LGBTQ+ community. You came to Canada in XXXX 2020 and claimed protection in January 2023. You explained that you planned to study in Canada and had a valid study permit until XXXX 2023.\n\nAt Exhibit 4, you also provided printed copies of e-mail exchanges between you and the XXXX XXXX XXXX, says advisor at XXXX XXXX, concerning the difficulty you were having in paying school fees, wherein the advisor, who was aware you are a trans woman and the problems you faced in India with your parents, provided you with financial options to consider, with seeking refugee protection. being one (1) of those options based on your situation.\n\nI find no reason to doubt the authenticity of the e-mails and give them full weight in corroborating your allegations and in establishing your subjective fear. You were a student with a valid visa, and you sought the assistance of the advisers at your college based on your situation. And it was because of this assistance you were able to start your claim for refugee protection in Canada.\n\nYou applied for an extension after the first visa had expired, and learned you could claim for protection here. You said you felt this would be a good decision as you learned that Canada would \u2014 was safe and would protect you. I find your explanation for delaying claiming to be reasonable and credible in light of your circumstances, and I have taken into account your lifetime of harassment, bullying, and lack of acceptance in my assessment of your credibility. I therefore find that your subjective fear is established by your credible testimony and supporting documents.\n\nObjective Basis\nBased on your testimony and the available documentary evidence, I find you have a well fear \u2014 a well-founded fear of persecution in India as a transgender woman. The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade Report, or DFAT, at Exhibit 3, at Item 1.5, notes a lack of protection, intolerance, abuse, and violence experienced by LGBTI persons.\n\nThe Constitution guarantees the right to equality before the law and equal protection. In 2014, the Supreme Court Of India ruled the rights and freedoms of transgender people are constitutionally protected, including the right to self-perceived gender identity. However, LGBTI students face barriers in education with bullying and harassment, difficulties accessing toilets, and obtaining identity documents. It is reported that most families do not accept their male child behaving in ways considered feminine, and children who do \u2014 sorry. And children who do so risk being subjected to violence.\n\nThe 2019 Transgender Persons Protection of Rights Act gave transgender persons a right to self-perceived identity, but registration with the government for official recognition is required after submitting proof of gender reassignment surgery. This legislation has been criticized for failing to prevent and reduce anti-transgender public sentiment and treatment. At Item 6.1, a Response to Information Request notes criticisms of the Transgender Persons Protection of Rights legislation, including denying transgender people the right to self-identification; criminalisation of begging, which is sometimes the only source of income available to some transgender people; failure to provide reservations in education and employment with this group, despite the directive to do so by the Supreme Court decision in 2014. And it also does not offer transgender persons adequate legal protection against sexual violence.\n\nFurther, the law does not provide a definition of discrimination, nor does it provide an enforcement mechanism for ensuring transgender people\u2019s right to non-discrimination. This source reports that despite some progress with legislation, public attitudes have not changed substantially, and the transgender community is continually harassed, stigmatized, and abused by the police, judges, their family, and society. Transgender people are particularly vulnerable to discrimination in employment and housing.\n\nAlthough discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity with respect to employment and occupation is prohibited, the law is only enforced in the formal sector and not in the informal sector, which represents approximately 90 percent of the workforce.\n\nAt Item 6.4, a UK Home Office report notes that transgender people face family pressure to cure them of their sexual orientation through psychiatrist or psychologist. This source notes that the journey to equality for trans individuals has only just begun, as much needs to be done to change the public perception of trans people \u2014 are often stigmatised and shunned and survived through begging or sex work. It also reported that transgender people face difficulty obtaining medical treatment and face systemic discrimination by landlords, effectively segregating them into localities which lack basic amenities.\n\nI find you have established a subjective fear on a balance of probabilities and would face a serious possibility of persecution due to your membership in a particular social group, namely transgendered persons, if you return to India.\n\nState Protection\nThere is a presumption of state protection in the absence of complete breakdown. This presumption may be rebutted with clear and convincing evidence. Based on your personal circumstances, as well as the objective documentary document \u2014 documentary \u2014 sorry. Based on your personal circumstances as well as the objective country documentation, I find that you have rebutted the presumption of state protection with clear and convincing evidence, as state protection would not be reasonably available to you.\n\nAt Item 6.1, a Response to Information Request notes that the attitude and behaviour of police is one (1) of the biggest barriers to queer persons\u2019 access to the justice system in India, and police \u2014 sorry, and people report police refusal to file complaints from LGBTI persons. Transgender persons remain vulnerable to harassment, stigmatisation, and abuse by the police.\n\nAt Item 6.3, LGBTQ+ individuals themselves are reluctant to file complaints and to approach the legal system to seek justice and redress for abuses they suffer, due to prejudice, preconceptions, and stereotypes held by authorities.\n\nAt Item 2.1, according to the US Department of State report, there was a lack of investigation and accountability for crimes involving violence and discrimination targeting sexual orientation and transgender persons. Widespread impunity prevails at all levels of government. Some police officers committed crimes against LGBTQI+ persons and used the threat of arrest to coerce victims not to report those \u2014 the incidents. Experts have noted that some law enforcement officials tend to side with families\u2019 interests against the queer community.\n\nAt Item 10.10, the UK Home Office reports human rights abuses committed by the police, including rape and torture, which are reported to be widespread and conducted with impunity. Persons from marginalised community \u2014 from \u2014 persons from marginalised minority communities are particularly affected.\n\nInternal Flight Alternative, IFA\nI have considered whether a viable IFA exists for you and find that there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout India. And therefore, no internal flight alternative is available to you, based on the lack of adequate state protection and widespread social intolerance, abuse, and violence perpetrated against transgender and LGBTQ+ persons.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the totality of the evidence and analysis above, I find you have established that you face a serious possibility of persecution in India based on the Convention ground of membership in a particular social group of transgendered persons. I therefore find you are a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA, and I accept your claim.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

Razak\nCountry: Poland\nRPD Number: TC3-16375\nAssociated RPD Number(s): TC3-16376, TC3-16377\nATIP Number: A-2023-01721\nATIP Pages: N\/A\n\nDECISION\n\n[1] MEMBER: These are the reasons for a decision concerning the claims for protection made by Mr. XXXX XXXX, his spouse, XXXX XXXX, and their son, XXXX XXXX. The claimants are all citizens of Poland. Their claims were heard jointly pursuant to Rule 55 of the Refugee Protection Division rules.\n\n[2] During the hearing, XXXX acted as the designated representative for XXXX, who was a minor at the time of the claim and at the time of the hearing. The allegations of this can be found in the claimants\u2019 Basis of Claim forms and in the testimony of the two (2) adult claimants.\n\n[3] The claimants allege a fear of persecution in Poland in the form of pervasive discrimination at the hands of society in general, and an increased risk of violence at the hands of nationalist groups. The claimants allege that this ground of persecution is race, or more specifically, the claimants\u2019 Roma ethnicity.\n\n[4] I find that the claimants have established that each of them faces a serious possibility of persecution in Poland on the ground of race because of the claimants\u2019 Roma backgrounds. Each of the claimants is therefore described by section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act as a Convention refugee.\n\n[5] With respect to identity, passports for all three (3) claimants could be found at Exhibit 1 and 4. Through these documents and the claimants\u2019 testimony, the claimants have established their personal identity and their Polish citizenship.\n\n[6] With respect to credibility, both adult claimants testified at the hearing. Claimants who testify under oath or affirmation are presumed to be telling the truth unless there are valid reasons to disbelieve the testimony. In this case, I have no valid reason to rebut the presumption of truthfulness. Both adult statements were generally straightforward, forthright, and detailed in their testimony. Both were able to provide specific detail about incidents that occurred to them and call it Their testimony was largely consistent with each other\u2019s testimony and with their Basis of Claim narrative.\n\n[7] Both claimants\u2019 testimony regarding their situation in Poland are consistent with conditions described from Roma living in Poland, at Exhibit 3, the National Documentation Package for Poland, as well as in country conditions submitted at Exhibit 5 on behalf of the claimants.\n\n[8] Both adult claimants testified to discrimination they faced in education, employment, and the provision of services. Both claimants testified to instances where they were denied employment once a prospective employer found out the claimants\u2019 ethnic origins. Both claimants testified that they had been subject to harassment, ostracization, bullying and abuse from non-Roma classmates during their times at school, and that Roma students typically did not receive the same level of educational attention as non-Roma students.\n\n[9] Both adults testified that the teachers and school administration did little to address their concerns. XXXX testified that XXXX has also faced similar discrimination and harassment when he went to school.\n\n[10] XXXX also testified that she has faced discrimination in Poland in the provision of health services. She testified that she elected to leave Poland temporarily to have her second child because of negative experiences giving birth in Poland earlier. She testified that she had first been denied entry to a hospital and had to travel to find an alternate site to give birth. She testified that although she was able to do this, she faced discriminatory treatment there, and testified that Roma mothers were not provided the same level of treatment as non-Roma mothers, and that she was not given pain relief when requested. Finally, XXXX testified that she is subject to harassment, racist comments and derision when out in public. She testified about being subject to racist vitriol on the streets or public transit, and being denied entry to stores and restaurants because of her Roma ethnicity.\n\n[11] One (1) particularly poignant incident was described in the claimant\u2019s Basis of Claim forms where they decided to treat their son to a movie but had to leave because of comments made by other moviegoers and cinema staff against Roma.\n\n[12] As noted above, I find the claimants to be credible. I find on a balance of probabilities that the claimants have suffered from pervasive discrimination in the provision of education, and the availability of employment, and in the denial of the opportunity to participate in everyday society free from harassment or abuse.\n\n[13] While individual instances of discrimination might not necessarily constitute persecution, a pervasive pattern of discrimination across multiple contexts can amount to persecution. This is particularly the case when this discrimination is accompanied by an increased threat of violence.\n\n[14] The adult claimants testified to multiple instances of violence directed against them because of their ethnicity. The claimants testified that XXXX was attacked and injured by skinheads who were yelling racist epithets when he was filling his XXXX at a gas station. The claimants testified that their house was attacked and vandalized in 2019, and their dog killed by intruders. The claimants testified that they believe that this was a racist attack. Finally, both adult claimants were attacked by a group of four (4) skinheads while visiting the burial site of one (1) of the claimants\u2019 parents. Both adult claimants were injured and required medical attention.\n\n[15] Both adult claimants were able to present medical documentation showing treatment for injuries consistent with the claimants\u2019 factual allegations. I find on a balance of probabilities that the claimants have experienced violence and threats of violence in Poland because of the claimants\u2019 Roma ethnicity. This, in concert with the discrimination and harassment noted above, leads me to conclude that the claimants do have a subjective fear of persecution in the form of continued, pervasive discrimination and risk of violence if they were to return to Poland.\n\n[16] Having found the claimants to have a subjective fear of persecution, I turn to the question of whether there is an objective basis for this fear. As noted, the claimants\u2019 allegations concerning their treatment in Poland largely conform to reports concerning the situation of Roma found at the National Documentation Package at Exhibit 3, and Country Condition article submitted on behalf of the claimant at Exhibit 5. These reports note that prejudice and bigotry have effectively closed out large areas of society from the Roma community.\n\n[17] Items 13.3 and 13.4 of Exhibit 3 discuss discrimination against Roma in Poland in education, employment, and health care. Item 13.4 notes that although there have been some legislative attempts to reduce discrimination against Roma in Poland, the Roma community remains largely excluded from the workforce and higher education. There remains some reluctance among Polish employers to hire Roma.\n\n[18] Roma are similarly generally restricted to substandard housing and face discrimination in the provision of health services. Finally, these reports also increasing prevalence \u2014\n\n[19] COUNSEL: I am so sorry. There is some \u2014 I am going to come and meet the claimant\u2019s microphone. Hold on.\n\n[20] MEMBER: No problem. It seems to have ended. I am just seeing where I was. Finally, these reports also note an increasing prevalence of hate crimes and violence against Roma in Poland. I find that the evidence presented establishes that the claimant does have an objective basis for their subjective fear of persecution. As such, I find that all three (3) claimants have a well-founded fear of persecution in Poland.\n\n[21] With respect to state protection, Item 13.4, cited above, notes that the police may be ineffective in addressing violence against Roma, and that in some instances police may share political sympathies with racist groups.\n\n[22] Attacks on Roma often go under-reported, as Roma feel reluctance to go to the police for assistance. The claimants testified that they did approach the police after violent attacks, but that the police were reluctant to act because the claimants were not able to personally identify their assailants, and that, in fact, at one (1) point, the claimant was treated with suspicion as having somehow provoked his attackers.\n\n[23] The claimants testified that in their view, the police are reluctant to assist or protect the Roma community. I find that this is reasonable, given the claimants\u2019 testimony and other evidence. The claimants presented sufficient evidence to establish that the state is unable or unwilling to protect the claimants.\n\n[24] With respect to the possibility of an internal flight alternative, again, country condition reports indicate an anti-Roma animus throughout Poland. I find the claimants have no viable internal flight alternative where they could reasonably escape persecution.\n\n[25] My conclusion, based on the documentary evidence before me, and the testimony of the adult claimants, is this. I find that the claimants have established a serious possibility of persecution on the Convention grounds of race if they were to return to Poland. All three (3) claimants are therefore Convention refugees pursuant to section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. All three (3) claims for protection are accepted.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

You will receive a copy of this decision by mail to the address that you have just given me. This is the decision of the claims for protection of XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX. They are citizens of the State of Israel who seek refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[2] You allege the following, Mr.XXXX you were born on XXXX XXXX, 2000, in XXXX, Israel, you are a Christian. Ms. XXXX, you were born on XXXX XXXX, 1996, in Haifa, Israel and you are a Muslim. You are both Palestinian Arab descent. Since your childhoods, you have felt excluded from mainstream life in Israel, you have suffered discrimination in all aspects of your life. The Arab town in which you Mr.XXXX grew up had substandard buildings and your high school was poorly accommodated. Ms.XXXX, you provided various examples of problems you and your family experienced in Israel related to your Arabic race. For example, in 2015 you lost your job at the XXXX when you argued with your supervisor who had told you that you could not speak the Arabic language to another employee. In XXXX 2021, during Ramadan, you, Ms.XXXX, and your family were subjected to several body searches at military and police checkpoints as you made your way to attend the Al-Aqsa mosque. Inside the mosque, Arab youth chanted slogans against the heavy military presence of Israeli soldiers and this resulted in the soldiers firing with rubber bullets on those in the mosque, they also used tear gas. You lost sight of your family members when you ran to escape. You fell to the ground and physically assaulted by a soldier, by police. You were then trapped with other Arabs inside a compound for several hours. You fear walking in public in Israel, where graffiti in the form of, \u201cdeath to Arabs\u201d remains on public display for weeks. In 2022, Ms.XXXX, you were verbally assaulted on public transport when you were heard speaking Arabic. In XXXX of 2022, you and your mother were walking a short distance to visit your aunt, when extremist Jews, shouting death to Arabs ran after you and your mother. You were\u2014 you and your mother were able to escape with other Arabs.\n[3] Mr.XXXX, you also provided examples of problems you experienced in Israel as a result of your Arabic ethnicity. For example, in 2017, while exiting Israel on a holiday to Georgia, you and your friends were separated by airport security and interrogated about the nature of your travels. In 2018, you were denied a job for which you were qualified because you\u2019re an Arab. In 2022, Israeli was at war with Gaza, the Arabs were advised to stay inside, and the police would not be responsible for your safety. On XXXX, excuse me, on XXXX XXXX, 2022, you participated in a large protest against the war in Gaza, you carried the Palestinian flag. You were beaten by security officers and then taken into custody where you were held for XXXX (XXXX) days. During that detention, you were interrogated and beaten. You were released with a warrant, not-, excuse me, and warned not to participate in demonstrations against Israel, or you would suffer severe punishment. You arrived in Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2022, and initiated your claims for refugee protection shortly thereafter.\n[4] Pursuant to Rule 55 of the Refugee Protection Division rules, these claims for protection were heard jointly. Regarding your identity, on the matter of identity, your personal identities as citizens of Israel have been established on a balance of probability by your credible testimonies and your Israeli passports. Your identities as persons of Palestinian origin within Israel have been established on the balance of probabilities, based upon your testimonies. With regards to your credibility, I find both of you to be credible witnesses. Your testimonies as to the circumstances of problems you experienced throughout your lives in Israel were straightforward and spontaneous. You made no obvious or-, excuse me, no apparent attempts to embellish your testimony and there were no obvious inconsistencies between the information you provided in your Basis of Claim forms and in your oral testimonies this morning. Through your testimonies, I find that you have established your subjective fears.\n[5] I have assessed your claims under section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act as I find there is a link between your fears of persecution and the Convention ground of ethnicity, that being Palestinian Arab citizens in Israel. I have considered whether your experience in Israel, experiences in Israel, where and whether your forward-looking risk is discrimination or persecution. In the decision of Ward, the Supreme Court held that persecution is the, \u201csustained or systemic violation of basic human rights, demonstrative of a failure of state protection.\u201d The United Nations High Commission for Refugees indicates in its handbook that discrimination rises to persecution where there is a-, where there are a number of discriminatory acts substantially prejudicial to the person concerned, which take place in a general atmosphere of insecurity and which result in a feeling of apprehension and insecurity with regard to the future existence of the person concerned. In determining whether you face a serious possibility of persecution upon return to Israel, I am guided by a Refugee Appeal Division decision identified as a reason of interest. This decision contextualizes persecution within the following human rights framework. This test must be understood within the context set out by Hathaway, who explains that the assessment of persecution must be done in the context of human rights law. This human rights-based approach to assessing persecution is not intended to be hierarchical or categorical, but rather flexible and fluid. Allowing for decision-makers to take into account of the cumulative human rights impact of the various harms alleged, in order to arrive at a synthesized assessment of the totality of the claim. As for these reasons, I must consider the situation in the country and whether the government is creating an atmosphere of intolerance. The consequences of the discrimination, including whether there are impacts on an ability to access education, healthcare, and jobs which lead to an insecure future existence the personal circumstances of the claimants and their vulnerabilities, including age, health, finances, and gender, and the cumulative nature of the discrimination and whether it rises to persecution. Upon applying this framework of analysis in the context of your particular circumstances and the country condition evidence for Israel, as I will discuss in a moment.\n[6] I find that you have established a forward-looking serious possibility of persecution. I acknowledge that you are both educated, however, the restrictions at the Israeli universities that led you Ms.XXXX to obtain your XXXX XXXX at a Palestinian university led to limited employment opportunities in Israel. Nevertheless, you both gained employment and had a modicum of economic security. However, I note that this relative privilege did not shelter you from multiple incidents of discrimination and violence based upon your Arab race both from security officials and Israeli society, which affects your rights to liberty, security, and mobility. Mr. XXXX, I acknowledge the violence you experienced at the hand of authority-, hands of authorities for expressing your political views which are a violation of your first-tier rights as explained by Professor Hathaway and that therefore this incident constitutes persecution in and of itself. I find-, I find, based upon the country conditions that there is a serious risk for both of you of experiencing such racial persecution on a forward-looking basis. It is well established in the jurisprudence that persecution may be caused by discriminatory acts that are sufficiently serious and occur over a long period of time that it can be said that the claimants, physical, or moral integrity is threatened. I have considered the social exclusion-, exclusion you experienced as well as the psychological impact of experiencing and witnessing verbal and physical violence for being Arabs, and I find that cumulatively the human rights impact of all these harms amounts to persecution.\n[7] Regarding the objective evidence, it supports your forward-looking fear of discrimination rising to persecution for Arabs in Israel. The objective evidence indicates that in the course of history, the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and its repercussions, Palestinians have long suffered human rights violations at the hands of Israeli authorities. Defined legally and acting practically as a Jewish State, Israel subjugates its approximately 1.5 million Palestinian Arab citizens within a system of discrimination and exclusion. The legal and political system creates a hierarchical citizenry that privileges Jews over others in Israel. The Israeli legal system and the judiciary provide no guarantees for safeguarding the basic human rights of the Palestinians, as both are largely impacted by extremist political parties that control the Israeli Government. The National Documentation Package shows that Palestinian neighborhoods in Israel show a lack of appropriate infrastructure, including improper educational, recreational, and healthcare facilities. A recent Human Rights Watch report shows that Israel is continuing to pursue a government policy of boxing in Palestinian neighborhoods, imposing sharp restrictions on Palestinian access to land within the country. The result is that Israelis of Palestinian origin are packed into densely populated enclaves in which they are severely restricted-, have severely restricted movement, this results in increasing in crime, violence, and internal conflict, quite apart from the ongoing military engagement.\n[8] Amnesty International also reports that Israeli soldiers, police, and ISA officers continue to torture and otherwise treat Palestinian detainees, including children, with impunity. Reported methods include beating, slapping, painful shackling, sleep deprivation, use of stress positions, and threats of violence against family members. Human Rights Watch also confirms Israeli authorities in 2020 systematically repressed and discriminated against Palestinians in ways that far exceed the security justification they often provided. Israeli forces routinely turn away or humiliate and delay Palestinians at checkpoints without explanation. As a result of the foregoing analysis, I find that the objective evidence supports your subjective fears and forward-looking risk. Regarding state protection, given that the State and the State agency are the primary agents of persecution, I find there is not adequate state protection for you in Israel if you return. Regarding an internal flight alternative, given that your agent of persecution is the Israeli state and its internal security agency, I find that there is no safe and viable internal flight alternative for you as Palestinian Israeli, excuse me, Israeli Arabs, given the level of discrimination in the country that I have previously discussed. Therefore I am satisfied that you face a serious possibility of persecution in all parts of Israel and you could not relocate for safety. In conclusion, I find that you XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX are Convention refugees under section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act based upon your race. I accept your claim and I wish you well.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

Kaminker\nCountry: Occupied Palestinian Territory\nRPD Number: TC3-15116\nAssociated RPD Number(s): TC3-08410\nATIP Number: A-2023-01721\nATIP Pages: N\/A\n\nDECISION\n\n[1] MEMBER: So, this is the decision for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, which is file number TC3-15116. You both claim refugee protection pursuant to pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. I have heard your claims together as required by the Rules, and I have considered and applied the Gender Guidelines in coming to this decision today.\n\nDETERMINATION\n\n[2] I find that you are both Convention refugees for the following reasons.\n\nALLEGATIONS\n\n[3] You have alleged the following in your Basis of Claim forms, which are at Exhibits 2.1 and 2.2. You are stateless Palestinians and you allege a fear of persecution at the hands of Hamas due to your opposition to them, and because you are women who essentially do not abide to their strict Islamic interpretations of what\u2019s expected of women in society.\n\nIdentity\n\n[4] You have established that you are both stateless, and your personal identity is established, and that is through your testimony and the documents that you have provided, and that does include copies of your Palestinian Authority travel document, which is in Exhibit 1.\n\nCountry of Reference\n\n[5] So, I know I did not raise this as a specific issue in the hearing, but I will touch upon it very briefly. This is in the case of XXXX. You testified today that your husband is in the process of applying for his Indonesian citizenship. And though he did mention that he expects to be successful with this in the coming months, he has not actually confirmed that. And at the time of this hearing, he does not have Indonesian citizenship. And therefore, I find that you do not have access to citizenship there at the time of this hearing. And therefore, a country of reference is not an issue in your case.\n\nCountries of Former Habitual Residence\n\n[6] So according to the Federal Court of Appeal in Thabet, it was held that in order to be found a Convention refugee, a stateless person must show that on a balance of probabilities they would suffer persecution in any country of former habitual residence, and that they cannot return to one (1) of their other countries, a former habitual residence.\n\n[7] You were both born and raised in Gaza and spent much of your lives there. You also went to Egypt in 2018 with the intention to remain there, though you only stayed for, I think it was, under one (1) year. From there, you went to T\u00fcrkiye also with the intention to remain there, though again, you only stayed there for about four (4) years and finally you went to Indonesia with the intent to stay there, though it did not transpire, and you are only there for about four (4) or five (5) months. Considering your intent in going to these countries was to remain there, though, that did not actually play out, I find that these are countries of former habitual residence for you. You also went to the United States, however you never wanted to stay there. You only went there to translate into Canada, and also to visit your sister very briefly. So, I do not think that this is a country of former habitual residence for you.\n\n[8] So, further to the Thabet principle, I must consider whether you face a 96 or 97 risk in one of these countries, and if you are able to return to the other countries.\n\nNexus\n\n[9] So, I find that there is a nexus between the harms that you fear and the Convention grounds, and that is your perceived political opinion in your membership in a particular social group, as women who are not \u2014 or do not wish to adhere to the strict Islamic interpretation that Hamas carries, and possibly even religion. And therefore, I have assessed your claim pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA, and I find that you met the test under that section.\n\nCredibility\n\n[10] In terms of credibility, your testimony today has been entirely consistent, credible, and straightforward with your evidence. There were no major omissions or contradictions. And therefore, I find that you are both credible witnesses, and I believe what you have alleged in support of your claim.\n\n[11] I have also considered the documents that you have submitted, and those are in Exhibits 1, 5, 6, and 7. These documents include copies of your Turkish, Indonesian, and Saudi Arabian identity \u2014 sorry, visas or residency permits, confirming that your status there was temporary and precarious, and they have since expired. You have provided letters of support from your father and friends, all confirming the issues that you faced in Gaza and your attempts to live elsewhere. And you have also provided copies of your sister\u2019s United States documents confirming the claim that she made in the United States.\n\n[12] Specifically, I find that on a balance of probabilities, you have established that you were both stateless Palestinian women were born and raised in Gaza, where you face continual and serious harassment at the hands of Hamas since they took control of the area. I will not go into all the details, but very briefly, you were harassed and threatened into wearing hijabs. They attempted to recruit your brother. They attempted to target and extort your family due to the work they were doing with the XXXX, which is an international organization. Your home was used as a home base for Hamas. And when you or your family tried to oppose any of these things, your lives were threatened.\n\n[13] Your entire family has since left Gaza and they are living in different places around the world, including here in Canada. You yourselves attempted to live in Egypt, T\u00fcrkiye, and Indonesia, however, were ultimately unable to stay there due to your status expiring and\/or your inability to renew that status, based in T\u00fcrkiye, specifically, on discrimination on account of your Palestinian identity. You ultimately were able to secure visas to the United States, which you use to transit into Canada and you claim protection here.\n\n[14] I find that you have established a subjective fear on a balance of probabilities.\n\nObjective Basis\n\n[15] So, I find that your subjective fear is supported by the objective documentary evidence in that it supports that the discrimination \u2014 or the fear of you \u2014 the harm you fear in Gaza is supported by the NDP. The evidence at Items 2.1 and 14.20 are clear that in Gaza, the designated terrorist organization, Hamas, does exercise effective authority. They maintain a large military wing in Gaza, which was formed in 1992. And in some instances, Hamas utilizes its military wing to crack down on internal dissent. Public sector employees sometimes believe that they were pressured to show loyalty towards Hamas and its military wing, and there are reports that members of Hamas security forces committed numerous abuses.\n\n[16] These documents outline a number of significant human rights abuses that are being committed by Hamas, and these do include credible reports of unlawful and arbitrary killing by Hamas; torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment; arbitrary arrest or detention; political prisoners and detainees; unlawful recruitment, and that does include the use of child soldiers; serious restrictions on freedom of expression, including violence, threats of violence and arbitrary arrest on or prosecutions on journalists, censorship and criminalization of libel and slander; serious restrictions on freedom of Internet. And really, this list goes on and on.\n\n[17] Essentially, there is no room to oppose Hamas, and anyone who does is responded to with violence. And in your cases, you have established that your family has been viewed as an opponent by Hamas due to your refusal to wear hijabs, the refusal of your brother to join them, your family\u2019s work, and your vocal opposition to them \u2014 to being in your home, and so forth.\n\n[18] The evidence also confirms that you would be at a heightened risk or the occupied Palestinian territory because you are women. The Evidence at Items 2.1, and also all of section five of the NDP, confirms that there is widespread discrimination and harassment against women in society generally, but also at the hands of Hamas. Item 2.1 specifically notes that Hamas enforced a conservative interpretation of Islam in Gaza that discriminated against women. Hamas authorities pressured women to conform to an interpretation of Islamic norms that generally restricted women\u2019s movement. According to press and NGO reports, some women students in Gaza reported being forced by school personnel to wear hijab or other conservative dress, and in some instances, teachers in Hamas-run schools in Gaza send girls home for not wearing conservative attire, although enforcement was not entirely systematic.\n\n[19] In Gaza, discrimination against women, including married women, reportedly took place in all sectors, and that includes banks, NGOs, daycare centres, schools, and was practiced by the de facto government as well in private sectors.\n\n[20] So, for all of these reasons, I find that you have established an objective basis for your fear and therefore a well-founded fear of persecution.\n\nState Protection\n\n[21] So, I have turned my mind to the ability of state protection in the occupied Palestinian territories. And I find that this is not available to you. I note that in your case, it is Hamas who is \u2014 governs the Gaza Strip, and your agent of persecution in this case. Even generally speaking, the evidence confirms that state protection is nonexistent in the area, given the fragmentation of the region. And for these reasons, I find on a balance of probabilities, you have rebutted the presumption of state protection and that adequate state protection would not be reasonably available to you in Gaza or the occupied Palestinian territory.\n\nInternal Flight Alternative\n\n[22] So, I have also turned my mind towards this issue, and I find that it is not available to you again. First and foremost, your agent of persecution is Hamas, which has de facto control over Gaza, and therefore I find that you would not be able to relocate within that region in order to escape the harm that you faced. Secondly, Items such as 3.1, 2.1, and 14.5 all indicate that there are severe restrictions on the freedom of movement internally and externally for Palestinians. Palestinians remain restricted based on a complex system of physical and administrative barriers such as checkpoints, roadblocks, and a permit system.\n\n[23] Further evidence confirms that freedom of movement between the West Bank and Gaza is nearly nonexistent. And for these reasons, I find that on a balance of probabilities, you have established that you do not have a viable internal flight alternative available to anywhere in the occupied Palestinian territory.\n\n[24] Now, I must assess. Since you have established a forward-facing serious possibility of persecution in the occupied Palestinian territory, I will consider whether you can return to any of your other countries of former habitual residence. The Federal Court of Appeal, in Thabet, has found that an individual could be considered returnable to a country only if the evidence establishes that there is nothing preventing a claimant from reacquiring status.\n\n[25] So, in the case of Egypt, your status there was temporary and precarious. You left in XXXX of 2018 and have not returned since. The evidence in the NDP indicates that you would need to obtain an entry permit in order to return to Egypt, and the granting of that permit is up to the discretion of Egyptian authorities. And therefore, I find on a balance of probabilities, you do not have the right to return to Egypt.\n\n[26] Your status in T\u00fcrkiye was also temporary and precarious. And based on the visas you have provided, they have since expired, you have not returned there since XXXX of 2022. The evidence again confirms that the granting of any visa is up to the discretion of authorities, and therefore I find that you also do not have the right to return to T\u00fcrkiye.\n\n[27] And finally, in the case of Indonesia, again, your status there was temporary and precarious. Your documents indicate that your status there has expired and any granting of a new visa up to the discretion of authorities again. And so therefore, I find that you also cannot return to Indonesia today.\n\n[28] And therefore, you established that you cannot return to any of your countries of former habitual residence. Based on all the evidence before me, I find that you are both Convention refugees. I accept both of your claims, and I do wish you the best of luck here in Canada.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

Neill\nCountry: Hungary\nRPD Number: TC3-14970\nAssociated RPD Number(s): TC3-14972\nATIP Number: A-2023-01721\nATIP Pages: N\/A\n\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n\n[1] This is the decision in the refugee claim of XXXX XXXX, (the principal claimant), who claims to be a citizen of Hungary and is claiming refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (\u201cIRPA\u201d).\n\n[2] This is a joint claim under Rule 55(1) which includes the following claimants: XXXX XXXX, (the associate claimant) who is the intimate partner of the principal claimant, and who claims to be a citizen of Hungary and is claiming refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (\u201cIRPA\u201d).\n\nALLEGATIONS\n\n[3] The claimants\u2019 allegations are fully set out in their Basis of Claim form and in their testimony. The claimants each allege that they are a citizen of Hungary and each fears persecution at the hands of nationalist Hungarians and the state due to each of the claimants being of the Roma ethnicity.\n\nDETERMINATION\n\n[4] Having considered the totality of the evidence, the panel finds each of the claimants to be a Convention refugee on that grounds that each faces a serious possibility of persecution based on the Convention ground of race; that being the claimants are of the Roma ethnicity.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nIdentity\n\n[5] On a balance of probabilities, the panel finds each of the claimants has established their personal identity and is a national of Hungary, based on the specific passport in their name included in Exhibit 1[1].\n\nNexus\n\n[6] The panel finds that there is a nexus between what the claimants fear and one of the five Convention grounds, namely race; that being the claimants are of the Roma ethnicity. The claim is therefore assessed under s. 96.\n\nCredibility\n\n[7] The panel is mindful that there is a presumption of truthfulness; when a claimant swears to the truth of their allegations, the allegations are presumed to be true unless there is reason to doubt their truthfulness.\n\n[8] The panel finds no reason to rebut the presumption of truthfulness. Each of the claimants testified in a straight-forward manner. Each answered promptly and without undue hesitation. Their testimony was consistent with the information in their Basis of Claim. They provided a set of documents that corroborated their claim and explained the relevance of each document as the documents were referenced. There were no significant discrepancies, omissions or inconsistencies in their evidence.\n\nThe Circumstances supporting the Serious Possibility of Persecution,\n\n[9] The panel finds the claimants have each established on a balance of probabilities that they are of the Roma ethnicity based on the following evidence.\n\n[10] The claimants each testified they are of the Roma ethnicity. When the principal claimant was asked how anyone would know he was Roma, he testified that he had a name that would be known to Hungarians as a Roma name, that he had Roma features \u201cthe way I look and the color of my skin\u201d. The associate claimant testified to similar facts when asked the same questions. The claimants each submitted a letter from a ROMA NGO which confirmed their identification as being of \u201cRoma\/Gypsy origin\u201d. The letters were issued on the letterhead of the Roma National Self-Government of Miskolic. The letters were stamped and signed by an identifiable person. The claimants each testified that they went to the government office and requested the letters and that the letters were issued because they (the claimants) were known to the issuing authority.\n\n[11] The panel refers to and relies on the NDP for Hungry[2] which includes a report[3] that identifies the \u201cRoma Minority Self-Government Miskolic\u201d as an agency that \u201csupports the Roma population in Miskolc, for example, by filling out forms and giving advice, and provides assistance, including with administrative procedures and with job-searching\u201d. The panel having confirmed that the agency exists and for the purpose that it has been referred to (the issuance of documents) and having no reason to doubt the authenticity of the submitted letters gives them full weight in assessing the credibility of the claimants\u2019 testimony that they are each of the Roma ethnicity. The panel having found the claimants to be credible and reliable finds that their evidence establishes that on a balance of probabilities they are of the Roma ethnicity.\n\nA Finding that Subjective Fear is established \u2013 Principal Claimant\n\n[12] The panel finds the claimants have each established a subjective fear of persecution due to their being of the Roma ethnicity based on the following evidence.\n\n[13] The principal claimant testified of being identifiable as a member of the Roma ethnicity as early as public school and being treated differently in school because of that distinction. He testified that he was segregated while in school in that he (and the other Roma students) was seated separately from the non-Roma students, he associated only with the other Roma students, and he testified to being bullied by the non-Roma students.\n\n[14] The principal claimant testified he believes he was denied employment based on his Roma ethnicity. He wrote in his narrative that he was unable to get full-time work and when asked in the hearing he testified he approached many companies looking for employment, but he believes that as soon as he was recognized as being of the Roma ethnicity the employers would no longer be interested in hiring him. He was asked if he considered moving to another location in his country to find employment to which he responded that he believed the response would be the same where-ever he lived in Hungary.\n\n[15] The principal claimant testified he was assaulted twice, (once in 2018 and once in 2022) by men in black clothes, a style of dress that in his experience he associates with nationalist youth who hold anti-Roma views. In the 2018 episode he was on a streetcar when he was approached by 5 or 6 men who directed foul language at him and spat on him. When he fled the streetcar to escape from them, they pursued him, knocking him to the ground and assaulting him until a gathering of witnesses caused them to leave, Afte the assault the principal claimant discovered that he had acquired a cut to his leg without knowing how it happened.\n\n[16] The principal claimant testified that he and the associate claimant were assaulted while walking home in XXXX 2020. He stated that the attackers were males in black clothing who knocked them to the ground. The associate claimant began to scream which got the attention of some nearby people. This attention caused the attackers to flee while threatening further harm to the claimants.\n\nA Finding that Subjective Fear is established \u2013 Associate Claimant\n\n[17] The associate claimant testified about the assault in XXXX 2020 that involved both of them. The panel found her testimony to be consistent with the principal claimant and there were no discrepancies. When testifying to the assault she included that the attackers spat on her and used foul language, calling her names.\n\n[18] The associate claimant testified she was more successful with her education than the principal claimant had been. She was able to complete XXXX XXXX qualifying her to do XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX. She testified she was unable to get work in that field in spite of her qualifications, believing that when prospective employers realized she was Roma they were no longer interested in hiring her. She testified she spent a year and a half applying in different places in her hometown for work. She testified when asked that like the principal claimant she did not leave her hometown to search for work believing she would face the same outcomes where-ever she went.\n\n[19] The panel having found each of the claimants to be credible and reliable finds they have established on a balance of probabilities that they face a serious possibility of persecution based on their race as part of the Roma ethnicity. The panel gives full weight to their testimony that they have been assaulted because of their race and they have been denied employment because of their race. The panel finds the claimants have each established a subjective fear of persecution due to their being of the Roma ethnicity.\n\nThe grounds for an Objective Basis.\n\n[20] The panel refers to and relies on the NDP for Hungary[4] for the objective evidence relating to the claimants\u2019 fear of persecution. The panel finds the NDP to be credible and reliable because it is prepared by professional researchers and journalists from identified sources of information. It is also current and updated frequently. The panel gives full weight to the information of the NDP when assessing the credibility and reliability of the claimant\u2019s subjective fear of persecution.\n\n[21] The panel refers to tab 13.5[5] which reports on the situation and treatment of the Roma people in Hungary. This report states that Roma face widespread discrimination as well as societal exclusion or segregation, and that Roma are subject to violence. Of significance to the claimants\u2019 situation the report states that the unemployment rate for Roma people is three to five times higher than it is for the non-Roma of Hungary. The report goes on to detail the discrimination and unfair practises targeting the Roma people caried out by the authorities in the areas of law enforcement, access to justice, employment, housing, health care and education. The panel finds this report provides the objective basis for the claimant\u2019s subjective fear of prosecution.\n\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution\n\n[22] The objective basis for the claimant\u2019s subjective fear of persecution on the Convention ground of race has been established on a balance of probabilities. Based on this, the panel finds that that each of the claimants has a well-founded fear of persecution in Hungary.\n\nState Protection\n\n[23] Refugee protection is meant to be a form of surrogate protection to be invoked only in those situations where the refugee claimant has unsuccessfully sought the protection of their home state. The onus is on the refugee claimant to approach the state for protection, in situations where state protection might be reasonably forthcoming.[6] In the absence of a compelling explanation, a failure to pursue state protection opportunities within the home state will usually be fatal to a refugee claim, at least where the state is a functioning democracy with a willingness and the apparatus necessary to provide a measure of protection to its citizens.\n\n[24] The panel finds there is objective evidence to support the claimant\u2019s belief that state protection is not available to them. Returning to the cited report (tab 13.5) the panel notes \u201cthere is a lack of trust between the police and Roma communities because of the perception by \u201c[m]any\u201d Roma that the police are unreliable when the victim of the crime is of Roma descent and because of the \u201cover-polic[ing]\u201d of administrative offences (like unpaid fines) when the perpetrator is of Roma descent,\u201d and further \u201cRoma individuals were fearful of coming forward to police when a violent act was committed against them as \u201cnot only [would the police] neglect the report,\u201d but the assailant would \u201ctake revenge and the police would still not defend them.\u201d In section 2.3 of the report it is stated \u201cMRG reports that racist violence and hate speech against Roma in Hungary \u201chave been sustained by the continued hostility Roma face from police forces and officials, reflected in persistent discriminatory practices including ethnic profiling and fines for even the most minor infractions.\u201d Based on a review of the objective evidence, and the principal claimant\u2019s own personal experiences, the panel finds that adequate state protection will not be available to the claimants if they were to return to Hungary.\n\nInternal Flight Alternative\n\n[25] On the totality of the evidence, the panel finds that there is not a viable internal flight alternative (IFA) for the claimants in Hungary.\n\n[26] The test to be applied in determining whether there is a viable internal flight alternative is two-pronged. Firstly, the panel must be satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that each of the claimants would not face a serious possibility of persecution in the IFA location, or on a balance of probabilities be personally subjected to a risk to their life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. Secondly, the conditions in the proposed IFA location must be such that it would not be objectively unreasonable under the circumstances, including those particular to the claimant, for them to seek refuge there. Both prongs must be satisfied for a finding that the claimant has an IFA.\n\n[27] The panel finds that the claimants have established that on a balance of probabilities their agents of persecution are the nationalist anti-Roma factions of Hungarian society, assisted by the discriminatory actions or lack of actions by the police. As each of these agents of persecution can be found country-wide the panel finds the claimants would face a serious possibility of persecution and\/or be personally subjected to a risk to their life, a danger of torture or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment, if they were to return to Hungary and attempted to relocate to an internal flight alternative..\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[28] Having considered the totality of the evidence, the panel finds each of the claimants to be a Convention refugee on the grounds that each faces a serious possibility of persecution based on the Convention ground of race that is being a member of the Roma ethnicity.\nThis claim is therefore accepted.\n\n(signed) M.

They fear persecution by the State and by society upon return to Hungary.\n\nDETERMINATION\n\n[7] Having considered the totality of the evidence, I find each claimant to be a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96.\n\n[8] They each face a serious possibility of persecution, on a balance of probabilities, on the basis of their Roma ethnicity.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nIdentity\n\n[9] I find that each claimant has established their personal and national identity, on a balance of probabilities. I rely on the certified true copies of their passports issued by the Government of Hungary at Exhibit 1.\n\nNexus\n\n[10] I find there is a link between their fear of return and the Convention grounds, ethnicity and the claims are assessed under section 96.\n\nCredibility\n\n[11] I found the claimants to be credible witnesses. Their testimony was clear, direct, spontaneous and unembellished. There were no inconsistencies, omissions or discrepancies of note.\n\n[12] I found no reason to disbelieve them, concerning their fear of return to Hungary because of their Roma ethnicity.\n\n[13] I give their testimony full weight and it is presumed to be true.\n\nDocumentary Evidence\n\n[14] The claimants provided documentary evidence packages at Exhibits 6 and 7. I\u2019ll mention the most probative.\n\n[15] At Exhibit 6, there\u2019s a letter from a Roma nationality school dated from last year, which states that the associate claimant \u2014 the second associate claimant can take exams there. The second associate claimant testified that this was an all Roma school and a better one than the schools he had attended before where he was excluded from the classroom with Hungarian children and treated as a lesser student.\n\n[16] I found his testimony and evidence to be corroborated by the National Documentation Package, as well as Counsel\u2019s country conditions evidence also at Exhibit 6.\n\n[17] I find it to be clear that Roma children in Hungary are frequently segregated without permission from Roma parents.\n\n[18] Both the principal claimant and the first associate claimant also testified that they left school early because of segregation.\n\n[19] There are also examples of all Roma schools run by the State, which offer poor education and mistreatment of Roma students, according to Tabs 2.12 and 13.12.\n\n[20] Some Roma communities have responded with their own all Roma schools.\n\n[21] However, the second associate claimant testified that school authorities at the all Roma school could not stop him from being attacked going to and leaving the school by ethnic Hungarians who had identified him as a pupil there. He testified that because of these attacks, he did not complete his education.\n\n[22] I accept his testimony and the documentary evidence and I find that it establishes a great deal. First, the second associate claimant was invited to take exams at a Roma school.\n\n[23] On a balance of probabilities, he is Roma, as he alleges.\n\n[24] And since he\u2019s Roma, on a balance of probability, his parents are Roma also.\n\n[25] Therefore, the three (3) claimants have established that they are Roma ethnicity.\n\n[26] Now, I also find that since these claimants all experienced segregation at school, according to their testimony leading to their early departure, I find that in all their cases, the denial of education to them, as Roma in Hungary, was a violation of their fundamental human rights.\n\n[27] Furthermore, it also set them up for a lifetime of poor economic prospects, as well as poverty.\n\nPrecipitating Events\n\n[28] The principal claimant testified that the claimants lived in a building from 1991 until 2022 and they were forced to leave it when the building underwent remediation. He provided photographs of this house at Exhibit 6, with a sagging wall covered in plastic and a roof with many holes and water on the floor. He testified that the family had lived in this dwelling in such poor condition for so long because it was all that they could get. He testified he had a job as a XXXX XXXX for the XXXX. And the first associate claimant added that he had worked overtime just to be able to afford this place with the family.\n\n[29] I find the claim is established that even with a XXXX job, they were unable to secure adequate housing.\n\n[30] I asked the first associate claimant why the family could not have found a nice home in an ethnically Hungarian part of the city?\n\n[31] And she responded that it had simply been too hard for them just to get what they had.\n\n[32] I find this is powerful testimony that \u2014 and it establishes, on a balance of probabilities, that Hungarian society walls Roma people off. Roma people, such as the claimants, walls them off from any kind of economic security, safety and comfort.\n\n[33] The principal claimant testified that in 2022, when the family was forced out, there was then nowhere to go but shelter.\n\n[34] I asked him what caused them to flee the country and he testified that there was a day when they were seated on a bench and a police officer told them to shift away or be arrested.\n\n[35] He testified that after this, he approached family members in Canada to ask for help in getting out of Hungary.\n\n[36] And I accept this explanation.\n\n[37] I find the claimants have established that they do fear return to Hungary.\n\n[38] They have established their subjective fear.\n\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution\n\n[39] I find their testimony to be corroborated by Tab 13.5 of the National Documentation Package, which reports that Roma in Hungary face discrimination in every walk of life, this includes education, housing, employment and health care. Roma communities face widespread discrimination, social exclusion and poverty.\n\n[40] Roma are the largest minority group in Hungary, according to Tab 2.1.\n\n[41] Segregation of Roma children remains a problem. And there are reports of high early dropout rates among Roma populations. There\u2019s also segregation in housing for Roma, according to Tab 5.2, and that homelessness is a growing problem.\n\n[42] I find that the claimants\u2019 testimony and their documentary evidence, as well as the objective evidence taken together, establish that the claimants were in a situation in Hungary where segregation in education and housing and led to lack of employment opportunity and poverty, and that institutions, such as the health care system, failed to care for and support them.\n\n[43] I find the objective evidence and their testimony establish that the State has a leading role in maintaining the systems that oppress Roma, and they allow systemic discrimination to persist.\n\n[44] I find that the claimants have established that they face violations of fundamental human rights, including the right to life and security of the person and the right to education and to equality before the law and that these violations were inflicted in a systematic way.\n\n[45] Therefore, the discrimination they fear upon return rises to the level of persecution.\n\n[46] The claimants have established an objective basis for their subjective fear of return and they have a well-founded fear of persecution.\n\nState Protection\n\n[47] There\u2019s a presumption that a (inaudible) country is capable of protecting its own citizens, unless it is in a state of breakdown and Hungary is a functioning state.\n\n[48] However, the objective evidence at Tabs 10.1 and 10.2 report that when Roma approached the police for protection because of racist attacks, police do not take action as a general rule.\n\n[49] Evidence at Exhibit 6 reports that police participate in violence against Romas.\n\n[50] (Inaudible) 10.1 says that prosecutors will not even pursue charges based on the racial nature of an attack. There is official corruption and institutional racism particularly against Romas, which produces a collective failure to provide appropriate service.\n\n[51] I therefore find that the State is a leading participant in the persecution faced by Roma and it would be objectively unreasonable for the claimants to seek the protection of the State.\n\n[52] As a result, I find there is no adequate state protection for the claimants.\n\nInternal Flight Alternative\n\n[53] To be accepted, the claimants must establish that there is nowhere in Hungary where they could live where they would not face persecution.\n\n[54] However, I find that the State is among the agents of persecution and it exercises control over all of Hungary.\n\n[55] Therefore, I find compelling evidence that the situation of the Roma people in Hungary does not vary from place to place.\n\n[56] Therefore, the claimants would face a serious possibility of persecution everywhere in Hungary and there is no viable internal flight alternative.\n\n[57] In conclusion, based on the totality of the evidence, the Panel finds the claimants to be Convention refugees, on the grounds of their ethnicity.\n\n[58] On a balance of probabilities, they each face a serious possibility of persecution upon return to Hungary and all three (3) claims are accepted.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

You both claim refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. I have considered and applied the gender Guidelines in coming to this decision today.\n\nDETERMINATION\n\n[2] I find that you are both Convention refugees for the following reasons.\n\nALLEGATIONS\n\n[3] So, you have alleged the following in your Basis of Claim forms, and those are Exhibits 2.1 and 2.2. You allege that you are both stateless Palestinians. You have lived your life between Lebanon and the United Arab Emirates or the UAE, and you allege fear of persecution in Lebanon, essentially because you are Palestinian and that is at the hands of the state and society generally, and also at the hands of Hezbollah, who have threatened your lives and gave you the ultimatum to either join them or leave Lebanon forever. You allege that there is no state protection nor an internal flight alternative available to you in Lebanon\n\nIdentity\n\n[4] So, you have established that you are both stateless Palestinians as well as your personal identities, and those are not only through your testimony and your Basis of Claim form, but also the documents that you have provided in that does include copies of your Lebanese travel documents for Palestinian refugees and also copies of your documents from the occupied Palestinian territory.\n\n[5] The applicable test for stateless claimants, so, that is found in the case of Thabet, and that is where the Federal Court of Appeal held that in order to be found a Convention refugee, stateless person must show that on a balance of probabilities he or she would suffer from persecution in a country of their former habitual residence and that he or she cannot return to any of their former countries of habitual residence.\n\n[6] In your cases, you were both born and lived for at least some time in Lebanon, and therefore, I find that that is a country of former habitual residence for both of you, and you have also both lived in the UAE, and so, that too, is a country of former habitual residence for you.\n\n[7] So, according to this Thabet principle, I must consider whether you will face in 96 or 97(1) risk to your life in Lebanon, and if so, what \u2014 I must also consider whether you can return to the United Arab Emirates.\n\nNexus\n\n[8] So, I find that there is a nexus between the harms you fear and the Convention grounds and that can either be race or even your membership in a particular social group as stateless Palestinians living in Lebanon, and therefore, I have assessed your claim pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA, and I find that you have met the test under that section.\n\nCredibility\n\n[9] So, in terms of your credibility, your testimony has been essentially entirely consistent, credible and straightforward with your evidence. You were able to provide clear, spontaneous and detailed testimony in regards to your allegations, and there were no attempts that I could see of you trying to embellish or bolster your claim in any way, and I find that that does really speak towards your credibility. And so, based on all the evidence before me, I find that you were both credible witnesses, and I do believe what you have alleged on a balance of probabilities.\n\n[10] Now, you have also provided a few documents, those are in Exhibit 6 and 7. That does not only include your identity documents, which I have already touched upon, but also other documents such as your UAE residency documents, confirming that your status there was temporary and precarious and has since expired. You provided documents confirming for the female claimant your marriage, and that was also to a stateless Palestinian man from Lebanon. You have also provided letters of support from the female claimant\u2019s children, or in the case of the male claimant, your siblings, which also confirms your allegations, and finally, you provided an attestation letter from Lebanon confirming that you are from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. So, based on all of the evidence before me, I find that you have established again that you are both stateless Palestinians who lived between Lebanon, where you had travel documents and the United Arab Emirates, where you had temporary and precarious status and you do not have a right to return there today.\n\n[11] In Lebanon, you did face discrimination amounting to persecution in almost all facets of your lives, and that does include your access to health care, education, government services, social services, and even your freedom of movement.\n\n[12] In the case of the male claimant, you have not returned to Lebanon since 2008, and I believe you indicated you were around six (6) years old or so at the time, and that is because essentially you were traumatized by the local conflict that ensued while you were there. For the female claimant, you did return to Lebanon, I believe that was around 2017, and that was to apply for a new travel document for you and your children. However, on that trip, you came to learn that Hezbollah has taken over your home in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and they also threatened your lives and demanded that your children, your male children join them, or otherwise you would all have to leave the country for good and your lives were threatened and you did not return to Lebanon after that.\n\n[13] Ultimately, you did come to Canada in 2023, and that was after you had lost your sponsorship in the UAE or you were being threatened to lose your sponsorship there and you came to Canada and claimed protection. So, based on all the evidence before me, I find that you have established a subjective fear on a balance of probabilities.\n\nObjective Basis\n\n[14] I find that your subjective fear is supported by the objective country documentation contained in the National Documentation Package and that this does indicate that the discrimination you would face in Lebanon does amount to persecution on a balance of probabilities. Essentially, numerous items in the NDP, such as Items 1.4, 13.1 and 13.5, they all indicate that Palestinian refugees have been present in Lebanon for many, many years. I think it indicates 70 years at least. And though the majority, which is 62 percent, of Palestinian refugees live inside of refugee camps, there is abject or deep poverty there, and the socioeconomic conditions in all 12 of the camps in Lebanon are described as deplorable and the camps are overcrowded and characterized by high health risks, water contamination and so forth. Though it is not mandatory for stateless Palestinians to live in camps, the freedom of movement for these individuals is restricted because Palestinians \u2014 the documents describe that Palestinians in Lebanon live in cages and only registered Palestinian refugees have the ability to travel from one (1) area to another.\n\n[15] Essentially, these documents also describe that Palestinians in Lebanon are denied citizenship and are prohibited from property ownership, which also means that they cannot run businesses or shops. Though Palestinians do have access to education, that is through the UNWRA, which is what the female claimant described today, and in terms of university, again, it would have to be through a private university, and that is quite expensive and not all can afford those tuition fees.\n\n[16] These same barriers exist in terms of employment, where Palestinians are prohibited from certain occupations and all public sector jobs. Many Palestinians are forced to work informally due to further restrictions they face in other area or employment sectors. Similarly, though, Palestinians can access private health care. Again, this is mostly unaffordable for most, and Palestinians generally do not have access to public health care, and again, as a female claimant described, you only have access to health care through the UNWRA.\n\n[17] Documents such as Items 116 and 13.1 of the NDP further confirm that discrimination against stateless Palestinians in Lebanon does rise to persecution as I mentioned. There is widespread and systematic discrimination against Palestinians and that does include persecution at the hands of Hezbollah, for example, through forcible recruitment. The documents indicate that Hezbollah is a Shiite Muslim political group and militant group that is \u2014 they are deemed a terrorist organization, and they have retained significant influence over parts of Lebanon, especially in refugee camps, and the evidence confirms that authorities in Lebanon would not be able to protect a person if they are wanted by this organization. So, on the whole, I find that the treatment you face and will face in Lebanon on a balance of probabilities gauges the right to a nationality or citizenship, a right to access employment, education, health care and so forth. And these are all basic human rights which are recognized and protected under core international human rights instruments.\n\n[18] And following the test set out in the case of Ward, serious and systemic violations of these rights may amount to persecution either on their own or when considered cumulatively. And in your case, I find that you have established that when taken together, these various elements of discrimination do indeed rise to a level of persecution. And therefore, I find that you have established an objective basis for your fear and therefore a well-founded fear of persecution.\n\n[19] So, in terms of state protection, I have turned my mind toward the availability of this, and I find that, of course, it is not available to you, as I already mentioned. The documents confirm that the state is not able to protect individuals who are targeted by Hezbollah in refugee camps. I also note that the UNHCR handbook in paragraph 101, states that in the case of stateless refugees, the question of availment of protection of the country of former habitual residence does not actually arise and for all these reasons, I find that you do not have the access to state protection on a balance of probabilities.\n\nInternal State Alternative\n\n[20] So, essentially for these exact same reasons, I also find that you do not have a viable internal flight alternative available to you on a balance of probabilities, and therefore, I find that you have established a serious possibility of persecution in Lebanon. And considering you have established this, I must also now consider whether you are able to return to the UAE. As I have already mentioned, your status there is temporary and precarious. The documentary evidence before me indicates that if you have left the country for six (6) months, you would lose that status. You left the UAE in XXXX 2023. So, it has now been over six (6) months, and for all of these reasons, I find that you do not have the right to return to the UAE today.\n\n[21] So, based on all of the evidence before me, I find that you are both Convention refugees. I accept both of your claims.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

The file number is TC3\u201107451. You are claiming to be a citizen of Israel. You are seeking refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. Hereinafter referred to sometimes as the Act or IRPA.\n\nDETERMINATION\n\n[2] Based on all the evidence, I find you to be a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA, based upon the intersection of your nationality as a Palestinian Israeli and your imputed political opinion as a potential opponent of the country based upon your refusal to spy on members of the Palestinian community in Israel for Israeli security.\n\nALLEGATIONS\n\n[3] The allegations in this matter may be summarized as follows. You have described you are an Israeli citizen of Palestinian origin who was raised in a town in East Jerusalem. You have described that as an Israeli of Palestinian origin you were always treated in a lower-class manner to such an \u2014\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 END OF AUDIO # 1 \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 BEGINNING OF AUDIO # 2 \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n[4] MEMBER: And that you consider yourself a Palestinian first rather than as an Israeli citizen. You detailed that you were always unequally treated with respect to basic rights. You have outlined that your situation got much worse in XXXX 2022, when you were contacted by Israeli internal security Shabak, and you were asked to spy on members of the Palestinian community in your municipality and report back to security. Despite your refusal, Shabak insist you spy for them anyway and report back to them in three (3) days. Shabak later, then picked you up at your workplace four (4) days later, unannounced. They beat you and threatened that if you did not comply, they would jail you indefinitely on false charges. After being released, you were home and getting medical treatment. You got your nephew\u2019s help while hiding out at your uncle\u2019s home to apply for a visa and travel to Canada as soon as you could where you have now sought refugee protection. You allege if you return to Israel, your fear that you will be persecuted, threatened, or even killed by Israeli security would come true. You allege there is no state protection for you in Israel because state security is the overarching agent of persecution with jurisdiction everywhere within the country.\n\n[5] On the matter of identity, your personal identity as a citizen of Israel has been established by your credible testimony and the identity documentation which has been entered into evidence at our hearing. While you described in your oral evidence that you do not feel Israeli because of your poor treatment in your home country, it is clear from the documentation and all your testimony that you actually are citizen of Israel. Your identity as a person in Palestinian origin within Israel has been established on a balance of probability by your testimony. I find on a balance of probabilities that identity and country of reference, Israel, have been established.\n\n[6] On the matter of nexus, I find there is a link between your fear, persecution, and your cumulative national and political profile as a member of the Palestinian minority in Israel who have been targeted as disloyal by Israeli security. Therefore, your claim is being assessed under section 96 of the IRPA.\n\nCredibility\n\n[7] I find you to be a credible witness with no major inconsistencies which go to the heart of your claim. I accept as credible that if you return to Israel, there is more than mere possibility you will face persecution or even violence based upon your cumulative profile as a Palestinian who refused to cooperate with Israeli security. I accept as credible you have been identified by Shabak as a person who might help them in spying on the Palestinian minority community in the country.\n\n[8] I also accept, on a balance of probabilities, your refusal to agree to spy for the Israeli security carries with it more than a mere possibility of you being persecuted and or harmed upon your return as a presumed enemy of the Israeli nation, which of course is currently at war with Palestinians from Hamas. You support your oral evidence with persuasive documentation, including various documents detailing the mistreatment of Palestinians in Israel, as well as medical documentation confirming that you suffered a XXXX XXXX injury \u2014 XXXX XXXX injury of a XXXX XXXX XXXX. Based upon the evidence provided, I find your credible subjective fear of persecution in Israel from Israeli security is well-founded.\n\nObjective Evidence\n\n[9] The objective documentary evidence confirms your credible subjective fear in Israel. The National Documentation Package, or NDP for Israel, shows that Palestinian neighborhoods in Israel show a lack of appropriate infrastructure, including improper educational, recreational, and health care facilities. Further, 13.1 of the Israeli NDP shows that Israel is continuing to pursue a government policy of \u201cboxing in\u201d Palestinian neighborhoods, imposing sharp restrictions on Palestinian access to land within the country. The result is that Israelis of Palestinian origin are packed into densely populated enclaves in which there are severely restricted movement with resulting increases in crime, violence, and internal conflict. Quite apart from the ongoing military engagement.\n\n[10] Amnesty International also reports Israeli soldiers, police, and ISA officers continue to torture and otherwise treat Palestinian detainees, including children with impunity. Reported methods include beating, slapping, painful shackling, sleep deprivation, use of stress positions, and threats of violence against family members. Human Rights Watch also confirms Israeli authorities in 2020 systemically repressed and discriminated against Palestinians in ways that far exceeded the security justification they often provided. Israeli forces routinely turn away or humiliate and delay Palestinians at checkpoints without explanation.\n\n[11] Your testimony about misconduct by Israeli security is also confirmed in the NDP for Israel. Item 2.1 of the NDP confirms that under Israeli law, members of Shabak are excluded from prosecution for using, \u201cexceptional methods\u201d in dealing with detainees. As you have testified and Waseem has mentioned, this article reports that the Israeli government has admitted that Shabak uses \u201cexceptional methods\u201d in dealing with detainees. However, the Israeli government strictly denies that these tactics amount to torture. Further, NGOs in Israel report that the upward trend in complaints of torture by Shabak continues and appears to be worsening. In Item 9.1 of the NDP states that Shabak violent tactics have been emboldened by a broadly worded 2016 anti-terror law, which is expected to significantly harm the civil rights of Palestinians within the country. Having considered the objective evidence summarized above, as well as more credible testimony, I conclude on a balance of probabilities that your fear of persecution in Israel from Shabak is well-founded.\n\nState Protection\n\n[12] Given that the state and the state agency are the primary agents of persecution, I find there is not adequate state protection for you in Israel if you return.\n\nInternal Flight Alternative\n\n[13] Given that your agent of persecution is the Israeli state and its internal security agency, I find there is no safe and viable internal flight alternative for you as a Palestinian Israeli, given the level of discrimination against Palestinians and the jurisdiction of the security agency throughout the country. Therefore, I am satisfied that you face a serious possibility of persecution in all parts of Israel, and there is no viable internal flight alternative for you.\n\n[14] In conclusion, I find you are a Convention refugee under section 96 of the IRPA based upon your cumulative national and imputed political profile. I accept your claim.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

The claimant alleges that she is a citizen of Cuba and claims refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n\nALLEGATIONS\n\n[3] The details of the claimant\u2019s allegations are set out in her Basis of Claim form and attached narrative as seen in Exhibit 2. In summary, the claimant fears persecution of the Cuban society in general due to her sexual identity.\n\nDETERMINATION\n\n[4] The Panel finds that the claimant has established on a balance of probabilities that she faces a serious possibility of persecution because she is a member of a particular social group, being a trans woman, if she were to return to Cuba. Therefore, the Panel finds that the claimant is a Convention refugee under section 96 of the IRPA.\n\nANALYSIS\n\n[5] In making this assessment, the Panel considered all the evidence, including the oral testimony, documentary evidence entered as exhibits. The Panel also considered the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9, which is proceedings before the IRB involving sexual orientation, gender identity and expression and sex characteristics.\n\nNexus\n\n[6] The Panel finds that the claimant fears a nexus to the Convention ground of membership in a particular social group as a trans woman.\n\nIdentity\n\n[7] The Panel finds that the identity of the claimant is established on a balance of probabilities through the certified true copy of her Cuban passport on file as seen in Exhibit 1.\n\nCredibility\n\n[8] Pursuant to the Maldonado principle, it is presumed that sworn testimony is true unless there are sufficient reason to doubt its trustworthiness. The claimant testified in a detailed, spontaneous, and straightforward manner with regard to the central elements of her claim. There were not inconsistencies or omissions which went to the core of her claim. Therefore, the Panel finds that the claimant was a credible witness. The claimant testified about how she had experienced discrimination and harassment due to her sexual identity in schools, coffee shops, and restaurants. The claimant testified credibly of the discrimination she suffered at a young age of 13 years old while still in high school at the hands of her fellow students and a teacher. The claimant further testified of how she was mistreated during her compulsory military service. She testified of how she was made to stand and scream, \u201cYes, sir.\u201d for an hour so that her feminine voice would change to a masculine one (1). When asked what role she played during her one (1) year service in the military, the claimant stated that she XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The Panel acknowledges that military service is compulsory in Cuba. See Exhibit 3. Given that the claimant\u2019s duty is clearcut in nature, the Panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that it does not raise concerns.\n\n[9] The claimant also testified that when, in XXXX 2015, she started wearing clothes and makeup to express herself in XXXX XXXX XXXX, she was invited to the dean\u2019s office and was asked to either dress like a man and continue her studies or leave. The claimant testified that she chose to leave her studies and stick to being herself. She also testified that Cuban medical doctors refused to perform surgical operations necessary to facilitate her transition, despite all her efforts. Further, the claimant testified of how a contract she had concluded for opening a XXXX in a newly opened XXXX in Cuba fell through because the XXXX manager discovered that she is a transwoman (inaudible). The claimant explained that the contract was given to another man who is strict. The claimant stated that she lost time and money owing to this discrimination. The claimant testified that she had been in several relationships with men. She mentioned her three (3) years relationship with XXXX (ph), at the most recent. The Panel noted that this was omitted in her narrative. When asked why she omitted it, the claimant responded that she thought that as a transwoman, a relationship with other men were not relevant. In her submission, the claimant\u2019s Counsel echoed what the claimant said and added that the issue facing the Panel is the claimant\u2019s identity. The Panel has assessed the claimant\u2019s testimony on this and the Counsel\u2019s submission and finds, on a balance of probabilities, that this omission is not material because it does not water down the claimant\u2019s allegation of suffering discrimination as a result of her sexual identity.\n\n[10] The claimant also submitted documents in support of her claim. The Panel finds the documents in Exhibit 5 to be probative value in establishing, on a balance of probabilities, the credibility of the claimant\u2019s allegations that she suffered persecution at the hands of the Cuban society due to her sexual identity. The documents are detailed. As such, the Panel attaches heavy weight to them. The documents are affidavit of support from claimant\u2019s sister, XXXX XXXX XXXX (ph), affidavit of support from the claimant\u2019s best friend, XXXX XXXX XXXX (ph), letter of support from the claimant\u2019s family friend, XXXX XXXX XXXX (ph), and various social media posts made by the claimant showing her sexual (inaudible) and friends.\n\n[11] The Panel raised concern about the claimant\u2019s failure to claim asylum in the US after almost two (2) months there. When asked why she did not claim asylum in the US, the claimant responded that her aim has always been to get to Canada to make an asylum claim. She also explained that her family is here in Canada, and she wanted to reunite with them. The Panel has assessed the claimant\u2019s explanation and finds that it is reasonable because one (1) would expect a person fleeing from such level of discrimination as the claimant faced to want to get support from her family. Further, the Panel accepts that there is no sufficient evidence that would warrant a negative credibility inference from the claimant\u2019s failure to initiate an asylum claim in the US. The Panel therefore refrains from making any negative inference therefrom. Overall, the Panel finds the claimant\u2019s testimony to be consistent and devoid of inconsistencies. The Panel also found the aforementioned documents to have probative value. The Panel finds the claimant\u2019s explanation for her failure to claim asylum in the United States to be reasonable. Given these findings, the Panel accepts the central tenets of the claimant\u2019s claims as outlined above. On account of these findings of fact, the Panel finds that the claimant established, on a balance of probabilities, her subjective fear of harm from the Cuban society because of her sexual identity.\n\nObjective Basis\n\n[12] The evidence in the National Documentation Package for Cuba in Exhibit 3 demonstrates that there is objective basis for the claimant\u2019s subjective fear of persecution at the hands of the Cuban society because of her sexual identity. Item 2.1 of Exhibit 3, which was also provided by the claimant in Exhibit 5, describes the widespread discrimination, harassment, and violence against actual and perceived members of the LGBTQ+ community in Cuba. Further, the only legal permitted advocacy group for LGBT community in Cuba is headed by a member of the Castro family and the Cuban regime, which controls the narratives being openly discussed and does not allow for free expression of opinions of the LGBTQ+ community. Item 2.1 of Exhibit 3 at page 3 further states that authorities ignored applications for legal recognition from new groups, including several new religious groups, human rights organizations, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and intersex (LGBTQ+) rights organizations. The lack of official recognition left group members open to potential charges of illegal association. NGOs reported LGBTQ+ persons continue to face social stigma and discrimination in education, health care, and employment, with employment opportunities for transgender persons generally limited to low paid and sometimes dangerous occupations. See Exhibit 3 at Item 2.1 at page 35.\n\n[13] Discrimination in employment occurred against members of the Afro-Cuban and LGBTQ+ populations, especially in the state owned or privately operated XXXX sector. The claimant testimony that she identifies as a transwoman puts her in the LGBTQ+ community and thus exposes her to the scenarios described above. Based on the claimant\u2019s testimony and the objective evidence which supports the claimant\u2019s allegation, the Panel finds that the claimant\u2019s subjective fear is objectively well-founded.\n\nState Protection\n\n[14] States are presumed to be capable of protecting all citizens except in situations where the state is in complete breakdown. To rebut this presumption, the onus is on the claimant to establish on a balance of probabilities through clear and convincing evidence that the state\u2019s protection is inadequate. Item 2.1 of Exhibit 3 reports that although the law prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation in employment, housing, citizenship, education, and health care, but does not extend the same protections to transgender or intersex individuals based on gender identity and expression or sex characteristics. The government generally did not enforce law effectively. The same source further states that Brenda Diaz, a transgender woman, was convicted of \u201cpublic disorder and sabotage\u201d, and sentenced to 40 years in prison for participating in an anti-government protest in August. Authorities reportedly placed Diaz in a prison facility that did not align with her gender identity, prompting calls for justice from local LGBTQ+ activists.\n\n[15] In view of the above clear and convincing objective evidence, the Panel finds on a balance of probabilities that since diverse sexual identity is not fully expressed in Cuba, the Cuban state is an agent of persecution, and the claimant cannot be expected to seek protection from the very entity that prosecutes her. The objective documentation constitutes clear and convincing evidence that the state is unwilling to provide adequate state protection to the claimant. Accordingly, the Panel finds that there is no state protection available to the claimant.\n\nInternal Flight Alternative\n\n[16] The Panel has examined whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for the claimant. Item 2.1 of Exhibit 3 shows that Cuba has control over all its territories via its security services, intelligence services, police, and military and other measures of social control. The claimant cannot, thus, internally locate to Cuba without facing the same serious possibility of persecution on the basis of her sexual identity. Based on the evidence on file, the Panel finds that the claimant faces a serious possibility of persecution throughout Cuba, given that the authorities and Cuban society operate similarly throughout the country. The Panel finds that there are no other parts of the country where the claimant would not face a serious possibility of persecution. The Panel therefore finds that there is no viable alternative available to the claimants.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[17] After careful consideration of all of the evidence, including the claimant\u2019s testimony, the Panel finds that the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA. The claim is therefore accepted.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

So, I place weight on these documents in establishing your Roma ethnicities.\n\n[16] While individual instances of discrimination do not necessarily constitute persecution, a cumulative pattern of discrimination may amount to persecution, taking into account the effect on the person concerned.\n\n[17] So, in this case, I find that your past experiences of discrimination were serious, systemic and repetitive instances of discrimination that together rise to the level of persecution.\n\n[18] You testified that in your schooling years, you experienced discrimination from teachers and other students due to your Roma ethnicity, which began in elementary school. This ultimately resulted in you dropping out of school at grade XXXX.\n\n[19] You also testified to diminished job prospects due to your Roma ethnicity.\n\n[20] Your previous employments were based largely on short-term precarious work and you testified that prospective employers made derogatory and discriminatory remarks about your Roma ethnicity and would not hire you due to your Roma ethnicity.\n\n[21] So, you stated in your narrative and testified at today\u2019s hearing to a number of times in your daily life will you face discrimination based on your ethnicity.\n\n[22] At today\u2019s hearing, you specifically testified to multiple incidents including being attacked by masked assailants and being denied proper medical care.\n\n[23] When I asked you about your experience with medical care, you testified that your partner was not able to access medical care when she was in labor and that she was made to endure physical pain, because medical personnel refused to examine her on account of her Roma ethnicity.\n\n[24] In regard to social services, you testified that you attempted to approach the police for assistance when you were assaulted and you were unable to obtain any help from them due to your ethnicity.\n\n[25] So, I find that you have established your ethnicity as Roma on balance of probabilities.\n\n[26] I also find that you\u2019ve established that you\u2019ve suffered a combination of harassment, discrimination and violence on the basis of your ethnicity, which cumulatively rises to persecution in Hungary.\n\n[27] So, concerning your failure to claim refugee protection in the U.S., after leaving Hungary, you traveled to the United States before crossing the border into Canada and seeking refugee protection.\n\n[28] When questioned on the failure to seek asylum in the U.S., you testified that it was your intention to come to Canada because you have relatives here.\n\n[29] I find your explanation reasonable in your particular circumstances.\n\n[30] Accordingly, your failure to claim in the U.S. does not raise significant concerns with respect to subjective fear or credibility.\n\n[31] I also note that failure to claim in the U.S. is not a determinative issue, and in your particular case, it is insufficient to render your claim not credible given your forward looking risk as Roma in Hungary.\n\n[32] Therefore, based on the presumption of truthfulness, your consistent testimony, and the corroborative evidence, I accept your allegations as credible.\n\n[33] I find that your subject to fear of persecution on the basis of your own ethnicity has been established on a balance of probabilities.\n\n[34] Okay, turning now to objective basis, refugee claimants must establish that they have a well-founded fear of persecution related to a convention ground or that they face a risk of personalized harm as contemplated by Section 97 over \u2014 on a balance of probabilities.\n\n[35] Therefore, having found that you have a subjective fear of persecution, I\u2019ve turned to the question of whether these fears have an objective basis.\n\n[36] I find that the objective evidence confirms that Roma face institutionalized systematic discrimination as well as violence and other issues, which represents \u2014 represent a sustained violation of human rights and cumulatively amounts to persecution.\n\n[37] The European Commission states that the group most vulnerable to discrimination is the Roma population.\n\n[38] Further, the objective evidence indicates that Roma are regularly subjected to racist and discriminatory treatment in Hungary, suffering from general societal mistreatment in healthcare, employment, education and legal services.\n\n[39] Similarly, sources in the objective evidence report that Roma face widespread discrimination.\n\n[40] Sources from Freedom House indicate that Roma communities also face poverty as well as societal exclusion or segregation.\n\n[41] Further, on March 2021 report on Roma in Hungary notes based on focused group interviews that everyday prejudices are widespread regardless of residence segregation, education or social status, and the media in Hungary has serious responsibility for the discriminatory attitudes of the majority.\n\n[42] The objective evidence notes that although Hungary has expressed commitment to equal treatment for all minority citizens, in practice social discrimination and exclusion of Roma from education, employment, and healthcare remains a pervasive problem in Hungary.\n\n[43] Other reports suggest that rather than easing, the problem is increasing as a result of the rise in nationalist sentiment and the influence of the Jobbik party in Hungary.\n\n[44] More far right political violence against Roma, while reduced from the early 2010s, is still common with Roma routinely scapegoated by the governing Fidesz party and the Jobbik movement.\n\n[45] So, the objective evidence establishes that those of Roma ethnicity in Hungary face sustained and systematic human rights abuses that amount of persecution.\n\n[46] Therefore, based on the Claimants\u2019 Roma ethnicity and the treatment of Roma generally in Hungary, I find that their subjective fear has an objective basis and it is well-founded.\n\n[47] Turning now State protection, the State is presumed to \u2014 presumed able to provide adequate protection to its citizens.\n\n[48] Therefore, Claimants generally have the duty to seek protection before seeking protection in Canada; however, in certain circumstances, it would be objective \u2014 objectively unreasonable to expect a Claimant to do so.\n\n[49] Furthermore, the protection available to a Claimant may not be adequate, given their specific circumstances.\n\n[50] In this case, I find that there is clear and convincing evidence that the State is unable or unwilling to provide the Claimants with adequate protection.\n\n[51] Objective evidence indicates that there is a large distrust of the police and the legal system within Hungary\u2019s Roma community, the cause of which is generally agreed to be dismissive and overly punitive police actions against Roma.\n\n[52] Similarly, the objective evidence regarding police complaints indicates that members of the Roma community face hostility from police forces in Hungary, which includes a failure to protect them from attacks.\n\n[53] Further, the report indicates police often fail to investigate and prosecute credible claim \u2014 claims of hate crimes and criminal hate speech against the \u2014 the Roma community.\n\n[54] So, in view of the documentary evidence, I find that State protection for the Claimants is inadequate on a balance of probabilities.\n\n[55] Further, you, Mr. Claimant, testified that you approached the police; however, you obtained no protection.\n\n[56] Therefore, based on your experience in Hungary and the objective evidence, I find on a balance of probabilities that the \u2014 that you have rebutted the presumption of adequate State protection with clear and convincing evidence on the State\u2019s inability or unwillingness to protect you.\n\n[57] Turning now to internal flight alternative, in order for a refugee claim to succeed, a claimant must establish that there is no other place in their country in which they can live without facing a serious possibility of \u2014 of persecution or a likely risk of Section 97 harm.\n\n[58] Alternatively, the Claimants must demonstrate that relocation to another place in the country is unreasonable in their circumstances.\n\n[59] I\u2019ve considered whether \u2014 whether there\u2019s an internal fight alternative for the \u2014 for you in Hungary, and based on the documentary evidence already mentioned, systemic discrimination amounting to persecution is widespread throughout Hungary. Therefore, I find there is no internal \u2014 viable internal flight alternative for the Claimants.\n\n[60] So, in conclusion, having considered the totality of the evidence, I find that there is a serious possibility of persecution for the Claimants on the basis of their Roma ethnicity, should they return to Hungary.\n\n[61] Therefore, I find that the Claimants are convention refugees pursuant to Section 96 of the IRPA. Their claims are therefore accepted.\n\n[62] This concludes my reasons. I will now take us off the record.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

Coulthard\nCountry: Occupied Palestinian Territory, Saudi Arabia\nRPD Number: TC2-38002\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2023-01721\nATIP Pages: N\/A\n\nDECISION\n\n[1] MEMBER:\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n[2] This is the decision of the Refugee Protection Division for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. You allege you are a citizen, you allege you\u2019re a stateless Palestinian, and you\u2019re claiming refugee protection pursuant to Section 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n\n[3] I have considered your testimony and the other evidence in this case and I\u2019m ready to render my decision orally. The written decision will come to you shortly in the mail and may be amended to include references to Exhibits or case law as needed.\n\nALLEGATIONS\n\n[4] The full details of your allegations are set out in your Basis of Claim form found at Exhibit 2 and 2.1. In summary, you allege that you\u2019re a stateless Palestinian from Gaza born in Saudi Arabia to Palestinian parents who were also born in Palestine and are currently long-term residents of Saudi. You allege that, you allege fear of forced recruitment by Hamas to which you are opposed. You allege that if you do not join the militia, they will deny you employment and harass you in order to force you to join the militia. You also fear that they could go as far as threatening to kill you if you do not join them. You allege that you cannot join Hamas as they commit war crimes and crimes against humanity and that you do not want to be a part of such atrocities. You allege that some of your relatives of the same age who have returned to Gaza have been targeted for forced recruitment by Hamas, specifically your brother and your brother-in-law, and other members of the family who are currently in Gaza are not safe. You also allege that you have no right to return to Saudi Arabia where you have lived on a temporary status and since your employment was terminated, you\u2019ve not been able to secure another employment and you made arrangements to come to Canada to seek protection for this reason. You allege you cannot return to Palestine for this reason as well. You allege that if you return to Saudi Arabia without status, you will be deported to Gaza. You fear returning to Gaza.\n\nDETERMINATION\n\n[5] For the reasons that follow, I find that, I find that you face a serious possibility of persecution pursuant to Section 96 of The Act if you return to Gaza because of your opposition to Hamas and your fear of forced recruitment. I also find that you do not have a right to return to Saudi Arabia as you currently do not have authorization to stay there.\n\nIdentity\n\n[6] Give me one moment. I find your identity as a Palestinian who is stateless, and your personal identity is established on a balance of probabilities by your oral testimony and copies of your Palestinian authority issued passport which shows that, which contains an identification number and shows that it was issued in XXXX and that you were born in Saudi to Palestinian parents. This also includes your Palestinian, a copy of your Palestinian ID card which shows your place of birth as Saudi, and your parents\u2019 Palestinian authority issued passports which shows their place of birth as Palestine, just one moment, country of habitual residence as a stateless Palestinian, I find it is necessary to determine your status in countries where you have had formal habitual residence. In this case, I find Saudi Sarabia is your country of habitual residence, and you must show that you either have a well-founded fear of persecution in Saudi or that you have no status that would allow you to return there.\n\nCredibility and Subjective Fear\n\n[7] Pursuant to the Maldonado Principle in refugee claims, when a claimant swears to the truth of the allegations, this creates a presumption that those allegations are true unless there is a reason to doubt their truthfulness. I find that you testified in a straightforward manner. It was spontaneous. There were no inconsistencies, material inconsistencies between your testimony, the documents that you have provided, or your narrative. I noted that you lived, you visited, just one moment, T\u00fcrkiye and you also studied for almost a year in Egypt and that you did not make claims in these countries. You have testified that for T\u00fcrkiye, you did not have a need to make a claim at the time you visited in 2019 and for Egypt, you, your narrative indicates that you were compelled to leave because, on your father\u2019s instructions. I do not make a negative inference with regard to your failure to claim in T\u00fcrkiye or in Egypt.\n\n[8] With regard to Jordan and the UAE where you also visited, I note that these countries are non-signatory to the Refugee Convention, and I do not draw a negative inference for your failure to claim there considering that you also had temporary status; you were only visiting.\n\n[9] I\u2019ve considered your rights to return to Saudi. I note you were born there and that you lived there extensively according to your testimony from when you were born to 2022 when you left apart from the short occasions when you traveled out of the country to visit family.\n\n[10] I\u2019ve considered the Exhibit 3.2 of the NDP for, Exhibit 3.2 which is the NDP for Saudi Arabia, specifically item 1.3 which indicates that there is no citizenship by birth in Saudi Arabia and that citizenship is by descent only in which case the father must be a citizen of Saudi. I\u2019ve considered the Palestinian authority passports for your parents and your, their Saudi resident ID\u2019s which shows that they remain temporary residents in Saudi; this is found at Exhibit 55. This evidence before me indicates that both parents are stateless Palestinians and as you were born to Palestinian parents, I find that you don\u2019t have the ability to gain Saudi Arabian citizenship by birth by virtue of your being born there. Just one moment please.\n\n[11] Item 1.3.1 for Saudi also indicates that non-citizens born in Saudi Arabia to non-citizen parents only have temporary status as Saudi Arabia does not bestow citizenship rights on foreign nationals who reside there, even after they have kids, and their residence status must be renewed as you testified and may be withdrawn.\n\n[12] Item 3.5 also speaks to the status of children. Just one moment. 3.5 indicates that children born in Saudi Arabia to non-Saudi parents are not considered Saudi citizens and they face discrimination including obstacles in finding jobs and they are not eligible to access government services and they also have to renew their residency permits every year. Access to education, health care, public housing, courts, and judicial proceedings are reserved only for citizens.\n\n[13] Item 3.9 of the NDP for Saudi that\u2019s found at Exhibit 3 regarding Palestinians in Saudi, it reports that most only have residence status and are excluded for naturalization proceedings even though the resident requirement for naturalization which is five years. This means that their stay and status in the country relies on ensuring that they have sponsorship. They constantly have no security, their status is very volatile, and they\u2019re ineligible to benefit from public services. Give me one second. Saudi Arabia is also not a party to the Convention Refugee, sorry, the Refugee Convention, and this is stated in item 14.2 of the NDP for Saudi. They do not have an asylum system under which people fearing persecution in their home country can seek protection leading to a real risk of deporting them to harm.\n\n[14] Still on the impact of statelessness in Saudi, item 3.9 of the NDP for Saudi indicates that being stateless in Saudi Arabia can result in significant violations of rights which has included lack of access to public education, health, and other services and inability to access employment, social alienation and psychological challenges.\n\n[15] Just one more bit on Saudi Arabia, item 2.1 identifies as for Saudi Arabia, that although racial discrimination is illegal, societal discrimination continued. So, I find this is consistent with your testimony with regard to your situation in Saudi. I find that you have temporary status in Saudi and that status no longer exists. You\u2019ve been out of Saudi for a year. Your employment in Saudi has been terminated. You provided a letter for that at Exhibit 5 which corroborates your testimony regarding the termination of your employment of which you were advised was coming in XXXX, XXXX 2021, due to Saudization. You testified you were not able to find another job and that the precarious nature of your residence rights in Saudi Arabia had become a frustration, frustrating over the years with the need to renew constantly. You testified that a family member was also deported to Gaza from Saudi Arabia, and this heightened your fear as well. I note that there was a slight inconsistency in the timing while your brother indicates that he was forced to Gaza in 2021, you testified that it was in 2008 or 2009, but you did come back to say that you were mistaken and not sure about the timing. I do not draw a negative inference from this inconsistency.\n\n[16] I assign weight to the letter from your brother which indicates that he was forced to depart Saudi to Gaza and that he faced persecution in Gaza. So I find that you do not have on the balance of probabilities, that you do not have status in Saudi even though you were born there and despite your long residence that would allow you to return to the country legally and that you\u2019ve established a serious possibility of persecution there based on your ethnicity or nationality and that your fear of returning to Saudi is objectively well-founded. I find that you do not have, reasonable state protection would not be forthcoming to you and that you do not have an Internal Flight Alternative there as a non-national without the rights to return there or in the absence of status in that country and I find that you would face persecution amounting, you face discrimination amounting to persecution should you return there without status.\n\n[17] In terms of your fear of persecution in Gaza Palestine, you did testify about your position to Hamas which is described as a terrorist organization. You testified that you know from your family experience, that of your brother and that of your brother-in-law who had to escape to Egypt, that Hamas is also forcibly recruiting civilians into their armed activities and that those who do not, who oppose Hamas, are denied employment and they face precarious situations in Gaza. You testified that you cannot join Hamas because they permit war crimes and crimes against humanity, and you do not want to be part of it. You did express that you have not, you have only shared this opinion with family members and friends. Give me one moment. I do not have any, I do not draw a negative inference from your, I find your testimony was consistent about your fear of Hamas in Gaza and to support your claim, you provided support letters from your siblings in Gaza, and they detailed their experience of difficulties of living in Gaza. I noted that the letter from your brother does not mention that he has been recruited by Hamas, but you did explain orally that your brother told you that that was the case and for security reasons, he has not indicated so in his letter. Again, I do not draw a negative inference from this concern. I find that you have reasonably explained the absence of that information in his letter, and I have assigned full weight to the letters in the absence of concerns about the authenticity. I find that the objective evidence supports your fear of returning to Gaza and Palestine.\n\n[18] Item 1.6 of the NDP for occupied Palestinian territory at Exhibit 3.1 speaks to the fact that the Gaza strip has been under the de facto governing authority of Hamas since 2007 and that since Hamas took over, Israel and Egypt have enforced tight restrictions on movement and access of individuals in and out of the country. In addition, Hamsa also operates their own restrictions and limitations of movement in and out of Gaza.\n\n[19] Item 1.10 indicates that travel to and from the Gaza strip is subject to severe restrictions and is only possible by the territories through land crossing points, Erez Crossing and Rafah Crossing. Very few Gazans are able to travel out of the Gaza strip. In your case, you\u2019ve testified that you have your right to return because you have a Palestinian Authority ID card, but you are not able to do so because you fear Hamas.\n\n[20] Item 2.1 and 1.6 of the NDP for the occupied Palestinian territory also makes it clear that Hamas does not tolerate dissent or opposition and those who are perceived as opposing Hamas face arrest and detention. Item 2.1 which I referenced earlier speaks to the fact that, contains a report of unlawful or arbitrary killings by Hamas, torture or cruel inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment by Hamas personnel and it indicates that Hamas has detained an unknown number of Palestinians due to their real or suspected anti-political affiliation. Just one moment. I\u2019m aware currently there is a conflict situation in Gaza as well between the Israeli authorities and Hamas. I find that the objective evidence supports that you would not be able to return to Gaza in the occupied Palestinian territories, and that you would face a serious possibility of persecution from Hamas should you return there with your opposition to its activities.\n\nState Protection and Internal Flight Alternative With Respect to Gaza\n\n[21] I have noted earlier that the de facto territory in Gaza is still Hamas, and that even though Israeli authorities try to control some of the Palestinian authority, (inaudible) to control in Gaza strip itself. I note that there is also at the moment an ongoing conflict between the Israeli authorities and Hamas in Palestinian territory, occupied territory. I find that the agent of persecution as you have described is Hamas and adequate state protection would not be reasonably be forthcoming to you on a balance of probabilities given your position to its activities.\n\nInternal Flight Alternative\n\n[22] I also find that you do not have a viable Internal Flight Alternative in the occupied territory, specifically Gaza. You did testify about the severe limits on freedom of movement from the Gaza strip to the West Bank which Israel controls and like I mentioned earlier, the objective evidence also indicates that there is severe limits on freedom of movement on the occupied Palestinian territory. I find based on the evidence before me including the objective evidence and your personal experience that you face a serious possibility of persecution if you were to return to Gaza because of your opposition to Hamas and your fear of forced recruitment. I find that you do not have a visible Internal Flight Alternative there in the absence of a real government.\n\n[23] So based on the totality of the evidence, this is my conclusion. I find pursuant to Section 96 of The Act that you have established a serious possibility of persecution in Gaza, and you are not able to return to Saudi Arabia because you do not have any status there. I find you are a Convention refugee and I accept your claims. Congratulations and I wish you all the best in Canada.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

XXXX XXXX, file number TC2\u201135010, a 38-year-old male. I am going to be giving you the reasons for the decision orally, but you and your Counsel will be provided with these reasons in writing shortly. The written reasons that you will receive will reflect those that I am giving you now. They may, however, be edited for general readability or to add references to legal citations or contrary documents. The claimants claim to be a stateless Palestinian from the Gaza Strip and seeking refugee protection in Canada pursuant to section 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. In the decided case of Adjei v. Canada, the Federal Court held that the duty of the RPD Panel is to determine whether there is sufficient, credible, or trustworthy evidence to determine that there is more than a mere possibility that you would be persecuted if you are returned to your own country or country of former habitual residence in your case. This also means that it must not be possible to get protection from this persecution in your own country or control of former habitual residence. And further that that there is no other place in your country of former habitual residence or country where you could live safely and that it would not be reasonable to do so in your own circumstances. In coming to my decision today, I have considered the whole evidence before me.\n\nDECISION\n\n[3] Based on the totality of the evidence presented, I find that you are a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act on the basis of imputed political opinion in Gaza Strip pursuant to section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. My reasons are as follows.\n\nALLEGATIONS\n\n[4] Your allegations are fully set out in your answer to question two (2) of the Basis of Claim form filed at Exhibit 2.1, as well as the updated narratives on Exhibit 2.2 of the consolidated list of documents. There is no need to repeat them here in detail. In summary, you alleged that having been deported by the United Arab Emirates authorities, UAE, because you are a stateless Palestinian, you are fearful of a return to Gaza Strip. Your other country of former habitual residence due to persecutions at the hands of the Hamas regime on the basis of imputed political opinion.\n\nIdentity and Country of Reference\n\n[5] Your identity as a stateless Palestinian in the UAE and Gaza have been established on a balance of probabilities by your testimony and the supporting documents filed under Exhibits 1 and 4, as well as Exhibit 6 of the consolidated list of documents. This document includes your Palestinian authority passport. Your current Palestinian authority passport, and translated identity card. Your birth certificate. Your temporary residence permit. And driver\u2019s licence all issued by the United Arab Emirates authorities, as well as your family registration card issued by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian refugees. The test for stateless individuals to be considered refugees under the Act is that stateless individuals are required to show on a balance of probabilities that they face persecution in at least one (1) country of former habitual residence and that they cannot return to the other or any other country of former habitual residence if applicable. On the matter of what is the claimant\u2019s country of former habitual residence. The evidence adduced before the Panel establishes that the claimant is a stateless Palestinian who was born in the United Arab Emirates, where he lived for about 29 years of his life based on renewable resident status who moved between United Arab Emirates, UAE, and Gaza Strip until he was deported from UAE to Gaza by the UAE authorities in XXXX 2021, where his appeal was pending against XXXX XXXX purchase charges which he was fined for 7000 (inaudible). The claimant explained that he bought the XXXX \u2014 the pharmaceutical from Europe where he travelled to for his XXXX treatment and that he was unaware that it was prohibited in the UAE. You furnished copies of both the public prosecution document and Dubai court deportation order from the UAE. Regarding the claimant\u2019s status in the Exhibit 3.2, which is a National Documentation Package for UAE, Item 3.9 at page 8 indicate that only children born to UAE fathers can acquire UAE citizenship at birth. Since you are a stateless Palestinian, since you have no permanent status in the UAE and do not have a right to return to that country by the NDP for UAE, I find that article 1E is not engaged in this claim.\n\n[6] I also know that this same NDP, Item 14.2 at page 8 referenced the United Nations Human Rights Commission. United Nations High Commission for Refugees Report, which stated that hundreds of Palestinians were deported from the UAE and that those expelled were provided no explanations or opportunities for appeal. I further note that there is a written notation on the claimant\u2019s residence permit indicating that his residency is invalidated if he is absent from UAE for more than six (6) months. The objective and documentary evidence before me indicate that a deportee from UAE has no right to return to that country. Since the claimant was deported from Gaza, from UAE to Gaza, where he lived until he came to Canada in XXXX 2022 and has no right to return to the UAE, the Panel will assess his claim against Gaza only, which is his next country of former habitual residence.\n\nNexus\n[7] I find that there is a link between the persecution you have suffered and fear in Gaza and imputed political opinion, which is one (1) of the five (5) enumerated Convention grounds for refugee claim. Therefore, the claim is assessed under section 96 of the Act.\n\nThe Determinative Issue in the Claim\n\n[8] The determinative issue in this claim is credibility. The court ruled in Maldonado and Canada that the sworn testimony of the claimant is presumed to be true unless there is a valid reason to doubt its truthfulness. I find you to be a credible witness. I find your testimony to be genuine. There were no material consistencies, submissions, or contradiction between your testimony and the other evidence in this claim that we are not reasonably explained. Your testimony was also consistent with the other evidence on the central aspect of your claim. Therefore, I believe what you have alleged in your Basis of Claim form and oral testimony. You testified in a consistent and organic detail about the persecutory incident you faced at the hands of Hamas organization and its affiliated officials in Gaza. First, as an XXXX student at XXXX XXXX in 2007, during which there was a conflict between Hamas and Fatah organization or movement of the Palestinian authorities.\n\n[9] You stated that her that your cousin, S, Mr. S was a member of Fatah (ph) movement and that he sustained injuries while fighting against Hamas. It was your credible testimony that Hamas (inaudible) targeted you because you took care of your cousin and that they suspected that you were also against Hamas. You stated that you denied any involvement with either side of the conflict and that you visited your cousin Mr. S, because of his familial relationship with you. However, according to you, the Hamas and the student Counsel did not believe you. They want you to terminate your admission if you ever visited your cousin or act in any way against Hamas. You also talked about another incident in 2008 when you worked as a XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX in Gaza and were denied your salary because you refused to support Hamas like other students. You testified that on XXXX XXXX and XXXX, you were summoned to appear before the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX for interrogation and was interrogated about your visit to the United States of America Embassy in Jerusalem for visa and your relationship with your cousin Mr. S.\n\n[10] You stated that you were detained in a room, assaulted, your phone searched, you were tortured and interrogated about Mr. S and your aunt who worked for a Fatah movement organization, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Furthermore, you spoke about how the Hamas authorities and officers questioned you about your social media post and your liberal views about religion, which they interpreted to be Islamic, to be against Islamic religious belief. You explained that the social media post related to atheism post posted by someone else which you shared on your Facebook. According to you, the Hamas officer who warned you to avoid making similar posts in the future or you risk being jailed. You also described how your consistent refusal to be part of Hamas violent organizations exposed you to physical assault. According to you, the interrogating officer also demanded that you work for Hamas to which you refused and was threatened. When I asked you, you explained how the assault and harassment made you feel insecure and made you intensify on your plans to escape the Gaza Strip. And you arrived in Canada in XXXX 2022 and reached the United States of America, then claimed refugee protection to save your life. When asked what will happen if you are returned to Gaza in 2023, you stated and explained that you are frightened and would be incarcerated or killed by Hamas authorities, which are now more powerful.\n\nSupporting Documents\n\n[11] I note that you corroborated your claim with the personal documents which were entered into evidence under Exhibit 4 and 6 of the consolidated lists of documents. The supportive document you provided includes a translated copy of the notice of attendance from the Hamas, dated XXXX XXXX 2022, which corroborates your claim that you were summoned and interrogated on the basis of perceived political opinion. You also furnished a copy of your XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, which corroborates your claim that you were a student in that university and the university authorities harassed you based on their perception that you supported Palestinian Authority against the Hamas during the 2007 conflict between them and Fatah.\n\n[12] There is also a letter of support from XXXX XXXX XXXX, the XXXX of XXXX XXXX in confirming your work with them as a XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX, Gaza, which \u2014 during which you helped in providing XXXX XXXX XXXX support to the XXXX XXXX. But they you are not paid. And experienced discrimination because you did not support Hamas like your colleagues did. Also, in evidence before me, pages of a screenshot of a Facebook post, you testified (inaudible) which Hamas officers interrogated you on XXXX XXXX, 2022, and that they accused you of sharing articles contrary to Shariah law. I have considered and found the supporting documents to be credible and trustworthy. I have found no reasons to doubt the genuineness of this document. I assign full weight to them as they corroborate your allegations.\n\n[13] On a balance of probabilities, I find that you were targeted in the past and faces continuing serious possibility of persecution at the hands of Hamas authorities based on imputed political opinion because of your refusal to work for them and their suspicion that you had connection with the Fatah movement. Considering your reliable testimony and compelling documentary evidence, on a balance of probabilities, I find that you were persecuted by Hamas authorities based on perceived political opinion. I further find that should you be returned to Gaza you will more likely than not face serious possibility of persecution based on imputed political opinion. Based on the totality of the evidence provided I also find on a balance of probabilities that you have established your subjective fear of persecution and the existence of the possibility of persecution on a forward-looking basis. I further find that your subjective faith fear is supported by Palestinian country conditions.\n\nCountry Conditions\n\n[14] Further to the reasons I have already given above, the next duty of the Panel is to determine whether there is sufficient, credible, or trustworthy evidence to determine that there is a serious possibility that this claimant will face a risk to his life or would be persecuted if he is to return to Gaza Strip, which is his next country of former habitual residence. Exhibit 3.1, which is the National Documentation Package, NDP for Palestinian makes it clear that Hamas does not tolerate dissent or opposition and that those who are perceived as opposing Hamas face arrest and detention. This is content on the NDP 1.16. As it is well known, Hamas violently took over control of Gaza from Palestine in 2007. Since then, Hamas has maintained a large military wing in Gaza. (inaudible) brigades. In some instances, according to NDP Item 2.1, Hamas utilized its military wing to crack down on internal dissent. The same sources contain credible reports that Hamas security forces committed numerous human rights abuses. Also, with respect to Hamas, the same NDP at Item 2.1 contains reports of unlawful arbitrary killings by Hamas personnel. Torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment by Hamas personnel, unjust detention, political prisoners, or detainees, serious problems with independence of the judiciary. Hamas detained an unknown number of Palestinians due to political affiliation, public criticism of Hamas or suspected collaboration with Israel and held them for various period of time, according to human rights groups.\n\n[15] There is also a problem with the Hamas justice system. The NDP states that Hamas military courts tried civilians and many people we are unfairly treated, tried, convicted, and held on order by the military courts. This is contained on the agenda Item 1.16. Based upon the objective documentation from the NDP as well as the claimant\u2019s oral and documentary evidence, the Panel is satisfied on the balance of probabilities that this subjective perception is well-founded. On a forward-looking basis, the Panel further finds that the claimant faces the possibility of persecution from Hamas authorities should he return to Gaza Strip, Palestine.\n\nState Protection and Internal Flight Alternative\n\n[16] In terms of whether the claimant would have adequate state protection, given that Hamas is the governing authority of the Gaza Strip and has considerable power and influence in the Gaza Strip, the Panel finds that that adequate state protection would not be reasonably forthcoming to this claimant. This is because Gaza is \u2014 Gaza, Palestine, governed by Hamas, is the place where he fears persecution. And Hamas is his main agent of persecution. Furthermore, objective evidence indicate that the Palestinian Authority itself has very little authority in the Gaza Strip, where Hamas is de facto control. According to NDP at 2.1. All though Israeli authorities control some of the Palestinian Authority and territory, the same NDP sources say that Israeli authorities have retook control in the Gaza Strip itself. Therefore, I find that the claimant has rebutted the presumption of state protection.\n\n[17] With respect to internal flight alternatives. Unfortunately, considering the totality of the evidence adduced, the Panel found that the risk the claimant faces is common in Gaza as a whole. The objective evidence indicate that there are severe, limited limitation on freedom of movement in the occupied Palestinian territory. NDP Item 1.14 indicate that Israeli authorities control or restrict all movement into Israel and the West Bank from Gaza Strip. Furthermore, the NDP, Item 2.1 and Item 14.5 state that Israeli military incursions and successive military campaigns by the Israeli Defence Forces, combined with the use of force in ISIS restricted areas, can add to the difficulty of entering or exiting or traveling within Gaza. In addition, Hamas traditionally operates their own restrictions and the limitations on the movement in and out of Gaza. As such, the Panel find that there is no viable internal flight alternative for this claimant in Gaza.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[18] Based upon the totality of evidence before me, the Panel finds that the harm that the claimant fear is based on a Convention ground. Consequently, for the reasons given and upon a constitution of the whole of the evidence, the Refugee Protection Division determines that XXXX XXXX is a Convention refugee as defined in section 96 of the Act.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

The Minor Claimant relied on the testimony of the adult Claimants.\n\n[4] Considering that the Claimants were self-represented, the Panel took steps to explain the hearing process in greater detail, posed questions to them using plain language and was sensitive to the difficulties usually faced by self-represented claimants in a remote hearing.\n\nGuidelines Consideration\n\n[5] In assessing these claims, the Panel considered and applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 4: Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution[3] and the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 3: Child Refugee Claimants: Procedural and Evidentiary Issues[4] to ensure that appropriate accommodations were made in questioning the Female Associate Claimant, in the overall hearing process, and in substantively assessing the joint claim.\n\nALLEGATIONS\n\n[6] The Claimants\u2019 allegations are fully set out in the narrative portion of their Basis of Claim forms[5] and need not be repeated here in detail. To briefly summarize, the Claimants allege that they have been historically targeted and fear further persecution from the Israeli authorities as well as Israeli society at large due to their Arab ethnicity and Palestinian origins.\n\n[7] They further assert that due to the past and continuing persecutory incidents inflicted on them, they fled Israel to Canada to save their lives.\n\nDETERMINATION\n\n[8] Having considered all the evidence adduced, the Panel finds that the Claimants are Convention refugees pursuant to section 96 of IRPA, as they collectively face a serious risk of persecution in Israel based on their race\/nationality as Arabs\/Palestinian citizens of Israel. The Panel\u2019s reasons are as follows.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nIdentity\n\n[9] The Panel finds that the Claimants\u2019 country of reference and identities as nationals of Israel have both been established, on a balance of probabilities, by the adult Claimants\u2019 testimony and respective copies of the Claimants\u2019 Israeli passports filed at Exhibit 1.[6]\n\n[10] Furthermore, the Claimants\u2019 ethnic identity as Arabs has been established, on a balance of probabilities, by their names as well as their testimonies about their ethnicity, in Arabic, before the Board.\n\nNEXUS\n\n[11] From their allegations, the risk the Claimants fear has a link to the Convention ground of race\/nationality, as they fear persecution due to being Palestinian Arab citizens of Israel. Therefore, their joint claim has been assessed under section 96 of IRPA.\n\nCredibility\n\n[12] Credibility was a key issue in this claim. The court held in Maldonado[7] that the sworn testimony of the Claimant is presumed to be true unless there is a valid reason to doubt its truthfulness. In assessing this claim, the Panel is mindful of the difficulties usually faced by Claimants in establishing a claim, including cultural factors and the stress inherent in the hearing room. During the hearing, the Panel rephrased questions and offered breaks to the Claimants as necessary.\n\n[13] The Claimants generally testified in a forthright and spontaneous manner and in keeping with what one would expect from someone telling their own story. The adult Claimants\u2019 testimonies were also consistent with the allegations set out in the Claimants\u2019 BOCs, regarding the central aspect of their joint claim. Overall, there were no material inconsistencies, omissions, or contradictions between their testimonies and the other evidence in their claim that were not reasonably explained. The Panel found the Claimants to be credible and trustworthy witnesses and, therefore, accepts their allegations and oral testimonies as truthful.\n\n[14] The PC testified that the Claimants decided to make a refugee claim after cumulative events that led them to believe that, as Arabs of Palestinian origin, he and his family members faced discrimination amounting to persecution in Israel. He testified in detail about specific persecutory incidents, including being forced to shutdown their XXXX in 2014 after certain Jews attacked the business by throwing fire inside the XXXX with the intention of burning it down to demonstrate the societal hatred towards them as Arabs. The PC credibly testified that in XXXX 2017, the police stopped and arrested him (while he was driving in XXXX) on the pretext that he was not wearing seatbelt. He explained that upon being identified as an Arab, the officers took him to the police station where he was handcuffed, interrogated, harassed, and humiliated for several hours before he was released without charges.\n\n[15] The adult Claimants were consistent regarding their testimony that a group of Jews forced their way into their home in XXXX 2021 while pretending to be police officers, threatened to cart away their household furniture in a waiting truck outside because they are Arabs and eventually extorted the sum of XXXX Israeli Shekels from the PC. The Female Associate Claimant described how the agents of persecution\u2019s sudden invasion of their home caught her unawares without proper covering as Muslim woman should, and that the men sexually harassed her in the process. It was her testimony that the Minor Claimant was so impacted by the hard knocks on their door and cried uncontrollably out of fear. The PC testified that that no Jewish citizens or \u201csettlers\u201d had been subjected to the type of harassment they underwent, and they were singled out because they are Arabs.\n\n[16] The Male Associate Claimant described in detail how the police twice arrested and detained him and the PC in 2021 at security checkpoints and at Al-Aqsa Mosque. When questioned further, the Male Associate Claimant testified that in XXXX 2021, the police stopped and arrested him at a checkpoint on his way to participate in a peaceful demonstration against the Jewish settlers and military attacks on the mosque and that he was detained him for XXXX XXXX without food or water. He described that the attackers wrote on the wall \u201cDeath to Arabs\u201d in their apparent determination to eliminate the protesters because of their ethnic identity. The Male Associate Claimant went on to testify that in XXXX 2022, the police arrested and detained him and other Arab Israelis who went to the mosque to stop Jewish extremists from destroying their place of worship on the false allegation that the mosque was built on the site where King Solomon\u2019s temple once stood. He explained that the police (which protected the extremists) detained him for XXXX XXXX and released him with threats of harsher punishment if further found engaging in such a demonstration.\n\n[17] The PC explained that he and his family members had faced lots of similar incidents as an Arab Israelis, but that the invasion of their home and frequent arrests at various checkpoints made him more fearful for his and his family\u2019s safety in Israel. According to him, Jewish citizens or \u201csettlers\u201d are usually not stopped at the checkpoints and that the Claimants\u2019 vehicles are usually singled out because of their obvious Arabic names.\n\n[18] The Male Associate Claimant also testified about the Israeli government\u2019s deliberate discriminatory polices against the Arabs, including by denying them employments opportunities and by arming the Jews to target businesses owned by Israelis of Palestinian origin like him. According to him, the incessant discrimination and persecution of Arabs made it extremely difficult for them to attend access hospital, schools, rent a home, earn a living or to support their families.\n\n[19] The Claimants testified that apart from the Israeli authorities\u2019 refusal to provide Arab citizens of Palestinian origin any kind of opportunity to survive, the government continues to subject them to various kinds of race-based persecution. And that when they reached a point where they could no longer continue living in constant fears of death, they fled to Canada to save their lives.\n\n[20] At all times during the hearing, the adult Claimants\u2019 testimonies were spontaneous, detailed, straightforward, unhesitating, and consistent with the Claimants\u2019 BOCs. Therefore, the Panel accepts on, a balance of probabilities, that Mr. XXXX and his family have faced persistent discrimination amounting to persecution in Israel based on their Arab ethnicity.\n\nOBJECTIVE BASIS: DISCRIMINATION VS PERSECUTION\n\n[21] In Ward, the Supreme Court held that persecution is the \u201csustained or systemic violation of basic human rights demonstrative of a failure of state protection.\u201d[8] The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) indicates in its Handbook that discrimination rises to persecution where there are a number of discriminatory acts substantially prejudicial to the person concerned, which take place in a general atmosphere of insecurity, and which result in a feeling of apprehension and insecurity with regard to the future existence of the person concerned.[9]\n\n[22] In determining whether the Claimants face a serious possibility of persecution upon return to Israel, the Panel is guided by a RAD decision, identified as a Reason of Interest.[10] This decision contextualizes persecution within the following human rights framework:\n\n\u2026 This test must be understood within the context set out by Hathaway, who explains that the assessment of persecution must be done in the context of human rights law. This human rights-based approach to assessing persecution is not intended to be hierarchical or categorical but rather flexible and fluid allowing for decision-makers to \u201ctake account of the cumulative human rights impact of the various harms alleged in order to arrive at a synthesized assessment of the \u2018totality of the claim.\u2019\u201d[11]\n\n[23] As per these Reasons, the Panel must consider the situation in the country and whether the government is creating an atmosphere of intolerance; the consequences of the discrimination, including whether there are impacts on an ability to access education, healthcare, and jobs, which lead to an insecure future existence; the personal circumstances of the Claimants and their vulnerabilities, including age, health, finances, and gender; and the cumulative nature of the discrimination and whether it rises to persecution.[12]\n[24] Upon applying the above framework of analysis in the context of the Claimants\u2019 particular circumstances and the country condition evidence (as set out below), the Panel finds that they have established a forward-facing serious possibility of persecution.\n\n[25] As well, the Panel notes the Claimants\u2019 testimony on lack of appropriate infrastructure in Arab neighbourhoods, including improper educational, recreational, and healthcare facilities. As these facilities are lacking primarily in Palestinian towns of Israel, the Panel finds that the poor educational and medical infrastructure discriminates against Palestinians in Israel. The Principal Claimant and the Male Associate Claimant had credibly testified about police brutality against them personally at their home, XXXX, on the road and at various security checkpoints, which primarily target Israeli Arabs of Palestinian origin as well as at mosque in 2014, 2017, 2021 and 2022. They also testified about their arrests and detention at different times as well as the interrogation, humiliation, and starvation they were subjected to by the Israeli police on those occasions but released without charges.\n\n[26] It is well-established in the jurisprudence that persecution may be caused by discriminatory acts that are sufficiently serious and occur over such a long period of time that it can be said that the Claimants\u2019 physical or moral integrity is threatened. The Panel has considered the totality of the adduced evidence and finds that the multiple incidents of discrimination and violence on the Claimants, both from the security officials and Israeli society, based on their Arab race are sufficiently serious as the Claimants\u2019 rights to liberty, security and mobility were adversely affected. On a balance of probabilities, the Panel further finds that these credibly established repeated acts of violence against the Claimants \u2013 as Arab community members and the human rights impact of all these harms on them \u2013 cumulatively amounts to persecution.\n\n[27] The objective evidence supports the Claimants\u2019 forward-looking fear of discrimination amounting to persecution for Arabs in Israel. According to the Amnesty International, Israel continued to discriminate against Palestinian citizens of Israel in areas of planning, budget allocation, policing, and political participation.[13]This report confirms that Israel maintains over 65 laws that discriminate against Palestinians. In August, two NGOs filed a petition to the Israeli Supreme Court on behalf of 10 local Palestinian councils and dozens of Palestinian citizens of Israel against government policy discriminating against these communities in the distribution of housing, construction and land development benefits compared to neighbouring Jewish communities that enjoy higher socio-economic status and have access to such benefits.[14]\n\n[28] In December, the magistrate court in Krayot, near Haifa, rejected a petition for access to education by Palestinian citizens of Israel living in Karmiel, citing the discriminatory Nation State Law. The decision said that establishing an Arabic school in the town or funding transport for its Palestinian residents to study in Arabic schools in nearby communities would undermine the town\u2019s \u201cJewish character.\u201d[15]\n\n[29] The Amnesty International also reports that Israeli soldiers, police and ISA officers continued to torture and otherwise ill-treat Palestinian detainees, including children, with impunity. Reported methods included beating, slapping, painful shackling, sleep deprivation, use of stress positions and threats of violence against family members[16]. Human Rights Watch also confirms that Israeli authorities in 2020 systematically repressed and discriminated against Palestinians in ways that far exceeded the security justifications they often provided.[17] Israeli forces routinely turn away or humiliate and delay Palestinians at checkpoints without explanation.[18]\n\n[30] Another Human Rights Watch report explains that, \u201cThe Israeli government\u2019s policy of boxing in Palestinian communities extends beyond the West Bank and Gaza to Palestinian towns and villages inside Israel, (\u2026) The policy discriminates against Palestinian citizens of Israel and in favour of Jewish citizens, sharply restricting Palestinians\u2019 access to land for housing to accommodate natural population growth.\u201d[19] Reports also state that Palestinian members of the Knesset (MKs) are facing increasing threats to their freedom of expression. These threats are of concern in and of themselves but also reflect the wider situation in Israel in which the space for voices critical of the Israeli government\u2019s treatment of Palestinians has shrunk and discrimination against Palestinian citizens has been entrenched.[20] The Panel has further considered the country conditions evidence and the Claimants\u2019 oral testimony and finds that the extreme discrimination and violence faced by Palestinian citizens of Israel has been historical and continues to increase.\n\n[31] Having considered the country conditions and the Claimants\u2019 personal circumstances, the Panel finds that the Israeli government is nurturing intolerance against its Palestinian citizens, that cumulative anti-Arab discrimination seriously affects the Claimants\u2019 human rights and result in a feeling of insecurity regarding their futures, thus amounting to a serious possibility of persecution.\n\nSTATE PROTECTION\n\n[32] Given that the Israeli state authorities and the society are the primary agents of persecution in this claim, the Panel finds that no adequate state protection will be extended to these Claimants upon their return to Israel.\n\nINTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE (IFA)\n\n[33] Considering that the agent of persecution is the Israeli state, the Panel finds that there is no safe and viable IFA for the Claimants as Israelis of Palestinian origin, as the discrimination against Arabs exists throughout the country and the Israeli government has effective control over all its territory.[21] On a balance of probabilities, the Panel finds that the Claimants face a serious possibility of persecution in all parts of Israel.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[34] Having considered all the evidence adduced, the Panel finds that XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX XXXX are Convention refugees pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA.

The claimants are brothers. I have considered your testimony and other evidence in this case, and I am ready to render my decision orally. I find that you are both Convention refugees as you have established a serious possibility of persecution in Saudi Arabia, based on the intersection of your imputed political opinion and your nationality of stateless Palestinians.\n\n[2] The details of your claim are in your Basis of Claim forms and narrative, which can be found in Exhibit 2.1 and 2.2, along with an amendment at Exhibit 5. In short, you both allege a fear of detention in Saudi Arabia as you no longer have status in that country, and fear indefinite detention, as you do not have a country to be deported to, as stateless Palestinians. You also fear reprisal from high-ranking Saudi officials who approach both of you to spy on Shia students criticizing the Saudi prince. When you refused to do so, the threats against you and your brother escalated, leading you to flee the country.\n\n[3] You have both established your personal national identities as stateless Palestinians based on your Egyptian travel document for Palestinian refugees, as well as your Palestinian Authority travel document. Both these documents can be found at Exhibit 1.\n\n[4] As you are both stateless, I assessed, your claim against your country of former habitual residence. I note that you both have travel documents from Egypt, and I note that this document is issued merely for travel and does not bestow any nationality rights on you. In fact, the travel document expressly states that it does not allow its owner to live in, or enter, Egypt. Based on the above. Egypt is not a country of former habitual residence, and you have not established a fact of residence there.\n\n[5] I also note that neither of you has been to the occupied Palestinian territories, nor do you have permission to enter your territories with your Palestinian Authority passports. However, I consider that you were born in Saudi Arabia, which is the only country where you have lived for all of your lives until you came to Canada. As such, I find that Saudi Arabia is the only country where you both have de facto residence, and that you have a relationship to Saudi Arabia broadly comparable to that between a citizen and his or her country of nationality. On the facts of this case, therefore, I find that the only country of former habitual residence is Saudi Arabia, and I have assessed your claims against only that country.\n\n[6] I found you both to be credible witnesses, and I believe what you presented in support of your claim. Mr. XXXX, you testified without hesitation and detail and were responsive to the questions I asked you. There were no material inconsistencies in your testimony, or contradictions between your testimony and the other evidence before me. You testified about the various problems you and your brother had experienced in your lives, as stateless Palestinians, starting from when you were in school. As young children, you extended Palestinians were mistreated more than other migrants as you did not have a state to protect you, and you were bullied and accused of selling your homeland to settle in a foreign country.\n\n[7] You explained that it had been instilled in you and your brother since childhood that you could never speak freely in Saudi Arabia, as there was always a fear that you could be disappeared. You testified organically and in consistent detail about how you and your brother were first approached by XXXX XXXX (ph) to spy on Shia students and repeat \u2014 sorry, report any criticism against the prince. Despite XXXX XXXX and his collaborators\u2019 several attempts to recruit you and your brother, you explained that you refused to do so as it was against your ethics. You extend that you did not want to be responsible for a friend or colleague being killed by the state because you reported them to the authorities for expressing their opinions. You explained as well that XXXX XXXX and his collaborators insulted you and your brother for being Palestinian and threatened that you both could be disappeared easily as you did not have a state to protect you. You explained organically that you were fearful because of Jamal Khashoggi, who was a native of Saudi Arabia, could be so brutally murdered for opposing the regime. A stateless Palestinian like you and your brother would face untold repercussions.\n\n[8] At all times, your testimony was consistent with your BOC and internally consistent with your brother\u2019s claim as well. You provided proof of your education at the university where you were targeted, as well as copies of threats that XXXX allegedly received by text. However, I have some concerns about the genesis of these text messages as I was unable to verify the originals on your phone. As such, I do not put any weight on these text messages. However, this does not outweigh your otherwise credible testimony.\n\n[9] I note that XXXX provided a copy of his expired Iqama, but XXXX did not. However, I note that you are both still under 25 and therefore, dependant on your father\u2019s status and would therefore have the same date of issue and expiry for your visas. The country conditions evidence in the NDP also confirms that status automatically expires six (6) months after you have left Saudi Arabia, and that can be found at 14.1. I know that you both only spent one (1) day in the US. When I asked you if you made a refugee claim in the US, you said you wanted to come to Canada as your maternal uncle lives here. I accept this response as reasonable and I do not draw a negative inference with respect to your subjective fear.\n\n[10] Having carefully considered the totality of the evidence before me, I find that the information you presented in your testimony and documents to be credible.\n\n[11] With respect to Nexis, I am satisfied on the facts of your case that you both face prosecution under section 96 in Saudi Arabia, based both on your political opinion as well as your nationality as stateless Palestinians. As neither of you currently have status in Saudi Arabia, you would be subject to deportation. The country conditions confirmed that foreigners are subjected to detention and deportation due to visa violations. This can be found at Item 2.4. On September 21st, 2019, authorities announced that the campaign had netted over 3.8 million arrests, including four (4) \u2014 3 million residency law violations and almost 600,000 labour law violations. This campaign then recommended over 962,000 migrants for deportation. This can be found at the Human Rights Watch report, at Item 2.5. Based on this objective evidence, I find that both you and your brother would be at risk of arrest in Saudi Arabia as you no longer possess valid residency documents.\n\n[12] However, in as stateless Palestinians with nowhere to be deported. I find that you both face a serious possibility of being detained indefinitely in Saudi Arabia, which would be a clear violation of your human rights, amounting to persecution. The objective evidence confirms that there is substantial prejudice against ethnic and national minorities in Saudi Arabia. And the NDP is unequivocal that the country\u2019s restrictive sponsorship laws have the impact of increasing vulnerability to forced labour conditions. All of this can be found at Item 13.1of the NDP for Saudi Arabia.\n\n[13] In its most recent rankings, Freedom House ranked Saudi Arabia as, \u201cNot free\u201d. This can be found at Item 2.3. And this report confirms that surveillance is extensive within Saudi Arabia and Saudis living and travelling abroad are also subjected to spying and intimidation. The government is known to have purchased Pegasus spyware, which allows users to secretly hack into a target\u2019s phone and spy on their whereabouts and communications in real-time.\n\n[14] Investigations in 2021 by foreign journalists and researchers uncovered a new form of surveillance used by the Saudi government that needed no interaction with the targeted user to access their personal devices. I also note that there are severe criminal penalties for criticism of the regime and free discussion on topics like religion or the royal family. Laws are often vaguely worded, giving the state considerable discretion to determine what constitutes illegal expression.\n\n[15] A report to the Joint Human Rights Council confirms that being stateless in Saudi Arabia can result in significant violations of rights, which has included lack of access to public education, healthcare and other services, inability to access employment, impeded family reunification, social alienation, and psychological challenges. What is often the most difficult consequences for these communities is that alongside other non-nationals, they are at the mercy of their sponsors to remain in the country. But unlike other non-nationals, they would have nowhere to return to if deported. This is at Item 3.9 of the Saudi Arabia NDP.\n\n[16] On the basis of all of the above. I find that the objective evidence establishes on a balance of probabilities that based on your nationality as stateless Palestinians, as well as your imputed political opinion for refusing to collaborate with the state, you both face a serious possibility of persecution in Saudi Arabia.\n\n[17] Now, as I have already found, the laws inside Saudi Arabia place foreigners, and particularly stateless Palestinians, in a very vulnerable position such that they have limited recourse to their rights \u2014 limited recourse when rights are violated, sorry, and that\u2019s at Item 2.5. Since it is a law of the state itself that subject stateless Palestinians to the exploitative sponsorship structure, I find that the state is responsible for the persecution that stateless Palestinians experience within its borders, and therefore I find that no adequate state protection exists for you inside Saudi Arabia. Further, since the agents of persecution in this case are state actors, I further find that you will not receive state protection on a balance of probabilities.\n\n[18] Since your agents of persecution are high-ranking government actors, there is no safe IFA for either of you within Saudi Arabia. The surveillance from the government and harsh laws against dissent exist all over the country, and therefore there is no safe IFA for you in Saudi Arabia, as there would be a serious possibility of persecution based both on your nationality and imputed political opinion in all parts of the country. For all of these reasons, I accept both of your claims under section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, and I find you both to be Convention refugees.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

They have claimed refugee status pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (the Act).[1]\n\n[2] The male claimant acted as the designated representative for the minor claimants. He confirmed his knowledge of his responsibilities in this regard prior to the hearing.\n\nALLEGATIONS\n\n[3] The claimants\u2019 allegations are set out in their Basis of Claim forms (BOCs) and a subsequent amendment.[2] They allege they are at risk of persecution in Saudi Arabia and China due to their Palestinian ethnicity, their religious beliefs as Sunni Muslims, and their political beliefs as opponents of the Hamas movement.\n\n[4] The male claimant originally lived in Saudi Arabia, but started to live primarily in the People\u2019s Republic of China starting from 2004, with the female claimant joining him in 2008 and the family renewing their residency in Saudi Arabia on an annual basis. During the 2010s the claimants eventually stopped renewing the status of the minor claimants and would journey to Saudi Arabia annually to renew the male claimant\u2019s status. They found increasing discrimination in China due to their ethnicity and religious practices.\n\n[5] The COVID-19 pandemic created a chaotic set of circumstances for the family starting in XXXX of 2020 after they were refused re-entry to China despite having a valid residency permit until XXXX of 2020, which resulted in the claimants temporarily living in Malaysia while attempting to return to China and attempting to maintain status in Saudi Arabia while simultaneously attempting to arrange residence with all three embassies. Their Saudi status was renewed for shorter and shorter periods, until by XXXX 2022 it was only being renewed weekly. The claimants attempted to live in Egypt, as is sometimes permitted by the claimants\u2019 status, but discovered they would need a sponsor to obtain a work permit or schooling.\n\n[6] The claimants arrived in the United States in XXXX of 2022 and entered Canada irregularly in XXXX of 2022, applying for refugee protection on arrival.\n\nDETERMINATION\n\n[7] The panel concludes that the claimants are Convention refugees.\n\nANALYSIS\n\n[8] The panel was provided with true copies of the claimants\u2019 Egyptian issued Travel Documents for Palestinian Refugees[3] as well as other identity documents from the People\u2019s Republic of China and Saudi Arabia.[4]\n\n[9] The panel finds that the documents, and the testimony of the claimants, are sufficient to establish their identities on a balance of probabilities.\n\nCOUNTRIES OF FORMER HABITUAL RESIDENCE\n\n[10] The claimants are stateless Palestinians. Statelessness per se does not give rise to a claim for refugee status.\n\n[11] The panel must consider countries where the claimant had \u201cformer habitual residence,\u201d which implies a situation where a stateless person was admitted to a country with a view to enjoying a period of continuing residence for some duration. The claimants do not have to be legally able to return to a country of former habitual residence. The claimants must have established a significant period of de facto residence in the country in question. To have a successful claim, the claimants must establish that they face a s. 96 or s. 97 risk in at least one country of former habitual residence, and that they are unable to safely return to any other.[5]\n\n[12] The Federal Court of Appeal established that a broad and liberal approach must be taken when assessing a proposed country of former habitual residence: there is no minimum period of residence required in that country, the analysis should not be unduly restrictive, the claimant does not need to be able to legally return, and the claimant must have established some significant period of de facto residence there.[6]\n\n[13] The claimants lived at times in Saudi Arabia and returned annually to update their residency. The panel finds that Saudi Arabia is a country of former habitual residence for all the claimants.\n\n[14] The claimants lived for many years in the People\u2019s Republic of China on valid residency permits, the male claimant starting in 2004 and the female claimant starting in 2020. The minor claimants can speak Chinese, and the claimants made many attempts to re-enter the country during the COVID-19 pandemic. The panel finds that the claimants have established China as a country of former habitual residence.\n\n[15] The claimants did live in Malaysia for some time during the COIVD-19 pandemic, but the panel finds that the claimants were there while attempting to re-enter China rather than to establish permanent residence, given the claimants had to obtain multiple tourist visas. The panel finds Malaysia is not a country of former habitual residence.\n\n[16] The panel likewise finds Egypt was not a country of former habitual residence given the short temporary residency of under three months the claimants had there.\n\n[17] The claimants have also never entered Gaza or established a period of de facto residence there.[7] The panel finds that this means the Palestinian Territories cannot be a country of former habitual residence.\n\n[18] In summary, all of the claimants have two countries of former habitual residence, Saudi Arabia and the People\u2019s Republic of China.\n\nNEXUS\n\n[19] The panel found the claimants established a nexus with regard to China due to their religious beliefs as Muslims and their ethnicity as Palestinians.\n\nCREDIBILITY\n\n[20] The panel found the claimants generally credible, and found that they addressed the minor issues in their testimony clearly, with mostly credible descriptions of the issues they faced.\n\n[21] They also provided adequate documentary evidence of their travel issues and of their residence in the above-named countries, including residency permits, documentation of meetings and -emails with embassies, and employment documentation.[8] These documents corroborated their well-drafted BOC narrative and their clear testimony.\n\n[22] The panel had some issues with regard to the male claimant\u2019s description of angering a Hamas supporter named XXXX in China, which apparently made him an enemy of Hamas in Gaza. The panel found that while XXXX may have existed, the speculation of the male claimant that he would be arrested in Palestine because of issues arising from their friendship ending over the male claimant\u2019s opinion of Hamas were exaggerated.\n\n[23] However, the panel found that this exaggeration was not sufficient to rebut the presumption of credibility.\n\n[24] The claimants have established that they are stateless Palestinians and that they were forced to involuntarily leave China and Saudi Arabia.\n\n[25] The panel also finds that the claimants have established that they are currently unable to reside legally in Saudi Arabia.\n\nSUBJECTIVE BASIS\n\n[26] The panel finds that the claimants have credibly testified that they would be afraid of the consequences of trying to return to China due to recent changes that are noted in the Objective Basis section.\n\n[27] While the panel found that the claimants did not adequately explain not claiming protection in the United States, the panel found that this did not, in and of itself, establish a lack of subjective fear, given their short stay there.\n\n[28] The claimants have established that they have a subjective fear of persecution.\n\nOBJECTIVE BASIS\n\n[29] The claimants described a worsening climate in China due to their religion, including warnings given to the family Imam regarding mentioning events in Northern China and schools cancelling Halal meals for the minor claimants and banning the minor claimants from praying.\n\n[30] The government of China allows for what it defines as \u201cnormal\u201d religious practices, allowing practice of Islam as a named religion but under the auspices of a \u201cpatriotic religious association.[9]\u201d The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade states that Muslims face increasing amounts of hate speech and are not able to practice their religion freely, summarizing that they face a moderate risk of societal discrimiantion.[10]\n\n[31] China has engaged in a systematic campaign against Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang province, which includes what neutral authorities describe as concentration and re-education camps and direct harassment of religious figures.[11]\n\n[32] More relevant to the claimants, the government has launched a program outside of Xinjiang to promote the \u201cSinicizaiton\u201d of Islam, which has included projects to remove Arabic style domes and minarets from mosques in China in Shanghai and Beijing[12] with a stated intent to remove \u201cSaudi and Arabic influence\u201d; a local official stated that this was an \u201c[\u2026] unstoppable general trend. It\u2019s been ordered by the central government. No one can stop it.[13]\u201d\n\n[33] The Australian DFAT states that:\n\u201cThe plan outlines a \u2018uniquely Chinese Islam\u2019 (as distinct from Arabic expressions of Islam), and warns against trends of \u2018generalisation of the concept of halal\u2019, emulation of \u2018foreign clothing styles\u2019, and imitation of \u2018foreign styles of mosque architecture\u2019. This can mean the removal of Arabic script from religious buildings, banning religious clothing, banning the call to prayer, restricting distribution of the Quran and closing non-registered mosques. Penalties may include prison terms of up to three years.[14]\u201c\n\n[34] While the claimants are not Ugyhars, the panel finds that the claimants\u2019 Palestinian ethnicity and practice of Islam would be generally defined as broadly Arabic and, due to these recent government policies regarding Islam, they would also not likely be considered as \u201cacceptable\u201d to authorities as the better-integrated Hui Muslims native to China.\n\n[35] More likely than not, their existence and faith as ethnic Palestinian Muslims would be seen in China as being effectively contrary to promoted government policy, which would be dangerous in an authoritarian communist state that objective evidence indicates is taking further measures against their faith.\n\n[36] Given the intersectionality of their ethnic and religious identity, the panel finds the claimants would face a serious possibility of discrimination amounting to persecution if they were to return to China due to their profiles.\n\nSTATE PROTECTION\n\n[37] The state is presumed able to provide adequate protection to its citizens. Therefore, claimants have the duty to seek state protection before seeking protection in Canada. However, in certain circumstances, it would be objectively unreasonable to expect a claimant to do so. Furthermore, the protection available to a claimant may not be adequate given their specific circumstances.\n\n[38] With regard to China, the panel must consider that the state is the prospective agent of persecution, the claimants would have linguistic issues with local police, and most importantly, well documented objective evidence indicates that those with contrary religious practices are sometimes tortured and arbitrarily detained,[15] police are politically motivated and generally act with impunity,[16] and that there is a lack of judicial independence.[17]\n\n[39] Given this, and the above noted concerns of political authorities regarding non-official practice of Islam, the panel finds that approaching authorities to obtain protection would be unreasonable.\n\n[40] The panel finds that the claimants have rebutted the presumption that adequate state protection exists for them in China.\n\nINTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE\n\n[41] The panel finds that, given the above noted objective evidence that the issues the claimants would face in China are the result of national policies, that they would face the described issues anywhere in China.\n\n[42] The panel finds that the claimants would not have an IFA in all of China.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[43] Even though the claimants have not established that they can return to China, Thabet is clear that the panel is to consider possible persecution in every country of former habitual residence in its determination. Applying the architecture, the panel finds that the claimants face a serious possibly of persecution in China.\n\n[44] The panel also finds that the claimants cannot, at this time, legally return to Saudi Arabia.\n\n[45] This means that the claimants face s. 96 harm in one country of former habitual residence and cannot enter their second one.\n\n[46] Given this, the panel must accept their claims as Convention refugees and accept their claims.\n\n(signed) Tyler Nicholson\n\nNovember 10, 2023\n\n[1] Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27, as amended, sections 96 and 97(1).\n\n[2] Exhibits 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4, amendment at Exhibit 5.\n\n[3] Exhibit 1.\n\n[4] Exhibit 5.\n\n[5] Thabet v.

        "unofficial_text":"2023 RLLR 68\n\nCitation: 2023 RLLR 68\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: December 8, 2023\nPanel: Gladys Idem\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Jordan Duviner\nCountry: Hungary\nRPD Number: TC2-24950\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2023-01721\nATIP Pages: N\/A\n\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n\n[1] These are the Reasons for Decision for the claimant, XXXX XXXX XXXX (\u201cclaimant\u201d). The claimant alleges to be a citizen of Hungary and is seeking refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).\n\nALLEGATIONS\n\n[2] The specific allegations of the claim can be found on the claimant\u2019s Basis of Claim Forms (BOC).\n\n[3] In summary, the claimant alleges that her assigned gender at birth was male however, she now identifies and dresses as female. She fears persecution in Hungary due to her ethnicity as Roma and because of her gender identity and expression.\n\nDETERMINATION\n\n[4] The panel has considered the evidence in this case and finds that the claimant is a Convention refugee because she faces a serious possibility persecution in Hungary based on her ethnicity as Roma.\n\n[5] In assessing this claim, the panel considered and applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9 on proceedings involving Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Expression, and Sex Characteristics, or \u201cSOGIESC\u201d (the Guideline), which establishes guiding principles for decision-makers in adjudicating cases involving SOGIESC.\n\n[6] The panel also considered and applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 4 which establishes guiding principles in gender related claims and proceedings before the Immigration and Refugee Board.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nIdentity\n\n[7] The claimant\u2019s personal identity and nationality as a citizen of Hungary has been established, on a balance of probabilities, by a copy of her Hungarian passport.\n\nNexus\n\n[8] I find that there is an intersectionality between what the claimant fears and the Convention ground of ethnicity and membership in a particular social group namely, LGBTQ2S+. The risk she faces is heightened and compounded due to the claimant\u2019s gender identity and expression. Therefore, her claim is assessed under section 96.\n\nCredibility\n\n[9] The claimant stated in her narrative that the first time she expressed her gender identity was in high school. She mentioned that she was bullied and assaulted by other kids the first day she went to school in tights, short girl top with trimmed and shaped eyebrows. She said the school authorities did not do anything about the attack on her, and neither was she provided any protection from further bullying and discrimination in school.\n\n[10] The claimant also submitted a Hungarian government verification document which confirms that the claimant is of Roma origin and a member of the Roma community.\n\n[11] The claimant confirmed during the hearing, that her preferred pronoun is \u201cshe\/her\u201d.\n\n[12] The claimant testified about her experience in high school. She said she was discriminated and bullied because she was Roma and the constant bullying she experienced in school was exacerbated because of her Roma ethnicity.\n\n[13] The claimant spoke about how she and her mother were insulted, discriminated and treated badly whenever they entered a store in Hungary. She said she is easily identified as Roma because she has a darker skin tone.\n\n[14] I find the claimant to be a credible witness in terms of her Roma identity and the difficulties she experienced in Hungary, in part due to her Roma ethnicity. I also give full weight to the evidence she submitted to establish her Roma identity.\n\n[15] However, I find that the claimant\u2019s testimony about her personal experiences in Hungary were vague and lacked detail.\n\n[16] Counsel mentioned during his submissions that the claimant\u2019s age, language barrier, cultural background and level of sophistication are factors that impacted the claimant\u2019s testimony.\n\n[17] I agree with counsel\u2019s submissions, and I find that these factors reasonably explain the difficulties that may have affected the claimant\u2019s testimony. Therefore, I do not draw a negative inference from the vagueness or lack of detail in the claimant\u2019s testimony.\n\n[18] In assessing the claimant\u2019s overall credibility and evidence, I did not find any discrepancies or omissions that would go to the core of her claim therefore, I have no reason to doubt her fear of discrimination and persecution from the Hungarian public or authorities because of her ethnicity.\n\n[19] The claimant testified that if she returns to Hungary, she will continue to experience racism and discrimination in every area of her life because of her Roma ethnicity.\n\n[20] The objective evidence which will be discussed below supports the claimant\u2019s allegations about the discrimination of the Roma individuals in Hungary.\n\n[21] Therefore, I find that the claimant faces a serious possibility of persecution in Hungary and the claimant has established on a balance of probabilities, her subjective fear.\n\n[22] In view of my finding that the claimant faces a serious possibility of persecution based on her Roma ethnicity, it is not necessary to consider the claimant\u2019s allegations regarding her gender identity and expression.\n\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution\n\n[23] The National Documentation Package (NDP) confirms that there are several human rights problems in Hungary, including discrimination against Roma people. According to the NDP, Roma people suffer social and economic exclusion in almost all fields of life. It states that Roma children faced discrimination in education, that there is segregation of Roma children in schools, and frequent misdiagnosis as having mental challenges.[1]\n\n[24] The European Commission expressed concerns regarding the disproportionate representation of Roma children in schools and stated that this negatively affected their future prospects. The NDP confirms that the Roma population in Hungary face discrimination in all fields of life, including education, housing, employment, and health care. It also states that the Roma people are also subjected to violence, often targeted by extremist groups and there are well-known incidents of violent hate crimes against Roma people. [2]\n\n[25] Based on the documentary evidence, I am satisfied that if the claimant returns to Hungary, she would on a balance of probabilities, face discrimination that cumulatively amounts to persecution because of her Roma ethnicity.\n\n[26] Therefore, I find that the claimant\u2019s subjective fear has an objective basis and, I find that she has a well-founded fear of persecution.\n\nState Protection\n\n[27] Item 10.1 of the NDP cites a 2018 report by the UN Human Rights Committee in Hungary indicating that there is a prevalence of hate crimes and hate speech targeting minorities, including the Roma population, and the police often failed to investigate and prosecute credible claims of hate crimes and criminal hate speech. The same report indicates that the Roma population faced continued hostility from police forces in Hungary and that there was a failure to protect them from attacks. Based on the objective documentary evidence, I find on a balance of probabilities, that adequate state protection would not be reasonably forthcoming to the claimant in this case. Therefore, I am satisfied that the claimant has rebutted the presumption of state protection.[3]\n\nInternal Flight Alternative (IFA)\n\n[28] For reasons like those of state protection, I find that the claimant will face a serious possibility of persecution everywhere in Hungary because of her Roma ethnicity. The societal discrimination that the claimant would face in Hungary as Roma would on a balance of probabilities, be the same everywhere. Therefore, I find there is no viable IFA for the claimant in Hungary.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[29] Based on the totality of the evidence before me, I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee under section 96 because she faces a serious possibility of persecution in Hungary.\n\n[30] Therefore, her claim is accepted.\n\n(signed) Gladys Idem\n\nDecember 8, 2023\n\n[1] National Documentation Package, Hungary, 29 September 2023, tab 2.1: Hungary.

Hamilton\nCountry: Sri Lanka\nRPD Number: TC2-14009\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2023-01721\nATIP Pages: N\/A\n\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n\n[1] This is the decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) in the claim of XXXX XXXX (\u201cthe Claimant\u201d ), who claims to be a citizen of Sri Lanka and is claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (the \u201cIRPA\u201d).\n\n[2] The panel considered and applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 4 on Gender Considerations in Proceedings before the Immigration and Refugee Board in refugee claims.[1]\n\nALLEGATIONS\n\n[3] The claimant\u2019s allegations are set out in her Basis of Claim (BOC) form submitted to the board.[2] In summary, the claimant alleges that she fears persecution at the hands of the Sri Lankan police and army due to her Tamil ethnicity and imputed political opinion.\n\nDETERMINATION\n\n[4] The panel finds that the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nIdentity\n\n[5] The panel finds that the identity of the claimant as a national of Sri Lanka is established, on a balance of probabilities, by her testimony and the copy of her passport in file. [3]\n\nNexus\n\n[6] The claimant alleges that she fears harm at the hands of the authorities because of her ethnicity and because the police and the army consider her involved with LTTE. She also alleges that her risk of harm is exacerbated because she is a widow in Sri Lanka. Therefore, the panel finds that there is a link between what the claimant fears and the Convention ground of ethnicity as a Tamil from Sri Lanka, imputed political opinion and her membership in a particular social group, that of Tamil widowed women who have children in western countries. The panel, therefore, assessed her claim under section 96 of the IRPA.\n\nCredibility\n\n[7] When a claimant swears to the truth of certain allegations, this creates the presumption that those allegations are true, unless there are valid reasons to doubt the veracity of their allegations.[4] The presumption of truthfulness is rebuttable, and the claimant bears the burden of establishing the claim.[5] A determination as to whether a claimant\u2019s evidence is credible is made on a balance of probabilities.[6] The existence of contradictions, inconsistencies or omissions in the evidence can be a valid basis for negative credibility findings.[7] It is also open to a decision-maker to consider vagueness, evasiveness, and\/or the implausibility of a claimant\u2019s evidence based on common sense and rationality and having regard to all the surrounding circumstances.[8]\n\n[8] In assessing the claimant\u2019s credibility, the panel was mindful of the difficulties faced by the claimants in establishing their claims, including cultural factors, level of education and the inherent stress of the hearing process. The panel also took in consideration the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 4: \u2018Gender Considerations in Proceedings before the Immigration and Refugee Board\u2019.\n\n[9] The claimant testified that she is afraid of the army and the police because they consider her a supporter of LTTE. She testified that she had to leave the country after army officers asked her about her daughters abroad and their links with LTTE. She also testified that the daughter of her brother was involved with LTTE which rendered her a suspect when she told the police officers that the daughter of her brother died during the civil war.\n\n[10] According to her BOC and testimony, the claimant was stopped when she was returning from Vavuniya to Jaffna on XXXX XXXX, 2021. She testified that she told the army officers that she was at her sister\u2019s place, but they accused her of going to Mullivaikal Remembrance Day. The claimant testified that after this incident, two army officers went to her house and accused her of being involved with the LTTE in diaspora, because of her daughters in Germany and Canada. The claimant testified that after they threatened her to send her to a detention camp, she talked with her daughter and her daughter in Canada and after receiving the visa, she came to Canada. The claimant testified that the army has inquired about her since she left the country.\n\n[11] The panel notes that the claimant provided consistent information about the last incident which forced her to leave the country but was confused about the previous incidents she alleges in her BOC. She was consistent with her BOC narrative about the interrogation when she returned from Germany to Sri Lanka or that police officers went to her house after she returned from India. However, she was confused and changed her testimony when asked about the dates when the incidents happened and about the visits of police or army officers to her home after she returned from Germany and India.\n\n[12] When the panel pointed out the discrepancies, the claimant explained that she was very confused and thought that she was being asked about the other incident, or that she forgot. While the panel still has credibility about her narrative regarding police visits before the incident of XXXX 2021, the panel notes that the claimant alleges that she left the country after they accused her of being involved with LTTE in XXXX 2021. She reiterated during the hearing what happened to her in XXXX 2021 and what led her to tell her daughters about the incidents.\n\n[13] The panel also considered the profile of the claimant, a Tamil widow from Jaffna, in the northern part of Sri Lanka. The claimant provided corroborative evidence regarding her residence in Jaffna and her allegation that she is Tamil from the Northern part of Sri Lanka. The panel further notes that she alleges that she is considered as someone supporting the LTTE because of her daughters abroad but also because the daughter of her brother was a member of LTTE who died during the war. The panel further notes that the claimant has been in Canada for two years, a country with a large Tamil diaspora. She has been stopped and interrogated in the past when she returned from Germany in 2019 as a Tamil woman returning in the country.\n\n[14] Therefore, while acknowledging that the claimant\u2019s testimony was not perfect, considering overall her testimony and the documentary evidence submitted, and in particular considering her profile, the panel finds that the claimant established on the required standard of a balance of probabilities, that she fears harm should she return, due to her profile as a Tamil widowed woman with extended family members involved with LTTE in the past, with two daughters abroad, and who has been in Canada for two years.\n\nObjective basis\n\n[15] The allegations of the claimant are supported by the objective evidence. In general terms, the NDP sources indicate that Tamils remain second-class citizens, as it has been for decades and that harassment, mistreatment and human rights abuses have all continued relatively unabated.[9] The National Documentation Package further indicates that Tamils are detained and tortured on suspicion of supporting the LTTE.[10] According to the documentary evidence, the security forces regularly monitored and harassed community members, especially activists, journalists and former or suspected former LTTE members.[11] Other objective documentary evidence points out that \u201cpeople connected to politically-sensitive war-related issues, such as missing persons, land release and memorial events, are most likely to be monitored.\u201d[12]\n\n[16] Other sources in NDP such as Freedom House Report indicate that the police and security forces are known to engage in \u201cabusive practices\u2026 including extrajudicial executions, forced disappearances, custodial rape, and torture, all of which disproportionately impact Tamils.\u201d[13] The National Documentation Package further informs that the police harass citizens and torture is an accepted use of force which is used by the police and that Tamils face discrimination.[14]\n\n[17] With respect to women, the reports indicate that women face significant levels and gender-based persecution and discrimination in Sri Lanka and that Tamil women routinely face sexual and gender-based violence and live with multiple challenges that threaten their freedom, dignity, and security on a daily basis.[15]\n\n[18] A report by the International Crisis Group states that Tamil speaking women in the north and east have arguably been more affected by the conflict and its aftermath than any other group in Sri Lanka. Tens of thousands of war widows and wives of the missing have been forced to become heads of household and primary income earners, in a patriarchal society, and are made insecure by the continued presence of the Sinhalese military. They suffered gender-based violence and abuse throughout the conflict and continue to suffer discrimination, sexual and gender-based violence, harassment, and abuse from within their own community and from the authorities, including at the hands of the military. These vulnerable groups of women do not feel safe in making complaints to authorities about discrimination, abuse, or violence against them and in most instances, it has been law enforcement agencies or decision-makers that have perpetrated this violence.[16]\n\n[19] According to NDP sources female-headed household as vulnerable to societal discrimination, official harassment and exploitation, and authorities may continue to monitor those believed to have family links to the LTTE. [17] Another report indicates that the presence of the military and former LTTE controlled areas, such as the north, has heightened Tamil woman\u2019s sense of insecurity and their vulnerability to gender-based violence at the hands of authorities.[18]\n\n[20] Suspected sympathizers of Tamil rebel groups are still subject to arbitrary arrest. There is ample evidence of Tamils monitored abroad and are being suspected of having links to the LTTE, upon return to Sri Lanka. Even Tamils who have a low profile and are only connected through the LTTE in a historical association, have been targeted. Tamil returnees who have claimed refugee status abroad and return to Sri Lanka are sometimes interrogated and detained at the airport.[19]\n\n[21] While the NDP does talk about some improvements under the previous government led by Sirisena, the elections of 2019 and 2020 resulted in Gotabaya Rajapaksa as president and his brother Mahinda Rajapaksa as prime minister. The panel notes that sources in the National Documentation Package inform that human rights deteriorated significantly since Rajapaksa was elected president, especially in Tamil areas.[20] The National Documentation Package also talks about the increased crackdown on Tamils during COVID-19. The government used the pandemic to further justify increased surveillance of Tamils in the north.\n\n[22] The documentary evidence shows that the Sri Lankan authorities were concerned about the resurgence of the LTTE or any similar Tamil separatist organisation within Sri Lanka, and, as such, the revival of the civil war. Therefore, the Sri Lankan authorities have been actively engaged in rooting out the LTTE supporters and sympathizers. It is reported that, \u201cthe Tamils in the north and east \u201care under scrutiny in a way in which they were never before\u201d.[21] The arrests of former LTTE combatants have also significantly increased through search operations.[22] The objective evidence also speaks about interrogation of Tamils returning from western countries.\n\n[23] The panel notes that there were recent protests in Sri Lanka which have resulted in the Rajapaksas fleeing the country. However, there is no information before the panel to suggest that the police will no longer target Tamils.\n\n[24] Given the country conditions and considering the claimant\u2019s profile as a Tamil widow, her testimony and the objective documentary evidence, the panel finds that the claimant\u2019s fear of returning to Sri Lanka has an objective basis and that she would continue to face a risk of persecution should she return to Sri Lanka. The panel therefore finds that the claimant has a well-founded fear of persecution in Sri Lanka.\n\nState Protection\n\n[25] States are presumed to be capable of protecting their own citizens, except in situations where the state is in a state of complete breakdown. A claimant is required to approach the state for protection if protection might reasonably be forthcoming or, alternatively, if it is objectively reasonable for the claimant to have sought protection. To rebut the presumption of state protection, a claimant must provide clear and convincing evidence of the state\u2019s inability or unwillingness to protect its citizens.\n\n[26] The panel finds on a balance of probabilities that adequate state protection would not be available to the claimant in Sri Lanka. In this case, the agents of persecution are the Sri Lankan authorities, namely the police and the army. When the agents of the state are themselves the sources of one\u2019s persecution, the presumption of state protection may be rebutted without exhausting all avenues of recourse in the country.\n\n[27] The NDP sources further indicate that women do not feel safe in making complaints to authorities about any discrimination, abuse, or violence against them. In most cases it has been law enforcement agencies that have perpetrated the violence.\n\n[28] In light of the objective country documentation as well as the personal circumstances of the claimant, the panel finds that the claimant rebutted the presumption of state protection, and that adequate state protection would not be available to the claimant in Sri Lanka.\n\nInternal Flight Alternative\n\n[29] The panel also considered whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for the claimant. The claimant testified that she would not be able to relocate anywhere in Sri Lanka because the police will find her, and she will still suffer as a Tamil widow from Sri Lanka. She explained that the police will find her, because she must register with the authorities if she relocates. The claimant further stated that it would be very hard for her as a widow, to live alone, considering her age.\n\n[30] The panel notes that the agent of persecution is the police and the army who have targeted her as a widow Tamil woman with children abroad and because of family members being involved with LTTE in the past. The documentary evidence regarding the persecution faced by Tamils is not restricted to any region, although it is most prevalent in the North and East of the country.\n\n[31] Considering the above, the panel finds that there is a serious possibility of persecution for the claimant throughout Sri Lanka, therefore there is no viable internal flight alternative.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[32] Considering the totality of the evidence, the panel finds that the claimant is a Convention refugee on the basis of her Tamil ethnicity, imputed political opinion and membership in a particular social group, that of Sri Lankan Tamil widowed women.\n\n[33] The panel therefore accepts her claim.\n\n(signed) Luljeta Caraoshi\n\nDecember 11, 2023\n\n[1] Chairpersons Guideline 4 at https:\/\/irb.gc.ca\/en\/legal-policy\/policies\/Pages\/GuideDir04.aspx, effective on July 18, 2022 and amended on October 31, 2023.\n\n[2] Exhibit 2.\n\n[3] Exhibit 1.\n\n[4] Maldonado v Canada (MEI), [1980] 2 FC 302 (CA) at 305.\n\n[5] Gill v Canada (MCI), 2004 FC 1498 at para 25.\n\n[6] Orelien v Canada (MEI), [1992] 1 FC 592 (CA); (1991), 15 Imm LR (2d) 1 (FCA).\n\n[7] Dan-Ash v Canada (MEI), [1988] 93 NR 33 (FCA).\n\n[8] Zheng v Canada (MCI), 2007 FC 673 at para 17, citing Aguebor v Canada (MEI), [1993] FCJ No 732 (FCA) (QL).\n\n[9] Exhibit 3.

Kadiri\nCountry: Israel\nRPD Number: TC2-10689\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2023-01721\nATIP Pages: N\/A\n\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n\n[1] These are the reasons for the decision in the refugee claim of XXXX XXXX.\n\nALLEGATIONS\n\n[2] The details of the claim can be found in the claimant\u2019s Basis of Claim (BOC) form and narrative.[1] In short, the claimant fears persecution from various parties, including the Israeli state and society as a divorced older Arab woman with XXXX XXXX.\n\nDETERMINATION\n\n[3] The panel finds that the claimant is a Convention refugee under s.96 of IRPA as she faces a serious risk of persecution in Israel based on the intersection of her age, gender and nationality as an older Arab\/Palestinian female citizen of Israel.\n\nIDENTITY\n\n[4] The claimant\u2019s national identity as an Israeli citizen has been established on a balance of probabilities by her Israeli passport. Her identity as Arab has been established, on a balance of probabilities, by her name as well as her testimony about her ethnicity, in Arabic, before the board.\n\nPROCEDURAL ISSUES\n\n[5] At the second sitting of the hearing, counsel provided a detailed XXXX report from XXXX identifying symptoms of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.[2] At this time, a report from Israel was also presented confirming that the claimant had been hospitalized for XXXX XXXX in 2020 for \u201cXXXX XXXX.\u201d[3] After speaking to the claimant briefly and reading through the reports, the panel designated her a Vulnerable Person and a Designated Representative was appointed to ensure the claimant\u2019s best interests were protected. The hearing was adjourned to a third sitting as it was clear that the claimant was not XXXX XXXX on that day.\n\nCREDIBILITY\n\n[6] There is a rebuttable presumption that a claimant\u2019s sworn testimony is truthful and a claimant bears the burden of establishing their claim. The panel is mindful of the difficulties faced by claimants in establishing a claim, including cultural factors and the stress inherent in the hearing room. During the hearing, the panel rephrased questions, offered breaks and even adjourned a sitting as necessary. As previously noted, the claimant is a Vulnerable Person with multiple XXXX XXXX difficulties. The XXXX report states, \u201cit is difficult to distinguish if these are XXXX symptoms or not, or maybe related to her past trauma.\u201d[4] The panel agrees with this assessment made by an experienced XXXX and also finds it difficult to distinguish between the claimant\u2019s XXXX and trauma, on a balance of probabilities. As such, the panel finds that it is impossible to assess the claimant\u2019s allegations of being attacked by multiple men trying to throw her out of the house. The claimant\u2019s credibility with respect to these incidents is inconclusive.\n\n[7] However, the panel did find the claimant\u2019s testimony about growing up in a segregated Arab community with chronically underfunded facilities, such as hospitals and schools, to be credible. Based on this testimony as well as the country conditions, the panel finds that the claimant still faces risk in Israel, based on her residual profile as a divorced older Arab\/Palestinian woman with significant XXXX XXXX difficulties. The panel accepts on, a balance of probabilities, that Ms. XXXX will face discrimination amounting to persecution in Israel based on the intersection of her age, gender and Arab ethnicity.\n\nNEXUS\n\n[8] The panel has assessed this claim under s.96 as it finds a link between the claimant\u2019s fear of persecution and multiple Convention grounds including race\/nationality and member of a particular social group as she faces a serious risk of persecution in Israel due to being a XXXX XXXX divorced woman of Palestinian Arab ethnicity.\n\nOBJECTIVE BASIS: DISCRIMINATION VS PERSECUTION\n\n[9] In Ward, the Supreme Court held that persecution is the \u201csustained or systemic violation of basic human rights demonstrative of a failure of state protection.\u201d[5] The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) indicates in its Handbook that discrimination rises to persecution where there are a number of discriminatory acts substantially prejudicial to the person concerned, which take place in a general atmosphere of insecurity, and which result in a feeling of apprehension and insecurity with regard to the future existence of the person concerned.[6] In determining whether the claimants face a serious possibility of persecution upon return to Israel, the panel is guided by a RAD decision, identified as a Reason of Interest.[7] This decision contextualizes persecution within the following human rights framework:\n\n[8] \u2026 This test must be understood within the context set out by Hathaway, who explains that the assessment of persecution must be done in the context of human rights law. This human rights based approach to assessing persecution is not intended to be hierarchical or categorical but rather flexible and fluid allowing for decision-makers to \u201ctake account of the cumulative human rights impact of the various harms alleged in order to arrive at a synthesized assessment of the \u2018totality of the claim.\u2019\u201d[8]\n\n[10] As per these Reasons, the panel must consider the situation in the country and whether the government is creating an atmosphere of intolerance; the consequences of the discrimination, including whether there are impacts on an ability to access education, healthcare, and jobs, which lead to an insecure future existence; the personal circumstances of the claimants and their vulnerabilities, including age, health, finances, and gender; and the cumulative nature of the discrimination and whether it rises to persecution.[9] Upon applying this framework of analysis in the context of the claimant\u2019s particular circumstances and the country condition evidence, as set out below, the panel finds that she has established a forward-facing serious possibility of persecution.\n\n[11] As well, the panel notes the claimant\u2019s testimony on lack of appropriate infrastructure in Arab neighbourhoods, including improper educational, recreational and healthcare facilities. As these facilities are lacking primarily in Palestinian towns of Israel, the panel finds that the poor educational and medical infrastructure discriminates against Palestinians in Israel. The claimant also testified that she did not go anywhere in Israel in order to avoid checkpoints. It is well-established in the jurisprudence that persecution may be caused by discriminatory acts that are sufficiently serious and occur over such a long period of time that it can be said that the claimants\u2019 physical or moral integrity is threatened. The panel has considered the social exclusion of the claimant as a divorced Arab woman in Israel, her XXXX XXXX without easy access to medical facilities, as well as the deep psychological impact of witnessing violence against the Arab community and finds that cumulatively, the human rights impact of all these harms amounts to persecution.\n\n[12] The objective evidence supports the claimants\u2019 forward-looking fear of discrimination rising to persecution for Arabs in Israel. According to Amnesty International, Israel continued to discriminate against Palestinian citizens of Israel in areas of planning, budget allocation, policing and political participation.[10] This report confirms that Israel maintains over 65 laws that discriminate against Palestinians. In August, two NGOs filed a petition to the Israeli Supreme Court on behalf of 10 local Palestinian councils and dozens of Palestinian citizens of Israel against government policy discriminating against these communities in the distribution of housing, construction and land development benefits compared to neighbouring Jewish communities that enjoy higher socio- economic status and have access to such benefits.[11]\n\n[13] In December, the magistrate court in Krayot, near Haifa, rejected a petition for access to education by Palestinian citizens of Israel living in Karmiel, citing the discriminatory Nation State Law. The decision said that establishing an Arabic school in the town or funding transport for its Palestinian residents to study in Arabic schools in nearby communities would undermine the town\u2019s \u201cJewish character.\u201d[12]\n\n[14] Amnesty International also reports Israeli soldiers, police and ISA officers continued to torture and otherwise ill-treat Palestinian detainees, including children, with impunity. Reported methods included beating, slapping, painful shackling, sleep deprivation, use of stress positions and threats of violence against family members[13]. Human Rights Watch also confirms that Israeli authorities in 2020 systematically repressed and discriminated against Palestinians in ways that far exceeded the security justifications they often provided.[14] Israeli forces routinely turn away or humiliate and delay Palestinians at checkpoints without explanation.[15]\n\n[15] Another Human Rights Watch report explains, \u201cThe Israeli government\u2019s policy of boxing in Palestinian communities extends beyond the West Bank and Gaza to Palestinian towns and villages inside Israel,(\u2026) The policy discriminates against Palestinian citizens of Israel and in favor of Jewish citizens, sharply restricting Palestinians\u2019 access to land for housing to accommodate natural population growth.\u201d[16] Reports also state that Palestinian members of the Knesset (MKs) are facing increasing threats to their freedom of expression. These threats are of concern in and of themselves but also reflect the wider situation in Israel in which the space for voices critical of the Israeli government\u2019s treatment of Palestinians has shrunk and discrimination against Palestinian citizens has been entrenched.[17] As well, the panel has considered the country conditions evidence submitted by counsel which further confirms the extreme discrimination and violence faced by Palestinian citizens of Israel, which has escalated in recent months.[18]\n\n[16] Having considered the country conditions and the claimant\u2019s personal circumstances, the panel finds that the Israeli government is nurturing intolerance against its Palestinian citizens, that cumulative anti-Arab discrimination seriously affects the claimant\u2019s human rights and results in a feeling of insecurity regarding her future, thus amounting to a serious possibility of persecution.\n\nSTATE PROTECTION\n\n[17] Given that the Israeli society and state is the primary agent of persecution, the panel finds that no adequate state protection will be extended to the claimant upon return to Israel.\n\nINTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE\n\n[18] Given that the agent of persecution is the Israeli state, the panel finds there is no safe and viable IFA for the claimant as a Palestinian citizens of Israel, as the discrimination against Arabs exists through out the country and the Israeli government has effective control over all its territory.[19] The claimant faces a serious possibility of persecution in all parts of Israel.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[19] The panel finds that the claimant is a Convention refugee under s.96 and accepts her claim.\n\n(signed) Aurina Chatterji\n\nJune 5, 2023\n\n[1] Exhibits 2\n\n[2] Exhibit 7\n\n[3] Exhibit 8\n\n[4] Exhibit 7\n\n[5] Canada (AG) v.

Gilbert\nCountry: Slovakia\nRPD Number: TC2-09599\nAssociated RPD Number(s): TC2-09601, TC2-12778\nATIP Number: A-2023-01721\nATIP Pages: N\/A\n\nDECISION\n\n[1] MEMBER: This is the decision of XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX, File Numbers TC2-09599, TC2-09601, and TC2-12778. I have considered the testimony and other evidence presented. All claimants have alleged persecution based on their Roma nationality. The claimant, XXXX XXXX, was declared a vulnerable person under Chairperson\u2019s guideline 8 on account of him being XXXX XXXX XXXX, and later, evidence was put forward to further support this designation at Exhibit 7, noting that in addition to this, he suffers from some form of XXXX XXXX. Elainea and Javeria, if you could interpret the following, and Nikole, if you could let Mr. XXXX know to turn the camera to his father? Mr. XXXX, I just want to note on the record that special accommodations were made for you to be able to participate and follow today\u2019s hearing and I want to thank you for participating in the hearing, and your testimony today was sincere and impactful. And the Board thanks you for sharing your story. Thank you. Nikole, you can let them know we are finished. And Elainea, that is it to you and Javeria. Thank you.\n\n[2] INTERPRETER 3: Do you want us to stay on or should we log out?\n\n[3] MEMBER: No, no. Everyone has to stay till the end.\n\n[4] INTERPRETER 3: Oh! We stay. Stay.\n\n[5] MEMBER: This will be a good decision transcript.\n\nDETERMINATION\n\n[6] I have determined that you are all Convention refugees for the following reasons.\n\nALLEGATIONS\n\n[7] You are citizens of Slovakia. You alleged, if you return, you will be harmed by the Slovak state and Slovak nationals on account of your Roma nationality. You alleged there is no state protection or Internal Flight Alternative available to you.\n\nIdentity\n\n[8] You all confirmed your identities with your Slovak passports.\n\nNexus\n\n[9] There is a link between this claim and the Convention ground of nationality. Therefore, I have assessed it under section 96.\n\nCredibility\n\n[10] I found you all to be credible witnesses. Your testimony was clear and consistent with the written narrative and evidence on file. In addition to this consistent testimony, I also want to note all your testimony came across as sincere and it is very clear from the way and the manner in which you spoke that all of you are bothered and upset and hurt to the core by the experiences you endured in Slovakia. You all established your Roma nationality. You spoke about your Roma appearances, your Roma accents, being raised in the Roma tradition and Roma cultures and you were able to provide some information on what those cultures and traditions were. In addition, you supported your Roma nationality with a letter at Exhibit 5.2 from the XXXX XXXX XXXX here in Toronto.\n\n[11] In addition to establishing your nationality, you established that you faced discrimination amounting to persecution on account of your nationality. Each of you spoke in varying degrees of detail about lifelong discrimination, mistreatment, and marginalisation on account of your Roma nationality. You spoke about issues related to housing, education, health care, and employment. You were relegated to living in Roma settlements that lacked basic amenities including clean water and reliable electricity. In the case of Mr. XXXX and Ms. XXXX, both of you were placed in schools meant for children with disabilities against yours and your family\u2019s will. This created the early point and the early foundation of discrimination and mistreatment that was built upon through each stage of your lives by the Slovak state and the communities that lived around you. You discussed mistreatment in healthcare. You discussed mistreatment in basic living when trying to go out and buy basic goods, of not being allowed into stores, of being fearful to walk in the city centre, and in the case of Mr. XXXX, of his not going alone to the city centre on account of fears of what might happen to him by his fears articulated by his son today, Mr. XXXX.\n\n[12] In addition to this treatment, this discrimination amounting to persecution, you established that you are also attacked and targeted physically and verbally because of your Roma nationality and that the police did not help you. Mr. XXXX spoke of constantly being insulted, and I want to pause and note here that the insults and mistreatment he spoke about today were not only on account of his skin color, which, in the manner in which he testified, was meant to signify his Roma nationality, but also on account of his disability, being XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX. Also, Mr. XXXX and Ms. XXXX established being called different names, being looked at differently, and in the case of Mr. XXXX and Mr. XXXX, of being violently attacked in the city centre and not being able to obtain help from police. You spoke about skinheads marching through your neighbourhood annually and calling the police while you were barricaded and locked in your homes and the police not coming to help you.\n\n[12] You supported your testimony today with evidence at Exhibits 5.2 through 5.4 that not only establish your Roma heritage, but also are meant to establish the difficulties you faced in Slovakia, specifically the evidence at Exhibit 5.4, which notes your inability to acquire some of the documents you had wanted to establish elements of your upbringing. Therefore, I find on a balance of probabilities that you are all credible. You established your Roma nationality and you established you were targeted because of it. Your subjective fear has been established.\n\nPersecution\n\n[13] Objective country evidence supports your claims. Roma in Slovakia face discrimination amounting to persecution. Roma persons in Slovakia face violence, threats of violence, intimidation and harassment. This includes actions by the police and violence and harassment from the police, and when not from the police directly, the police do not on the majority of occasions hold perpetrators accountable for targeting and mistreating the Roma. There is also institutionalised discrimination by parliament and overt attempts to rebuff the raising of awareness of the situation of Roma in Slovakia. Specifically, recently, parliamentarians in Slovakia objected to a report by the country\u2019s ombudsperson that was meant to highlight the precarious situation Roma communities in Slovakia face. Roma in Slovakia face discrimination in all facets of their life including housing, education, work, healthcare, and the provision of social services and this was reflected in your personal experiences noted in the section above.\n\n[14] I want to give just one example, one (1) statistic that I think highlights the situation and how dire it is, and that is that the life expectancy for Slovakia\u2019s Roma is just under seven (7) years less than the rest of the population. The result of all of this is that Roma in Slovakia find themselves marginalised and vulnerable. Some examples, as already discussed but further elaborated on, include the illegal sterilisation of women without their consent, the relegation of Roma households to substandard living and housing, enrolling children in special schools, which I noted sows the seeds of discrimination and marginalisation from a young age, ensuring that each new generation finds itself once again relegated to the margins. And here, I want to note that there have been some efforts to address the situation of schooling. But even where courts have ordered certain schools to desegregate and educate Roma and non-Roma students together, those court rulings have not been adhered to. I note the evidence in the National Documentation Package also notes that the situation is grim for persons with disabilities, such as Mr. XXXX. They face similar challenges, though not necessarily as dire or precarious as Roma do. And despite legislation meant to prohibit discrimination based on various factors including disability, many disabled persons in Slovakia find themselves facing discrimination. These findings rely on NDP Items 2.1, 13.2, 13.4, 13.9 and 13.14. Your country evidence at Exhibit 6 further supports these findings.\n\n[15] You provided a large number of articles that document the mistreatment, violence, and lack of accountability for violence directed at Roma people in Slovakia, and I note that the time periods of many of the articles you provided stretch back to over a decade showing that, over the past several years, the situation has not improved and that what was happening even before some efforts in Slovakia such as those by the ombudsperson to raise awareness and improve the situation of the Roma. Despite those efforts, things have remained the same and not much has changed. Therefore, based on the totality of the evidence, I find on a balance of probabilities your fear has an objective basis and is well-founded.\n\nState Protection\n\n[16] I find state protection would not be available to you. Slovakia is acting as the agent of persecution, and when it does not act as an agent of persecution itself, it has demonstrated it is unable or unwilling to provide protection to Roma citizens from those who target them. On a balance of probabilities, the presumption of state protection is rebutted in this case.\n\nInternal Flight Alternative\n\n[17] There is no viable IFA for you in Slovakia. You face a serious possibility of persecution in all of Slovakia. Therefore, I find on a balance of probabilities there is no IFA in Slovakia.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[18] For all the reasons above and based on the totality of the evidence, I find you all to be Convention refugees. You have a well-founded fear of persecution based on your Roma nationality. Your claims are accepted.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

So, this is the decision for XXXX XXXX XXXX, as well as XXXX XXXX XXXX, and your children, XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX, and that is file number TC2-00446. You all claim refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration, Refugee Protection Act. I have heard your claim together, and Mr. XXXX has been appointed as the designated representative for the minor claimants, and this is all required by the RPD rules. I have also considered and applied the gender guidelines in coming to this decision today.\n\nDETERMINATION\n\n[2] I find that you are all Convention refugees for the following reasons.\n\nALLEGATIONS\n\n[3] You allege the following in your Basis of Claim forms, which are found in Exhibits 2.1 through 2.4 and the addendum made in Exhibit 5, and there were a few slight amendments also made at the start of the hearing today. You allege that you are all citizens of Israel, and you allege a fear of persecution at the hands of the state itself as well as society generally because you are Palestinian Arabs and Muslims. You allege that there is no state protection nor an internal flight alternative available to you.\n\nIdentity\n\n[4] Your personal identities and Israeli nationalities have been established on a balance of probabilities through your testimony and the documents that you provided, and these are all in Exhibits 1 and 6. These documents include copies of your passports, your birth certificates, the principal claimant\u2019s driver\u2019s licence, and the adult claimants\u2019 marriage certificate.\n\n[5] I also asked some questions surrounding the Jordanian document that you provided for your father as well as his marriage certificate. I asked you some questions to assess whether he had citizenship there. However, you explained that this was simply a travel document and not an actual passport which grants citizenship. And I am mindful of Item 3.8 of the Jordan NDP, which is actually Item 3.3 of the list of documents, and this indicates that Jordanian documents which do not contain that national identity number are not actually documents that grant citizenship. So, I find that you have established that your father does not have Jordanian citizenship, and therefore, this is not a potential country of reference for you.\n\nNexus\n\n[6] I find that there is a nexus between the harms that you fear and the Convention grounds, and that is race and nationality or even religion. Therefore, I have assessed your claim pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA, and I find that you have met the test under that section.\n\nCredibility\n\n[7] So, your testimonies today have been entirely consistent, straightforward with your evidence, and you were able to provide clear and spontaneous detailed testimony in regards to your allegations. There were no major contradictions or omissions that would go to the heart of the claim, and therefore, I find that you are both credible witnesses, and I believe what you have alleged in support of your claim.\n\n[8] You have also provided a number of documents, and these are all in Exhibit 6. I found that these documents are probative and that they relate to the core aspects of your claim. And so, I have placed great weight on them in establishing your claims. Essentially, these include personal identity documents, such as the ones I have already listed, which all show for the principal claimant that you were born in the West Bank and that you are all Arab and you are Muslim. You have also provided family and relative documents confirming that both of your families originate from the West Bank. You provided educational documents confirming your education in the West Bank as well as in Israel. You have also provided various documents demonstrating the difficulty that your family has faced in obtaining Israeli citizenship. You have provided a letter of support, as well as copies of United States asylum documentation for the principal claimant\u2019s brother, and he confirms that he faced similar issues to you and your family in Israel and that is why he also left Israel and that he was actually granted protection in the United States on similar grounds. And you have also provided other letters of support from your family and relatives, colleagues, and friends, all confirming your allegations.\n\n[9] Specifically, I find that you have established on a balance of probabilities that you are all Palestinian Arabs and Muslim citizens of Israel, and as a result of this profile, you faced many issues in Israel as well as travelling between the West Bank and Israel in your earlier years. I will not go into the details of all of these incidents individually, but essentially, you faced discrimination, harassment, and violence in crossing through checkpoints, in obtaining and maintaining employment, in your quality of education and choice of professions, in accessing health and government services, and also just within society generally. Additionally, for the principal male claimant, you also faced physical violence and arbitrary detention simply for participating in protests in Israel.\n\n[10] I did have some concerns as to why you did not leave Israel sooner to come either to Canada or elsewhere to claim protection, and why you did not claim on your previous trips to other countries between 2011 and 2019, and why you actually returned to Israel, which is a country where you fear for your lives. However, you explained that you were not ready to leave, you did not actually want to leave your homes, you were hopeful that things would get better in the country. You also explained that it is not an easy choice to make, to leave everything behind. The turning point for you was the treatment for the principal claimant that you faced at the hands of authorities in XXXX of 2021 and also the incident of discrimination where your paramedic services were refused simply because you were Arab or Muslim. And I find these all to be reasonable explanations, especially in your claims, where it is a case of discrimination amounting to persecution.\n\n[11] So, on the whole, I find that you have established a subjective fear, and I believe what you have alleged on a balance of probabilities.\n\nObjective Basis\n\n[12] So, I find that your fear in Israel is supported by the objective documents contained in the National Documentation Package. In this regard, I am also mindful of the case law and the guidance from the UNHCR Handbook, which outlines the procedures or ways of dealing with cases involving discrimination amounting to persecution. I will not go into the details of that law, but simply, I find that the circumstances that you face demonstrate that you do face discrimination amounting to persecution in Israel.\n\n[13] So, the evidence contained in the NDP indicates that Arab citizens of Israel are subject to institutional discrimination. Specifically, Item 3.11 indicates that Palestinian citizens of Israel, who make up more than 20 percent of the population, continue to experience marginalization in a range of areas, including housing, access to services and employment, and also social prejudice and official discrimination. The item further indicates that Israel has continued to adopt legislation curtailing the rights of Palestinian Israelis, who are subject to wide-ranging discrimination in housing, social welfare, education, criminal justice, and other areas of their lives.\n\n[14] Item 3.5 further indicates that Palestinians have long suffered human rights violations at the hands of Israeli authorities. Defined legally and acting practically as a Jewish state, Israel places its approximately 1.5 million Palestinian Arab citizens \u2014 again, that is 20 percent of the population \u2014 under a system of discrimination and exclusion. The legal and political system creates a hierarchal citizenry that privileges Jews over others in Israel, and most notably, structural discrimination against the Palestinian citizens of Israel appears in the area of land and housing rights.\n\n[15] Furthermore, the state of Israel implements laws and policies that have a persecutory effect on Arab citizens. Item 13.9 indicates that the state\u2019s ethnically based self-definition, coupled with the basic laws, have led to the enactment of further laws that grant privileges and powers to the Jewish majority in Israel in various spheres. These fields include control over land, and discrimination in land planning and construction, demographic control, and discrimination in citizenship and residency, discrimination in the realm of civil, political, economic, and social rights, and cultural dominance. The item further describes the state effort to limit political participation by Arab citizens and openly racist remarks by Israeli politicians.\n\n[16] I will also note that Item 2.1 specifically indicates that among the significant human rights abuses in Israel, includes that authorities are responsible for arbitrary or unjust detention, including of Palestinians in Israel and the occupied territories, restriction on Palestinians residing in Jerusalem, including arbitrary or unlawful interference with privacy, family, and home, and violence or threats against Palestinians and member of national, racial, or ethnic minority groups, and as well as labour rights abuses against foreign workers and Palestinian workers. Moreover, regarding the treatment that the male claimant received as a result of his participation in the protest, I also note that the same document indicates that Israeli authorities have arbitrarily arrested both Israeli and Palestinian citizens who participate in protests. And again, all of this is further corroborated by your own country condition documents, and that is found in Exhibit 7.\n\n[17] So, based on all of the evidence before me, I find that you have established a subjective fear and objective basis for that fear and, therefore, a well-founded fear of persecution.\n\nState Protection\n\n[18] So, I have turned my mind towards this issue. However, given that it is the state itself that is among your primary agents of persecution and, as well, considering that the NDP indicates that there is discrimination and lack of protection for Arab-Israelis, and that is at items such as 13.11 and 2.1, I find that you cannot expect adequate state protection in Israel on a balance of probabilities.\n\nInternal Flight Alternative\n\n[19] Again, because your agent of persecution is the state itself, I find that there is no safe and viable internal flight alternative available to you as Palestinian citizens of Israel, essentially considering that the discrimination against Arabs and Muslims exists throughout the entire country and the Israeli government has effective control over all of its territory, and this is corroborated by various items in the NDP, but I will reference specifically Item 2.1. So, for these reasons, I find that you do not have a viable internal flight alternative available to you in Israel on a balance of probabilities.\n\n[20] Based on all of the evidence before me, I find that you are all Convention refugees, and I accept all of your claims, and I do wish you the best of luck here in Canada.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

The file number is TC1-12808.\n\n[2] This is a decision rendered after the hearing in the absence of the parties by dictation using MS Teams. The transcript of this decision may be edited before it is signed.\n\n[3] You claim to be a citizen of Israel of Arab origin, and you are seeking refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n\n[4] My determination is, I find that you are a person in need of protection, for the reason that you have established on a balance of probabilities that you face a personalized risk of harm and risk to your life in Israel.\n\n[5] In summary, the allegations in this matter as follows. You are currently 20 years of age, having come to Canada when you were 18-year-old in XXXX 2020. In your Basis of Claim and narrative you allege you face a personalized risk to your life from your neighbours in Jaffa, Israel, and persons associated with them connected to their ongoing feud with your cousins.\n\n[6] Specifically, you allege that you and your family members have been targeted since late XXXX 2019, when exchanges of violence erupted between your family represented by two (2) of your cousins who lived in the house next door to your family home, and other families, which was touched off by the murder of a man named SD (ph). In early 2020, problems escalated, and SD\u2019s family and their numerous allies vowed to kill all of your cousins\u2019 relatives. This led to you being chased by a car while you were out XXXX XXXX in XXXX 2020.You were injured in the subsequent motor vehicle accident during this incident when you were hit by another vehicle. Thereafter you fled to a relative\u2019s home in XXXX Israel for five (5) months, essentially living in hiding with your aunt. During this day you were sent a death threat on social media vowing to kill you, no matter where in the country you might try to hide.\n\n[7] While you returned to your home in Jaffa in XXXX 2020, to visit your mother and sister, you witnessed the murder of your cousin in a drive-by shooting in XXXX 2020, while he was standing on the porch of your home. After receiving more threatening messages indicating that you too soon would be killed, in XXXX 2020, you fled to the United States before coming to Canada and claiming refugee protection in March 2021.\n\n[8] Concerning Identity.\n\n[9] I find you have established your identity as a citizen of Israel through the copy of your Israeli passport, and generally credible testimony, and the supporting documentation, including your birth certificate which has been entered into evidence at our hearing.\n\n[10] On the matter of credibility.\n\n[11] I find you to be a generally credible witness. And overall, I believe what you have alleged and testified to in support of your claim. You testified in a straightforward detailed, unhesitant, and responsive manner to the wide-ranging questions I asked you during the hearing. You detailed your circumstances in Israel, particularly, the nature of your family relationships, your residence next door to your cousins, and how the family dispute with the enemies of your cousins poses an ongoing threat to your life, and the lives of your immediate and extended family members. You\u2019ve also credibly outlined that since your departure from Israel your remaining immediate family members including your mother, father, and sister, have all left the country fearing for their lives because of this feud.\n\n[12] There were no material inconsistencies in your testimony or contradictions between your testimony and your written materials which you did not satisfactorily explain, including the issues about your delay in claiming, and why you did not seek refugee protection in the United States. You\u2019ve provided relevant documentary evidence to support your claim including; identity documents; documents connected the vehicular assault on you in XXXX 2020, and the injuries which resulted; your medical records confirming these injuries; photographs of these injuries; proof of your cousin XXXX\u2019s death, and the media reports of his killing, and a corroborating statement of the events from your father.\n\n[13] Having considered the totality of evidence before me, I find the information you have presented in your testimony, and your documentary evidence to be credible, overall, on a balance of probabilities.\n\nPersonalized Risk to Your Life.\n\n[14] To find you\u2019ve credibly established a personalized risk to your life in Israel, and therefore that you are a person in need of protection, for the purposes of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, I have to find there is an objective basis for your fear and that you are being personally targeted. In other words, you must clearly establish the perpetrators you fear have personally targeted you, and that the risk you face to your life in Israel is not simply a generalized risk faced by the population, for example, as a result of conflict or high crime rates in the area where you live. For the reason described below, I find your actions are consistent with those of a person who has been personally targeted, harmed, and who therefore faces a forward-looking risk of personalized harm, including a risk to your life if you return to Israel.\n\nObjective Basis\n\n[15] Information in the country condition documentation including the NDP for Israel, as well as the country documents provided by your counsel, are consistent with your allegations that you face a personalized risk to your life if you return there. The country condition documents provided contain extensive evidence of high levels of crime and violence, within and involving Arab Palestinian communities in Israel. Item 2.1 at page 60.\n\n[16] Further these objective sources describe that these problems persist because of low levels of police engagement and enforcement of crime. In this regard you\u2019ve credibly described that you are situated in a community where you and your family have been targeted for death, by an alliance of rival families who vowed revenge against your cousins and their relatives. Particularly, and so far, as they live beside you. These enemies have demonstrated their motivation to harm and kill you and they have shown their ability to carry out such lethal harm by murdering your cousin XXXX in your presence in XXXX 2020.\n\n[17] Multiple Items from the NDP for Israel, speak to the prevailing violence in communities of Arab origin within the country including Item 1.8, 2.1, 2.13 and 10.1.\n\n[18] Also, Item 2.1, which is the annual United States Department of State report, records that young Arab men in Israel are reported to face allegations of arbitrary arrest, institutional and social discrimination, and high levels of crime and violence related to low levels of policing. Other objective documents provided by your counsel indicate in the fact that police and the State in Israel, generally fail to intervene to protect Israelis of Arab origin despite high rates of violence in those communities.\n\n[19] Overall, the country condition report before me, clearly indicates violence is a serious problem in communities of predominantly Arab origin within Israel, and despite significantly higher rates of crime; significantly fewer state resources have been allocated to address these issues. This leaves perpetrators such as your neighbours who now target you and your family to act with virtual impunity. With these factors in mind, I find you\u2019ve established a credible fear for your life in Israel.\n\n[20] Given the totality of evidence before me, I therefore conclude you would face a personalized risk to your life if you return there.\n\n[21] On the matter if state protection.\n\n[22] You\u2019ve given evidence that you are unable to access adequate state protection in Israel to deal with the situation you face. States are presumed to be capable of protecting their own citizens, except in situations where there is a complete breakdown of the State itself. To rebut this presumption of state protection a claimant must provide clear and convincing evidence of the State\u2019s inability or unwillingness to protect them on a balance of probabilities.\n\n[23] Based on all the evidence before me, and for the reasons set out below, I find on a balance of probabilities that Israel is unwilling and\/or unable to adequately protect you if you return there.\n\n[24] Freedom House in Item 2.4 of the NDP for Israel, in an article entitled: Freedom in the World 2021, documents at page 14 and 15, that citizens of Arab origin account for the vast majority of murder victims in the country just by being only 1\/ 5th of the population. Freedom House comments that despite high incidents of murder victims of Arab origin \u201cPolice are far less likely to solve murders with Arabs as opposed to Jewish victims.\u201d\n\n[25] Item 2.1 of the NDP, documents that Israeli citizens of Muslim origin face persistent institutional, and societal discrimination, with their communities being plagued by high levels of crime and violence especially due to organized criminals.\n\n[26] In a June 2021 report included at Item 10.2 of the NDP for Israel, Amnesty International decries the lack of protection provided to Israeli citizens of Palestinian origin, noting that wholesale failure in the country to protect Palestinians from even premeditated attacks. In concert with these reports the objective documentation before me, also indicates a discrepancy in the access to police and\/or other state protection at resources between Arabs and Jews in Israel. While some efforts are apparently underway to address these discrepancies, reported efforts to improve policing in Arab areas in Israel, according to the NDP, have not been effectively implemented at present.\n\n[27] Therefore, I find that there is a little barrier between you and the personalized threats to your life that you face from your neighbours, who have repeatedly threatened to kill you and your family members and have shown the ability to do so with the murder of your cousin XXXX in XXXX 2020.\n\n[28] I have no evidence before me to show that your agents of persecution were held to account for this homicide, or other violent threats to you and your family. For all these reasons, I find you\u2019ve presented sufficient clear and convincing evidence to rebut the presumption of state protection on a balance of probabilities.\n\nInternal Flight Alternative\n\n[2] I\u2019ve also had to consider whether you have an internal flight alternative within Israel, i.e., whether you can safely and reasonably relocate within your country of citizenship. At the hearing, new location in XXXX where your aunt lives, was proposed as an internal flight alternative. You described successfully relocating to your aunt\u2019s home in XXXX for five (5) months, after the vehicle attack on you. You\u2019ve outlined that this relocation was only temporary, and it is not sustainable.\n\n[30] Further, given the small size of the country, you testified that you believe that people looking for your family members will eventually find you there. You described that you deliberately kept a low profile during this stay to avoid trouble.\n\n[31] On all the evidence, I find you have no viable internal flight alternative within Israel. As you pointed out Israel is a small country physically, and Jaffa is only about a 90-minute drive from your aunt\u2019s home in XXXX. Aside from the possibility of being found by your agents of persecution, I find it is not reasonable for you to relocate to XXXX. You\u2019re a young man from a Muslim minority in Israel with a XXXX XXXX education, the only family you have remaining in Israel, is located outside of Jaffa is your elderly widowed aunt. While you might draw on family support in Jaffa to sustain your relocation, your immediate family members have now all fled the country, leaving you with your extended family members, whom you\u2019ve already testified are being targeted themselves by your agents of persecution, and whose illegal activities cannot provide you reliable assistance in relocating safely.\n\n[32] As such, I conclude on a balance of probabilities, you have no viable internal flight alternative in Israel.\n\n[33] In Conclusion.\n\n[34] For all the reasons above, I find you have established you are a person in need of protection with the (inaudible) of section 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. And I therefore accept your claim.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

You allege that you are a stateless Palestinian and you allege a fear of persecution in Gaza in the occupied Palestinian territories at the hands of Hamas because of your refusal to join them.\n\nIdentity\n\n[4] You have established both that you are stateless and also your personal identity, and that is through your testimony and the documents that you provided, and that namely includes copies of your Palestinian authority passport and copies of your Saudi Arabian residency card, and that is found in Exhibit 1.\n\nCountries of Former Habitual Residence\n\n[5] So, according to the Federal Court of Appeal in Thabet, in order to be found a Convention refugee, a person \u2014 sorry \u2014 a stateless person must show on a balance of probabilities that they would suffer persecution in any country of former habitual residence, and that they cannot return to any of those other countries of former habitual residence.\n\n[6] In your case, you were born and lived much of your life in Saudi Arabia. You have also lived in Gaza, in the occupied Palestinian territory from around 1990 until 2000, and you were also in the United States from 2016 until coming to Canada in 2019. Though you were there on a student permit, you were ultimately \u2014 you did have the intention to remain there. In consideration of all of the evidence, I find that these three (3) countries are countries of former habitual residence for you.\n\n[7] You have also indicated that you lived in Yemen for some time and that was to complete your \u2014 to enroll in your university studies. You did not have the intention to remain there aside from completing these studies, and therefore, I find that this is not a country of former habitual residence for you.\n\n[8] So, in consideration of this evidence, further to the Thabet principle, I must first consider whether you face a 96 or 97 risk in at least one (1) of those countries, and whether you can return to any of the other countries.\n\nNexus\n\n[9] So, I find that the harm that you fear does have a nexus to the Convention grounds, and that is essentially your membership in a particular social group as a man who does not want to support Hamas and therefore I \u2013 also, your perceived political opinion in that case, and therefore, I have assessed your claim pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA, and I find that you have met the test under that section\n\nCredibility\n\n[10] So, in terms of credibility, I have considered all of the evidence and that does include your medical documentation confirming that you are living with an XXXX XXXX XXXX and other XXXX XXXX which you are being treated for both by medication \u2014 sorry, both by medication, also in person treatment.\n\n[11] In terms of your credibility, your testimony today has been mostly consistent, credible and straightforward with your evidence. You were able to provide clear and detailed testimony in regards to your allegations. There were some issues which I will touch on later, but I find your explanations to these were either reasonable or otherwise, they were insufficient to render your entire claim not credible. And for all of these reasons, I find that generally you were a credible witness.\n\n[12] You have also provided a number of documents in support of your claim, and those are all in Exhibits 4 through 7. These do not only include the identity documents, they have \u2014 some of which I have already touched upon, but also documents confirming your status in Saudi Arabia, Yemen and the United States, and that those statuses were temporary and precarious.\n\n[13] You provided documents confirming your divorce in the United States and copies of the summons issued against yourself, your father and your brothers by the Palestinian authority or Hamas. Specifically, I find on a balance of probabilities that you have established that you are a stateless Palestinian man who lived between Saudi Arabia, Gaza and the United States. You lived in those countries on temporary precarious status.\n\n[14] In terms of the United States, you have indicated that you did not claim protection there because you were on an F1 student visa and you were not permitted to do so, and also, this was during the time of the Trump era and there was a halt on these sorts of claims and I find these explanations to be reasonable and that they do not negate your subjective fear.\n\n[15] In terms of Gaza, I did have some initial concerns considering that you admitted having lived there from all of your Basis of Claim forms. When this was put to you today in the hearing, you explained that you did tell your previous Counsel about this, you were not sure why it was omitted from your Basis of Claim form. I do not find that explanation to be reasonable, considering that you have confirmed a few times that you had the help of an interpreter to read and review your Basis of Claim form before it was signed and submitted, and the onus is on you to present your case.\n\n[16] I have also considered that you have retained new Counsel and I was concerned as to why an amendment was not submitted after retaining new Counsel in regards to this omission. However, you confirmed in testimony today that you only met with your current Counsel two (2) times, and that was shortly before the hearing today. And in light of this and also given your health conditions, I find that this is a reasonable explanation as to why this was not provided in the form of an amendment.\n\n[17] Notwithstanding the submission, I am aware that, of course, your Basis of Claim forms are entirely formed around your fear in Gaza. So, I do not think that this was a total omission in regards to your fears there. In consideration of all the evidence, I do find it strange that you would not indicate this period of residence in your Basis of Claim form. I do not draw any serious negative credibility inferences from this omission. So, I find that you have established that you lived in Gaza for that time between 1990 and around 2000, and you also returned there in 2006, and it was on that trip that you and your father were approached by Hamas. Your lives were threatened if you did not join them. You all left Gaza shortly thereafter and never returned there again.\n\n[18] In 2017, they issued warrants for you to present yourselves in the Palestinian authority, and these were sent to your father in Saudi Arabia, I believe. I also had concerns as to why this is not mentioned in your Basis of Claim form. However, you explained that you did provide the documents themselves and you were planning to indicate this information at the hearing. And though I do not find this to be reasonable explanation, I do not think that this issue alone is to render your whole claim not credible. So, based on all of the evidence before me, I find that you have established a subjective fear on a balance of probabilities.\n\nObjective Basis\n\n[19] So, your fears in the occupied Palestinian territory is supported by the documentary evidence in the National Documentation Package. Specifically, my references will be from Items 2.1 and 14.2 \u2014 14.20. All of these documents are clear that in Gaza, the designated terrorist organization, Hamas, is exercising de facto authority or control. They maintain a large military wing in Gaza, which was formed in 1992. In some instances, Hamas utilised its military wing to crack down on internal dissent, and public sector employees sometimes believe that there was pressure to show loyalty to Hamas and its military wing.\n\n[20] There are reports that members of Hamas security forces committed numerous abuses, and these are all outlined in these documents. And among these significant human rights abuses, it does include credible reports of unlawful and arbitrary killing by Hamas personnel, torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment by Hamas, arbitrary arrest or detention, political prisoners and detainees, unlawful recruitment and the use of child soldiers. Essentially, the evidence is clear that Hamas does recruit and they do not leave any room for anyone to oppose their stance, and anyone who does is responded to with violence. So, based on all of the evidence before me, I find that you have established an objective basis for your fear and therefore a well-founded fear of persecution.\n\nState Protection\n\n[21] So, I have also turned my mind towards this issue, and I find that it is not available to you. Again, Hamas is your agent of persecution. They have de facto control of the Gaza strip. Even generally speaking, the evidence confirms that state protection is nonexistent in the occupied Palestinian territory, and that is given the fragmentation of the region, and for all these reasons, I find that you have rebutted the presumption of state protection and that adequate state protection would not be available to you in your circumstances.\n\nInternal Flight Alternative\n\n[22] So, I have also turned my mind towards this issue, Item such as 13 \u2014 sorry \u2014 3.1 and 2.1 and 14.5, they all indicate that there are severe restrictions on the freedom of movement, internally and externally for Palestinians. Palestinians remain restricted based on a complex system and physical administrative barriers such as checkpoints, roadblocks and a permit system.\n\n[23] Further evidence confirms that freedom of movement between the West Bank and Gaza is nearly non-existent. I am also mindful that it is Gaza which is in control \u2014 sorry \u2014 it is Hamas which has control of Gaza, that is your agent of persecution, and also, I am mindful of the current conditions in Gaza today. For all of these reasons, I find that on a balance of probabilities, you do not have a viable internal flight alternative available to you in the occupied Palestinian territories.\n\n[24] So, for all of these reasons, I find that you have established a forward-facing serious possibility of persecution in the occupied Palestinian territories, and so, now I must consider whether you have the ability to return to your other countries of former habitual residence, which are Saudi Arabia and the United States. Again, you have established that your status there, in both of those countries was temporary and precarious. They have since expired and therefore, I am satisfied that you do not have the right to return to either of those countries. And therefore, for all of the reasons I have already mentioned, I find that you are a Convention refugee. I accept your claim.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

The claimant alleges that upon finishing XXXX in XXXX 2018, he opened his own\nXXXX business in Chihuahua where clients would seek his services for the XXXX. In XXXX 2018 the claimant alleges that he was approached by some men who were carrying weapons to do some XXXX. The claimant abided in fear and alleged that a few days later he was intercepted while out driving his car, told that he must XXXX and work for them or there will be consequences. The claimant alleges that the following week when the cartel came to his business, he XXXX, permanently closed the doors of the business, and moved in with his father. In XXXX of 2019 the claimant was intercepted by members of the cartel when leaving a client\u2019s home, where he was beaten, threatened, and told he should never try to hide or change his phone number again. The claimant alleges that he went with his father to file a complaint with the police but was turned away. The claimant alleges he again changed his phone number in fear and a couple of weeks later got a job at XXXX. The claimant alleges that he was continually informed by his friends that cartel members were asking about him at the restaurants he frequented. In XXXX 2021 the claimant alleges that he received a phone call while at work at XXXX threatening him that they knew where he was, where he worked and lived and that they now had a new task for him which was to transport and camouflage drugs XXXX from the state to the border. The claimant alleges he resigned from XXXX and moved to his friend\u2019s house in Oaxaca and again changed his number.\n\n[3] On XXXX, 2021 the claimant was intercepted by two men while leaving the supermarket, beaten, and threatened with a gun to the head and told he must return to\nand do as he was told, or he would be killed. The claimant in fear left and went to another friend\u2019s home in Mexico City and in XXXX 2022 and alleges he began working at a XXXX company. The claimant further alleges that he requested the company pay him in cash in fear of the cartel finding him. The claimant alleges that on XXXX, 2022 he was informed by some coworkers that the police along with two men had come by and asked for him. The claimant left work, bought a ticket to Canada, got his PCR test and did not leave the house till the early morning hours of XXXX, 2022, where he went directly to the airport in Mexico City and came to Canada.\n\nDETERMINATION\n\n[4] The panel finds that the claimant is a person in need of protection for the reasons outlined below.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nIdentity\n\n[5] The claimant has established his personal and national identity, through his Mexican passport.[2]\n\nDelay\n\n[6] The panel accepts the claimant\u2019s explanation that he was alone, afraid, and unaware of the refugee protection program in Canada and that the language barrier was also a factor that delayed the claimant from applying for refugee protection.\n\nCredibility\n\n[7] When a claimant swears that certain facts are true, this creates a presumption that they are true unless there is a valid reason to doubt their truthfulness.[3]\n\n[8] According to Rule 11, the Refugee Protection Division Rules, the claimant must provide acceptable documentation to establish identities and other elements of their claim. In this case, the claimant did provide sufficient evidence, including photos evidencing the claimant\u2019s work in\nXXXX, proof of employment and letters of support[4]. As such, the panel further finds that the presumption of truthfulness stands, and the claimant is therefore credible.\n\nObjective Basis of Future Risk\n\n[9] Based on the claimant\u2019s credible allegations and the objective documentary evidence, the panel finds that the claimant has established, on a balance of probabilities, that if he returns to Mexico, he will be subjected to a risk of violence at the hands of the agents of harm.\n\n[10] According to the objective evidence, while cartels have fragmented in recent years, it is likely the cartel would still be motivated and capable of locating an individual who is of specific interest.[5] The panel finds that the claimant fits the profile of an individual who would be of \u2018specific interest\u2019 to CJNG cartel given that the claimant was one of the few people in Mexico with the XXXX and the cartel wanted the claimant to assist them with this part of their criminal activities including transporting their drugs XXXX. The panel further finds that the claimant would be in danger of being located and harmed by the agents of harm if he were to return to Mexico.\n\nState Protection\n\n[11] States are presumed to be capable of protecting their citizens except in cases of complete breakdown. Furthermore, Mexico is a democracy where citizens can choose their government through free elections which, generally speaking, fosters an environment where state protection may be available.\n\n[12] Claimants are expected to seek state protection in their home country unless they would put themselves at risk in doing so. In this case, the claimant did go with his father to the police station but was informed that he did not have the evidence needed to file a proper complaint such as names of the individuals who threatened the claimant and was then turned away by the police. The claimant believes the Mexican authorities are corrupt and therefore, would not be able to provide him with protection from the CJNG cartel.\n\n[13] The objective evidence establishes there is a high level of corruption among police forces working with organized criminals, and that municipal and state police have been infiltrated by the cartels.[6] The documentary evidence suggests that when analyzing drug trafficking, organized crime and human rights violations, police of all levels (local, state and federal) are present in the facilitation of illegal businesses, working for organized criminals, and systematically violating human rights.[7] Further, sources indicate that low pay contributes to police corruption and that local police are often particularly vulnerable to corruption or infiltration from organized crime groups because they are overworked, underpaid, and understaffed.[8]\n\n[14] The panel finds that the claimant would not be able to access adequate state protection in Mexico given the rampant corruption within the police and government organizations which are often infiltrated by organized criminals. Therefore, based on the above noted evidence, the panel finds that the presumption of state protection has been rebutted.\n\nInternal Flight Alternative\n\n[15] In determining if the claimant could live safely in another part of Mexico, the panel must consider if the agents of harm would have the means and motivation to pursue the claimant if he were to relocate elsewhere in Mexico.\n\n[16] While the panel acknowledges that Mexico is a large country made up of almost 130 million people[9], after considering all the evidence, the panel finds that the claimant has established, on a balance of probabilities, that the agents of harm have both the motivation and the capacity to locate him throughout Mexico.\n\nMeans of the Agents of Harm\n\n[17] The panel acknowledges that the objective evidence within the National Documentation Package (NDP) of Mexico provides that, in Mexico, if large criminal organizations or cartels have the motivation, then they have the means to locate their victims throughout the whole geographic area of Mexico.[10] Therefore, the panel finds that the CJNG cartel have the means to locate the claimant in the proposed IFA location if motivated to do so.\n\nMotivation of the Agents of Harm\n\n[18] According to the objective evidence, criminal groups are motivated to track certain individuals because they steal or lose money; due to personal rivalries; for political incentives\/reasons or due to personal vengeance; perceived betrayal; public exposure of relationships with public officials, politicians, or investments; or cooperation with authorities as informants or collaborative witnesses.[11]\n\n[19] As previously noted, the panel found that the claimant has established an objective basis of future risk since he fits the profile of and individual who would be of interest to the agents of harm. The objective evidence further establishes that the agents of harm would be motivated to track the claimant and cause him harm should he return to Mexico given his profile as the one of the few people in Mexico with the XXXX and the cartel wanted the claimant to assist them with this part of their criminal activities, including transporting their drugs\n\n[20] For the above reasons the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the perpetrators would pursue and harm the claimant throughout Mexico and, as such, there is no viable internal flight alternative for the claimant.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[21] The panel finds that the claimant is a person in need of protection pursuant to s.97 of the IRPA.\n\n[22] Accordingly, the claim is accepted.\n\n(signed) Tina Androutsos\n\nDecember 6, 2023\n\n[1] Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n\n[2] Exhibit 1\n\n[3] Maldonado v.

The principal claimant was born and raised in the state of Veracruz. In 2011, the principal claimant started working at the XXXX with the help of the XXXX and his wife, whom she met during a XXXX. Her job was to XXXX, which she did wholeheartedly.\n\n[3] ln 2017. She was invited to be a part of the XXXX of the XXXX. In the XXXX of 2018, the principal claimant started receiving calls from the cartel. At first, she did not understand who they were and what they wanted. At one (1) point, the caller said their commander offered to sell their products, namely drugs, which they knew would make good money. On one (1) occasion, she referred to the caller as zetters (ph), which infuriated the caller, who, with venom, told the principal that he was with the cartel, Jalisco New Generation, the CJNG.\n\n[4] On XXXX, 2018, as she was stepping out of her car to open the garage gate, a gray car with tinted windows pulled up next to her. A man pointed a gun at her, and shot, hitting the glass \u2014 the door of her car. She managed to run into the house, several glass pieces having cut into her arm \u2014 her forearm, causing injuries.\n\n[5] On XXXX, 2018, at around 3:00 a.m., she and her family were asleep when they were awakened by sounds of gunshots outside their house. The police were summoned. The police stated that it was a couple of drunk boys practicing with their gun. She was scared and felt she could not rely on the police for protection, so she left and came to Canada. She arrived XXXX 2019.\n\n[6] On XXXX, 2019, XXXX attended a gathering to inform people about XXXX and to XXXX. Armed individuals forcefully entered the gathering place and started shooting at everyone. Tt was a massacre. One (1) of her close colleagues died in the incident. She later learned that the people who helped her to get the XXXX job were arrested for drug possession, and that her boss had been kidnapped.\n\n[7] On XXXX. 2020, one (1) of her close family friends \u2014 members were shot dead by the cartel. She learned that the cartel had started threatening her oldest daughter, XXXX (ph) and her husband. The cartel shot at her husband at one (1) point. Unbeknownst to the principal claimant, they fled to Canada, where they made a successful refugee claim.\n\n[8] The cartel started to threaten her parents, and the threats got specific towards the principal claimant\u2019s, daughters XXXX and XXXX, who were in their care. On XXXX, 2022, her parents decided to run away and stay at some other places for protection. The children remained in hiding, unable to attend school or outdoor activities. The principal claimant\u2019s father decided to send the girls to Canada as he was not sure, given his state of health and age, that he would be able to protect them any more.\n\n[9] I find that the claimants are persons in need of protection pursuant to section 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, because on a balance of probabilities they would be subjected personally to a risk to their lives, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment at the hands of the CJNG, should they return to Mexico.\n\n[10] I find the claimants\u2019 identities are established by the documents provided, and \u2014 including true copies of their Mexican passports.\n\n[11] Testimony provided under oath is presumed to be truthful unless there is a reason for doubting its truthfulness. I find the principal claimant to be credible, and I believe that the allegations of the claim on a balance of probabilities. The testimony of the principal claimant was straightforward and detailed without embellishment or exaggeration. She responded to questions spontaneously, and her emotional demeanor was consistent with the gravity of her situation. There were no relevant contradictions, inconsistencies, or omissions between the claimants\u2019 Basis of Claim forms, the testimony, or the documents in evidence. The documents produced by the claimants confirmed the key elements of the claim. I have no reason to doubt the veracity of these documents, and as such, I place great weight on them.\n\n[12] The objective evidence establishes they have no reasonable expectation of state protection in Mexico. I find that adequate state protection is not available to protect the claimants from the agent of harm. The fact police refused the principal claimant\u2019s overtures for help on the night of the shooting at her house is demonstrative of lack of state protection under the circumstances.\n\n[13] The objective country conditions evidence establishes that despite efforts by the state to combat crime, the police generally are ineffective enough and tainted by corruption. A recent RIR highlights the high level of corruption among the police forces in Mexico, stating that most police are controlled by criminals, and that police forces and politicians have been largely infiltrated by organized crime. Based on the evidence in the record, I find that adequate state protection is not available on a balance of probabilities.\n\n[14] I have considered whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for the claimants. At the beginning of the hearing, I identified Cabo San Lucas. However, I find the objective documentary evidence corroborates the claimants\u2019 position that a viable IFA is not available to the claimants in Mexico, as the CJNG has a growing presence in the country and the means to track individuals nationally.\n\n[15] I find further that the past behaviour of the agent of harm establishes that the cartel would be motivated to pursue the claimants if they returned to Mexico. A viable IFA is not available to the claimants. The current NDP for Mexico establishes that the CJNG is a powerful and violent cartel with a presence through extensive alliances and smaller cells in all 32 states. There is evidence indicating that the CJNG has the most operational capacity in the country, and it is the only cartel with national presence and that Cabo San Lucas is part of the CJNG\u2019s area of considerable influence.\n\n[16] Turning to the claimants\u2019 circumstances, in my view, the past behaviour of the agent of harm in harassing and threatening the principal payments over an extended period of time, and tracking the PC\u2019s \u2014 principal claimant\u2019s father to several locations and harassing him, following the principal claimant\u2019s flight to Canada for refuge is persuasive evidence of a high level of motivation to pursue the claimants.\n\n[17] As the means and motivation of the agent of harm to pursue the claimants is established, I find the claimants face a section 97(1) risk of harm on a balance of probabilities if they relocate it elsewhere to Mexico \u2014 in Mexico, including the proposed IFA location of Cabo San Lucas. Thus, the proposed IFA fails the first prong of the test and cannot be found to be a viable IFA for the claimants on consideration of all the circumstances. ln view of my finding on the first prong, l need not go on to consider the reasonableness of the relocation to the proposed IFA under the second prong of the test.\n\n[18] In light of the preceding, I conclude the claimants are persons in need of protections pursuant to section 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. Accordingly, I accept the claims.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

The claimant was barn in Tuxtla but has been living with his family in Chiapas from a young age. The claimant worked with the XXXX where they XXXX The claimant\u2019s family was a XXXX in XXXX, Chiapas, which required the family to travel to Tabasco, M\u00e9rida and other places throughout Mexico and basically travel wherever they XXXX including close to the Guatemala border.\n\n[3] The claimant\u2019s father started receiving threatening calls in 2010 from members of the Sinaloa Cartel demanding that he work for them. The cartel demanded that the claimant\u2019s father transport their drugs for them from one (1) city to another, which he refused. The claimant\u2019s brother was murdered by the Sinaloa Cartel on XXXX 2011 and the father was informed by the cartel members that they would strike the family again if they did not obey the demands to work for them, the cartel.\n\n[4] The claimant and his family stayed XXXX, which was located XXXX with minimal connection to the community. The claimant\u2019s mother left XXXX on XXXX, 2016, was intercepted by the Sinaloa Cartel members, killed and tortured. The claimant\u2019s father continued to be threatened that his older son would be killed next if he did \u2014 his other son would be killed next if he did not obey the cartel\u2019s demand to transport drugs for them.\n\n[5] The claimant\u2019s father moved to Villahermosa in the state of Tabasco. The claimant moved from Chiapas to M\u00e9rida, Guanajuato to Guerrero, and each time was located and threatened. The claimant was threatened in-person by the Sinaloa Cartel in these cities and continued to receive threats of death and torture although he continually changed his phone number.\n\n[6] To this day, the claimant\u2019s father continues to receive death threats for his son and is extorted by the Sinaloa Cartel.\n\n[7] The claimant arrived in Canada on XXXX, 2022 and filed for protection on December 28th, 2022.\n\n[8] ln terms of delay, which l asked the PC (sic) about \u2014 sorry, the claimant about, he indicated that when he first arrived in Canada, he was not aware that he could claim for refugee protection and only became aware when he met a man named XXXX (ph) whom he confided in and told him his options. I accept this as a reasonable explanation and I draw no negative inference.\n\n[9] l find that your identity as a national of Mexico is established by the documents provided, including a certified copy of your Mexican passport.\n\n[10] ln terms of credibility, l am reminded in the case of Maldonado, which established that when a claimant swears to the truth of allegations, this creates a presumption that those allegations are true unless there is a reason to doubt their truthfulness.\n\n[11] I find you to be a credible witness and you \u2014 and therefore, believe what you have alleged in support of your claim. You have testified in a straightforward manner and there were no relevant inconsistencies in your testimony or contradictions between your testimony and the other evidence before me.\n\n[12] You provided supporting material, including affidavits and letters provided by family members and friends that document what occurred with the Sinaloa Cartel over the years, including the death certificates of the claimant\u2019s brother and the claimant\u2019s mother. The claimant\u2019s father also connected into the hearing from Mexico to testify on the claimant\u2019s behalf. Ali of which \u2014 this evidence corroborates your allegations.\n\n[13] Based on the credibility of the claimant\u2019s allegations, his identity as someone who defied them and escaped their demands to work with the cartel and the objective documentary evidence set out below, I find that the claimant has established, on a balance of probabilities, if he returned to Mexico, he would be subjected to violence at the hands of the cartel.\n\n[14] The harm that the claimant would face upon return to Mexico clearly amounts to a personalized risk or to life or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. That is, he would face a personalized risk to his life because he defied the cartel and did not do as he was told. This is a risk not generally faced by the Mexican population because it is defined by the claimant as he defied the cartel\u2019s demand to work for them and transport drugs for them and for any other corrupt business purposes. For these reasons, I find that the claimant\u2019s faces a section 97 risk in Mexico.\n\n[15] There is a presumption that the state has the ability to protect its citizens. That presumption can be rebutted by clear and convincing evidence that it is not reasonable to seek protection or that state protection would not be reasonably forthcoming.\n\n[16] The documentary evidence clearly establishes that the corruption of police forces in Mexico is a serious problem, with no indication of improvement in recent years. Organized crime has deeply infiltrated police institutions at all levels and law enforcement agencies have been involved in facilitation of illegal business activities, working for organized crimes and systematically violating human rights. Item 9.10 of the NDP states that there is a blatant corruption and abuse of power within the police and that they are involved in crimes that have been reported by national anti-corruption systems. There have also been credible reports of police involvement in kidnappings for ransom and that federal officials are sometimes accused of perpetrating these crimes.\n\n[17] Given the clearly documented state of police corruption, coupled with the fact that it is well-documented that cartels have infiltrated the police and the claimant cannot be expected to turn to the state for protection. Therefore, the presumption of state protection is rebutted.\n\n[18] In terms of internal flight alternative, at the beginning of the hearing, I suggested an internal flight alternative in M\u00e9rida, Campeche or Baja California could exist. I must consider if the cartel would have the motivation and capacity to pursue the claimant if he relocated to Mexico. After, however, considering ail the evidence, I find that the claimant has established, on a balance of probabilities, that the agents of harm, specifically the Sinaloa Cartel, has the capacity and the motivation to locate him throughout Mexico.\n\n[19] The objective evidence indicates that cartels are extremely powerful, believed to have a presence in every part of the country. The objective documentary evidence indicates that the Sinaloa Cartel, despite a loss of power over the years to the CJNG, remains a powerful cartel with a presence throughout Mexico. The documentary evidence confirms that the cartels have the capacity to track individuals beyond their areas of operation by relying on representation that they have in other areas. As well, cartels use family networks and private investigators to trad: people as well as property records in the US and Mexico, and by placing GPS trackers on their cars. The cartels \u2013 according to Exhibit 3, Item 7.15 of the current NDP, states corrupt law enforcement agents are used to obtain information about the people they pursue.\n\n[20] I find that the above cited evidence establishes, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant could be located and harmed by the cartel anywhere in Mexico.\n\n[21] While the claimant is nota high-profile journalist or politician or someone who could harm the operations of the cartel through his power and influence, the documentary evidence states that a large debt or a personal vendetta could motivate them to track someone outside of their area. I have considered the cartel\u2019s interest in the \u2014 cartel\u2019s level of interest in the claimant in determining whether, on a balance of probabilities, there is a section 97(1) risk for the claimant throughout Mexico.\n\n[22] The claimant moved from Chiapas to M\u00e9rida to Guanajuato to Guerrero, and each time was located by the cartel and threatened he should do as he was told, that he could not escape no matter where he went in Mexico. l find it would be reasonable to expect that the cartel would look for the claimant upon his return to Mexico and that they are motivated to pursue him as the claimant and his father defied their demands to work for them.\n\n[23] For the above reasons I find agents of harm would pursue and harm the claimant, on a balance of probabilities, throughout Mexico. For these reasons, I find there is no viable internal flight alternative for the claimant.\n\n[24] I conclude, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant faces a personalized and prospective risk to his life or cruel \u2014 a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in every part of Mexico. This is a specific personal risk faced by the claimant as opposed to indiscriminate or random risk faced by the others.\n\n[25] In conclusion, for the preceding reasons, I find that the claimant is in need of protection pursuant to section 97 of the IRPA, and therefore, I accept his claim.\n\n[26] Congratulations and welcome to Canada.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

        "unofficial_text":"2023 RLLR 57\n\nCitation: 2023 RLLR 57\nTribunal: Refugee Protection Division\nDate of Decision: December 11, 2023\nPanel: Abbas Kwofie\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Kirk J. Cooper\nCountry: Mexico\nRPD Number: TC3-20097\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2023-01721\nATIP Pages: 000110-000116\n\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n[1] These are the reasons for the decision in the claim for refugee protection made by XXXX. The claimant claims to be a citizen of Mexico and is claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).[1]\n\nALLEGATIONS\n\n[2] The allegations in support of the claim are set out in the claimant\u2019s Basis of Claim (BOC) form.[2] In summary, the claimant alleges that he is at risk from the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG) as his life was threatened in an attempt to get the claimant to pay an extortion fee of XXXX pesos per month initially at his XXXX, an amount which then escalated to XXXX pesos.\n\nDETERMINATION\n\n[3] The panel finds that the claimant is a person in need of protection, pursuant to section 97(1) of the IRPA because, on a balance of probabilities, he would be subjected personally to a risk to his life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, should he return to Mexico.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nIdentity\n\n[4] The claimant has established his personal identity as a national of Mexico, on a balance of probabilities, by his testimony and by the filing of personal identity documents, notably, certified true copies of his Mexican passport.[3]\n\nCredibility\n\n[5] In assessing the credibility of the evidence presented by the claimant, the panel refers to the Federal Court of Appeal in Maldonado wherein the Court stated, in part, \u201cwhen [a claimant] swears to the truth of certain allegations, this creates a presumption that those allegations are true unless there be reason to doubt their truthfulness.\u201d[4]\n\n[6] Although there were a few credibility issues during the course of questioning, and while the panel found the documentary evidence lacking in some instances, the claimant was consistent and credible with respect to the central allegations of his claim, being that he was targeted by the CJNG at his XXXX for the purposes of extortion, on a balance of probabilities.\n\nNo nexus\n\n[7] The panel finds that the allegations made by the claimant are criminal in nature, and criminal acts do not generally establish a nexus to a Convention ground. The claimant w as not targeted on the basis of any of the five Convention grounds.\n\n[8] The panel finds that the claimant\u2019s allegations, therefore, will be assessed under section 97(1) of the IRPA.\n\nObjective Basis of Future Risk\n\n[9] Based on the credibility of the claimant\u2019s allegations, and the objective documentary evidence set out below, the panel finds that the claimant has established, on a balance of\nprobabilities, if he returns to Mexico, he will be subjected to violence at the hands of the CJNG cartel.\n\n[10] The objective evidence indicates that the CJNG is an extremely powerful cartel, believed to have control over half of Mexico, with a presence in every part of the country. It is said to be large and powerful enough to be capable of corrupting the authorities at the federal, state, and local levels.[5] The CJNG is deemed by many to be the largest and most dangerous drug trafficking organization in Mexico and is known for the use of extreme and intimidating violence.[6] The evidence also confirms that the CJNG has alliances with several other large cartels and has a national scope of influence.[7]\n\nState Protection\n\n[11] The panel finds that there is clear and convincing evidence that state protection in Mexico is inadequate for the claimant, in his circumstances, and finds the claimant has rebutted the presumption of state protection.\n\n[12] The documentary evidence establishes that organized criminal groups throughout the country aim to dominate and intimidate local politicians and law enforcement, infiltrate state authorities, and \u201ccan use \u2018corrupt law enforcement agents\u2019 to obtain information about people they pursue.\u201d[8]\n\n[13] Further documentary evidence in item 10.2 notes that:\n\n[C]corruption, including within the armed forces and federal police [Policia Federal], underpins state collusion with criminals. [P]olice corruption remains a major problem in Mexico and there is little indication of improvement in recent years [and] \u2026 organized crime has deeply permeated police institutions.[9]\n\n[14] In addition, the same NDP item states:\n\nIn most Mexican states other than Yucatan, Campeche, and Aguascalientes, local police have been infiltrated by organized crime \u2026 analyses of drug trafficking, organized crime and human rights violations also highlight the role of police at all levels \u2013 federal, state, local \u2013 in facilitating illegal businesses, working for organized crime, and systematically violating human rights.[10]\n\n[15] The same NDP item further notes:\n\nAccording to the BTI 2020, [i]n many localities of Mexico, the drug organizations have control of the local police. The same source also indicates that \u201cthere is no trust between the different police forces, as municipal and state police have been infiltrated by the drug cartels and are, therefore, rarely informed of operations led by federal police or the army.\u201d Similarly, an article by KPBS, a San Diego news service, states that [t]he federal government has said infiltration by organized crime is a problem in many police forces in Sonora and around the country.[11]\n\n[16] Further documentary evidence in item 10.2 notes:\n\nThere are mechanisms available to report police corruption at the municipal, state, and federal level\u2026 [yet]\u2026 surveys show that citizens are highly unlikely to file official complaints of corruption and the most cited reasons for doing so are \u2018waste of time\u2019 and \u2018fear of reprisals.[12]\n\n[17] Additionally, it is noted in item 2.1 that:\n\nCriminal groups, especially drug cartels and gangs, were implicated in numerous killings, acting with impunity and at times in collusion with corrupt federal, state, local, and security officials.[13]\n\n[18] In light of the above cited evidence, the panel finds that there is clear and convincing evidence that state protection in Mexico is inadequate for the claimant, in his circumstances. For all of these reasons, the panel finds that the claimant has rebutted the presumption of state protection.\n\nInternal Flight Alternative (IFA)\n\n[19] The panel has considered whether a viable IFA exists for the claimant. The panel identified Merida and Campeche at the outset of the hearing as viable options.\n\n[20] The objective evidence established that the CJNG is a powerful and violent cartel with a presence in 32 Mexican states which it has achieved through extensive alliances and smaller cells. The CJNG is now established in Merida and Campeche, and there is evidence that the CJNG has the highest operational capacity, compared to any other cartels, in the country and that they have a considerable presence in the Yucatan.\n\n[21] Further, the objective evidence also addresses the means and motivation of the CJNG and other criminal organizations to track individuals who relocate within Mexico. The evidence indicates that criminal groups are motivated to track individuals for a number of reasons including the loss of money, personal rivalries, political incentives, or personal vengeance, and also indicates that if an organized criminal group that is dominate in other parts of Mexico is interested and willing to retaliate against people relocating to other areas of the country, they could doit easily. Further, the objective evidence highlights the CJNG are known for their use of brutality and violence.\n\n[22] While the claimant is not a high-profile journalist or politician, or an individual who could harm the operations of the CJNG through his power and influence, the documentary evidence states that a large debt or a personal vendetta could motivate a gang to track someone outside their area.\n\n[23] The panel has considered the CJNG\u2019s level of interest in the claimant in determining whether, on a balance of probabilities, there is a section 97(1) risk for the claimant in the IFA location.\n\n[24] As for the circumstances of the claimant, he was targeted on multiple occasions for the purposes of extortion beginning in XXXX 2022. This happened again in XXXX 2022 and XXXX 2022. The claimant also went to the police on several occasions but despite him doing this, the agents of harm returned. Due to the threats, he began paying the fee in XXXX 2022, which he paid until XXXX 2022 when they increased the amount, and he was unable to gather the fonds. Thereafter, the claimant went to hide in Cancun, where he and his family received calls from the agents of harm, and he then left for Canada in XXXX 2022.\n\n[25] In addition, since the claimant has been in Canada, he has continued to receive messages and phone calls from the agents of harm on XXXX, 2023 where they asked him for money and if he did not comply, they would harm his family. In addition, the agents of harm sent him threatening WhatsApp messages (which he disclosed) and he continues to get calls from the same area code which he believes is the agents of harm up until XXXX, 2023.\n\n[26] The panel finds that since the claimant has been repeatedly targeted and threatened on multiple occasions, and since the agents of harm operate throughout the country, there is a likelihood that the claimant would, if relocated to any of the of the other parts of the country, face the same risks. Based on the evidence before it, the panel finds that no viable IFA exists for him in Mexico.\n\n[27] The panel concludes, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant faces a personalized and prospective risk to his life, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in every part of Mexico.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[28] The panel finds that that the claimant is a person in need of protection pursuant to s.97(1)(b) of the IRPA and the panel accepts his claim.\n\n(signed) Abbas Kwofie\n\nDecember 11, 2023\n\n[1] The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C.2001, c.27, as amended, sections 96 and 97(1).\n\n[2] Exhibit 2, Basis of claim form TC3-20097\n\n[3] Exhibit 1.\n\n[4] Maldonado v.

Bainbridge\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Krista Ann Rodriguez\nCountry: Mexico\nRPD Number: TC3-15357\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2023-01721\nATIP Pages: 000098-000109\n\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n[1] This is the decision regarding the claim of refugee protection made by XXXX who is a citizen of Mexico and is claiming refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (the \u201cAct\u201c)[1].\n\nALLEGATIONS\n\n[2] The specifics of the claim are set out in the claimant\u2019s Basis of Claim (BOC) form.[2] The following is a summary of the allegations.\n\n[3] The claimant alleges that he cannot return to Mexico because he was targeted by XXXX members of XXXX to do XXXX that they used to conduct their criminal operations.\n\nExclusion 1E \u2013 Status in the United States\n\n[4] As set out in section 98 of the IRPA, a person referred to in Article 1E of the Refugee Convention is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection if they are a person who is recognized by the authorities of a third country in which they have taken residence, and have rights and obligations that are substantially similar to nationals of that country.\n\n[5] The panel has considered the legal test set out in the Federal Court of Appeal case in Zeng to determine if a refugee claimant should be excluded pursuant to Article 1E of the Convention. The Court stated the following:\n\nConsidering all relevant factors to the date of the hearing, does the claimant have status substantially similar to that of its nationals, in the third country? If the answer is yes, the claimant is excluded. If the answer is no, the next question is whether the claimant previously had such status and lost it, or had access to such status and failed to acquire it. If the answer is no, the claimant is not excluded under Article lE. If the answer is yes, the RPD must consider and balance various factors. These include, but are not limited to, the reason for the loss of status (voluntary or involuntary), whether the claimant could return to the third country, the risk the claimant would face in the home country, Canada\u2019s international obligations, and any other relevant facts.[3]\n\n[6] The claimant testified that he was brought to the United States as a child in 2000 when he was approximately 12 years old. His parents left the U.S. in 2015 to return to Mexico, however he remained because he was working illegally as a XXXX and receiving training as an XXXX. He returned to Mexico in 2017 because his father fell ill.\n\n[7] The claimant testified that he tried to regularize his status in the U.S. while he was there the first time and stated that he tried to \u201caccess the program by Obama\u201d for children who were brought by their parents illegally into the U.S., however he was denied. The claimant also attempted to regularize his status when he entered and lived illegally in the U.S. a second time between 2020 and 2022, however he was told by the lawyer he hired, that he was ineligible to apply for asylum as he had previously lived in the U.S. illegally after he reached the age of majority, and further, he would not be eligible to apply for a visa.\n\n[8] The panel finds that the claimant does not have status or rights similar to that of United States nationals because he did not have legal status while living in the U.S. for several years. The claimant entered the country illegally on two occasions, the first as a child brought by his parents, and the second as an adult fleeing harm in Mexico. He testified that he chose to flee to the U.S. the second time because he was familiar with the country as he had grown up there. The panel accepts that he tried to regularize his status there on two occasions, but he was unsuccessful. Based on the evidence before the panel, the panel finds that the claimant did not previously obtain status in the U.S., nor did he lose status, and he does not have the right to return to the U.S. at the date and time of this hearing. Accordingly, the panel finds that the claimant is not excluded under Article 1E of the Convention.\n\nDETERMINATION\n\n[9] The panel finds that the claimant is a person in need of protection pursuant to s. 97(1) of the IRPA.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nIdentity\n\n[10] The panel finds that the personal and national identity of the claimant as a national of Mexico has been established on a balance of probabilities by his testimony, and his passport.[4]\n\nNexus\n\n[11] The allegations of the claimant are that he is a victim of organized crime. The claimant was not targeted on the basis of any of the five Convention grounds. Therefore, the panel finds that the allegations of the claimant are more properly assessed under section 97(1) of the IRPA.\n\nCredibility\n\n[12] The presumption of truthfulness as set out in Maldonado applies to a claimant\u2019s sworn testimony unless there is reason to doubt its truthfulness.[5] However, the presumption of truthfulness can be rebutted through material contradictions, inconsistencies, and omissions if they are not satisfactorily explained. Further, claims may be undermined by a lack of credibility.\n\n[13] The claimant testified in a straightforward manner, and he provided detailed testimony relating to the alleged events in Mexico. There were no inconsistencies or omissions identified by the panel, and the testimony was consistent with the allegations contained in the Basis of Claim. Further the allegations of the claimant were supported by numerous personal documents he provided. These documents included: three statements from close family members who were familiar with the claimant\u2019s fear of XXXX and his attempts to relocate[6], a medical report detailing the claimant\u2019s injuries from the attack of XXXX, 2018[7]; a police report made by the claimant regarding the same attack[8]; and a police report made by the claimant\u2019 s parents regarding a break and enter by the agent of harm who were looking for the claimant in XXXX 2022[9].\n\n[14] The panel has considered the credible testimony of the claimant and the corroborating evidence provided and finds that he is a credible witness. The panel accepts the allegations as true, on a balance of probabilities.\n\nRisk of Harm S. 97\n\nFacts Established on a Balance of Probabilities\n\n[15] To establish his status as a person in need of protection, the claimant must show that he would be subjected, on a balance of probabilities, to a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or a danger of torture if returned to Mexico.\n\n[16] In consideration of the credible testimony of the claimant and the supporting documentation filed, the panel finds that the claimant has established the following facts on a balance of probabilities: the claimant is from the community of XXXX located within the state of Guerrero; the claimant\u2019s parents brought him to the United States when he was 12 years old in 2000, where they lived and worked illegally; his parents returned to Mexico in 2015; the claimant stayed in the United States obtained training as an XXXX while working illegally; the claimant returned to Mexico in 2017 because of an urgent issue with is father\u2019s health; the claimant assisted his father with their farm and also made XXXX around the family home; others in the community noticed his XXXX skills and paid him to do work on their properties; his trade was noticed by members of XXXX who wanted him to do work for them; the claimant refused when first approached in XXXX 2018; they approached him again on XXXX, 2018 where they demanded he work for them, but he refused and they kidnapped him, beat him, and brought him before their boss who demanded he do the work or else they would kill him; he was knocked unconscious and dropped off near his parents\u2019 home; the claimant was taken to the hospital for treatment of his injuries; the claimant made a police report about the XXXX, 2018 incident, the perpetrators and the injuries; the claimant was further harassed by the agent of harm after making the complaint; on XXXX 2019, the agents of harm found the claimant at a local store and told him they were going to take him to work; the claimant did not refuse as he feared for his life; he was taken to the warehouses operated by XXXX, where he worked XXXX for approximately a month and a half; while working XXXX, he witnessed drugs for trafficking, weapons, and faces of cartel members; that claimant did not finish the work in XXXX 2020 because he knew once he did, they would kill him, instead he fled to his brother\u2019s home in Toluca, Mexico City, which is five to six hours away from his parents\u2019 home; he disposed of his cellphone before relocating; a few days later, his brother received a call from his cousin stating that the agent of harm had been asking the community about the claimant\u2019s location and that they wanted to kill him for failing to comply with their orders and for making a complaint to the police; the claimant was located by a member of the agent of harm while shopping in a market with his brother who told the claimant they now knew where he was; the claimant relocated to his sister\u2019 s house in\n2020 who lives in the city of XXXX in Queretaro, which is about 10 hours from his hometown; the claimant\u2019s sister hosted a father\u2019s day celebration at her home in XXXX 2020 where the claimant\u2019s parents visited; during this visit, a rock with a note was thrown through the window which stated that they knew where the claimant was; the claimant decided to flee to the United States; the claimant made the journey to the United States where he worked and lived illegally; he contacted a lawyer and paid him, but he was told he could not be helped since he had already lived illegally when his parents brought him to the United States as a child and he stayed until he was an adult; he was delayed leaving the United States due to the pandemic, but eventually made his way to Canada where he claimed refugee protection; the claimant\u2019s parents were visited by the agents of harm on XXXX, 2022 who were looking for the claimant, and they ransacked their home looking for information about his location after his parents told them he was no longer in the country; his parents made a police report about this incident and continue to live in fear.\n\n[17] Given the credible testimony of the claimant and the various personal documents and country conditions evidence provided, the panel accepts these allegations as true on a balance of probabilities.\n\nSection 97(1) Analysis\n\nDoes the claimant face a personal risk?\n\n[18] According to the objective evidence, over the past two decades, criminal violence in Mexico has become highly intense, diversified, and popularized, while the deterrence capacity of Mexican law enforcement remains critically low. The outcome is an ever more complex, multipolar, and out-of-control criminal market that generates deleterious effects on Mexican society and makes it highly challenging for the Mexican state to respond effectively.[10]\n\n[19] Freedom House reports in 2022, that Mexicans are subject to the threat of violence at the hands of several actors, including individual criminals, drug cartels that operate with impunity, and police officers who are often susceptible to bribery. Mexicans are particularly vulnerable to enforced disappearances, which remains a tremendous challenge for the government despite efforts to address the missing-persons backlog in recent years.[11]\n\n[20] Noteworthy is that violence in Mexico has become diversified over the past decade, with drug trafficking groups becoming involved in widespread extortion of legal businesses, kidnapping, illegal logging, illegal mining, and smuggling of migrants. That is partially a consequence of the fragmentation, as smaller groups are compelled to branch out into a variety of criminal enterprises. But for larger groups, extortion of large segments of society is not merely a source of money, but also of authority.[12]\n\n[21] Furthermore, the objective evidence suggests that there is a high level of corruption among police forces working with organized criminals, and that municipal and state police have been infiltrated by the cartels.[13] The documentary evidence suggests that when analysing drug trafficking, organized crime and human rights violations, police of all levels (local, state and federal) are present in the facilitation of illegal businesses, working for organized criminals, and systematically violating human rights.[14] Further, sources indicate that low pay contributes to police corruption and that local police are often particularly vulnerable to corruption or infiltration from organized crime groups because they are overworked, underpaid, and understaffed.[15]\n\n[22] The experience of the claimant outlined in the previous section is in line with the objective evidence above, which discusses the increasing use of violence by organized criminals to threaten those who do not obey them or expose their enterprises or illegal activities to the authorities.\n\n[23] Therefore, the panel finds that the first part of the test has been established and finds that the claimant would be personally subjected to a risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if he were to return to Mexico, on a balance of probabilities.\n\nIs the risk to the claimants faced generally?\n\n[24] In Guerrero v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2011 FC 1210, Justice Russel Zinn observed at paragraph 34 that the requirement that the risk is not faced generally by other individuals in or from that country means that:\n\n\u201cPersons who face the same or even a heightened risk as others face of random or indiscriminate violence from gangs [may not be] eligible for protection. However, where a person is specifically and personally targeted for death by a gang in circumstances where others are generally not, then he or she is entitled to protection under s. 97 of the Act if the other statutory requirements are met.\u201d\n\n[25] Further, the Federal Court decision in Lovato [2012] FC143 at paragraph 13, directs the Board to focus not only on the reasons why a claimant is being targeted, but also on the extent to which they are being targeted, and whether that extent is beyond that experienced by the population at large.\n\n[26] The evidence before the panel is that the claimant was targeted by XXXX because he had knowledge as a skilled XXXX and became well known in the community as someone who could perform work as an XXXX. The claimant was seen as valuable to them as he could perform work XXXX that housed their criminal enterprises, which included illegal weapons, drugs, and other cartel members. The claimant refused to do the work several times despite being threatened with death and being brutally attacked. In the end, the claimant could not withstand the pressure and did the majority of the work but left before the work was completed because he knew he would likely be killed upon its completion. The claimant is also a person of interest to the agent of harm because he made a police report about the attack in which he was beaten by the agent of harm.\n\n[27] Therefore, the panel finds that the risk faced by the claimant is not generalized to the entire Mexican population because the claimant was targeted due to his skills as an XXXX\nand he performed work XXXX for the agent of harm thereby becoming knowledgeable of their operation. The risk to the claimant is specific to him and is not generalized to the entire Mexican population.\n\nState Protection\n\n[28] States are presumed to be capable of protecting their citizens except in cases of complete breakdown. Furthermore, Mexico is a democracy where citizens can choose their government through free elections, which generally speaking, fosters an environment where state protection may be available.\n\n[29] Claimants are expected to seek state protection in their home country unless they would put themselves at risk in doing so. The claimant testified that he made a complaint to the police about the attack by the agent of harm which occurred on XXXX, 2018. Despite making this complaint and following up on the complaint, the claimant was told by the authorities that nothing could be done and there had been no progress made on pursuing those responsible for the attack. Further, the claimant\u2019s parents\u2019 home was invaded by the agent of harm in\n2022 where they demanded to know information about the claimant\u2019s whereabouts. They further ransacked the home of the claimant\u2019s parents when they were told he was no longer in the country. The claimant\u2019s parents made a police report about the incident; however, they have not received assistance from the police in terms of locating the perpetrators since making the report.\n\n[30] As discussed previously, there is a lack of state protection in Mexico due to weak and corrupt police forces, or in many cases, police forces who are the perpetrators of crime themselves.[16] The claimant, and his parents who still reside in Mexico, attempted to access police protection, but their efforts were not supported. These experiences are in line with the documentary evidence previously discussed, namely that police forces in Mexico are corrupt, overworked, and underpaid, and that government actors are often infiltrated by organized crime and corrupted.\n\n[31] Given the objective evidence regarding state protection in Mexico and the testimony of the claimant, the panel finds that the claimant has rebutted the presumption of state protection by providing evidence that it is not available to him, on a balance of probabilities.\n\nInternal Flight Alternative\n\n[32] The panel has considered whether a viable internal flight alternative (IFA) exists for the claimant. The panel identified Campeche and Merida. The panel finds that the objective documentary evidence corroborates the position of the claimant which is that a viable IFA does not exist to him in Mexico as the agent of harm has demonstrated an ongoing interest in pursuing him throughout Mexico.\n\n[33] The claimant testified that he attempted to relocate twice within Mexico to escape the agent of harm. He relocated to Toluca in Mexico state, and city of XXXX in Queretaro. Each location was between five to ten hours away from the claimant\u2019s hometown; however, the agent of harm was able to locate him there. The claimant was asked if he ever considered relocating further way from his hometown and he testified that he did, but because he had already been located twice by the agent of harm despite his relocations, he no longer felt safe in Mexico and he made the decision to flee the country.\n\n[34] The objective evidence states that XXXX, similar to most other cartels in Mexico, does not have a national presence in the country.[17] However, the objective evidence also states that cartels can and will enter into temporary alliances with each other, and these alliances can be difficult to track because they can occur quickly.[18] For instance, the United States Drug Enforcement Administration reports that XXXX has developed ties to the Cartel Jalisco Nuevo Generacion (CJNG)[19], which is considered to be the only cartel with a national presence in Mexico.[20] Further, XXXX is known to have made alliances with other cartels such as Los Zetas, which is another cartel who has made temporary alliances with other criminal organizations, such as the Beltran Leyva Organization (BLO) and the Gulf Cartel.[21]\n\n[35] The objective evidence also states that if a criminal organization has \u201ca very strong motivation to find and retaliate against a certain person\u2026. especially if the criminal group were\none of the more powerful groups in Mexico\u2026. with indications of having cooperation from relevant authorities\u2026then the ability to track and retaliate against a certain person would be a\nreasonable concern to have\u201d.[22] There are various ways in which a criminal organization could locate someone, such as connections with other criminal groups as previously discussed, through bribing employees of telephone companies to track phone calls, the use of spyware to locate individuals, and bribery of corrupt state officials.[23]\n\n[36] Given this information, the panel finds that the claimant remains a person of interest to the agent of harm. The panel acknowledges that the objective evidence states that XXXX may not be as powerful as it once was, however, the actions of the agent of harm and the objective evidence that states a person can be found by a criminal organization through alliances they may have with other criminal groups, and\/or connections to state authorities or telecom operators.\n\n[37] Therefore, the panel finds that the means and motivation of the agent of harm to pursue and locate the claimant has been established on a balance of probabilities. The panel finds there is no viable internal flight alternative available to the claimant.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[38] The panel finds that the claimant is a person in need of protection pursuant to s. 97(1) of the IRPA. Therefore, his claim is accepted.\n\n(signed) K. Bainbridge\n\nDecember 12, 2023\n\n[1] Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n\n[2] Exhibit 2\n\n[3] Zeng v.

Lithwick\nCountry: Mexico\nRPD Number: TC2-36011\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2023-01721\nATIP Pages: 000087-000097\n\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n\n[1] XXXX, a citizen of Mexico, seeks refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).[1]\n\nALLEGATIONS\n\n[2] The claimant alleges a prospective risk of harm at the hands of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG). He claims that the CJNG threatened, coerced, and attempted to force him to work for them. After he refused multiple times, he alleges that armed members of the CJNG assaulted him.\n\nDETERMINATION\n\n[3] I find that the claimant is a person in need of protection as contemplated by section 97 of\nIRPA and therefore accept his claim.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nIdentity\n\n[4] I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant has established his personal and national identity as a citizen of Mexico through the identity documents filed, namely his passport.[2]\n\nCredibility\n\n[5] In claims before the RPD, there is a presumption that sworn testimony is true unless there is valid reason to doubt its truthfulness. I found the claimant\u2019s testimony to be consistent, compelling, and genuine, and have no reason to doubt its truthfulness.\n\n[6] The claimant testified that the CJNG first became aware of him through his mother\u2019s partner, who was working with them. Members of the CJNG approached him and asked them to work with them multiple times between XXXX and XXXX 2021 because of his education in XXXX and his job position as a XXXX for a XXXX. He claims they wanted to use his position to transport drugs using vans. As a result of their advances, he went to live with his father. His mother\u2019s partner began earnestly calling him and insisting that he work for the CJNG.\n\n[7] On XXXX, 2021 the claimant received a phone call from a member of the CJNG threatening to kill him if he did not cooperate and work with them. The letter of the claimant\u2019s friend XXXX, who was with him at the time of the call, corroborates the claimant\u2019s testimony as to this event, the demands of the CJNG to work with his mother\u2019s partner, and their threats to his life.[3]\n\n[8] On XXXX, 2021, a grey vehicle with tinted windows cut the claimant\u2019 s car off while he was driving with his friend. Four armed members of the CJNG got out, pointed their guns at the claimant and his friend, and told the claimant he had to come and work for them. One of them hit the claimant with his gun, leaving him bruised and injured. The claimant submitted a letter from his friend XXXX, who was with him at the time of this incident, corroborating the claimant\u2019s testimony with respect to this event and the threats made by the CJNG.[4]\n\n[9] Finally the claimant testified that on XXXX, 2021, after keeping a low profile and barely leaving home, he took a motorcycle to visit his grandma because she was having a XXXX. He took a route that passed underneath a bridge, at which point a black car with tinted windows hit his motorcycle. He was bruised and bleeding from his face after the impact, which is documented in the pictures submitted by the claimant.[5] Two armed men got out of the car, picked the claimant up, and threw him in the back of their vehicle. They told him they were taking him to their boss. The claimant managed to escape by hitting one of them and diving out of the moving vehicle as it approached a speed bump in the road. He ran and hid in the bushes before jumping into the nearest taxi. After this incident, he went to live with his uncle at a more secure address in Colima while he recovered. His father and uncle submitted letters of support which corroborate the claimant\u2019s physical injuries following the incident, the threats made against him by the CJNG, and the claimant\u2019 s testimony as to his living in hiding.[6] The claimant ultimately left Mexico on XXXX, 2021.\n\n[10] The claimant testified that initially he only intended to come to Canada on a temporary basis to allow time for things to calm down in Mexico. However, while he was living in Canada, his aunt informed him of a shooting at his mother\u2019s house that occurred on XXX, 2022. The claimant submitted a letter from his cousin, who had witnessed the shooting, in support of this allegation.[7] The claimant\u2019s mother disappeared on XXXX, 2022 and was found dead with her partner several days later on XXXX, 2022. The claimant submitted a death certificate that indicates his mother died a violent death by strangulation on XXXX, 2022.[8] Following his mother\u2019s death, the claimant changed his mind and decided to submit a refugee claim in September 2022.\n\n[11] The NDP evidence shows that the CJNG is a well-organized, aggressive, and violent criminal group present in most of the Mexican states, and one of the largest and most dangerous criminal groups in the world.[9] The CJNG is known for its \u201caggressive use of violence\u201d, and activities of the CJNG include human trafficking, homicide, forced disappearances, and other forms of extreme violence.[10] The CJNG is reported to have the most operational capacity and is the only cartel, apart from the Sinaloa cartel, to have a national presence.[11] The NDP states it is the dominant criminal actor in Colima, where the claimant lived in Mexico.[12] The claimant also submitted an expert report which notes the aggressive, violent activities of the CJNG including kidnapping, torture, murder, and making individuals disappear for reasons such as failing to pay extortion or challenging the group\u2019s interests.[13] I find this report to be reliable and persuasive on the basis of the extensive credentials of the author, how recently it was written, and how it addresses the claimant\u2019 s specific circumstances. It also complements and does not contradict other sources of the NDP. I therefore attach it full weight. This report also details the state of the art military grade technology possessed by the CJNG and the high level of state corruption it exploits, and notes the CJNG are the dominant group in Colima.[14] It also explains the prevalence of forced recruitment by the CJNG of local citizens and how this has fueled their rapid expansion.[15] This profile of the CJNG is consistent with the claimant\u2019s testimony.\n\n[12] I accept the credibility of the claimant\u2019s key allegations as summarized above. In addition to his clear, convincing testimony, the claimant adduced supporting documentation in the form of letters from his father, his uncle, his cousin, and two of his friends, photos of himself after his attack, and his mother\u2019s death certificate.[16] These letters corroborate the important events in the claimant\u2019s testimony, namely the efforts by the claimant\u2019s mother\u2019s partner and the CJNG to recruit the claimant, the claimant\u2019s departure to live with his father, the call of XXXX, 2021, the assault of XXXX, 2021, the attempted kidnapping of XXXX, 2021, and the claimant\u2019s departure to live in hiding with his uncle. I find each of these letters of support to be detailed and reliable accounts of the events in the claimant\u2019 s testimony that they purport to support, with no material inconsistencies. I therefore attach full weight to them, as well as the claimant\u2019s mother\u2019s death certificate.\n\n[13] I also accept the vast capabilities, violent activities, and aggressive nature of the CJNG, which is the dominant cartel in the claimant\u2019s home state and the purported agent of harm. The claimant presented as a useful recruit for drug trafficking purposes as he was a XXXX at a XXXX in Colima. This would be a high value position for the CJNG to recruit as part of their efforts to facilitate the transport of drugs through the region and provide an additional base of operations.\n\n[14] Accordingly I find, more likely than not, that the claimant credibly faces a prospective risk to his life at the hands of the CJNG should he return to Mexico. The risk he faces is personalized and elevated relative to that of the general population due to the claimant\u2019s profile as a XXXX, his repeated refusals to work for the CJNG in spite of their threats, and his deceased mother and her late partner\u2019s past involvement with the CJNG. Additionally, the claimant\u2019s father wrote in his letter of support that he essentially still lives in hiding, only going to work and then back home, and still receives phone calls from unknown numbers to this day that he believes could be threats from the CJNG (though he has not answered them).\n\nState Protection\n\n[15] States are presumed to be capable of protecting their citizens except in situations where the state is in a state of complete breakdown.[17] The claimant must rebut this presumption with clear and convincing evidence of the state\u2019s inability to protect its citizens for their claim to succeed. I find that the claimant\u2019s testimony, taken together with the objective country evidence, successfully rebut this presumption and serve as clear and convincing evidence that adequate state protection is not available to the claimant in Mexico.\n\n[16] The NDP evidence indicates that police forces in Mexico lack human and material resources to properly investigate crimes and that for all murders registered between 2010 and 2016, 94.8% of cases had no suspect facing charges.[18] According to the 2019 National Survey on Victimization and Perception of Public Safety, 93.2% of all crimes committed were either not reported or not investigated.[19] The NDP also states that 80% of police forces are controlled by criminals, that almost 60-70% are corrupted by organized crime, and that organized crime has infiltrated local police and politicians.[20] Other sources indicate that police at all levels (local, state, and federal) play a role in facilitating illegal businesses, working for organized crime, and systematically violating human rights.[21] Additionally, 59.2% of respondents in a 2019 survey reported that they had experienced an act of corruption with public security authorities.[22]\n\n[17] I note that a claimant is not required to risk their life to seek ineffective protection of a state merely to demonstrate that ineffectiveness.[23] The claimant testified that he attempted to go to the district attorney\u2019 s office to report the assault on XXXX, 2021, but saw his assailants\u2019 vehicle in the parking lot when he arrived and decided to turn around. Given the well-documented corruption and inadequacy of state protection by the NDP, I find this course of action to be reasonable.\n\n[18] In light of the objective country documentation and the claimant\u2019s testimony about his attempt to seek out state protection, I find that the claimant has rebutted the presumption of state protection and that adequate state protection would not be available to the claimant in Mexico.\n\nInternal Flight Alternative\n\n[19] I raised the issue of IFA with the claimant at the outset of the hearing and proposed Merida as a viable IFA. I find that the claimant has successfully challenged this IFA under the first prong of the analysis.\n\n[20] The Federal Court of Appeal has held that there is a two-pronged test for assessing an IFA.[24] The RPD must be satisfied that:\n\ni. There is no serious possibility of the claimant being persecuted in the part of the country to which it finds an IFA exists and\/or that it is more probable than not that the claimant would not be personally subject to a danger of torture or to a risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in the IFA; and\n\nii. The conditions in the part of the country considered to be an IFA must be such that it would not be unreasonable in all the circumstances, including those particular to the claim, for the claimant to seek refuge there.\n\n[21] Both prongs of the test must be satisfied to find that a claimant has an IFA. Once the issue of IFA has been raised and potential IFAs have been identified by the RPD, the burden of proof then rests with the claimant to show that they do not have a viable IFA in those locations.\n\nFirst Prong: Prospective Risk o(Harm in the IFA\n\n[22] The claimant does not allege a danger of torture at the hands of the state or by a public official. I will therefore focus the first prong of the IFA analysis on whether the claimant has demonstrated that, more likely than not, he faces a prospective risk to his life or of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in Merida. For the reasons that follow, I find that the claimant has successfully established that he would and therefore that Merida would not be a viable IFA.\n\n[23] As stated previously, the NDP indicates that the CJNG has a national presence in Mexico.[25] Additionally, the CJNG has a reported presence in Merida, though the NDP notes that violence there is much lower and criminal groups attempt to keep a low profile.[26] The NDP further indicates that most organized criminal groups have the capacity to find an individual throughout Mexico if sufficiently motivated using family networks, private investigators, property records, GPS trackers, communications networks (e.g., cell phone towers), government databases, and police, army, government contacts, and alliances with other criminal organizations.[27]\n\n[24] Accordingly, based on the objective NDP evidence for Mexico and the claimant\u2019s testimony, I find that the CJNG has the capacity to track down the claimant and execute the claimant\u2019s allegations. I now tum to the motivation of the CJNG to use their resources to track down the claimant.\n\n[25] The NDP evidence states that motivations for a criminal organization to track an individual down include large unpaid debts, stolen or lost money, personal vendettas or rivalries, political incentives, high-value personnel, people with privileged information about the criminal organization\u2019s operations, perceived betrayal, and cooperation with the authorities.[28] One NDP source writes that the amount of effort expended depends on a person\u2019s value, and that a low-level, easily replaceable taxi driver, for instance, would not likely be tracked.[29] The expert report submitted by the claimant also states that targeting individuals like the claimant who have defied CJNG demands is essential to the group as it stops individuals from questioning the capacity of the CJNG, which would present an existential threat to the cartel.[30]\n\n[26] The claimant has a degree in XXXX. He would have presented as a useful recruit to the CJNG for drug trafficking purposes as he was a XXXX at a XXXX in Colima. He claimed that the CJNG wanted to leverage this position as means of transporting drugs using vans. This would be a high value position for the CJNG to recruit as part of their efforts to facilitate the transport and distribution of drugs through the region with complicit supervision, and would provide them with an additional base of operations (the XXXX). The value of the claimant\u2019s position to the CJNG is supported by their persistent efforts to recruit him. First, they tried to do so amicably by stating that he could more easily pay his student debts by working for them, and then switched to violence and coercion when that did not work. They spent 3-4 months trying to recruit him, and as part of their efforts both assaulted him and attempted to kidnap him. He defied each attempt by the CJNG to recruit him, and then fled Mexico.\n\n[27] The claimant also has a pre-existing connection with the CJNG through his mother and her partner, who were later violently murdered in XXXX 2022, quite possibly by the CJNG. The claimant testified to overhearing arguments between his mother\u2019 s partner and other members of the CJNG, which he believed to be over money that was owed to the CJNG. This could present additional motivation for the CJNG to track down the claimant due to the personal connection and the potential of an unpaid debt they might attribute to him by virtue of his relationship to his mother.\n\n[28] On the basis of the claimant\u2019s profile and the actions taken by the CJNG in his testimony, I find that the CJNG has both the means and the motivation to track the claimant down to the proposed IFA, should he relocate to Merida. Accordingly the claimant has established that, more likely than not, he would face a prospective risk to his life or of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment should he seek refuge there.\n\n[29] As the claimant has successfully challenged the proposed IFA under the first prong of the IFA analysis, I find that the claimant does not have a viable IFA in Merida and need not proceed with the second prong of the IFA analysis.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[30] I find that the claimant is a person in need of protection under section 97 of IRPA and therefore accept his claim.\n\n(signed) Matthew Stumpf\n\nAugust 17, 2023\n\n[1] Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, SC 2001, c 27, as amended, ss 96, 97(l)(a) and 97(l)(b).\n\n[2] Exhibit 1.\n\n[3] Exhibit 5, Item 10, p. 33-35.\n\n[4] Exhibit 5, Item 9, pp. 30-32.\n\n[5] Exhibit 5, Item 5, pp. 16-18.\n\n[6] Exhibit 5, Items 6 and 7, pp. 19-26.\n\n[7] Exhibit 5, Item 8, pp. 27-29.\n\n[8] Exhibit 5, Item 3, pp. 7-9.\n\n[9] NDP, Mexico, Tab 7.7 at pp. 1-3: Mexico: The Jalisco New Generation Cartel (Cartel de Jalisco Nueva Generaci6n, CJNG), its activities, areas of operation and influence; the ability of the CJNG to track and retaliate against people who move to other areas of Mexico, including M\u00e9rida, Campeche, Mexico City, and Cabo San Lucas; the profiles of people they would be motivated to track and target (2019-August 2021).

In summary, the claimant witnessed and objected to police detaining a Colombian migrant in Cancun, Quintana Roo state in XXXX 2021. The police pushed him away and threatened him with obstruction of justice. The claimant filed a complaint against the police with the public prosecutor\u2019s office. Days later, the XXXX at the scene XXXX phoned the claimant and threatened him.\n\n[3] A few weeks later men identifying themselves as members of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG) accosted the claimant, threatened him for reporting XXXX and demanded a weekly fee of XXXX pesos. The claimant moved back to M\u00e9rida to live with his mother. They began receiving calls from unknown numbers. In XXXX 2021, a banner containing a threat from the CJNG was hung outside his home. The claimant then filed a complaint with M\u00e9rida police about the banner and with the Human Rights Commission because of the Cancun prosecutor\u2019s inaction. In XXXX 2021, CJNG members entered the claimant\u2019s house, robbed, and assaulted him. Mr. XXXX claims he faces a risk of harm in Mexico from the CJNG because he filed complaints about the Cancun police with whom they have connections.\n\nDETERMINATION\n\n[4] The claimant has established that he faces a risk of harm from the CJNG should he return to Mexico because he filed complaints against a Cancun XXXX with links to the cartel.\n\n[5] I find that the claimant is a person in need of protection, and I accept his claim for refugee protection under s. 97 of IRPA.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nIdentity\n\n[6] The claimant established his identity, on the balance of probabilities, as a citizen of Mexico through his testimony and by submitting copy of his Mexican passport.\n\nCredibility\n\n[7] When a claimant swears to the truth of their allegations, this creates a presumption that those allegations are true, unless there is reason to doubt their truthfulness.[2] Mr. XXXX\u2019s testimony was consistent with his BOC narrative. His responses to the panel\u2019s questions were spontaneous and his did not embellish his testimony. Based on his testimony and the documents submitted as evidence, I find on a balance of probabilities that the claimant and his evidence are credible.\n\nRisk of Harm\n\n[8] The claimant alleges that if he returns to Mexico, he faces a personalized risk of harm from the CJNG because he filed complaints with the prosecutor\u2019s office in Cancun and M\u00e9rida and the Human Rights Commission in M\u00e9rida against the CJNG and Cancun XXXX who has links to the cartel.\n\n[9] The claimant testified that he was a XXXX at a XXXX in Cancun, Quintana Roo. On the evening of XXXX, 2021, the claimant saw police trying to force a woman into their vehicle. The woman yelled that she was an undocumented Columbian and that the police were detaining her because she could not pay the XXXX pesos they were extorting from her. The claimant said she also accused the police of having ties with the CJNG.\n\n[10] The claimant asked the police what was happening, and they told him to stop meddling.\nHe raised the issue of the woman\u2019s rights and the police conduct. The XXXX with his name displayed on his badge, demanded the claimant\u2019s Electoral Identity card which he then photographed. He shoved the claimant to the ground and told him not to intervene or he would be arrested for obstruction of justice.\n\n[11] The claimant filed a report on the police\u2019s action that night at the prosecutor\u2019s office. The prosecutor was reluctant to accept the complaint. A copy of the claimant\u2019s police report dated XXXX, 2021 was submitted as evidence.[3]\n\n[12] The claimant testified XXXX started calling him about five days after his report hurling vulgar insults and threats against him for his complaint.\n\n[13] A few weeks after the XXXX\u2019s calls, the claimant was accosted as he left work by masked and armed men identifying themselves as CJNG members. They showed him a digital photo of his identity card which XXXX had taken. They told him to stop being a \u201csnitch\u201d, told him he was now on a blacklist and demanded XXXX pesos weekly or they would kill him.\n\n[14] The claimant moved back to M\u00e9rida at the beginning of XXXX 2021 to live with his mother. In XXXX, they started receiving calls from unknown callers who said nothing and did not leave messages. In early XXXX 2022, the claimant found a banner outside his home in which the CJNG said he owed them money and if he did not pay they would harm him for being a snitch. A photograph of the banner and a news article reporting on the banner and the claimant\u2019 s situation was submitted as evidence.[4]\n\n[15] The claimant filed a report with the prosecutor\u2019s office in M\u00e9rida about the banner and detailing the circumstances behind the threats to him. He also filed a complaint with the Human Rights Commission over the lack of action by the prosecutor\u2019s office in Cancun over his original complaint about the police. The claimant submitted copies of the two complaints as well as a letter from his lawyer XXXX as evidence.[5]\n\n[16] On XXXX, 2022 armed and masked men wearing clothing with CJNG insignia forced their way into the claimant\u2019s house. They beat the claimant and told him they came because he had not paid the fee demanded in Cancun. They stole whatever cash the claimant had in the house.\n\n[17] Since his departure from Mexico in XXXX 2022, masked and armed CJNG men went to his mother\u2019s house on XXXX, 2022 looking for him. They vandalized her house and told her the claimant would be killed because he did not pay the cartel. The claimant submitted as evidence, a letter from her, a photo of the damage to his mother\u2019s house, a news article about the CJNG raid of her house, and a copy of her complaint to the prosecutor\u2019 s office about the raid.[6]\n\n[18] Based on the documentary evidence and testimony, I find that the claimant has demonstrated that he faces a forward-facing personalized risk of harm from the CJNG if he returns to Mexico.\n\nState Protection\n\n[19] There is a presumption that a state has the capability to protect its citizens. A claimant can rebut that presumption, on the balance of probabilities, with clear and convincing evidence The claimant has an obligation to approach state authorities for protection if the protection might reasonably be forthcoming or it is objectively reasonable to seek protection. The burden of proof is directly proportional to the level of democracy in the country.\n\n[20] The objective evidence however shows that corruption in Mexico, including within the armed forces and federal police underpins state collusion with criminals. Local police are particularly vulnerable to corruption and infiltration from organized crime groups, as they are overworked, underpaid, and understaffed. The federal government has said infiltration by organized crime is a problem in many police forces around the country.[7]\n\n[21] In the claimant\u2019s case, one of his agents of harm was a XXXX in Cancun who was angered by the claimant\u2019s intervention in a potential unlawful detention. The XXXX was enraged when the claimant filed a complaint against him with the prosecutor\u2019 s office. He telephoned him to berate and threaten him, calling him a snitch. When the claimant was accosted by CJNG members in Cancun, they called him a snitch. The cartel had a digital photo of the claimant\u2019s electoral identity card. I find on the balance of probabilities that the Cancun XXXX who photographed the claimant\u2019s electoral identity card gave it to the CJNG and sent them after the claimant.\n\n[22] The claimant received no police protection despite filing complaints about the CJNG when they threatened him, when they hung a banner outside his house and when they attacked him in his home.\n\n[23] After considering the objective evidence, the documentary evidence, and the testimony, I find on the balance of probabilities that there is clear and convincing evidence that the claimant cannot receive adequate state protection in Mexico should he return.\n\nInternal Flight Alternative\n\n[24] The two-pronged test for an IFA is well-established. The panel must be satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that:\n\na) the claimant would not be subject personally to a danger of torture or to a risk of life or a risk of cruel and unusual punishment, or face a serious possibility of persecution in the proposed internal flight alternative; and\n\nb) that conditions in that part of the country are such that it would be objectively reasonable, in all the circumstances, including those particular to the claimant, for him to seek refuge there.[8]\n\n[25] Once the Panel has identified potential IFAs, the claimant has the burden of proof to show they do not have an IFA. During the hearing, I identified the city of Culiacan as a potential IFA.\n\n[26] I find that there is a risk of harm anywhere in Mexico because there is sufficient evidence to establish, on a balance of probabilities, that the agents of harm have the means and the motivation to locate the claimant in Mexico.\n\nThe IFA is not safe\n\n[27] Mexico is a large country with a population of over 130 million people covering an area of over 1.9 million sq. km.[9] The law provides for freedom of movement and the right to travel within Mexico. The panel must assess whether the agent of harm has both the \u201cmeans and motivation\u201d to locate the claimant in Culiacan. In making this assessment the panel considered the area of operation and level of interest in the claimant by the agent of harm.\n\nMeans of the agents of harm to locate the claimant in the IFA\n\n[28] The documentary evidence suggests that if a criminal group has a very strong motivation to find a person and they are one of the more powerful criminal organizations in Mexico, then they may be able to find individuals through various means. For example, the organization may have connections to government authorities, or may bribe people working for telephone companies to track phone calls or messages.[10] This objective evidence suggests that a large criminal organization such as a cartel may have the capabilities to track down an individual if they have the motivation to do so.\n\n[29] The claimant testified that the men who threatened him in Cancun after he filed a complaint against XXXX identified themselves CJNG members. The cartel also hung a banner outside his home in M\u00e9rida identifying themselves. According to the objective evidence, the CJNG has a presence in Cancun and M\u00e9rida.[11] I find on the balance of probabilities that the claimant\u2019s agents of harm are the CJNG.\n\n[30] Both the Mexican and American government have described the CJNG as one of the world\u2019s most prolific and violent drug trafficking organizations. The CJNG are a consolidated, well-organized criminal group with solid financial networks and diverse criminal activities with a supranational presence through its own presence or through allies in most of Mexico\u2019s states.[12] They are a criminal organization that could track down an individual in Mexico.\n\n[31] Based on the claimant\u2019s testimony and the documentary and objective evidence, I find on the balance of probabilities that the CJNG have the means to locate the claimant in Mexico.\n\nMotivation of the agents of harm to locate the claimant in the IFA\n\n[32] The second part of the first prong of assessing the proposed IFA is whether the agents of harm have the motivation to find the claimant if he returned to Mexico.\n\n[33] The objective evidence says, \u201ccriminal groups are motivated to track certain individuals because they steal or lose money; due to personal rivalries; for political incentives\/reasons or due to personal vengeance; perceived betrayal; public exposure of relationships with public officials, politicians or investments; or cooperation with authorities as informants or collaborative witnesses\u201d.[13]\n\n[34] In this case, the CJNG were threatening the claimant because of their connection to a Cancun XXXX who was angry that the claimant filed a complaint against him. The cartel took the opportunity to extort money from the claimant, but he did not pay and moved to M\u00e9rida and continued filing complaints against the CJNG. Revenge attacks against those that do not submit to their threats is part of the cartel\u2019s culture.[14]\n\n[35] Since the claimant came to Canada, the CJNG went to his mother\u2019s house looking for him in XXXX 2022. The Yucatan state prosecutor XXXX in XXXX 2022 XXXX. The claimant\u2019s mother XXXX went to the prosecutor\u2019s office to file a complaint against the XXXX. A copy of the XXXX and her complaint dated XXXX 2023 was submitted as evidence.[15]\n\n[36] The Yucatan Attorney General issued summonses for the claimant in XXXX, and XXXX 2022 to appear in court. I find on the balance of probabilities that the XXXX and the three summonses were orchestrated by the claimant\u2019s agents of harm to try to locate him. Copies of the three summonses were submitted as evidence.[16]\n\n[37] I find that the claimant has established on a balance of probabilities that the agents of harm have the motivation to find him in anywhere in Mexico. Accordingly, I find on a balance of probabilities that the claimant would be subject personally to a risk to his life, to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or to a danger of torture in Mexico and that the first prong of the IFA test has not been met.\n\nThe IFA is not reasonable\n\n[38] Given the circumstances of the claimant, I do not need to determine whether the claimant has met the burden to demonstrate, on a balance of probabilities, that the proposed IFA is unreasonable in all circumstances.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[39] Based on the totality of the evidence and the analysis above, the panel finds that the claimant is a person in need of protection pursuant to sections 97(1)(a) or (b) of the Act. Accordingly, his claim is accepted.\n\n(signed) Alexander Pannu\n\nAugust 21, 2023\n\n[1] Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n\n[2] Maldonado v.

They claim these two criminal organizations are linked or allied with each other. They detail four instances where members of LC and\/or the CJNG had assaulted them and one instance of attempted kidnapping between 2017 and 2022.\n\nDETERMINATION\n\n[4] I find that the Claimants are persons in need of protection as contemplated by section 97(1) of IRPA and therefore accept their claims.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nIdentity\n\n[5] I find on a balance of probabilities that each of the Claimants has established their personal and national identity as a citizen of Mexico through the identity documents filed, namely their passports.[2]\n\nCredibility\n\n[6] In claims before the RPD, there is a presumption that sworn testimony is true unless there is valid reason to doubt its truthfulness. I found the testimony of the Principal Claimant, the Associate Claimant RRS, and the Associate Claimant AGL to be consistent, compelling, and genuine.\n\n[7] The Associate Claimant RRS testified that on XXXX, 2017 members of LC beat him up and stabbed him on the street near his home in Mexico City. Over the following three months, the Principal Claimant was approached by members of the CJNG and received messages on Facebook asking for the Associate Claimant RRS\u2019 whereabouts. The Principal Claimant\u2019s father was also approached by individuals identifying as both members of LC and the CJNG who asked him about the Associate Claimant RRS. Following these incidents, the Principal Claimant, the Associate Claimant RRS, and their parents decided to move to XXXX, State of Mexico in XXXX 2017.\n\n[8] The Claimants had no further incidents with LC or the CJNG until XXXX 2021. One day in XXXX 2021, three armed members of the CJNG attacked the Principal Claimant, the Associate Claimant RRS, and their father in their yard. After the CJNG members were chased off by the neighbours, the Principal Claimant and Associate Claimant RRS took their father to a hospital in Cuajimalpa, Mexico City where their sister was living. They decided to relocate there and live with her. In XXXX 2021, two members of the CJNG attended the workplace of the Principal Claimant and the Associate Claimant RRS in order to collect an extortion fee from the\nXXXX. While they were there, they recognized the Principal Claimant and attacked him. Both the Associate Claimant RRS and his brother-in-law intervened and together they managed to fight them off and force them to leave. As they left, they said they would return and finish them off. Following this incident, the Associate Claimant RRS left Mexico to come to Canada.\n\n[9] The Principal Claimant was intercepted by four members of the CJNG two months later in XXXX 2022 as he was leaving work. They chased after him and attempted to assault him with an ice pick, but he managed to escape with only minor injuries. He went into hiding in XXXX with his aunt before leaving Mexico six months later. Shortly after he left, the Associate Claimant AGL began receiving calls every 2-4 weeks from people identifying as members of the CJNG asking her about the whereabouts of the Principal Claimant and the Associate Claimant RRS. They said they knew where she and the Minor Claimants lived. One day in XXXX 2022 when she was returning home from work, a white van pulled over and members of the CJNG tried to grab her. They yelled insults at her and asked about the Associate Claimant RRS and the Principal Claimant. She was able to run and get away by boarding a bus that was just across the street.\n\n[10] In support of these allegations, the Claimants have submitted several supporting documents, including: hospital reports, photos, police statement, and letters of support from the Principal Claimant\u2019s parents and brother-in-law. The hospital reports corroborate the testimony of the Claimants with respect to the dates of and injuries sustained in the assaults of XXXX, 2017 and XXXX 2021. The letter of support of JECU corroborates the Claimants\u2019 testimony with respect to the assault in XXXX 2021 and his own assault by the CJNG in XXXX 2023 after the Claimants had left. The letter of support of the Principal Claimant\u2019s parents also corroborates this latter assault of their son-in-law in XXXX 2023. These letters of support also claim that this has forced both the family of the Principal and Associate Claimant RRS, and the family of the Associate Claimant AGL, to relocate out of fear of further reprisals by the CJNG. These documents have no material inconsistencies, and I attach them full weight.\n\nPersonalized Prospective Risk Not Faced Generally\n\n[11] The NDP notes XXXX as a smaller Mexico City gang with associations with larger criminal organizations including the Tepito Union.[3] This is corroborated by the country condition disclosure package submitted by the Claimants.[4] I note that a link between LC and the CJNG is not specifically made out in these documents or the NDP. However, the territory of LC and the CJNG has been shown to overlap and the testimony of the Claimants demonstrates that the CJNG has been pursuing them as well. I will therefore accept a link between LC and the CJNG for the purposes of my analysis.\n\n[12] The NDP evidence shows that the CJNG is a well-organized, aggressive, and violent criminal group present in most of the Mexican states, and one of the largest and most dangerous criminal groups in the world.[5] The CJNG is known for its \u201caggressive use of violence\u201d, and activities of the CJNG include human trafficking, homicide, forced disappearances, and other forms of extreme violence.[6] The CJNG is reported to have the most operational capacity and is the only cartel, apart from the Sinaloa cartel, to have a national presence.[7] This profile of the CJNG is consistent with the claimant\u2019s testimony.\n\n[13] As part of my analysis, I must assess the nature, basis and degree of risk faced by the Claimants. I must then compare the nature and degree of the risk faced by the Claimants with the nature and degree of risk faced generally by others from Mexico.\n\n[14] I accept the vast capabilities, violent activities, and aggressive nature of the CJNG as well as their association with LC. The Claimants fear a future risk of death or serious harm from these criminal organizations. This constitutes the nature of risk faced by the Claimants. The underlying reason for this risk has not been made wholly clear as the Claimants have testified that they are not sure why LC and the CJNG have been pursuing them. However, I find the basis for this risk began with the assault of the Associate Claimant RRS on XXXX, 2017, from which the other four subsequent incidents have flowed.\n\n[15] The degree of risk faced by the Claimants is significantly higher than others in Mexico, both in severity and number of incidents. The Claimants have sustained serious injuries from four assaults and an attempted kidnapping by members of LC and the CJNG over six years and across multiple municipalities. These violent incidents were more concentrated in 2021 and 2022, demonstrating an increase in the efforts of the CJNG to harm the Claimants as time passed. I find this constitutes a repeated, linked, and escalating personal targeting of the Claimants by these criminal organizations, and that this sufficiently distinguishes the risk they face from the generalized risk faced by others in Mexico.\n\n[16] Accordingly I find, more likely than not, that the Claimants credibly would be personally subject to a prospective risk to life at the hands of LC and the CJNG should they return to Mexico. The risk they face is personalized and elevated relative to that of the general population due to the consistent attempts by members of LC or the CJNG to harm them over the span of several years in multiple different municipalities.\n\nState Protection\n\n[17] States are presumed to be capable of protecting their citizens except in situations where the state is in a state of complete breakdown.[8] The Claimants must rebut this presumption with clear and convincing evidence of the state\u2019s inability to protect its citizens for their claims to succeed. I find that the objective country evidence successfully rebuts this presumption and serves as clear and convincing evidence that adequate state protection is not available to the Claimants in Mexico.\n\n[18] The NDP evidence indicates that police forces in Mexico lack human and material resources to properly investigate crimes and that for all murders registered between 2010 and 2016, 94.8% of cases had no suspect facing charges.[9] According to the 2019 National Survey on Victimization and Perception of Public Safety, 93.2% of all crimes committed were either not reported or not investigated.[10] The NDP also states that 80% of police forces are controlled by criminals, that almost 60-70% are corrupted by organized crime, and that organized crime has infiltrated local police and politicians.[11] Other sources indicate that police at all levels (local, state, and federal) play a role in facilitating illegal businesses, working for organized crime, and systematically violating human rights.[12] Additionally, 59.2% of respondents in a 2019 survey reported that they had experienced an act of corruption with public security authorities.[13]\n\n[19] I note that a claimant is not required to risk their life to seek ineffective protection of a state merely to demonstrate that ineffectiveness.[14] The Principal Claimant\u2019s father tried to file an initial complaint following the assault of the Associate Claimant RRS on XXXX, 2017. However, the police informed him that LC was closely linked to the CJNG and that there could be negative consequences for filing a complaint against them. They were not willing to accept the complaint as a result. The Associate Claimant AGL also filed a complaint with the police after her attempted kidnapping but was too afraid to mention the CJNG in this complaint lest it attract their notice and motivate them to retaliate further against her.\n\n[20] In light of the objective country documentation and unsuccessful attempts by the Claimants to avail themselves of state protection, I find that the Claimants have rebutted the presumption of state protection and that adequate state protection would not be available to the Claimants in Mexico.\n\nInternal Flight Alternative\n\n[21] I raised the issue of IFA with the claimant at the outset of the hearing and proposed Merida as a viable IFA.\n\n[22] The Federal Court of Appeal has held that there is a two-pronged test for assessing an IFA.[15] The RPD must be satisfied that:\n\ni. There is no serious possibility of the claimant being persecuted in the part of the country to which it finds an IFA exists and\/or that it is more probable than not that the claimant would not be personally subject to a danger of torture or to a risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in the IFA; and\n\nii. The conditions in the part of the country considered to be an IFA must be such that it would not be unreasonable in all the circumstances, including those particular to the claim, for the claimant to seek refuge there.\n\n[23] Both prongs of the test must be satisfied to find that a claimant has an IFA. Once the issue of IFA has been raised and potential IFAs have been identified by the RPD, the burden of proof then rests with the claimant to show that they do not have a viable IFA in those locations.\n\nFirst Prong: Prospective Risk o(Harm in the IFA\n\n[24] The Claimants have not established a nexus to a Convention ground, nor have they adduced any evidence of a danger of torture at the hands of the state or by a public official. I will therefore focus the first prong of the IFA analysis on section 97(1)(b) and whether the claimant has demonstrated that, more likely than not, he would be personally subject to a prospective risk to his life or of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in the IFA of Merida. For the reasons outlined below, I find that the Claimants have successfully established that they would and therefore that Merida would not be a viable IFA.\n\nSufficient Means to Track the Claimants\n\n[25] The NDP evidence shows that the CJNG is a well-organized, aggressive, and violent criminal group present in most of the Mexican states, and one of the largest and most dangerous criminal groups in the world.[16] The activities of the CJNG include homicide, forced disappearances, kidnappings, drug production, drug trafficking, drug trade, extortion, and extreme violence.[17] The NDP also supports the claimant\u2019s allegations about forced recruitment by the cartels.[18] Additionally, the CJNG has a reported presence in Merida, though the NDP notes that violence there is much lower and criminal groups attempt to keep a low profile.[19]\n\n[26] The NDP further indicates that most organized criminal groups have the capacity to find an individual throughout Mexico if sufficiently motivated using family networks, private investigators, property records, GPS trackers, communications networks (e.g., cell phone towers), government databases, and police, army, government contacts, and alliances with other criminal organizations.[20]\n\n[27] Accordingly, based on the objective NDP evidence for Mexico, I find that LC and the CJNG have the capacity to track down the Claimants and harm the Claimants.\n\nSufficient Motivation ta Track the Claimants\n\n[27] The NDP evidence states that motivations for a criminal organization to track an individual down include large unpaid debts, stolen or lost money, personal vendettas or rivalries, political incentives, high-value personnel, people with privileged information about the criminal organization\u2019s operations, perceived betrayal, and cooperation with the authorities.[21]\n\n[28] The Associate Claimant RRS submitted that he did not know why LC and the CJNG were after him and said they must have mistaken him for someone else. While the reason why LC and the CJNG have pursued the Claimants remains unclear, LC and CJNG have demonstrated a motivation to locate the Claimants in multiple different municipalities in both Mexico City and the State of Mexico (discussed in more depth above). Members of LC and the CJNG first assaulted the Associate Claimant RRS in Mexico City in 2017. They then tracked the Principal Claimant, the Associate Claimant RRS, and their father down to XXXX, State of Mexico in 2021 and assaulted them. They tracked the Principal Claimant, the Associate Claimant RRS, and their father down to Cuajimalpa nine months later and assaulted them again. Several weeks later, after the Associate Claimant RRS had left Mexico, the Principal Claimant was again assaulted by members of the CJNG as he was leaving work. The Associate Claimant AGL received 4-5 phone calls from members of the CJNG inquiring about the whereabouts of the Principal Claimant and the Associate Claimant RRS. Finally, members of the CJNG attempted to kidnap the Associate Claimant AGL several months after the other two Claimants had already left.\n\n[29] Additionally, since their departure, the Principal Claimant\u2019s brother-in-law has been assaulted by members of the CJNG and asked about the whereabouts of the Claimants. This happened just a few months ago in XXXX 2023, prompting both families of the Claimants to move to Tlahuac and change their phone numbers. The interest of the CJNG in the Claimants therefore appears to be ongoing.\n\n[30] On the basis of the persistent actions taken by LC and the CJNG across various municipalities over the past 6 years, I find that the CJNG has demonstrated both the means and the motivation to track the Claimants down to the proposed IFA, should they relocate to Merida. Accordingly the Claimants have established that, more likely than not, they would be personally subject to a prospective risk to life or of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment should they seek refuge there.\n\n[31] As the Claimants have successfully challenged the proposed IFA under the first prong of the IFA analysis, I need not proceed with the second prong of the IFA analysis. I find that the Claimants do not have a viable IFA in Merida or indeed throughout Mexico.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[32] I find that the Claimants are persons in need of protection under section 97 of IRPA and accept their claims.\n\n(signed) Matthew Stumpf\n\nOctober 30, 2023\n\n[1] Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, SC 2001, c 27, as amended, ss 96, 97(l)(a) and 97(l)(b).\n\n[2] Exhibit 1.\n\n[3] NDP, Mexico, Tab 7.39 at p. 4: La Union Tepito.

In short, you are a professional XXXX with an expertise in XXXX. In 2017, you worked for the XXXX in charge of XXXX in Venezuela in the XXXX. In your XXXX role, you learned that your superior was in cahoots with the XXXX and they were stealing equipment and XXXX to sell to Colombia. After the XXXX completed his XXXX a number of months later, you made a police complaint against the former XXXX. Shortly afterwards, you were assaulted in XXXX of 2017 and the next day you made a police complaint again and then finally you were again threatened with death if you did not withdraw the two complaints that you made. You immediately went to a different state and received a number of threatening phone calls to withdraw the complaints or else.\n\n[4] In XXXX of 2018, you were attacked physically, and you escaped to Colombia and then to Mexico in of 2018. In XXXX 2019, the former XXXX against whom you made the complaints was XXXX. In XXXX of 2020, your ex-partner went to the Mexico embassy in Venezuela to get permission for your daughter to travel to Mexico and after that, you were fired from your job and you moved from Mexico City to Toluca for fear of further threats; however, you began to get threatening calls in Toluca. In XXXX of 2021, you tried to make a complaint to the police against the perpetrators but the police in Mexico would not take your complaint due to the XXXX of person you were making the complaint against.\n\n[5] You learned in 2022 that Mexicans could come to Canada without a visa, and you came to Canada in XXXX of 2022 to seek protection and finally made a refugee claim in August of 2022. The agent of persecution and his associates continued to call and threaten your family members in Venezuela and Mexico until very recently.\n\n[6] I find that you are a Convention refugee as you have established a serious possibility of persecution should you return to Venezuela or to Mexico based on your imputed political opinion.\n\n[7] I find that you have established your identity as a national of Venezuela and of Mexico by both your testimony and by the documents you\u2019ve provided including a certified true copy of your Mexican passport and a declaration from a Venezuelan lawyer at Exhibit 5, page 23, that you are a citizen of Venezuela. However, most of your Venezuelan identity documents are in Mexico now with your family members.\n\n[8] When a claimant swears that facts are true, this creates a presumption that they are true unless there is a valid reason to doubt their truthfulness. I find there were no substantial reasons to doubt your truthfulness. You testified in a straightforward and convincing manner, and you were able to answer all the questions that were asked. There were no discrepancies between any of the documents that you disclosed and your testimony that you were not able to adequately explain. I find you did not exaggerate your testimony even when it may have appeared beneficial to do so and after weighing all of the evidence, I find that you are credible on a balance of probabilities regarding the core elements of the claim, and I therefore believe what you have alleged in support of your claim. I accept on a balance of probabilities that you angered a powerful and influential, dishonest and corrupt politician in Venezuela, and you were targeted in Venezuela as a result. I accept that you left Venezuela for fear of being seriously harmed and the threats continued in Mexico.\n\n[9] I have no reason to doubt the authenticity of the personal documentary evidence that you disclosed, and I find on a balance of probabilities that the evidence supports and corroborates your allegations and I give it significant weight. For example, you disclosed a letter from your former partner in Venezuela and a letter from your mother in Mexico corroborating the core allegations, as well as a number of documents regarding your professional credentials, training, and jobs corroborating your experience as an XXXX along with the two police denunciations that are at the root of all of the threats and assaults against you that you made in Venezuela, and a medical report regarding the first time you were assaulted by the agents of persecution in 2017 in Venezuela.\n\n[10] I find that you have established a nexus to Section 96 by reason of your imputed political opinion, that being in opposition to the former XXXX who is the XXXX and that you are an opponent of the Government of Venezuela.\n\n[11] So based on the credibility of your allegations and the objective documentary evidence, I find you \u2018ve established there\u2019s a forward-facing risk that you will be subjected to mistreatment and violence at the hands of Venezuelan authorities and their affiliates in both Venezuela and Mexico owing to your Venezuelan anti-government political opinions.\n\n[12] The fact that you face these risks is corroborated by the documentary evidence provided by you and by the preponderance of the documentary evidence found in the National Documentation Package for Venezuela dated February 28th 2023, and the National Documentation Package for Mexico dated September 2022.\n\n[13] For example, Exhibit 2.1 in the Venezuela NDP, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, Major Human Rights Report, recent Human Rights Reports demonstrate that there continue to be widespread persecution throughout Venezuela against individuals known or suspected of being political opponents of the Madura regime with the government authorities, paramilitaries, Colectivos, and other political supporters targeting opponents of the regime with harassment, denial of services, severe discrimination, incarceration, and physical violence, and killing. The documentary evidence overwhelmingly corroborates that authorities in Venezuela do not tolerate dissent against government and state affiliated armed gangs known as Colectivos routinely commit acts of violence with impunity against civilians involved in anti-government activities such as your\n35 denunciations. The situation is described as a continuing human rights crisis with further reports of extrajudicial executions, excessive use of force, and unlawful killings by the security force during the year.\n\n[14] Item 7.1 in the Venezuela NDP addresses the issue of whistleblowers and says that over the past five years, there have been people fired as a result of exposing corruption in the XXXX and that\u2019s XXXX and there is also a report at page 5 in Exhibit 7.1 of a government employee\nwho went missing after reporting misconduct of local public officials much like your case. It\u2019 s common for the government in Venezuela to blacklist opponents or revealers of information such as yourself. You were provided a number of news articles corroborating the agent of persecution as being a powerful corrupt career politician who has been involved with the regime in Venezuela XXXX and is now involved with the XXXX recently as the XXXX when you uncovered his criminal activity and now recently as the XXXX, to XXXX at the times you \u2018ve alleged. The preponderance of the evidence in the NDP on Mexico establishes that police at all levels in Mexico are corrupt and collude with cartels and criminals and you have provided documentation regarding the connection between the Venezuelan politicians and the Mexican cartels.\n\n[15] With regard to the nature of the harm that you would face upon return to Venezuela and Mexico, I find that threats, intimidation, and physical violence at the hands of the agents of persecution clearly amount to persecution.\n\n[16] With regard to state protection in Venezuela, since the state is the agent of persecution, I find it would be objectively unreasonable for you to seek the protection of the state and therefore find you have rebutted the presumption of state protection in Venezuela.\n\n[17] In Mexico, the documentary evidence you have provided reveals the Mexico government is in support of the Venezuelan government and further, the documentary evidence in the most recent NDP for Mexico states, is very clear, the preponderance of the evidence is clear that corruption in the police remains a major problem in Mexico and there is little indication of improvement in recent years. For example, Exhibit 10.2 states that organized crime has deeply permeated police institutions at all levels, federal, state, local, in facilitating illegal businesses, working for organized crime, and systematically violating human trust, human rights. There is no trust between the different police forces as municipal and states police have been infiltrated by the drug cartels and are therefore rarely informed of operations led by federal police or the army. There are mechanisms available to report police corruption, yet surveys show that citizens are highly unlikely to file official complaints of corruption and the most cited reasons for doing so are waste of time and fear of reprisals, and that\u2019s found at item 10.2 in the NDP for Mexico.\n\n[18] So, the documentary evidence establishes that cartels throughout the country aim to dominate, intimidate local politicians and law enforcement in Mexico and infiltrate state authorities and therefore I find that you have rebutted the presumption of state protection in Mexico.\n\n[19] With regard to an Internal Flight Alternative in Venezuela, I find there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout the whole country given the documentary evidence that the authorities and their affiliates, the laws and the policies operate similarly throughout the entire country and therefore there is no IFA there for you and with regard to an Internal Flight Alternative in Mexico, I find that despite moving to various locations in Mexico, the perpetrators had the means to find you through clandestine networks and therefore they clearly have the motivation to pursue you, they clearly have the means to pursue you. As well, they clearly have the motivation to pursue you as evidenced by the ongoing contact and threats that they have made against your family members throughout Mexico. So, I therefore find there is no viable Internal Flight Alternative for you in Mexico.\n\n[20] So based on all of these reasons, I find that you are a Convention refugee and I accept your claim.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

Each claim was decided on its own merits. However, the panel advised the claimants that their individual testimony might affect the other claimants. The panel made decisions for each claimant.\n\nALLEGATIONS\n\n[3] The complete story alleging the basis of the claimants\u2019 fears are captured in their Basis of Claim (BOC) forms[3] and can be summarized as follows. The PC is the sun of XXXX and is married to the AC, XXXX and XXXX are married. The PC and his father our evangelical XXXX and have alleged that the lives of the entire family are threatened by the XXXX as well as the mainstream Catholic Church due to their XXXX as well as the various XXXX from the associate claimant and that they have faced professional or ministerial backlash which includes violence, acts of harassment and death threats.\n\n[4] The narratives of the PC and his father although separate are linked together with the PC facing continued persecution in Mexico after his father left Mexico in 2017. In XXXX 2020 XXXX left Mexico to be with her husband to flee religious persecution there and to assist her husband in his XXXX\n\nDETERMINATION\n\n[5] The panel finds that the claimants are Convention refugees within the meaning of section 96 of the IRPA.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nIdentity\n\n[6] The claimants\u2019 personal identities and Mexican nationality were established, on a balance of probabilities, based on a copy of their Mexican passports.[4]\n\nNexus\n\n[7] The claimants alleged that the persecution they face is due to their evangelical faith. The panel accepts that the claimants have established an access to one of the Convention grounds and, therefore, have assessed this claim against section 96 of the IRPA.\n\nCredibility\n\n[8] When a claimant swears that certain facts are true, this creates a presumption that they are true unless there is a valid reason to doubt their truthfulness.[5] In assessing the credibility of the evidence presented by both the PC and his father, the panel accepts, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimants are credible witnesses overall. Both claimants were able to respond to the panel\u2019s questions in a forthright matter and did not appear to embellish their claims.\n\n[9] The AC, XXXX was the first witness to testify and stated that he had degree in XXXX and had XXXX in an effort to expose many improper deeds and practices by the mainstream Catholic Church. He dedicated his life to the church as a XXXX commencing in 1999. Both he and the PC fear the XXXX (an evangelical religious movement).\n\n[10] The AC left this movement in 2013. The AC provided significant documentation\nincluding books and articles XXXX as a XXXX. He testified that XXXX were openly criticized and that he lost numerous job opportunities in the role of a XXXX. Accordingly, he began working as a XXXX at a XXXX in Mexico City where he began to XXXX some of his work colleagues in the XXXX of Jesus Christ.\n\n[11] On XXXX, 2016, the AC was involved in a serious accident where he has alleged that his motorcycle was rammed at a high speed from behind by a car whereby, he was significantly injured including a severely fractured XXXX requiring surgery. The PC was charged with a driving offence despite his protests, and he believes this was due to his religious XXXX. The AC provided numerous photos detailing his motorcycle accident and injuries and proof of his hospital treatment. He also provided numerous photos depicting his XXXX activities both in Mexico as well as his XXXX as a XXXX in Canada. A copy of a certificate of XXXX was also provided.\n\n[12] The AC also provided a letter of recommendation from a pastor of the XXXX in Mexico, together with a letter from the XXXX in Mexico confirming that the AC XXXX in an effort to expose falsehoods, hypocrisy and sins within the Catholic Church and the fact that the AC was threatened on numerous occasions to stop his XXXX\n\n[13] The PC testified that he was also XXXX as a XXXX, and he attended various indigenous churches to XXXX . He testified that stones were thrown at the family home located in the state of Mexico. The family home was also vandalized with graffiti and notes were left at the home that there would be attempts against the families\u2019 lives. The PC continued to carry out XXXX work in the states of Puebla and Mexico and that on occasion he noted that he was being followed by vans. On XXXX , 2021, four individuals on two motorcycles were in front of his home and on XXXX, 2021 a van followed him. He was afraid for his safety and drove to a shopping centre and filed a report with the authorities who refused to do anything. On XXXX, 2022, while on a XXXX to the state of Puebla, the PC\u2019s vehicle was followed by a car\nwith armed personnel, but the PC was able to avoid them.\n\n[14] The claimants have alleged that the authorities do not wish to get involved in religious affairs or problems and that they fear for their safety because the church has fanatics throughout every state in Mexico.\n\n[15] The PC was also able to provide a copy of the police report detailing the acts of intimidation against him, together with his certificate of XXXX and a letter of support from a pastor in Mexico.[6]\n\n[16] The panel finds both the PC and the AC, his father to be credible witnesses. Accordingly, the claimants have established their subjective fear of persecution based on their evangelical Christian faith.\n\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution\n\n[17] The panel has sought guidance from the most recent National Documentation Package (NDP) for Mexico to assess the objective basis for the claimant\u2019s fear of persecution based on his religion.\n\n[18] The documentary evidence indicates the religious composition of Mexico as follows: \u201cAccording to the 2020 Mexican government census, approximately 78 percent of the population identifies as Roman Catholic (compared with 83 percent in 2010); 10 percent as Protestant or Christian evangelical; and 1.5 percent as other religious groups, including Judaism, Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Church of Jesus Christ), and Islam.\u201d[7] The panel notes that there is no information regarding the XXXX sect in the NDP.\n\n[19] However, the claimants were able to provide documentary evidence regarding the religious intolerance in Mexico against evangelicals. A report from the ANSA stated that \u201creligious intolerance in Mexico, especially against the evangelical minority is on the rise, with expulsions of dozens of families, especially in indigenous communities, harassment and even murders, as well as high levels of impunity.\u201d The article further indicated that in most cases the attacks came from traditionalist Catholics in a country considered the second most Catholic in the world.[8] a further article provided by the claimants stated that the expansion of violent criminal groups in Mexico and the climate of impunity surrounding such crimes has led to an increase in violence against religious leaders.\n\n[20] Accordingly, given the documentary evidence and both claimants testimony, the claimants have established the objective basis for their well- founded fear of persecution. Given this, the panel finds that the claimants face a serious possibility of persecution due to their evangelical faith in Mexico.\n\nInternal Flight Alternative (IFA)\n\n[21] At the outset of the hearing, the panel proposed the IFA location of Cabo San Lucas, Baja California Sur.\n\n[22] The test to be applied in determining whether there is a viable IFA is two-pronged and both prongs must be satisfied for a finding that a claimant has a viable IFA. First, the panel must find that there is no serious possibility of the claimant being persecuted nor risk to life, danger of torture or of cruel and unusual treatment, on a balance of probabilities, in the proposed IFA.[9]\nThe claimant bears the burden of proof to show that there is a reasonable chance that persecution will occur in the entire country and specifically in the proposed IFA. Secondly, the panel must be satisfied that conditions in the suggested IFA are not such that it would be objectively unreasonable in all the circumstances, including those particular to the claimant, to relocate and reside there.[10]\n\n[23] The panel has considered the totality of the evidence and finds that there is a serious possibility of persecution for the claimants in the proposed IFA location.\n\n[24] The panel acknowledges that Mexico is a large country with a population of over 132 million people covering an area of over 1.9 million sq. km. In addition, the Mexican constitution provides all persons the right to religious freedom, including the right to engage in religious ceremonies and acts of worship. [11]\n\n[25] Accordingly, the objective documentary evidence before the panel indicates that there is a serious possibility of persecution even in the region considered \u201csafest\u201d in Mexico. Given that Mexico is predominantly a Catholic country, the claimants\u2019 counsel submitted that the claimants are at risk of persecution throughout Mexico if they were to freely practice their religion. Both the PC and his father testify that they would continue to XXXX their evangelical faith throughout Mexico. A report found in the NDP stated that Catholicism is very important part of most Mexican peoples\u2019 lives, and that old-fashioned \u201cmacho\u201d and conservative Catholic attitudes prevail in the country.[12] In addition, tab 12.1 of the NDP outlines incidents where religious minorities in Mexico have experienced discrimination and intolerance.\n\n[26] Having carefully considered the totality of the evidence, the panel finds that there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout Mexico. Thus, given the particular circumstances of the claimants who are evangelical Catholics, an internal flight alternative is not viable. Given that the test failed on the first prong, the panel did not consider the second test of reasonableness.\n\nState Protection\n\n[27] There is a presumption that except in situations where the state is in complete breakdown, the state is capable of protecting its citizens. To rebut the presumption of state protection, a claimant must provide clear and convincing evidence of the state\u2019s inability to protect its citizens. [13]\n\n[28] The US Department of State (DOS) Mexico Country Report on Human Rights 2021 states as follows: Significant human rights issues included credible reports of: unlawful or arbitrary killings by police, military, and other governmental officials; forced disappearance by government agents; torture and degrading treatment by security forces; harsh and life-threatening prison conditions; arbitrary arrest or detention; restrictions on free expression and media, including violence against journalists; acts of corruption; insufficient investigation of and accountability for gender-based violence, including but not limited to domestic and intimate partner violence; crimes involving violence or threats of violence targeting persons with disabilities; and crimes involving violence or threats of violence targeting lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and intersex persons. Impunity and extremely low rates of prosecution remained a problem for all crimes, including human rights abuses and corruption. There were reports some government agents were complicit with international organized criminal gangs, and prosecution and conviction rates were low for these abuses.[14]\n\n[29] The Mexico Freedom in the World 2022 indicates that \u201cMexico\u2019 s justice system is plagued by delays, unpredictability, and corruption, which often lead to impunity for perpetrators of crimes.\u201d [15]\n\n[30] The National Documentation Package (NDP) for Mexico and the documents submitted by the claimant make clear that the state is ineffective and in these particular circumstances, there is clear and convincing evidence that the state is unable or unwilling to protect the claimants. Accordingly, the panel finds that the claimants have met the burden of proof, on a balance of probabilities, and the presumption of state protection has been rebutted.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[31] For the following reasons, the panel finds that the claimants are Convention refugees.\n\n[32] Their claims are therefore accepted.\n\n(signed) Kevin Cantor\n\nNovember 6, 2023\n\n[1] Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27 as amended, sections 96 and 97(1).\n\n[2] Refugee Protection Division Rules, (SOR\/2012-256), Rule 55.\n\n[3] Exhibits21.-2.4.\n\n[4] Exhibit 1\n\n[5] Maldonado v.

In summary, the claimants are lesbian partners and were social activists in Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco state. They claim that they face a well-founded fear of persecution in Mexico because of their sexual orientation and a risk of harm from government officials who opposed their anti\u00ad corruption denunciations and media activities.\n\nDETERMINATION\n\n[3] The claimants have established that they face a well-founded fear of persecution because of their membership in a particular social group, namely lesbian women. They also face a risk of harm from government officials because of their legal denunciations against corruption and exposing them to the media.\n\n[4] The panel finds that the claimants have a well-founded fear of persecution and face a serious possibility of harm if they return to Mexico. Accordingly, I find that they are Convention refugees, and I accept both the claimant and associate claimant\u2019s application for refugee protection under s.96 of IRPA.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nIdentity\n\n[5] The claimants established their identity, on the balance of probabilities, as citizens of Mexico through their testimony and by submitting a copy of their Mexican passports.\n\nNexus\n\n[6] The panel finds that there is a nexus between the claimants\u2019 allegations and one of the grounds for being a Convention refugee, namely membership in a particular social group, based on sexual orientation. The claimants identify as lesbians. It is well-established that those fleeing persecution on account of their sexual orientation fall within the ambit of the particular social group category in Canadian refugee law. Their claims were assessed primarily under s.96 of the Act.\n\nCredibility\n\n[7] When a claimant swears to the truth of their allegations, this creates a presumption that those allegations are true, unless there is reason to doubt their truthfulness.[2] Both claimants\u2019 testimonies were consistent with their BOC narratives. Their responses to the panel\u2019s questions were spontaneous and they did not embellish their evidence. Based on their testimony and the documents submitted as evidence, I find on a balance of probabilities that the claimants and their evidence are credible.\n\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution\n\nSubjective Fear\n\n[8] The claimant testified she grew up with siblings in a devout Catholic home in Acapulco, Guerrero state. Her father held very conservative views about the role of men, women, and the family, and her mother deferred to her older husband. Her family environment in which she grew up in was one in which traditional views of society were the norm, with anything outside of that \u2013 like homosexuality \u2013 being considered immoral and wrong and not spoken about.\n\n[9] She realized she was attracted to women as a young girl but never acted upon her feelings because of the homophobic attitudes other family. As she grew older, she was pressured by her mother to act more feminine and have a boyfriend. Her older brother continued to insult her with derogatory names given to lesbians in Mexico. The claimant said at times she felt XXXX.\n\n[10] The claimant had her first relationship with a woman, XXXX, when she was 20 and studying at a XXXX institution while living with her godparents in Guadalajara. She moved back in with her parents when they relocated to Guadalajara for work. Her parents were suspicious of the claimant\u2019 s relationship with XXXX, and she admitted to them that she was lesbian. The disapproval of both their parents led Ms. XXXX and XXXX to run away together to Puerto Vallarta in 1991. The claimant\u2019s father learned of their location and went to their house and physically attacked them with a hammer.\n\n[11] The relationship with XXXX eventually ended and the claimant had relationships with XXXX and then XXXX before she met the associate claimant in XXXX 2011. Ms. XXXX submitted a letter as evidence corroborating her relationship with the claimant.[3] Ms. XXXX and Ms. XXXX have been in a relationship since then. The claimant submitted photos and social media posts to corroborate their long-term relationship.[4]\n\n[12] The claimant testified that she and the associate claimant kept their relationship secret at first to avoid homophobic harassment. In 2014, their neighbourhood in Puerto Vallarta was flooded and the residents lost most of their possessions. They believed the local government had accepted bribes to allow construction of homes in a flood-prone area and to approve construction of a bridge which caused the flood. The claimant and her neighbours filed a complaint against the local government to compensate them for the flood damage to their homes and to correct the construction work. The claimant sent out and engaged with media to expose the government officials. They discovered that funding had been authorized to pay damages but had not been paid to the people affected. The claimant and neighbours filed a criminal complaint with the Prosecutor\u2019s office against the officials for the diversion of funds.\n\n[13] The claimants pressed for action for two years, but their criminal complaint went nowhere with the Prosecutor. The claimants received threatening messages on their phones and in person warning them to stop investigating the complaint. People in the Prosecutor\u2019s office hinted to them to drop their complaint.\n\n[14] In XXXX 2016, the claimants and three other women formed a XXXX to XXXX. They secured space in a public square, XXXX, to XXXX and paid rent to the City of Puerto Vallarta. However, when they asked for rental receipts for tax purposes, they discovered that some city officials were pocketing the rents paid by hundreds of businesses operating in the city\u2019s XXXX.\n\n[15] The corrupt officials cancelled a popular event in the XXXX and spread disinformation to other merchants blaming the claimants for the cancellation. The claimants were threatened by some of the merchants. The XXXX filed a criminal complaint against the XXXX for Puerto Vallarta, XXXX and his XXXX for the diversion of the rents and for defaming them by blaming them for the event cancellation. A copy of the complaint was submitted as evidence.[5] The XXXX and regularly briefed the media. A former member of the XXXX, submitted a letter as\nevidence corroborating the claimant\u2019s account of the flooding complaint and diversion of rents for the XXXX.[6] A neighbour and member of the XXXX, also submitted a letter corroborating the claimant on the two incidents in question.[7]\n\n[16] The claimants started receiving explicit threats from officials in the XXXX asking them to stop their activities. The claimants stopped their media activity, but harassment continued. The claimant lost her job working for the XXXX. The XXXX\u2019s licenses to XXXX were revoked. The claimant testified that unknown men in civilian clothes were monitoring their home and taking photographs.\n\n[17] On XXXX, 2020, six armed men in civilian clothes in police vehicles attempted to take the claimants from their home, allegedly to the Prosecutor\u2019s office. The claimants\nrefused to go with the men. A neighbour, XXXX, witnessed the armed men at the claimant\u2019 s door and submitted a letter as evidence.[8]\n\n[18] The claimants fled Puerto Vallarta and went to Ms. XXXX\u2019s mother\u2019s house in Nayarit. They hid when armed men came to the house in XXXX 2020. They next hid at the claimant\u2019s brother XXXX\u2019s house in Guanajuato from XXXX 2020 until XXXX 2021 when he started receiving death threats on his phone. XXXX submitted a letter as evidence corroborating the claimant\u2019s account.[9] The claimants returned to hide at Ms. XXXX\u2019s mother\u2019s house from XXXX to XXXX 2021. Armed men again went to Nayarit to look for the claimants. The claimants finally hid at Ms. XXXX parents\u2019 place in Guadalajara until they fled to Canada in XXXX 2022.\n\n[19] Based on the testimony and documentary evidence, I find on the balance of probabilities that the claimants established they are lesbians and suffered persecution because of their sexual orientation. I also find that the claimants face a risk of harm from corrupt government officials whose activities the claimants helped expose.\n\nObjective Evidence\n\n[20] According to the objective evidence, although there have been advances in Mexico\u2019s legislation to recognize equality, discrimination based on sexual orientation, as well as gender identity and expression, is a structural phenomenon rooted in Mexican society, and occurs daily, at multiple levels: in family, work and institutional environments.[10] Both claimants testified that their families were strongly against the LGBTQ community and their relationship was largely secret in public except to their friends and fellow members of the community. In accordance with Guideline 9, the claimants cannot be expected to hide their sexual orientation to live safely in Mexico.\n\n[21] The evidence also shows that legislative attempts to stop discrimination do not necessarily translate into effective actions in reality for members of the LBGTQ community. Laws providing rights to sexual and gender minorities over the past five years have made them more visible in Mexican society, and as a result more vulnerable to homophobic and transphobic violence. Increased visibility has actually increased public misperceptions and false stereotypes about the gay and transgender communities. This has produced fears about these communities, such as that being gay or transgender is \u2018contagious\u2019. These fears have in turn led to hate crimes and murders of LGBTQ people.[11]\n\n[22]I considered the points raised in the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9 on Proceedings Before the IRB Involving Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Expression, and Sex Characteristics.[12] Based on the objective evidence and testimony, I find on the balance of probabilities that the claimants have a well-founded fear of persecution based on their gender and sexual orientation if they return to Mexico.\n\nState Protection\n\n[23] There is a presumption that a state has the capability to protect its citizens. A claimant can rebut that presumption, on the balance of probabilities, with clear and convincing evidence. The claimant has an obligation to approach state authorities for protection if the protection might reasonably be forthcoming or it is objectively reasonable to seek protection. The burden of proof is directly proportional to the level of democracy in the country.\n\n[24] Mexico is a federal presidential republic with free and fair elections, a large population of 130 million people and the 11th largest economy in the world. The claimant\u2019 s burden of proof is high.\n\n[25] The objective evidence however shows that corruption, including within the armed forces and federal police, underpins state collusion with criminals. Local police are particularly vulnerable to corruption and infiltration from organized crime groups, as they are overworked, underpaid, and understaffed. The federal government has said infiltration by organized crime is a problem in many police forces around the country.[13]\n\n[26] The claimants said they received threats from members of the government that were supposedly investigating their criminal complaints against corrupt government officials. The claimant testified that armed men in police vehicles came to her house to possibly kidnap her at the direction of the corrupt government officials they had angered. This incident was witnessed by a neighbour.\n\n[27] After considering the objective evidence, the documentary evidence, and the testimony, I find on the balance of probabilities that there is clear and convincing evidence that the claimants cannot receive adequate state protection in Mexico should they return.\n\nInternal Flight Alternative\n\n[28] The two-pronged test for an IFA is well-established. The panel must be satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that:\n\na) the claimant would not be subject personally to a danger of torture or to a risk of life or a risk of cruel and unusual punishment, or face a serious possibility of persecution in the proposed internal flight alternative; and\n\nb) that conditions in that part of the country are such that it would be objectively reasonable, in all the circumstances, including those particular to the claimant, for them to seek refuge there.[14]\n\n[29] The panel has considered the two prongs in assessing whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for the claimants and finds that it does not. On the evidence before me, I find that there is a serious possibility of the claimants being persecuted in any part of Mexico. The claimants would not attempt to hide their sexual orientation should they return to Mexico, nor are they required by Canadian refugee law to do so. The objective evidence shows that persecution based on sexual orientation is widespread throughout Mexico and even in so-called gay-friendly neighbourhoods in Mexico City and some tourist cities, members of the LGBTQ community are targeted for verbal and physical assaults and robberies.\n\n[30] Mexico remains a conservative country outside of some neighbourhoods in Mexico City and some of the cities catering to tourists. Conservative attitudes prevail in parts of the country and public displays of affection between members of the same sex may not be considered socially acceptable in some areas. Discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity is widely prevalent, despite a gradual increase in public tolerance of LGBTQ individuals according to public opinion surveys.[15]\n\n[31] Accordingly, I find on a balance of probabilities, that there is no viable IFA in Mexico.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[32] Based on the totality of the evidence and the analysis above, the panel finds that the claimant has a well-founded fear of persecution pursuant to section 96 of the Act.\nAccordingly, her claim and the claim of the associate claimant are accepted.\n\n(signed) Alexander Pannu\n\nJuly 18, 2023\n\n[1] Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n\n[2] Maldonado v.

Gonzalez Ponce\nCountry: Mexico\nRPD Number: TC2-12570\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2023-01721\nATIP Pages: 000036-000040\n\nDECISION\n\n[1] MEMBER: This is a decision of the Refugee Protection Division for XXXX. You are a citizen of Mexico and claim protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. I considered your testimony and the other evidence in your claim, and I will now render my decision. The written decision will be mailed to you in due course.\n\nALLEGATIONS\n\n[2] You fear persecution in Mexico because of threats and physical abuse be received by people demanding that you XXXX in your role as an XXXX Hidalgo. You also feel -\u00ad fear persecution from Mexican authorities and society because of your identity as a gay man. You alleged that there is no state protection for you and no internal flight alternative in Mexico.\n\nDETERMINATION\n\n[3] You are a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA, as you face a serious possibility of persecution in Mexico because of your membership in a particular social group, as a gay man.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nIdentity\n\n[4] Your personal and national identity is established by a copy of your Mexican passport.\n\nCredibility\n\n[5] There is a presumption in Canadian refugee law that when someone promises to tell the truth, as you did, the testimony that follows is true, unless I have good reason to doubt it. You testified in a generally consistent, spontaneous, and straightforward manner regarding the central elements of your allegations. There were no material inconsistencies in your evidence which have not been satisfactorily explained. The presumption of truth holds in your claim. I can believe and rely upon your evidence.\n\n[6] Specifically, you established with your moving testimony and corroborative documentation that you are a gay man who has experienced relentless homophobia harassment in the workplace from your superiors and other colleagues, including in your XXXX role as an XXXX. Your direct superior and a recent XXXX role even refused to share an office with you because he assumed you were gay.\n\n[7] You have also experienced anti-gay harassment in public, including an incident of sexual assault in XXXX 2018 during which you were groped and ridiculed by a man. You were publicly harassed twice when you tried to show affection to your former partner, OA (ph). You have made other gay friends in Canada and have been able to express yourself as a gay man here in ways that you feel are impossible in Mexico because of the strong anti-gay sentiment there.\n\n[8] You provided supplementary documentation to corroborate your allegations, including articles describing routine violence against members of the LGBTQ+ community in Mexico, and a letter from a gay friend in Canada, who describes how you met, the joy of being able to relate to other Spanish-speaking gay men in Canada, and the frank conversations you have had about the difficulties you have suffered in Mexico because of your sexual orientation.\n\n[9] I find that these documents corroborate your allegations regarding your sexual orientation and the ant-gay discrimination you have endured in Mexico.\n\nObjective Basis\n\n[10] Your fear of persecution is established by your credible testimony. l also find that your claim is objectively well-founded. The objective evidence consistently indicates that the legal protections and recognitions of LGBTQ+ persons that exist in Mexico do not accurately reflect the actual situation for many sexual minorities in that country, which is often dire.\n\n[11] There is a federal ban on discrimination based on sexual orientation in Mexico, and same-sex couples can be married there. At the same time, anti-LGBTQ+ discrimination at the societal level is widespread, with transgender individuals facing some of the most extreme forms of persecution. I infer from this mixed evidence that sexual minorities in Mexico are not treated identically by society and authorities.\n\n[12] It is therefore necessary to consider your personal circumstances and whether or not those circumstances internet with Mexican society and the authorities in such a way as to create a serious possibility of persecution for you.\n\n[13] You are a gay man, and you testified that you experienced homophobic harassment by people in the workplace and in public for being perceived as gay, despite you not being open to most people about your sexual orientation. You testified that your speech and mannerisms may be interpreted by others as feminine or gay. I therefore find from your evidence that your identity as a gay man is obvious to most onlookers.\n\n[14] I find that gay men who are easy to \u2014 I find that gay men who are easy to identify as gay men by employers, colleagues, authorities, and society generally, are at greater risk of suffering a homophobia endemic in Mexican culture. Your personal experiences bear this out. You credibly testified to routine harassment at work and in public for being perceived as gay. This aligns with the survey identified at Item 6.4 of the NDP, which indicate that half of all LGBTQ+ respondents experienced harassment or discrimination in the workplace, and that gay men in particular constituted 31 percent of the known 117 LGBTQ+ members in Mexico during the 2018-2019 period.\n\n[15] Because you were a XXXX in Mexico who worked side by side with XXXX your experience of publicly identifiable gay members also exposed you to anti-gay discrimination by Mexican law enforcement. Your experiences of harassment by your colleagues who are XXXX are echoed by accounts of XXXX homophobia in the objective evidence.\n\n[16] For example, the NDP discusses an incident during which two (2) men were arrested for kissing on a beach in Quintana Roo. Your experience of homophobic sexual assault in XXXX 2018 is unfortunately unsurprising considering the objective evidence.\n\n[17] An lnter-American Commission of Human Rights, IACHR, report discusses concern with regard to the rising number and increasingly violent nature of crimes based on prejudice against LGBT persons, and the civil rights organization, Letra Asida (ph), even reports on the existence of criminal gangs dedicated to targeting gay men.\n\n[18] ln view of the above, I find that your fear of persecution in Mexico is well-founded.\n\nState Protection\n\n[19] If refugee claimants have access to adequate national or state protection of their country of citizenship, they do not require Canada for protection. lt is incumbent on claimants to rebut the presumption of state protection with clear and convincing evidence. You testified that if you were to ever report the anti-gay harassment you had experienced in Mexico to the authorities, such as to the police, they would laugh at you.\n\n[20] You testified that police would not work and routinely called you anti-gay slurs. You believe that the authorities in Mexico have considered gay men to be unserious clowns. You fear not being able to access state protection. It is against your fear of \u2014 your fear of not being able to access state protection as a gay man is represented in the objective evidence. lt indicates that legal protections for LGBTQ individuals in Mexico are not uniformly enforced. And if the government did not always investigate and punish those complicit in abuses against LGBTI individuals.\n\n[21] When considering your attempts to access protection in the \u2014 let me rephrase that. In considering your evidence regarding your hesitancy to access state protection, and the objective evidence, I find that you have rebutted the presumption of protection in Mexico.\n\nInternal Flight Alternative\n\n[22] If refugee claimants can flee to safety within their own country, they do not require Canada\u2019s protection. The Panel must apply a two (2)-prong test to determine whether there is a viable effect. First, the Panel must be satisfied on a balance of probabilities there is no serious possibility of persecution in the proposed location. And second, conditions in the proposed IFA must be such that would not be unreasonable in all the circumstances, including those particular to you, for you to seek refuge there.\n\n[23] Most of the anti-gay discrimination you have experienced occurred in the city of Hidalgo. When I asked you about whether or not you could be safe in Mexico City, you testified that while you considered moving elsewhere in the country before moving to Canada, you real ized that nowhere would be safe for you, that your relatives in other areas like Mexico City and Michoacan, advise you \u2014 they do not believe you could be safe there? You discussed the case of a high-profile magistrate in Mexico City who was murdered for advancing a pro LGBTQ+ policy agenda. And you reiterated that you do not think anywhere would be safe.\n\n[24] The objective evidence seems to indicate that some places in Mexico, including urban centers like Mexico City, are safer and more welcoming of LGBTQ+ individuals than others. For example, Mexico City legally recognizes changes in gender identities, while other places like Monterrey and M\u00e9rida do not. And recent national survey indicates that residents of Mexico City have significantly less homophobic views than the national average when it comes to attitudes towards same-sex couples living together.\n\n[25] However, it remains unreasonable to expect you to hide or change a fundamental aspect of who you are to be safe in Mexico. In view of your particular circumstances as a publicly identifiable gay man who has experienced relentless homophobia and working in public, in conjunction with the objective evidence, which discusses the prevalence of homophobia throughout Mexican society, it describes anti-LGBTQ discrimination in Mexico as a structural phenomenon with extensive social roots.\n\n[26] I find on a balance of probabilities that you would face a serious possibility of persecution throughout Mexico. As you face a serious possibility of persecution throughout Mexico, there is no viable IFA for you in that country. Tt is not necessary for me to assess the second prong of the IFA test.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[27] You are a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA, as you face a serious possibility of persecution in Mexico because of your membership in a particular social group, as a gay man. Accordingly, I accept your claim.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

The principal claimant is a 37-year-old male who is a XXXX and the associate claim is a 36-year-old female who is also a XXXX and has three (3) children, ages seven (7), 10, and 14 years old, who are the minor claimants listed in this claim.\n\n[2] The claimants fear the corrupt CJNG cartel. The principal claimant worked as a XXXX at XXXX in Canc\u00fan, making a comfortable income for his family. The principal claimant was kidnapped by the CJNG cartel for the first time on XXXX, 2019, as he was leaving work. He was blindfolded, beaten, and forcibly taken to an unknown location where he was informed that he was to XXXX \u2014 he was the XXXX the boss wanted. The principal claimant was threatened with a gun and forced to XXXX for 10 members of the cartel and then was again blindfolded and driven back where he was taken from. The cartel took nothing from the principal claimant but told him that he must be available any time he was summoned and threatened him not to (inaudible) police.\n\n[3] The principal claimant received a voice message on XXXX, 2019, from the cartel informing him that he was going to be picked up after work tomorrow. ln fear, the claimant went to work the next day, where he was intercepted by the cartel, blindfolded, and forced into a van once again. Again, the principal claimant was told it was a good thing he did not try to go to the police and forced to XXXX for his boss. The principal claimant was blindfolded again, taken into a van, dropped off at the same place as last time, and again warned and threatened by the cartel members.\n\n[4] The principal claimant again received another call by the cartel on XXXX, 2019, informing him the same would occur the next day. The principal claimant was taken again in the same manner and forced to XXXX for the cartel. This time, the principal claimant met another XXXX who told him to try and escape far away with his family as this man himself had already tried to escape and one (1) of his family members had been killed by the cartel.\n\n[5] In fear, the claimants took their children out of school, moved to a relative\u2019s home in Canc\u00fan, and filed a denunciation. The claimants noticed strange vehicles in the area and moved to the other brother\u2019s home of the associate claimant in Playa del Carmen. The principal claimant asked for a work transfer, which was granted during this time. The claimants began to receive threatening calls that the cartel was aware of the denunciation and they could not escape them. When the claimant was stopped answering the phone calls, they continued to receive threatening text messages.\n\n[6] The principal claimant was informed by co-workers that armed men are looking for him at his old workplace. The claimants then moved to the principal claimant\u2019s father\u2019s home in XXXX, Yucat\u00e1n, never leaving their home and children not attending school.\n\n[7] The claimants applied for their passports. The principal claimant arrived in Canada on, XXXX, 2019, and the associate claimant along with the minors arrived in Canada on XXXX, 2020. The claimants filed for protection on November 3rd, 2020.\n\n[8] In terms of the delay, which I asked the principal claimant about, he indicated that when he first arrived in Canada, he was hoping that things would get better, but he and his family continued to be threatened. The principal claimant testified that once he learned about Canada\u2019s refugee protection through a friend, he started his family\u2019s application. I accept this as a reasonable explanation and I draw no negative inference.\n\n[9] I find that your identities as nationals of Mexico are established by the documents provided, including certified copies of your Mexican passports.\n\n[10] ln terms of credibility, I am reminded of the case of Maldonado, which establishes that when a claimant swears to the truth of allegations, this creates a presumption that those allegations are true unless there is a reason to doubt their truthfulness.\n\n[11] I find you to be credible witnesses and therefore believe what you have alleged in support of your claim. You have testified in a straightforward manner, and there were no relevant inconsistencies in your testimony or contradictions between your testimony and the other evidence before me.\n\n[12] You provided supporting material, including a copy of the denunciation files, employment and educational documentation, pictures and copies of the threats that you received via text, a copy of the medical treatment the PC sought after his kidnapping on XXXX, 2019, and affidavits and letters of support from family members, neighbours, and co-workers, all of which corroborate your allegations.\n\n[13] Based on the credibility of the claimants\u2019 allegations, the principal claimant\u2019s identity as someone who defied and escaped the cartel\u2019s demand to work for them, and the objective documentary evidence set out below, I find that the claimants have established on a balance of probabilities that if they return to Mexico, they will be subjected to violence at the hands of the cartel.\n\n[14] The harm that the claims would face upon return to Mexico clearly amounts to a personalized risk to cruel or unusual treatment or punishment. That is, they would face a personalized risk to their lives because the principal claimant defied them and did not do as he was instructed by the cartel. This is a risk not generally faced by the Mexican population because it is defined by the claimants as the PC again defied the cartel\u2019s demands to work for them. For these reasons, I find that the claimants face a section 97 risk in Mexico.\n\n[15] There is a presumption that the state has the ability to protect its citizens. That presumption can be rebutted by clear and convincing evidence that it is not reasonable to seek state protection or that state protection will not reasonably be forthcoming.\n\n[16] The documentary evidence clearly establishes that corruption in the police force in Mexico is a serious problem with no indication of improvement in recent years. Organized crime has deeply infiltrated police institutions at all levels, and law enforcement agencies have been involved in facilitation of illegal business activities, working for organized crime, and systematically violating human rights. Item 9.10 of the NDP states that there is a blatant corruption and abuse of power within the police and that they are involved in crimes. They have been reported by the National Anti-Corruption System. They have also \u2014 there have also been credible reports of police involvement in kidnapping for ransom and that federal officials are sometimes accused of perpetrating these crimes.\n\n[17] Given the clearly documented state of police corruption coupled with the fact that it is well-documented that cartels have infiltrated the police and the claimants cannot be expected to turn to the state for protection \u2014 therefore, the presumption of state protection is rebutted.\n\n[18] In terms of internal flight alternative, at the beginning of the hearing, I suggested the internal flight alternative of M\u00e9rida, Yucat\u00e1n, could exist. I must consider if the cartel would have the motivation and capacity to pursue the claimants if they relocated in Mexico.\n\n[19] However, after considering ail the evidence, I find that the claimants have established on a balance of probabilities that the agents of harm, specifically the CJNG cartel, have the capacity and the motivation to locate them throughout Mexico.\n\n[20] The objective evidence indicates that cartels are extremely powerful and believed to have a presence in every part of the country. The objective documentary evidence confirms that cartels have the capacity to track individuals beyond their areas of operation by relying on representation they have in other areas. As well, cartels use family networks and private investigators to track people as well as property records in the US and Mexico and by placing GPS trackers on cars. The cartels, according to Exhibit 3, Item 7.15 of the current NDP, states corrupt law enforcement agents are used to obtain information about the people they pursue.\n\n[21] I find the above-cited evidence establishes on a balance of probabilities that the claimants could be located and harmed by the cartel anywhere in Mexico. While the claimants are not high-profile journalists, or politicians, or someone who could harm the operation of the cartels through their power and influence, the documentary evidence states that a large debt or persona( vendetta could motivate them to track someone outside of their area. I have considered the cartel\u2019s level of interest in the claimants in determining whether on a balance of probabilities, there is a section 97(1) risk for the claims throughout Mexico.\n\n[22] The claimants moved from Canc\u00fan, to Playa del Carmen, to XXXX, where each time, they were located by the cartel, watched, and continued to be threatened. I find it would be reasonable to expect that the cartel would look for the claimants upon their return to Mexico and that they are motivated to pursue them as the principal claimant defied them and did not do as they demanded of him and work for them. For the reasons above, I find the agents of harm would pursue and harm the claimants on a balance of probabilities throughout Mexico. For these reasons, I find there is no viable internal flight alternative for the claimants.\n\n[23] I conclude on a balance of probabilities that the claimants face a personalized and prospective risk to their lives or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in every part of Mexico. This is specific, personal risk faced by the claimants as opposed to indiscriminate or random risks faced by the others. In conclusion, for the preceding reasons, I find that the claimants are in need of protection pursuant to section 97 of the IRPA, and therefore, I accept their claims.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

Sharma\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Daniel Ayllon Petit\nCountry: Mexico\nRPD Number: TC0-06060\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2023-01721\nATIP Pages: 000022-000030\n\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n\n[1] These are the reasons for the decision in the claim for refugee protection made by XXXX (\u201cthe claimant\u201d).\n\n[2] The claimant alleges to be a citizen of Mexico and is claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).[1]\n\nALLEGATIONS\n\n[3] The facts and events alleged in support of the claim are set out in the claimant\u2019s Basis of Claim (BOC) form[2] and the corresponding amendment.[3] To summarize, the claimant resided in the state of Yucatan, identifies as a Mayan Indigenous person and fears individuals from the local gang called XXXX\n\n[4] The claimant alleges XXXX is a gang comprised of 15 men who terrorize the claimant\u2019 s local community. The claimant has been attacked by XXXX members on three separate occasions: XXXX 2014, XXXX 2015 and XXXX 2017. In the latter attack, the gang members physically assaulted the claimant with a machete and uttered ethnic slurs. The claimant was able to run away and obtain help from his father.\n\n[5] The claimant went to report the assailants to the police and additionally filed a lawsuit. The assailants were initially arrested but released a few days later. The claimant alleges that the assailants\u2019 family members paid a bribe to the police. The claimant presented himself for the lawsuit hearings with his friend as a witness, but the assailants never appeared.\n\n[6] A week later, the claimant encountered one of his attackers who threatened to hurt the claimant again. Fearing his life, the claimant decided to depart Mexico for good in the XXXX of 2018.\n\nDETERMINATION\n\n[7] The panel finds that the claimant is a Convention refugees within the meaning of section 96 of the IRPA.\n\nPROCEDURAL MATTERS\n\n[8] The hearing took place virtually on August 28, 2023, and November 1, 2023. The claimant requested a Mayan interpreter as he was most comfortable testify in the Mayan language. The Board procured the services of Mayan-Spanish interpreter via a third-party agency. As such, there were two interpreters present at the hearing: a Spanish-English interpreter and a Mayan-Spanish interpreter. The Board, the claimant and the claimant\u2019s counsel consented to the presence of a third-party interpreter for the hearing and accepted the inherent risks involved with the process.\n\n[9] The claimant indicated that the contents of his BOC form and narrative were translated to him in Spanish. The claimant stated that he understood the main elements of the BOC form but did not understand all of it. The BOC amendment (8 pages) was translated from English to Spanish to Mayan for the record. After the sight translation, the claimant confirmed that the BOC forms and corresponding amendment was true correct and up to date.\n\n[10] The claimant submitted post-hearing documents,[4] which included identity documents, the filed police report and email correspondence with his friend.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nIdentity\n\n[11] The claimant\u2019s personal identity and Mexican nationality were established, on a balance of probabilities, based on the copy of the claimant\u2019s Mexican passport.[5]\n\nNexus\n\n[12] The panel finds that the claimant\u2019s allegations establish a nexus to the Convention grounds of race and nationality given that the claimant identifies as a Mayan indigenous man. As such, the panel has assessed this claim under sections 96 and 97 of the IRPA.\n\nCredibility\n\n[13] When a claimant swears that certain facts are true, this creates a presumption that they are true unless there is a valid reason to doubt their truthfulness.[6] In assessing the credibility of the evidence presented by the claimant, the panel accepts, on a balance of probabilities, the events alleged in the BOC narrative.\n\n[14] The claimant also adduced evidence[7] in support of his claim, including record of complaint filed with the Yucatan Attorney General\u2019s office on XXXX, 2017, photos of the claimant\u2019s injuries, medical note dated XXXX, 2024, letter of support from the claimant\u2019s spouse and community member and email correspondence with the claimant\u2019 s friend, who witnessed the last attack in XXXX 2017. The panel has no reason to doubt the authenticity of these documents.\n\n[15] The claimant testified that he believed the local gang may have connections to the C\u00e1rtel de Jalisco Nueva Generaci\u00f3n (CJNG). When the panel brought forth that this was omitted in the BOC narrative, the claimant explained that there have been talks about the link in his community but it he is not entirely sure. Based on the claimant\u2019s own account, the panel finds these particular allegations of links of the local gang to the CJNG to be speculative and finds that claimant has not credibly established that the local gang who assaulted him is connected to the CJNG or any major Mexican cartel.\n\n[16] The panel accepts the claimant\u2019s allegation that he was threatened and assaulted individuals who claimed to be a part of XXXX , a local Yucatan gang. However, given the profile of the agents of harm as a local gang and the significant time passed since the claimant\u2019s last contact with these individuals, the panel find on a balance of probabilities, that the agents of harm are not motivated to harm and pursue the claimant. In this case, while the panel does not accept the forward-looking risk at the hands of the agents of harm, the panel find that the claimant has still credibly testified to fear of persecution as a Mayan Indigenous man, which is the basis on which the analysis will proceed from here forward.\n\n[17] Given the claimant\u2019s detailed testimony and supporting documents, the panel finds the claimant has established a story of a history of abuse on account of his indigeneity and fears discrimination in Mexico which rises to the level of persecution. As such, the claimant has established his subjective fear in returning to Mexico.\n\nObjective Basis\n\n[18] When assessing a claim for refugee protection, the Board of course has to look at whether claimant have a well-founded fear of persecution, which contains both the subjective fear element and the objective basis for that fear.\n\n[19] In addition to the subjective fear, there is also an objective basis. The panel refers to the preponderance of documentary evidence in the most recent National Documentation Package (NDP) for Mexico, which identifies concerns for members of Indigenous communities.\n\n[20] The United States Department of State (DOS) Mexico, Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2022 indicates Indigenous persons often experienced racism and discrimination and were frequently victims of violence.[8] This was due at least in part to their lack of Spanish language proficiency, Indigenous persons generally had limited access to health care, education services, and legal means to seek justice.\n\n[21] A Response to Information Request (RIR) on the Treatment of Indigenous Persons suggests that the Indigenous population is \u201cmarginalized and discriminated against.\u201d[9] Freedom House indicates that Mexican law bans discrimination based on ethnic origin; however, the Indigenous population faces \u201csocial and economic discrimination\u201d and southern states with a high Indigenous population face \u201cparticularly deficient services.\u201d[10]\n\n[22] Based on current, reputable, and reliable documentary evidence, and the credible allegations, the panel finds that the claimant has established on a balance of probabilities, a well\u00ac founded fear of persecution by reason of his ethnic profile.\n\nInternal Flight Alternative (IFA)\n\n[23] At the outset of the hearing, the panel proposed the IFA locations of Guadalajara, Jalisco; Acapulco, Guerrero; and Mexico City. The panel will focus its analysis only on Guadalajara, for the purpose of efficiency.\n\n[24] Mexico is a large country with a population of over 131 million people covering an area of over 1.9 million sq. km.[11] The law provides for freedom of movement and the right to travel within Mexico. In determining whether the agent of harm has both the \u201cmeans and motivation\u201d[12] to locate the claimant in the panel has considered the area of operation of the cartel and their level of interest in the claimant. Based on the claimant\u2019s testimony and adduced evidence, the panel finds that the influence of the agents of harm, a local gang based in the Yucatan state, was localized. As such, the agents of harm do not have the means or motivation to harm the claimant in proposed IFA location.\n\n[25] The panel has also considered the claimant\u2019s residual profile to determine whether he would have a viable IFA in Mexico. The claimant stated that he would face mistreatment and discrimination in the proposed IFA locations as he is Mayan, an ethnic minority group in Mexico. The claimant further explained that he has only ever lived in his small town in the Yucatan state and that the general Mexican population looks down at Mayan people.\n\n[26] The panel refers to the available documentary evidence in the NDP regarding the experiences of Mayan people living in Mexico. There are approximately 774 000 Mayan speakers residing in Mexico and is the third most widely spoken Indigenous language in the country.[13] A Response to Information Request (RIR) found in the NDP states \u201cestimated 71.9 percent of the Indigenous population live in poverty or extreme poverty, compared to 40.6 of the national population [in Mexico]\u201d[14]\n\n[27] The NDP indicates that Indigenous groups, including Mayan persons, have been subjected to incidents of generalized discrimination and violence in Mexico. However, it also concludes that legislation states that the government will protect the existence of these minorities and encourage conditions for the promotion of their individual identities.\n\n[28] The RIR reports that government department called Comisi\u00f3n Nacional para el Desarrollo de los Pueblos Indigenas (CDI) is the national entity responsible for \u201ccoordinating, promoting, monitoring and evaluating programmes, projects, strategies and government action for the comprehensive and sustainable development of indigenous peoples and communities.\u201d\n\n[29] The Minority Rights Group International states:\n\n\u201d \u2026 many indigenous organizations, ranging from small community-based groups to national bodies, also formed to fight for better living conditions for this population. They have campaigned for access to education, health services, potable water, credits, fair wages, political representation, consultation, the protection of local environments, and official recognition of their languages and traditional skills as healers. Sorne of these groups worked in collaboration with other local non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and human rights bodies and others have partnered with local governments.[15]\n\n[30] The panel finds that there is not sufficient evidence in the NDP to suggest that Mayan people are systematically targeted everywhere in Mexico, particularly in the IFA locations of Guadalajara and Mexico City. However, the panel accepts that Mayan persons have been subjected to incidents of violence and discrimination in Mexico as the generalized conditions of the Indigenous populations are often inferior to the general Mexican population.\n\n[31] In addition, the panel notes that the claimant\u2019 s first language is Mayan and the claimant is not fluent in the Spanish language, which is the national language of Mexico and the proposed IFA locations. The panel also notes that the claimant has little formal education, having only completed his studies up to XXXX . The panel finds that the combination of the claimant\u2019 s lack of Spanish language proficiency, little formal education and Mayan identity will hinder the claimant\u2019 s ability to access necessary amenities such as housing, education and employment.\n\n[32] As such, given the intersectional profile of the claimant as a Mayan persan who has basic proficiency in the Spanish language as well as little formal education, the panel accepts, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant may experience discrimination which rises to the level of persecution in the proposed IFA locations.\n\nState protection\n\n[33] While not raised as an issue, the panel has considered whether there is state protection available to the claimant. As a starting point, it is presumed that states are capable of protecting their citizens unless there is clear and convincing evidence to the contrary. In this case, the panel finds that this presumption has been rebutted.\n\n[34] At the case at bar, the claimant testified he attempted to obtain police assistance when he was assaulted by the assailants, but the case was eventually dropped before it went to court. The claimant testified that he believed that the assailants were able to bribe the police in exchange for dropping the case.\n\n[35] Human Rights Watch reports that Mexico\u2019s criminal justice system \u201croutinely fails to provide justice to victims of violent crimes and human rights violations\u201d and that \u201ccauses of failure include corruption, inadequate training and resources, and complicity of prosecutors and public defenders with criminals and other abusive officials.\u201d[16] According to the Mexican government\u2019s own statistics, an estimated 94 percent of crimes are either unreported or not investigated. Criminal organizations thus continue to carry-out human rights abuses and widespread killings throughout the country with impunity.[17]\n\n[36] The UN Special Rapporteur states the following:\n\nIndigenous peoples are widely affected by problems concerning access to justice. According to the Mexican authorities, the vast majority of offences go unpunished. There is also a high level of criminal cases that go unreported owing to the lack of trust in the authorities and their procedures. Various factors prevent indigenous persons from gaining access to the national judicial system in order to defend their rights. They face economic, cultural, linguistic, and geographic barriers, as well as racism and discrimination.[18]\n\n[37] The panel recognizes that the NDP has conflicting statements in terms of the treatment of indigenous peoples in Mexico, as noted in the previous section. Despite the facts that the Mexican constitution prohibits discrimination based on ethnicity, and a federal law prohibits all forms of discrimination and that authorities have taken some action, the panel finds that the government has tried to enact legislation and put in place tactical initiatives across several departments but the recent statements in the NDP noted above suggest that they are not producing results on the ground. The panel finds that the documentary evidence, as noted above, demonstrates that Mexico continues to have difficulties in providing protection for all its citizens, including Mayan and other ethnic minorities.\n\n[38] The NDP and as well as the claimant\u2019s testimony make clear that the state has been complicit in the hate crimes committed on members of the indigenous communities. Accordingly, in these circumstances, the panel finds clear and convincing evidence that the state is unable or unwilling to protect the claimant.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[39] For the foregoing reasons, the panel finds that the claimant is a Convention refugee.\n\n[40] The claim is therefore accepted.\n\n(signed) K.

Seevaratnam\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Max Berger\nCountry: Mexico\nRPD Number: TB9-34815\nAssociated RPD Number(s): TB9-34826, TB9-34855, TB9-34856, TB9-34857\nATIP Number: A-2023-01721\nATIP Pages: 000012-000021\n\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n\n[1] The claimants, XXXX (principal claimant); his wife XXXX (associate claimant); and their adult children, XXXX and XXXX, and their minor daughter, XXXX claim to be citizens of Mexico and they are claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).[1]\n\n[2] The father, XXXX, was appointed as the designated representative for his minor daughter, XXXX, for the purpose of this hearing.\n\n[3] The claimants allege that they fear returning to Mexico due to their race (darker complexion), and religion, Muslim. They fear the XXXX who identify and target foreigners.\n\nISSUES\n\n[4] The determinative issues outlined at the commencement of the hearing were nationality, credibility, and the objective basis for their well-founded fear of persecution.\n\nALLEGATIONS\n\n[5] The details of the allegations are outlined in the principal claimant\u2019 s Basis of Claim (BOC) Form and narrative.[2]\n\nDETERMINATION\n\n[6] The panel finds the claimants to be Convention refugees. The panel\u2019s reasons are as follows.\n\nIDENTITY\n\n[7] In Exhibit 1,[3] the claimants have provided copies of their passports, issued by the government of Mexico. In addition, the principal claimant and his wife have provided a copy of their marriage certificate.[4]\n\n[8] The principal claimant testified that he was born in Pakistan and moved to Mexico in XXXX 1992 in search of better economic opportunities. He explained that he became a national\nof Mexico in 2021. He explained that he and his wife had to renounce their Pakistani nationality in order to procure Mexican citizenship.[5] They have provided Naturalization certificates from the Mexican Ministry of Foreign Affairs as corroboration.[6]\n\n[9] The citizenship law stipulates that naturalized nationals in Mexico cannot maintain dual nationality.[7] Report on Citizenship Law: Mexico indicates that the different legal and practical treatment given to different Mexicans (by birth; by naturalisation; and dual nationals) was set in the laws on purpose. This configures a hierarchy of citizenship in Mexico, as follows:\n\n1. Mexicans by birth with no other nationality, who are fully entitled to all rights and duties associated to citizenship, now including protection against forfeiture;\n\n2. Mexicans by birth with another citizenship, with important restrictions in the political and governmental areas, and some others in specific civil matters; and\n\n3. Mexicans by naturalisation, who not only also face the same restrictions, but currently are (i) the only ones that can lose their Mexican citizenship, and (ii) the only ones who are prohibited from holding a further citizenship.[8]\n\n[10] This is further corroborated in a report by the Global Citizenship Observatory which indicates that the 1997 constitutional reform marked a radical shift from the twentieth century nationalist ethos and restrictive approach citizenship and migration regulation, as well as to relationships with the diaspora.[9] Even so, the same reforms also introduced some quite important limitations to dual citizenship. Arguably, these were intended as a barrier to too much \u2018foreign interference\u2019. Dual citizenship would be allowed for citizens by birth only. Naturalised Mexicans would be (and still are) barred from either taking another citizenship, as well as from retaining their original one after naturalisation.[10] Accordingly, the principal claimant and his wife have revoked their Pakistan nationality. The principal claimant testified that upon arrival in Canada, he inquired about the renewal of their former nationality at the Pakistan consulate in Toronto, however, it was denied by the Pakistan authorities.[11]\n\n[11] The principal claimant testified that all three children were born in Mexico. Birth Certificates have been provided for all of them.[12] He testified that they became Mexican citizens automatically since they were born in Mexico. This is corroborated in the Mexican citizenship laws which states that any person born in Mexican territory is automatically a citizen by birth, regardless of his or her migratory\/citizenship status or the nationality of his or her parents.[13]\n\n[12] The panel finds the claimants to be nationals of the Republic of Mexico and no other country.\n\nCREDIBILITY\n\n[13] The panel is cognizant of the leading jurisprudence on the issue of credibility. Maldonado[14] stands for the principle that when a claimant swears to the truth of certain allegations, this creates a presumption that those allegations are true unless there is reason to doubt their truthfulness.\n\n[14] All adult claimants provided clear, direct, and candid testimony. Their responses were straightforward. Their oral evidence was internally consistent. The claimants testified that they were easily recognized due to their darker complexion. They testified that they were also recognized as being Muslim because of the male claimant\u2019s name, and the female claimants\u2019 clothing. In addition, the male claimant testified that he prayed five times a day. The claimants testified that they practice their religious faith as Shia Muslims. The adult daughter, XXXX explained that she has experienced micro-aggression in school since she and her two siblings were the only students of a different race and religion. She explained that they were easily identifiable in school and in society. She testified that they are all fearful given her father\u2019s experiences and threats he received from the XXXX aimed at him and his family.\n\n[15] The sworn viva voce testimony of the principal claimant was consistent his BOC form and narrative.[15] His testimony was corroborated by reliable documentary evidence.[16] The principal claimant has provided photographs of his XXXX[17] and the XXXX lease agreements.[18] A former employee, XXXX, has provided an affidavit outlining the extortion demands and death threats at gun point[19] she witnessed from the XXXX targeting the principal claimant.\n\n[16] The panel finds the adult claimants on a balance of probabilities to be credible and trustworthy witnesses. Accordingly, the claimants have established their subjective fear of persecution based on their race (darker complexion) which is compounded by their religion.\n\nWELL-FOUNDED FEAR OF PERSECUTION\n\n[17] The principal claimant testified that he established a small successful XXXX. He has provided photographs of his XXXX,[20] his XXXX lease agreement,[21] and a letter from a former employee detailing the harassment and assault experienced by the claimant as corroboration of his testimony. He explained that he was targeted by the XXXX because they believe that foreign XXXX arrive with a large cash flow. In addition, he believes he was an easy identifiable target due to his race and religion. He explained that the supporters of the XXXX believe that foreigners have taken their jobs and thus are resentful. He further explained that they are racist towards people with a darker complexion.\n\n[18] The panel has sought guidance from the most recent National Documentation Package (NDP) for Mexico[22] to assess the objective basis for the claimants\u2019 fear of persecution based on their race and religion.\n\n[19] The United States Department of State (DOS) report on Mexico, Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2022 finds that the constitution prohibits discrimination based on ethnicity, and a federal law prohibits all forms of discrimination. Nonetheless, discrimination was common against racial and ethnic minorities, including Black, Afro-Mexican, and Indigenous groups.[23]\n\n[20] Mexico, Freedom in the World 2023 report indicates that Mexican law bans discrimination based on ethnic origin, gender, age, religion, and sexual orientation. Nevertheless, lighter-skinned Mexicans enjoy substantial social advantage compared to Indigenous people and other distinct groups.[24]\n\n[21] According to Mexico, International Religious Freedom Report for 2022, the U.S. government estimates the total population at 129 million (midyear 2022). According to the 2020 Mexican government census (the most recent), approximately 78 percent of the population identifies as Roman Catholic (compared with 83 percent in 2010); 10 percent as Protestant or evangelical Protestant; and 1.5 percent as other religious groups, including Judaism, Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Church of Jesus Christ), and\nIslam.[25] It is evident from current country condition documents that the claimants practice a minority religion and it is reasonable that they were easily identified by members of their community and the XXXX\n\n[22] Counsel for the claimant has provided media reports of foreigners being targeted and killed in Mexico.[26]\n\n[23] XXXX, the eldest daughter, testified that they were the only students at their school who had a darker complexion, whose parents were immigrants, and practiced a different religion. The principal claimant testified that he was vehemently targeted by the XXXX (XXXX) as a XXXX for extortion due to his race and religion. He stated that they are nationalists who accuse foreigners of taking their jobs, thus, causing their economic decline. The anti-foreigner sentiments espoused by the XXXX is corroborated in the documentary evidence.[27] The documentary evidence indicates that XXXX representatives openly called on Mexicans to join in their struggle against foreigners, sexual minorities, and leftists.[28] Accordingly, the panel finds that the claimants are at risk of persecution due to their race (darker complexion) compounded by their minority religion. Thus, the claimants have established on a balance of probabilities the objective basis for their well-founded fear of persecution.\n\nSTATE PROTECTION\n\n[24] There is a presumption that except in situations where the state is in complete breakdown, the state is capable of protecting its citizens.[29] To rebut the presumption of state protection, a claimant must provide clear and convincing evidence of the state\u2019s inability to protect its citizens.[30]\n\n[25] The principal claimant testified that he made attempts to obtain state protection through the police in XXXX 2019 when he received verbal threats and extortion demands by telephone. He stated that he personally attended at the police station to initiate a complaint, but the police took no action. The principal claimant further explained that on XXXX, 2019, he was threatened at gun point at his XXXX by members of the XXXX. Again, he attended at the police station to file a report and the police dismissed his concerns. He testified that he closed his XXXX permanently at the end of XXXX due to fear of ongoing extortion and violent reprisals by the XXXX. This is corroborated by an affidavit provided by a former employee, XXXX, who was a witness.[31] On XXXX, 2019, the principal claimant was identified by the XXXX and physically assaulted. He explained that the police arrived on the scene and made a report, however, no arrests were made, and protection was not forthcoming. He stated that the police are corrupt, complicit, and ineffective in Mexico.\n\n[26] The Mexico Freedom in the World 2023 indicates that Mexico\u2019s justice system is plagued by delays, unpredictability, and corruption, which often lead to impunity for perpetrators of crimes.[32]\n\n[27] The report further states that Mexicans are subject to the threat of violence at the hands of multiple actors, including individual criminals, criminal gangs that operate with impunity, and police officers who are often susceptible to bribery.[33]\n\n[28] The 2023 report indicates that official corruption remains a serious problem. Despite Mexico\u2019 s relatively comprehensive anticorruption framework, implementation of existing mechanisms is lacking in.\n\n[29] The panel finds that the claimants fear persecution at the hands of XXXX. Based on the objective documentary evidence,[34] and the principal claimant\u2019s viva voce evidence, he and his family cannot avail themselves of the protection of the authorities due to their corrupt practices and ineffectiveness.\n\n[30] The National Documentation Package (NDP) for Mexico[35] makes clear that the state is ineffective and in these particular circumstances, there is clear and convincing evidence that the state is unable or unwilling to protect the claimants. Accordingly, the panel finds that the claimants have met the burden of proof, on a balance of probabilities, and the presumption of state protection has been rebutted.\n\nINTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE (IFA)\n\n[31] The Federal Court of Appeal established a two-part test for assessing an IFA in\nRasaratnam and Thirunavukkarasu: As per Rasaratnam,\n\n(1) \u201cthe Board must be satisfied on a balance of probabilities that there is no serious possibility of the claimant being persecuted in the part of the country to which it finds an IFA exists\u201d[36] and\/or the claimant would not be personally subject to a risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture in the IFA.\n\n(2) Moreover, the conditions in the part of the country considered to be an IFA must be such that it would not be unreasonable in all the circumstances including those particular to the claim, for him to seek refuge there.[37]\n\n[32] The claimants bear the burden of proof to demonstrate that they would be persecuted on a Convention ground, or subject personally, on a balance of probabilities, to a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment[38] in all of Mexico.\n\n[33] The principal claimant testified that when police protection was not forthcoming, fearing for their lives, he and his family relocated to Puebla, Mexico. Nevertheless, he was identified and violently targeted on XXXX, 2019. The principal claimant testified that the XXXX have an extensive network whereby they have the ability to target and persecute their adversaries. The claimants testified that they are easily identifiable due to their darker complexion, race, and religion. He stated that he and his family cannot live in fear in hiding.\n\n[34] Having carefully considered the totality of the evidence, the panel finds that there is a serious risk of persecution throughout Mexico. Thus, given the particular circumstances of the claimants, who are being pursued due to their race compounded by their minority religion, an internal flight alternative is unavailable.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[35] The claimants, XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX, have established that there is a reasonable chance of persecution, if they were to return to their country of nationality, Mexico, based on the Convention grounds of race and religion. Therefore, the panel finds the claimants to be Convention refugees.\n\n[36] Accordingly, the Refugee Protection Division accepts their claims.\n\n(signed) S.

Cortes-Diaz\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Adela Crossley\nCountry: Mexico\nRPD Number: TB9-03547\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2023-01721\nATIP Pages: 000006-000011\n\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n\n[1] These are the reasons for the decision in the claims of XXXX (the claimant), who claims to be a citizen of Mexico and is claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n\nChairperson\u2019s Guidelines\n\n[2] In deciding this claim, I have considered the Chairperson Guideline 4: Gender Proceedings Before the Immigration and Refugee Board (Chairperson\u2019s Gender Guidelines). All relevant factors, such as the social and cultural context in which the claimant found herself, along with the issues of state protection and country conditions, were examined through the lens of the Gender Guidelines.\n\nDe Novo\n\n[3] The first hearing into the claim was held on September 14, 2021, with a decision dated October 05, 2021, the claim was rejected. The decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) was appealed to the Refugee Appeal Division. The appeal was allowed, and the matter was returned to the RPD for re-determination by a different member. These are the reasons for the decision of the de novo hearing which was held on January 05, 2023.\n\nALLEGATIONS\n\n[4] Details of the allegations can be found in the Basis of Claim form (BOC).[1]\n\nDETERMINATION\n\n[5] In reaching this determination, I have considered all the evidence including the claimant\u2019s testimony, the documentary evidence filed as well as counsel\u2019s oral submissions.\n\n[6] Based on the totality of the evidence before me and the objective evidence which I will highlight in a moment, I find that you, the claimant has established a serious possibility of persecution on the intersecting grounds of religion and membership in a particular social group; namely a woman facing gender related violence.\n\n[7] Further, I find that the claimant has established that she would face a serious possibility of persecution if she retuned to Mexico.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nIdentity\n\n[8] I find that the claimant\u2019s personal identity and Mexican nationality has been established by her passport filed in evidence and her testimony at the hearing.\n\nCredibility\n\n[9] In assessing the claimants\u2019 testimony, I was mindful of the potential difficulties in testifying in a remote hearing setting and of the fact that the claimant had to testify about sensitive issues that transpired in Mexico.\n\n[10] I generally found the claimant to be a credible witness and therefore believe what she has alleged in support of her claim. I also find that she made her best effort to respond to the questions in a straightforward manner, and she did not make any effort to embellish her testimony.\n\nWell-foundedness of the Claim\n\n[11] Even though Mexico\u2019s constitution provides all persons the right to religious freedom, including the right to engage in religious ceremonies and acts of worship[2], and even though the claimant was able to practice her religion in Mexico, she credibly testified about the many incidents of discrimination and hate she was a victim of because of her religion. The claimant testified she started wearing a hijab when she converted to Islam in 2012 and described in very detail the violent incidents and threats that she received, which were fueled by her Muslim appearance and wrongly perceived Arab nationality. The claimant also testified that she was also easily identifiable among people because of the hijab which made an easy target for xenophobic and anti-Islamic verbal attacks from people. This reality coupled with her condition as a single woman, made her even more vulnerable to violence in a country where violence against women, femicide, and impunity is a condemning reality[3]. Section 2.2 of the NDP states that \u201cgender\u00ad based violence against women and girls is widespread in Mexico\u201c, adding that the perpetrators of this violence are rarely punished. The claimant further claims that she was unable to get police protection when these incidents happened as they did not take her seriously.\n\n[12] \u201cLaws targeting gender-based violence are most often unenforced and are ineffective, with the state agents responsible for enforcing the laws described as \u201cnot committed to women or are openly misogynistic\u201d[4]\n\n[13] I find that the objective evidence in this case supports the claimant\u2019s subjective fear of victimization and harm based on her profile as a Muslim woman living in Mexico.\n\nState Protection\n\n[14] Even though Mexican legislation provides legal provisions[5] that guarantees women the access to equal right and protection them from violence, in practice, Mexican women continue to be exposed to extreme levels of aggression and gender violations. Item 5.10 of the NDP states that according to sources, violence against women is pandemic. Sources also indicate that violence against women cuts across social, gender, economic, cultural and age lines. It also states that the causes of violence against women in Mexico includes cultural attitudes and socially constructed gender roles ingrained in generation after generation.\n\n[15] Based on the above evidence and taking into consideration the specific profile of the claimant; a Muslim single woman living in Mexico, the past incidents of violence the claimant has been victim of, and the displayed inability of Mexican authorities to protect her, I find that state protection will not be available to the claimant if she returned to Mexico. Therefore, the presumption of state protection has been rebutted.\n\nInternal Flight Alternative\n\n[16] I must consider a two-prong test to determine the viability of an IFA location. Firstly, I must be satisfied that, on a balance of probabilities, the claimants would not face a serious possibility of persecution or risk to their life or of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in the proposed IFA. Secondly, I must be satisfied that conditions in the suggested IFA are not such that it would be objectively unreasonable in all the circumstances, including those particular to the claimants, for them to relocate and reside there.\n\n[17] I proposed Campeche as a potential internal flight alternative that would be both safe and reasonable for the claimant. However, I have found that wherever the claimant goes in Mexico there will be a risk for violence based on gender and religious profile.\n\n[18] The objective evidence suggests [6] that the Muslim community in Mexico conform a religious minority with a presence mostly in the state of Mexico. This state is precisely where the claimant lived and faced discrimination and the violent attacks. In response to the risk and fear she was experiencing, in 2018, the claimant moved to Chiapas where the next biggest Muslim community exist in Mexico. In there, the claimant also experienced discrimination and hate events that made her return to her parents\u2019 house and eventually leave for Canada.\n\n[19] The objective evidence does not support that Campeche will be a location where the claimant will be able to freely and safely live as a Muslim woman and openly practice her religion. In fact, the evidence suggests that violence against women is widespread in Mexico and a matter of national concern. Also, the claimant testified that she will not be able to practice her religion in Campeche as there are no mosques or a Muslim community she can participate in. Also, I find that, on a balance of probabilities, the chances of the claimant facing the same discrimination and not being protected again by the authorities reasonable high and enough to determine that Campeche is not a safe and reasonable IFA location.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[20] Based on the analysis above, I find the claimant to be a convention refugee based on the intersectionality of religion and gender under section 96 of the IRPA. I, therefore, accept her claim for refugee protection.\n\n(signed) T.

XXXX file number TC2-38416, and associate claimants, XXXX file number TC2-38417, and XXXX file number TC2-38418. I have considered your testimony and the other evidence in the case, and I am ready to render my decision orally. In reaching this decision, the Panel has considered Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 4, gender considerations in proceedings before the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. You are claiming to be citizens of Mexico and are claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n\nDETERMINATION\n\n[2] I find that you are Convention refugees because you face a serious possibility of persecution for the following reasons.\n\nALLEGATIONS\n\n[3] You are citizens of Mexico and no other country. You worked for the XXXX since 2010, initially as an XXXX for several XXXX and XXXX. In 2018, while working as a XXXX with a simultaneous title of XXXX for a XXXX in the XXXX in Nayarit. You began to receive threats to you, and to your wife, and daughter from cartel members. You reported the threats to the police and prosecution. The XXXX was provided with armed protection and escorts, but you and your family were not.\n\n[4] In 2021, fearing for their safety. You sent your wife and daughter away to Mazatlan. However, the threats against you persisted, and you decided that you had to flee the country to save your lives. If you returned to Mexico, you could be subjected to kidnapping, enforced disappearance, torture, sexual and gender-based violence, or murder, by the Jalisco New Generation Cartel. You allege that there is no state protection for you in Mexico, where many similarly situated individuals have been disappeared or murdered by the cartels, nor is there any internal flight alternative.\n\nIdentity\n\n[5] Your personal identities as citizens of Mexico has been established by your testimony and the supporting documents filed in the exhibits, including certified true copies of your Mexican passports, and national election ID cards. I therefore find on a balance of probabilities that identity and country of nationality have been established.\n\nNexus to section 96 or section 97\n\n[6] I find that there is a link between what you fear and one (1) of the five (5) Convention grounds, specifically your membership of a particular social group as a woman and girl targeted by a cartel in the case of the associate claimants, and as a member of a family unit targeted by a cartel in the case of the principal claimant. Therefore, this claim has been assessed under section 96.\n\nCredibility\n\n[7] In terms of your general credibility, I have found you to be credible witnesses, and I therefore accept on a balance of probabilities what you have alleged in your oral testimony and in your Basis of Claim forms. Your testimony is presumed to be true. You testified in detail and consistently with your Basis of Claim forms about how your \u2014 threats against you escalated over time and persisted even when you moved on several occasions. In support of your claim, you provided documents in Exhibit number 5 that include copies of reports you filed with the police, and testimonies from family members and former colleagues. The Panel finds these documents and your related testimony to be credible on a balance of probabilities and thus assigns them significant weight.\n\n[8] Your testimony was in keeping with your Basis of Claim forms, and there were no significant inconsistencies or omissions. The Panel also found this testimony and the evidence to be credible on a balance of probabilities, as was your testimony about why you could not count on adequate police protection anywhere in Mexico. In reaching these findings, the Panel has considered and applied Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 4, gender considerations and proceedings before the Immigration and Refugee Board, particularly sections 6, 7, and 8. I therefore believe what you have alleged in support of your claims, and I find the following to be credible, that on a balance of probabilities, you are a family targeted by a cartel because of your direct association with the XXXX . You have credibly established your subjective fear of persecution, including fear of being kidnapped, disappeared, tortured, raped, or killed.\n\nPersecution Risk\n\n[9] The objective documentation supports your allegations that individuals in your circumstance face persecution. One (1), the documentary evidence indicates that criminal elements, including local and transnational gangs and narcotics traffickers, were significant perpetrators of violent crimes and committed acts of homicide, torture, kidnapping, extortion, human trafficking, bribery, intimidation, and other threats, resulting in high levels of violence and exploitation. NDP 2.1.23, page 2.\n\n[10] Two (2), the documentary evidence indicates that impunity and extremely low rates of prosecution remained a problem for ail crimes, including human rights abuses and corruption. There were reports some government agents were complicit with international criminal gangs. NDP 2.1.23, page 2.\n\n[11] Three (3), the documentary evidence indicates feminicide is rampant in Mexico, and there were serious flaws in the investigation of these crimes. NDP 2.1.23, page 3.\n\n[12] Four (4), the documentary evidence indicates that the CJNG is one (1) of the fastest growing criminal organizations in Mexico, and one (1) of the five (5) most dangerous in the world, and is present in all federal entities except Sinaloa. NDP 7.7, page 2.\n\n[13] Five (5), the documentary evidence indicates that the Mexican police and security forces have been hobbled by corruption for decades, and that this corruption underpins collusion with criminals. NDP 10.2.\n\n[14] Six (6). Mexico is plagued by thousands of missing persons and enforced disappearances annually, and impunity largely prevailed on this issue. NDP 2.1.23, pages, 3 to 5.\n\n[15] Seven (7). The CJNG has managed to infiltrate public institutions, despite its general anti-government stance. NDP 7.7, page 6. Consequently, I find that there is a serious possibility that you could face enforced disappearance, murder, and\/or targeted gender-based violence, should you return to Mexico. I find that you have established an objective basis for your subjective fear, and therefore you have a well-founded fear of persecution.\n\nState Protection\n\n[16] I find that adequate state protection would not be available to you were you to seek it in Mexico. The objective documentary evidence outlined above indicates that criminal gangs use ruthless violence and work in collusion with corrupt security forces throughout Mexico. States are presumed to be capable of protecting their citizens, except in situations where the state is in a complete breakdown. However, based on the claimant\u2019s personal circumstances, as well as the country documentation referred to above, the Panel finds on a balance of probabilities that the claimants have rebutted the presumption of state protection with clear and convincing evidence. Adequate state protection is not available to them as they fear persecution from powerful cartels that operate with the support of corrupt members of the police and security forces.\n\nInternal Flight Alternative\n\n[17] I have also considered whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for you, particularly in relation to Queretaro. The country documentation referred to above indicates that the situation for individuals in circumstances such as yours is the same throughout the country, and that you would face a serious possibility of persecution or risk to life anywhere in Mexico, as the cartels could find you anywhere in Mexico. The Panel finds on a balance of probabilities that there is a serious possibility of persecution of the claimants anywhere in Mexico, including Queretaro, as the security forces are corrupt and work in collusion with criminal gangs. And this would make starting a new life safely and undiscovered elsewhere in Mexico nearly impossible. As such, I find that the IFA test fails on the first prong and that there is no viable internal flight alternative for you in Mexico.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[18] Based on the totality of the evidence, I find the claimants to be Convention refugees as they face a serious possibility of persecution because of their membership of a particular social group. Your claims are therefore accepted.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

Rukaria\nCountry: Mexico\nRPD Number: VC3-07353\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2023-01721\nATIP Pages: N\/A\n\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n\n[1] XXXX XXXX XXXX (the \u201cclaimant\u201d) alleges that she is a citizen of Mexico and claims protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (the \u201cAct\u201d).[1]\n\nALLEGATIONS\n\n[2] The claimant is a XXXX from Veracruz, Mexico who alleges a risk of harm at the hands of the C\u00e1rtel de Jalisco Nuevo Generaci\u00f3n (\u201cCJNG\u201d). Prior to becoming in a XXXX in Mexico, she resided in the United States of America from 2003 to 2012: she has two daughters born during her time in the USA. These children currently reside in the United States of America and are American citizens.\n\n[3] She says that her problems with the CJNG began on XXXX XXXX, 2022. She was working at a XXXX XXXX when several persons entered and demanded the claimant XXXX one of them, who was XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. One of the people asked the claimant if XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX would be required, and the claimant said the XXXX would need further XXXX but said she would not be able to do so herself. They drew a firearm on the claimant and told her they were from the CJNG and that if she refused to help them they would kill her and leave her corpse in the street. The claimant then acquiesced to help them and they left the XXXX.\n\n[4] The claimant tried to report the threat to the police, but the police stopped writing in the midst of her statement telling her that there was nothing they could do help her. The following day the claimant and her family fled to another town, about three-and-a-half hours away. They spent a month there, before the claimant fled to Tijuana. The claimant feared that if she were to return to work as a XXXX that she may be discovered so she took a series of jobs in Tijuana outside of the XXXX field.\n\n[5] In XXXX 2023, the claimant\u2019s mother received a phone call. The person on the line did not identify himself, or on whose behalf he was calling, but he told the claimant\u2019s mother that they knew she was in Tijuana and if she \u201cdid not return back to work for them\u201d[2] then the claimant knew what would happen to her. The claimant reasoned that this must be the CJNG. The claimant remained in hiding, but tried to find a way out of the country.\n\n[6] The claimant\u2019s youngest daughter was able to depart for the USA on XXXX XXXX, 2023 joining her oldest sister who was in Washington state preparing for university studies. The claimant had been told by friends and family that because her children were US citizens that she may have an easier path in to the USA.\n\n[7] The claimant presented herself to American immigration officials at the border. She was told that she had to register online and she would be given an interview date in two to five months time. The claimant, fearing that she may not be able to enter the USA, made arrangements to travel to Canada.\n\n[8] The claimant traveled to Toronto on XXXX XXXX, 2023. Thence she traveled to British Columbia on XXXX XXXX, 2023 where she sought protection.\n\n[9] The claimant says that she fears death at the hands of the CJNG if she were to return to Mexico. She says that she has heard from a former colleague of hers at the XXXX, who was abducted by CJNG in XXXX 2023, that the cartel has now issued orders to kill the claimant.\n\nDETERMINATION\n\n[10] I find that the claimant is a person in need of protection pursuant to section 97(1) of the Act. Accordingly, I accept her claim.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nIdentity\n\n[11] I find that the claimant\u2019s identity and Mexican nationality is established on a balance of probabilities by her testimony and documentary evidence, including a copy of her Mexican passport at Exhibit 1.\n\nClaimant is not Excluded pursuant to Article 1E\n\n[12] The claimant wrote in her Basis of Claim narrative that; \u201cMy friends and my brother had advised me that because my children were USA citizens, I could apply to be reunited with them in USA on humanitarian grounds because my life was in danger in Mexico.\u201d[3]\n\n[13] On November 11, 2023 the Board notified the Minister per Rule 26 of the RPD Rules that there was a possibility that the claimant may be excluded from protection pursuant to Article 1E of the Refugee Convention. On December 5, 2023 the Minister notified the Board that they would not be intervening in the claim and that they would not be present at the hearing.\n[14] In her testimony before the Board the claimant clarified her friends and family had told her that it may be easier for her to seek refugee protection in the United States on account of the American citizenship of her children. There is no indication in any of the documents in the National Documentation Package (\u201cNDP\u201d) for the United States of America at Exhibit 3.2 that the claimant would have access to any form of status, at all, through her American born children who were 19 and 13 years old respectively at the time the claim was heard by the Board. The claimant lived in the United States from 2003 to 2012, but did not obtain any legal status in the country at that time.\n\n[15] I find that the claimant is not excluded from protection under Article 1E. There is no evidence before me that the claimant has any form of status, let alone status similar to that of a national, in the United States of America at the time the claim was heard, nor is there any evidence that the claimant had such status and lost it, or had access to such status and failed to acquire it.[4]\n\nCredibility\n\n[16] The claimant spoke in a clear, straightforward manner and there were no inconsistencies in her testimony or between her testimony and the other evidence before me. I found her to be a credible witness and therefore believe what she has alleged.\n\n[17] In addition to her testimony, the claimant provided a number of documents to corroborate key aspects of her allegations at Exhibit 6. These documents include:\n\n\u2013 Various proof of education and employment documents, including her employment both as a XXXX in XXXX, Veracruz as well as her employment in different capacities in Tijuana, Mexico;\n\n\u2013 An affidavit from the claimant\u2019s mother dated XXXX XXXX, 2023 accompanied by a copy of her Mexican national voting ID. In the affidavit she writes, among other things, about relocating with the claimant following the threats from the CJNG, about the phone threats of XXXX 2023, and about how she has received further threatening phone calls about her daughter; and,\n\n\u2013 A written statement from a former colleague of the claimant\u2019s, RCG, dated XXXX XXXX, 2023 accompanied by a copy of the writer\u2019s Certificate of Unique Population Registration Key. In the written statement she notes that she worked with the claimant but was not present during the events of XXXX XXXX 2022. She writes that she was later taken captive from the XXXX by the CJNG and forced to provide XXXX XXXX to their members. She says that during her confinement she overheard that orders had been given by the cartel to find and kill the claimant. She also stats that she herself has now fled XXXX for her life.\n\n[18] I have no reason to doubt the authenticity of any of the claimant\u2019s evidence above and note that the material is relevant and probative. Accordingly, I have placed full weight on the material provided by the claimant at Exhibit 6.\n\n[19] I find that the claimant has established the underlying facts of her allegations and I accept them without reserve. I find, for the sake of greater clarity, that the claimant was targeted by the CJNG starting on XXXX XXXX, 2022 when they demanded the claimant provide XXXX XXXX to one of their members and that she continue to provide further XXXX XXXX. When the claimant fled these demands of the cartel, they continued to track her locating her in the city of Tijuana. They demanded, though her mother, that she return to XXXX, Veracruz and work for them or they would kill her. Since the claimant has come to Canada the cartel has now issued an order that the claimant be killed in retribution for refusing and fleeing their demands.\n\nNo nexus\n\n[20] I find that the claimant has not established a nexus between the harm alleged and a Convention ground. I see no credible and trustworthy evidence before me to establish that the claimant fears gender-based persecution, or any other persecution based on a Convention ground. It appears to me that the claimant was targeted initially by the cartel by chance\u2014they happened to come into the XXXX where she was working one day\u2014and because the claimant fled their demands they have continued to threaten her and now seek to kill her. Accordingly, I have assessed the claim pursuant to section 97(1) of the Act.\n\nRisk to life\n\n[21] In reaching my decision I have followed the framework set out in the July 28, 2022 Chairperson\u2019s Jurisprudential Guide at TC1-05038.[5] At paragraph 23 of that decision the Refugee Appeal Division writes:\n\n[23] Building on the cases of Portillo and Correa, I propose the following framework of analysis for assessing claims under paragraph 97(1)(b) of the IRPA:\n\nFirst Stage: Determine the risk faced by the Claimant\n\u2022 Clearly identify the nature of any ongoing or future risk.\n\u2022 Clearly identify the basis (or initial reason) for the risk.\n\u2022 Clearly identify the degree of the risk (or proximity to the risk). Consider any relevant factor, such as:\no The severity and number of incidents; and\no Any pattern or link between the incidents; and\no Any change over time.\nSecond Stage: Determine whether the risk is faced generally by others\n\u2022 Compare the nature and degree of the risk faced by the Claimant with the nature and degree of the risk faced generally by other individuals in or from their country.[6]\n\nThe Risk faced by the claimant\n\n[22] The claimant faces a risk to her life (nature of risk) at the hands of the CJNG, a prominent criminal cartel in Mexico. The claimant was initially approached by members of the cartel and work and forced to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. When the claimant told the cartel that she would not provide XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX threw pointed a gun at her and told her if she did not, they would kill her. After the claimant fled the cartel, they continued to seek her and ultimately located her in the city of Tijuana, and demanding her return. After the claimant fled Mexico, the cartel issued an order to locate and kill the claimant.\n\n[23] The degree of risk is significant, and has been escalating since the claimant\u2019s first run-in with the cartel. Initially, the claimant endured no harm by acquiescing to their demand to XXXX XXXX XXXX. However, since that time the claimant has fled and thereby opposed the cartel, at which point her return was demanded. When she did not return, the cartel determined that they would kill her.\n\n[24] The CJNG is a powerful and violent cartel. NDP 7.2 notes that the CJNG was declared one of the most dangerous cartels in Mexico by the government in 2015.[7] The CJNG is an international operation with activities in the Americas, Asia and Europe. Within Mexico they have a presence in 27 of 32 states as of 2020. NDP 7.2 states that CJNG \u201chas been linked to several mass graves in southwestern Mexico and was responsible for shooting down a Mexican army helicopter in 2015, the first successful takedown of a military asset of its kind in Mexico.\u201d[8]\n\n[25] NDP 7.7 notes the expansive and national reach of the CJNG and that it \u201cis known for its \u2018aggressive use of violence\u2019\u201d.[9] It notes that CJNG is fast-growing and that it has taken advantage of the Covid-19 pandemic to \u2018claim new territory.\u2019\n\n[26] According to NDP Item 7.16, the Mexican drug cartels engage in extreme forms of violence as a means of maintaining power. For example, these groups are known to place dead and mutilated bodies on public display in order to terrorize the public and ensure compliance with the group\u2019s demands. Those who betray or steal from the cartel are dehumanized and portrayed as rats who must pay with a gruesome death for their betrayal. Examples of actions that cartels consider to be a form of betrayal which warrants death include failing to pay a bribe or quota:\n\nMurder, torture and abduction are articulated as the order of things in the business of drug trafficking: \u201cthis is how it works, you murder those who do not pay the bribe we ask [cuota], those who betray the cartel, those who give information to other cartels. You torture people to obtain information from them or to make them pay for mistakes they made\u201d (anonymous). [10]\n\n[27] I find that the totality of the evidence, including the claimant\u2019s evidence as well as the country condition evidence in the NDP for Mexico, shows that the claimant\u2019s degree of risk is significant and that she has been personally targeted by the CJNG, a powerful and violent cartel in Mexico.\n\nThe risk is not faced generally by others in Mexico\n\n[28] I find that others are not generally in the same position as the claimant. While there is a widespread risk of crime and violence in Mexico, the general population does not currently face a risk to life at the hands of the CJNG. The claimant\u2019s risk arose from a demand for XXXX XXXX. When the claimant fled rather than give-in to the demands of the cartel for further XXXX XXXX, CJNG tracked her and demanded her return. Since she subsequently fled the country, the CJNG has now marked her for death.\n\n[29] I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant faces a personal risk to her life and that this risk is not faced generally by others in Mexico.\n\nState protection\n\n[30] Except in situations where the state is in a state of complete breakdown, states must be presumed capable of protecting their citizens. This presumption can be rebutted by \u201cClear and convincing\u201d evidence of the state\u2019s inability to protect.\n\n[31] In terms of state protection, in general, the local and state authorities are unwilling and unable to protect victims of cartel violence. According to the NDP, \u201ccontinual corruption, weakness, and lack of competence in Mexican law enforcement, particularly of local and state police forces, but also of the Federal Police, have created a bedrock climate of impunity and critically exacerbated the criminal violence.\u201d[11]\n\n[32] The claimant explained that she did visit the police, and tried to make a police report in XXXX 2022; however, the officer taking her report stopped writing and told her there was nothing the police could do. In any event, the objective evidence supports the claimant\u2019s contention that the police are unable to protect persons from the cartels in Mexico.\n\n[33] Despite the state\u2019s attempts to eradicate drug trafficking and target top level gang leaders, their strategies have simply resulted in shifting alliances and the emergence of new gangs. No meaningful attempts have been made to protect local populations from the daily violence that occurs throughout the country. Human Rights Watch indicates that Mexican authorities routinely fail to investigate crimes or provide justice for victims due to rampant corruption, complicity with criminals and abusive officials.[12]A Response to Information Request at 10.2 of the NDP notes that, \u201cAccording to the BTI 2020, \u201c[i]n many localities of Mexico, the drug organizations have control of the local police\u201d (Bertelsmann Stiftung 2020, 6).\u201d[13]\n\n[34] I therefore find that there is clear and convincing evidence before me of the state\u2019s inability to protect victims of the cartels. Accordingly, the panel finds that state protection would not be forthcoming to the claimant in this case.\n\nInternal Flight Alternative \u2013 Merida\n\n[35] At the outset of the hearing I proposed Merida as potential Internal Flight Alternative (\u201cIFA\u201d) for the claimant.\n\n[36] Once an IFA is raised, I must be satisfied on a balance of probabilities that (1) the claimant would not be subject personally to a danger of torture, or to a risk of life or a risk of cruel and unusual punishment, or face serious possibility of persecution in the proposed IFA and (2) that conditions in that part of the country are such that it would be objectively reasonable, in all the circumstances, including those particular to the claimants, for them to seek refuge there.[14]\n\n[37] The onus is on the claimant to show that they do not have an IFA. The burden placed on the claimant is a high one. The claimant must show that there are conditions in that IFA that would jeopardize their life and safety in relocating to that area.[15] In the Federal Court of Appeal decision of Ranganathan v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) in 2001, it was stated that the test is to show that the IFA is unreasonable. That test requires nothing less than the existence of conditions that would jeopardize the life and safety of the claimants in relocating to a safe area.[16] Actual and concrete evidence of adverse conditions is required. The burden of proof is on the claimant to establish that the proposed IFA is not viable under either one of the two prongs of the test.[17]\n\n[38] I find that claimant has established that she faces a risk from the agents of harm in Merida, in particular as the claimant has provided credible evidence to the panel showing the CJNG has the means as well as the motivation to find her and remains motivated to find her.\n\n[39] The claimant testified that she fears that the agent of harm will find her anywhere in Mexico. I note that her evidence shows that the agent of harm successfully located, through means unknown, to locate the claimant after she relocated to Tijuana, Mexico a city far distant from her hometown of XXXX, Veracruz. NDP 7.8 notes that cartels in Mexico track and retaliate against persons in Mexico.[18] There are several means available to the cartels for tracking persons, including bribing phone companies to track their calls and working with \u2018corrupt\u2019 Mexican officials to have spyware installed on persons\u2019 phones. NDP 7.15 notes that cartels in Mexico also use family networks and private investigators to track people, as well as property records in the US and Mexico and placing GPS trackers on cars.[19] NDP 7.8 quotes a Doctor of criminology who states, \u201c[i]f any of these organizations is interested in harming [an individual], no city will provide a safe haven.\u201d[20] NDP 7.8 notes that the cartels:\n\n\u2026are motivated to track certain individuals because they steal or lose money; due to personal rivalries; for political incentives\/reasons (Doctor of criminology 21 July 2021) or due to \u201cpersonal vengeances; perceived betrayal; public exposition of relationships with public officials, politicians or investments; or cooperation with authorities as informants or collaborative witnesses.[21]\n\n[40] The claimant\u2019s evidence indicates that the CJNG remains motivated to find her.\n\n[41] The panel finds on a balance of probabilities that CJNG remains motivated to find the claimant and that they have the means of doing so anywhere within Mexico. Accordingly, I find that the claimant does not have a viable internal flight alternative.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[42] For the foregoing reasons I find that XXXX XXXX XXXX is a person in need of protection per section 97(1) of the Act.\n\n[43] Accordingly, I accept her claim for protection.\n\n(signed) Graham Zilm\n\nDecember 15, 2023\n\n[1] Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n\n[2] Exhibit 2, Basis of Claim written narrative, p. 3, para. 15.\n\n[3] Exhibit 2, Basis of Claim narrative p. 3f., para. 17.\n\n[4] Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v.

The claimants are citizens of Mexico who are seeking protection in Canada under section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. At the outset of the hearing, I confirmed the appointment of the Principal Claimant as the designated representative for her daughter, XXXX. At the time the claimants filed their claim, the son, XXXX, was a minor, but he is now an adult and does not require a designated representative.\n\nALLEGATIONS\n\n[2] The claimants\u2019 allegations are set out in the Principal Claimant\u2019s Basis of Claim form, or BOC. In brief, the claimants fear they will be killed, kidnapped or otherwise harmed by the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, CJNG, if they return to Mexico. Their story can be summarized as follows. In XXXX 2021, the Principal Claimant opened a XXXX XXXX in Jalisco. Several months after the XXXX opened, two (2) men, posing as customers, called the Principal Claimant to XXXX XXXX to discuss business matters. They said they knew how to help her business expand quickly and increase her income. The Principal Claimant realized that the men were proposing illegal activities such as money laundering or drug trafficking, and she told them she was not interested. The men left, but returned later that night to inform her that if she was not willing to work for them, she would have to pay a tax of XXXX XXXX XXXX pesos per week. She said that was simply impossible because that amount exceeded her total revenues. The men left, and she heard nothing further.\n\n[3] In XXXX 2022, different men pulled up at the XXXX around midnight. The XXXX was closed and the staff were cleaning up and preparing to lock up for the night. The men agreed to limit their XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and after XXXX XXXX XXXX, they left without incident. They returned quickly, however, within 20 minutes or so, saying that they had returned for their backpack. The Principal Claimant said that they had cleaned the XXXX and had not found a backpack. The men were incensed. They pulled out guns and demanded that the Principal Claimant return the pack immediately. The experience was terrifying. The men told them that they, meaning the Principal Claimant and her staff, had better not mess with them, as they belonged to the Jalisco Cartel. The men ransacked the place, searching for the backpack, while repeatedly threatening to kill the Principal Claimant and the staff. The men finally left around dawn, warning the Principal Claimant that she had three (3) days in which to return the backpack, or she would be killed. The Principal Claimant did not open the XXXX again. She immediately went with her children to the home of her friend about 40 minutes away. The claimants did not leave the house of the friend. They relied on neighbours to bring them food.\n\n[4] However, the friend and neighbours quickly noticed the presence of unknown black vehicles, which were parked on the street for extended periods of time. This was sufficiently alarming that the friend asked the claimants to leave, and so they did. They moved to Puerto Vallarta to stay with family members of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, a young man who had worked at the XXXX. XXXX had proposed that they go to stay with his mother and grandmother. Within days of the claimants arriving, however, unknown men knocked at the door of XXXX\u2019 mother\u2019s home, asking for the claimants by name. XXXX\u2019 grandmother did not open the door. She told the men through the closed door that no one was at home. On hearing the voice of an elderly woman, the men left.\n\n[5] At the time of these events, the Principal Claimant was in a relationship with a man called XXXX (ph). XXXX suggested that they move to a rural property that his mother and sister owned near the town of XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The claimants moved to this farm or ranch. The Principal Claimant realized, however, that she and her children faced years of having to move in an effort to hide from the cartel, so she left her children with XXXX, and came to Canada to enquire about the refugee process. This was in XXXX 2022.\n\n[6] While the Principal Claimant was in Canada, XXXX learned that unknown men had been asking about the Principal Claimant in XXXX. He moved the children, meaning the younger claimants, to an even smaller community, one that was so remote that there was neither electricity nor phone connection. XXXX told the Principal Claimant that he could no longer care for the children, so she returned to Mexico to get the two (2) younger claimants, and the three (3) of them returned to Canada in XXXX, or early XXXX 2022. The claimant\u2019s older daughter, XXXX (ph), had a young child, and XXXX could not leave with the young child as there were legal problems associated with her taking the child out of the country. The claimant explained that the child\u2019s father had disappeared and so XXXX needed to get a court ruling authorizing her to take the child out of the country. So XXXX remained in Mexico in hiding, and she has, for the most part been staying with XXXX, the close family friend who had originally suggested the claimants stay with his mother and grandmother in Puerto Vallarta. And so the claimants appeared before me today to explain why they are seeking protection in Canada.\n\nDECISION\n\n[7] After hearing the evidence, I find that the claimants are persons in need of protection as there is a risk to their lives, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment at the hands of the cartel Jalisco Nueva Generacion, the CJNG, if they return to Mexico.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nIdentity\n\n[8] I am satisfied as to the claimants\u2019 identity by virtue of their credible testimony and by their Mexican passports, certified true copies of which are on file.\n\nCredibility\n\n[9] In assessing credibility, I start from the presumption that evidence given under oath is truthful. Of course that presumption can be displaced if there are reasons to doubt the truthfulness or the reliability of the evidence, but in this case I have no reason to doubt what the claimants were telling me. The Principal Claimant provided most of the testimony. I found she was a credible witness and that she was endeavouring to tell the truth. She acknowledged when she did not know the answer to questions. Her answers were also consistent with the information in her Basis of Claim form. She believes that the first incident, the incident in which two (2) men demanded that she pay a weekly tax is related to the second incident where the men were two (2) different men, ransacked the XXXX looking for a backpack. She believes that the accusation by the second set of men was a way to increase fear and to intimidate her into paying the quota. I do not share the claimant\u2019s belief that the two (2) incidents are related. The Principal Claimant acknowledges that no one returned to the XXXX to collect the taxes in the months following the initial demand, and the men who ransacked the XXXX in XXXX 2022 apparently did not mention her failure to pay the taxes. Regardless of whether the two (2) incidents are related or not, I am nonetheless satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that the men who visited the XXXX in XXXX 2022 have lost a backpack which contained a large amount of money, and that they are deflecting blame to the Principal Claimant. As a result, the CJNG now has the Principal Claimant in their crosshairs, and are actively looking for her.\n\n[10] The son also testified briefly, and I found him to be a credible witness. He testified that when the family first arrived in Canada, they kept asking themselves why the CJNG would be pursuing them with such zeal. He said that he did some research. He explained his methodology, and he learned that many small businesses that are extorted by the CJNG comply with the cartel\u2019s demands. He believes that the Principal Claimant has been targeted because she has not complied with their demands, and this has incensed the cartel.\n\n[11] The claimants provided a number of documents to corroborate their claims. These include, one (1), a letter from XXXX, the former employee. XXXX describes the events of XXXX XXXX, 2022, in detail. His account accords with that set out in the Principal Claimant\u2019s narrative, although it is clear that he is describing the events from his own perspective. He describes the men who entered the XXXX as suspicious, and said that they had arrived in a black vehicle with tinted windows. He says that the men told him that they belong to a cartel, and that their informants and the police would let them know if they, meaning the Principal Claimant, tried to file a complaint. XXXX says that he has received numerous calls asking for the Principal Claimant, and for her adult daughter, XXXX. XXXX has been living with XXXX, although not in a romantic relationship. XXXX writes that he has moved five (5) times since the initial event of XXXX 2022, in a quest for safety for himself as well as for XXXX and her young child.\n\n[12] Two (2), a letter from the claimant\u2019s friend, XXXX (ph). XXXX confirms that she offered shelter to the claimants in late XXXX 2022. She said that in the short time that the claimants were there, black vans suddenly appeared and parked outside her home for extended periods of time. She was sufficiently unnerved that she asked the claimants to leave for her own safety. XXXX apparently has already lost a family member to the CJNG, and has a fear of the cartel. XXXX also says in her letter that an unknown person came to her home and asked about the claimants shortly after they left.\n\n[13] Three (3), a letter from the claimant\u2019s daughter, XXXX. XXXX describes the events of XXXX XXXX, 2022, in detail. She says that she remains in hiding, and that her young son is unable to attend school. I am not sure what XXXX means by this, as I believe that the son is only three (3) years old, but perhaps she is referring to pre-school.\n\n[14] Four (4), text messages between XXXX and the Principal Claimant. In XXXX 2023, XXXX messaged the Principal Claimant and said that he had been mugged. He sent her photos of bruises and injuries on his body. He said that he would be filing a police complaint. In a relatively recent message, XXXX tells the Principal Claimant that the attackers in XXXX told him that they knew that the Principal Claimant and the younger claimants had left the country. They also told him that they knew that the older daughter, XXXX, was still in the area, and that if they found XXXX, they would force the Principal Claimant to come back. They also warned XXXX that if he went to the police, they would kill him. XXXX apologizes to the Principal Claimant for not telling her about these threats when he was first mugged. He did not want to share that information with her. He says that XXXX does not leave the home at all. He implies in his message that XXXX\u2019s presence in Mexico is increasing the risk to himself, and he expressly states that he hopes the Principal Claimant can arrange for her to leave Mexico soon.\n\n[15] Five (5), photos of injuries on XXXX\u2019 body after the attack.\n\n[16] Six (6), police complaint filed by XXXX on XXXX XXXX, 2022. The report states that XXXX was attacked and his belongings were stolen. In the complaint, he does not name the assailants, nor does he mention the threats they made. This omission is explained in the text message referred to above, where XXXX said that the assailants told him they would kill him if he went to the police. So he filed a routine report about mugging, but did not give them more personal information about the threats to the Principal Claimant and XXXX.\n\n[17] After reviewing the documents, I have no reason to doubt their authenticity, and I find they corroborate the claimants\u2019 allegations. After considering the evidence, including the credible testimony of the two (2) claimants who testified and the corroborative documents, I accept the allegations as set out in the BOC narrative. In particular, I find that the Principal Claimant has been personally targeted and threatened by the CJNG, who have pursued her and threatened to kill her and family members over a period of time.\n\nNexus\n\n[18] The next question is whether the claimants have a Nexus to the refugee convention, and I find they do not. Victims or potential victims of crime, corruption or personal vendettas generally cannot establish a link between the fear of persecution, and the convention grounds or political opinion, alleging nationality, membership in a particular social group or religion. In this case, I find that there is nothing that links the harm the claimants fear to the refugee convention. I therefore assess the claim under subsection 97(1) of the Act. Under this section, the claimants may qualify for protection if they can show that, on a balance of probabilities, they would be subjected personally to a risk to their lives, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if they returned to their country of origin.\n\nPersonalized Risk to Life or Other Harm\n\n[19] So I now turn my mind to the question of whether the claimants would face a personalized risk to their lives or other serious harm at the hands of the CJNG if they returned to Mexico. I first considered the nature of the agent of harm, namely the CJNG. According to reports in the Board\u2019s National Documentation Package for Mexico, the CJNG is a criminal organization that has emerged in the wake of killings and rifts in the older cartels. The CJNG is renowned for its aggressive use of violence, and is now considered Mexico\u2019s foremost criminal threat. The cartel engages in a range of activities, from drug trafficking, kidnapping, extortion, murder, recruitment and more. A Board Response to Information Request found at Tab 7.48 of the NDP, describes tactics used by cartels to enforce their power. The sources in the RIR state that, \u201cThose who defy a cartel\u2019s demands face murder, torture, violence, as well as general intimidation.\u201d The RIR also says that some groups threaten, kidnap or kill family members.\n\n[20] In terms of whom the CJNG is likely to target, the Response to Information Request at Tab 7.7 of the NDP states that the cartel typically targets and tracks rivals, business persons such as the Principal Claimant, journalists, anyone they perceive to be a threat to their interests, as well as anyone that the cartel feels has betrayed them, challenged their rule or refused to work with them.\n\n[21] Another report on the CNJG found at Tab 7.12 states that workers and business owners are among the most targeted groups across the country. That latter report says that the targeting of business owners remains largely unreported and unattributed, as many of the victims face threats and distrust the authorities to prosecute the perpetrators, and so the extortion is unnoted.\n\nPersonalized Risk of Violence\n\n[22] I now turn my mind to the question of whether the claimants face a personalized risk of violence, and I find they do. The Country Reports paint a grim portrait of violence in Mexico. Many Mexicans face a possibility of serious violence at the hands of criminals. But I find that the claimants before me have established a very personal and real risk that is outside of the generalized risk faced by other Mexicans. The CJNG has now invested a lot of resources in pursuing the Principal Claimant because they believe she has defied their authority, and has stolen from them. I also find that the two (2) younger claimants are at risk simply because of their kinship to the Principal Claimant. It would not require a lot of imagination on the part of the CJNG to see that they could punish the Principal Claimant by kidnapping or killing her children.\n\nSo in sum, I find there is sufficient credible evidence that the claimants face a personal forward-facing risk to their lives or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in the form of kidnapping, torture and other forms of violence if they return to Mexico.\n\nState Protection\n\n[23] A state is presumed capable of protecting its citizens, and claimants must establish, on a balance of probabilities, that the country would not be able to provide them with reasonable protection. But in this particular case, I find that the presumption of state protection has been rebutted. The Principal Claimant says she did not report the attack of XXXX XXXX, 2022, to the police because the attackers had cautioned her that their informants would let them know if she attempted to do this. And the reports in the Board\u2019s National Documentation Package confirm that collusion between police and organized crime is a serious problem in Mexico. There are two (2) reasons for this; one is police corruption, and the other is the power of the cartels.\n\n[24] On the question of police corruption, an RIR on police corruption found at Tab 10.2 of the NDP states that police corruption in Mexico is a major problem. They attribute this to poor working conditions in law enforcement, which leave police officers particularly vulnerable to bribes and infiltration by organized crime. International Crisis Group reported in 2018 that corruption in all branches of Mexican law enforcement underpins state collusion with criminals. The reports in the NDP also indicate that the cartels have their finger in many aspects of government.\n\n[25] The US Congressional Research Report at Tab 7.2 of the NDP reports that, \u201cThe continued revelation of high level corruption linked to crime groups and their apparent control of Mexican territory demonstrates that the TCOs, meaning Transnational Criminal Organizations, are more deeply entrenched than ever. The Lopez Obrador government faces some allegations of DTO, related corruption of public officials, its party politicians and members of the national police forces.\u201d A source in the RIR on police corruption found at Tab 10.2 of the NDP states that studies highlight the role of police at all levels, federal, state and local, in facilitating illegal businesses, working for organized crime and systematically violating human rights. So in view of the Country Reports, I find that the claimants cannot rely on meaningful state protection should they return to Mexico.\n\nInternal Flight Alternative\n\n[26] I also find that the claimants do not have reasonable or viable internal flight alternative in Mexico. This is because the agent of harm, the CJNG, operates throughout the country. The claimants have described their efforts to move, I believe it was four (4) times within a four (4) -month period in Mexico. On each occasion, the cartel appears to have successfully tracked them, forcing the claimants to move again to ever more remote areas. Ultimately, the claimants before me successfully left Mexico, but the Principal Claimant\u2019s oldest daughter, XXXX, is still in Mexico in hiding. And the evidence from her friend and housemate, XXXX, indicates that that the cartel is still actively looking for her and has a general idea of where she is. XXXX is not working and does not leave the home. She is a virtual prisoner inside the home.\n\n[27] The claimants\u2019 difficulty in eluding the cartel are consistent with the reports in the NDP, which indicates that criminal groups and cartels have the ability to track people throughout the country. The Response to Information Request at Tab 7.15 states that a gang or cartel can be motivated to track someone outside their area in pursuit of a large debt, or to settle a personal vendetta. The RIR describes the strategic alliances, the cartels support with each other to expand their reach, and says that cartels and gangs rely on family networks and private investigators to track people. They also rely on property records and use corrupt law enforcement agents to obtain information about the people they pursue.\n\n[28] Another RIR specifically on the CJNG found at Tab 7.7 states that the Jalisco cartel tracks and locates individuals who move to another region by leveraging their own internal intelligent operatives, known as community intelligence. The cartel\u2019s own internal intelligence includes informants, armed members, connections with local politicians and allied gangs, and is effective at tracking and locating individuals. The RIR also states that the Jalisco cartel outsources the tracking and location of individuals to their contacts in the police or armed forces whom they pay in exchange for access to their technological resources. The monitoring infrastructure of criminal groups in Mexico, including that of the Jalisco cartel, is pervasive and routine across the country\u2019s highways, seaports and airports. And so based on the evidence before me, I find that the claimants do not have a viable IFA in Mexico.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[29] In sum, after reviewing all of the evidence, I find that the claimants would face a risk to their lives, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment should they return to Mexico. I therefore find that they are persons in need of protection as to find in subsection 97(1) of the Act, I accept their claims.\n\n[30] Okay. Those are the reasons for my decision. I would like to thank you all for coming to testify today. XXXX, you didn\u2019t testify, but thank you for being present. Ms. Sharda, thank you very much for a well-prepared claim. I know it\u2019s not always easy, corralling documents.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 DECISION CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

In summary, the Claimant lived in Sinaloa and fears the Sinaloa Cartel because the Claimant cooperated with the police by giving information about two members of the Sinaloa Cartel and was invited to testify against them in Court. Members of the Sinaloa Cartel have searched for the Claimant in a bid to force him to withdraw the written testimony he gave to the police against them.\n\n[3] The Claimant was a XXXX XXXX in Los Mochis, Sinaloa, Mexico. On XXXX XXXX, 2018, he XXXX XXXX two men at a place called XXXX XXXX at about 12 am. Police later contacted him and he found out that the men he had XXXX XXXX with XXXX XXXX had been involved in murders at the place he XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. According to him, the police got his contact from the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. He stated that he was told by the police that the two men had not only killed an individual but had been involved in many other crimes. The police also stated that he must give his testimony\/declaration to not be an accessory to the crime. He made a declaration two weeks later and he identified the men he XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.\n\n[4] The Claimant further alleged that almost immediately three men went to his home at Los Mochis, Sinaloa, where they met his parents. He stated that the three men identified themselves as members of the Sinaloa Cartel and demanded that the Claimant withdraw the witness statement he made to the police or his entire family will suffer the consequences.\n\n[5] The Claimant also stated that his parents immediately moved away and went to stay at his grandparent\u2019s home while he went to stay with his sister at Culiacan. He stayed there for three months and moved further away. He went to Tijuana (his aunt\u2019s place) and stayed there for about three to four months until the men found him, and he had to flee. He also stated that he kept receiving summons from the Attorney-General\u2019s office and the Court in criminal matters filed against the men he gave information about.\n\n[6] The Claimant came to Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2019, on a visiting visa (ETA) which he extended once. The ETA expired in XXXX 2020, and he had stayed in Canada since that time.\n\n[7] He contacted the Mexican consulate in 2019 and in 2023 to inform them that he does not want to frustrate the proceedings by his presence in Canada and would be willing to give his evidence from Canada.\n\n[8] In 2023, his mother and sister attempted to assist him in obtaining a copy of the statement he made to the police, but they were told that the files were still open.\n\nDETERMINATION\n\n[9] The panel finds that the Claimant is a person in need of protection pursuant to paragraph 97(1)(b) of the Act as he has established, on a balance of probabilities, that he would be personally subjected to a risk to his life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in Mexico.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nIdentity\n\n[10] The panel finds that the Claimant\u2019s personal identity and national identity as a citizen of Mexico are established, on a balance of probabilities, by the copy of his Mexican passport which he submitted to the Board.\n\nNexus\n\n[11] For a Claimant to be a Convention refugee, the persecution that they fear must be by reason of one of the five grounds enumerated in the Convention refugee definition. The Claimant must have a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\n\n[12] The panel finds that the risk alleged by the Claimant does not have a connection or nexus to any of the Convention grounds. The Claimant alleges that he will be at risk from a criminal organization, the Sinaloa Cartel, if he returns to Mexico due to his failure to withdraw the statement he made to the police in respect of members of the Sinaloa Cartel and his status as a witness in the prosecution of members of the Sinaloa Cartel. As such, the claim is assessed under subsection 97(1) of the Act.\n\nCREDIBILITY\n\n[13] When a Claimant swears to the truth about his or her allegations, it creates a presumption that those allegations are true unless there is reason to doubt their truthfulness.[1] Additionally, when assessing credibility, the panel is entitled to rely on its rationality and common sense.[2] In this case, the panel finds the Claimant to be credible, except where indicated below.\n\n[14] In particular, the principal Claimant spoke in detail about how he first came in contact with two members of the Sinaloa Cartel when he XXXX XXXX XXXX as his XXXX XXXX. He narrated how the police sought information about his contact with these two men, how he gave the information about where he XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and how he learnt that prior to XXXX XXXX XXXX, they had been involved in a murder at where he XXXX XXXX XXXX. He also spoke about how the men went to his home, which his parents shared with him, immediately after giving his sworn statement to the police. He gave evidence about how the men who visited his home demanded he recount his testimony or have his family face their wrath, and how this visit and threat led to the displacement of his family. He also stated how he ran to Culiacan and then to his aunt\u2019s house at Tijuana. He also stated that he sent his mom to the Prosecutor\u2019s office in 2023 to get a copy of the \u2018denunciation\u2019 he made against the two men he XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX, but he was told by his mom that the Prosecutor\u2019s office refused to give it to his mom, stating that the case is still open and that it was delicate because of the minors involved.\n\n[15] The panel accepts these aspects of the Claimant\u2019s testimony, based on the presumption of truthfulness, as true. The panel has no reason to doubt these aspects of the Claimant\u2019s allegations and as such, finds that the Claimant is credible in respect of these allegations, on a balance of probabilities.\n\n[16] The Claimant submitted documentary evidence to corroborate aspects of his claim including:\ni. Court summons and letter dated XXXX XXXX, 2019, asking the Claimant to appear at the XXXX XXXX XXXX on XXXX XXXX, 2019, at 10.00 am for the purpose of giving testimony.\nii. Court summons and letter dated XXXX XXXX, 2019, asking the Claimant to appear at the XXXX XXXX in Sinaloa on XXXX XXXX, 2019.\niii. Letters from the Claimant\u2019s father and sister.\niv. Aunt\u2019s letter stating that certain men came to the house to ask for the Claimant on XXXX XXXX, 2019, demanding that the aunt reveal the Claimant\u2019s whereabout.\n\n[17] Upon review of the documents, the panel has no reason to doubt the authenticity of any of the documents and accepts them as corroborative of the core allegations advanced by the Claimant and places full weight on them.\n\n[18] The Claimant in his oral testimony also stated that members of the Sinaloa Cartel went to his aunt\u2019s house in Tijuana on XXXX XXXX, 2019. In his interview with the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA), the Claimant stated that he saw the men in three vehicles and ran away. In his oral testimony before the panel, he stated that on XXXX XXXX, 2019, he had arrived back at the house after going out with a girl without having a clue as to what happened. He further stated that he was initially informed of the visit of the men from the Sinaloa Cartel when he returned by his neighbour. The panel asked the Claimant to explain why his statement to the CBSA officer that he saw the men of the Sinaloa Cartel who visited his aunt and fled, and his statement to the panel that he did not know of the visit until he returned home and was informed by his neighbour, appeared to contradict each other. The Claimant\u2019s response was that when he made the statement, he was not 100% sure that the men he saw were the same people as the Sinaloa Cartel that visited his aunt\u2019s place. He stated his statement to me was the truth, as he was not 100% sure of what had occurred prior to returning home.\n\n[19] The panel finds that the statements that the Claimant saw the men of the Sinaloa Cartel and ran, and that he came home without a clue of what had transpired at his aunt\u2019s place are contradictory. The panel also finds that the explanation provided by the Claimant was not reasonable. The panel thus draws a negative credibility inference from this contradiction. However, while the panel finds that the Claimant is not credible as to what he saw on XXXX XXXX, 2019, the panel finds that there is other evidence of the visit of the men from the Sinaloa Cartel before the panel. This includes the letter written by the Claimant\u2019s aunt. As such, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the men of the Sinaloa Cartel visited the Claimant\u2019s aunt\u2019s home in 2019.\n\n[20] The panel notes that the Claimant has been in Canada without status since XXXX 2020. The Claimant explained that he did not make a refugee application earlier because he did not have enough money to pay a legal representative. He was later referred to Legal Aid, whom he approached immediately and put in his application. The panel finds the Claimant\u2019s explanation reasonable in the circumstances and does not find that the delay in asking for protection undermines his credibility.\n\nRisk of Harm\n\n[21] The definition of a \u201cperson in need of protection\u201d in the Act, requires that a Claimant show that their removal would subject them personally to a risk to life, risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or risk of torture and that they are unable or, because of that risk, unwilling to avail themselves of the protection of their country of nationality.[3] The Claimant must also show that this risk would be faced in every part of their country of nationality and that the risk is not faced generally by other individuals in or from that country.[4] To succeed in a claim under section 97(1)(b) of the Act, the evidence must establish a specific, individualized risk to the claimant, and not merely generalized exposure to crime or human rights violations in a country.[5]\n[22] The panel has reviewed the country condition information contained in the latest National Documentation Package (NDP) for Mexico. The panel finds that this evidence establishes that the Claimant would be subjected personally, on a balance of probabilities, to a risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment that is not faced generally by others in or from Mexico.\n\n[23] As described by the Federal Court in Guerrero, 2011 FC 1210, there is a two-step process for determining whether the Claimant would be subjected personally to a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment that is not faced generally by others. First, the Claimant must establish, on a balance of probabilities, that he would be subjected personally to a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if returned to their country of nationality. It is only after a finding that there is a personal risk that a decision-maker must continue to consider whether that risk is one faced generally by others.\n\nThe Claimant would be subjected personally to a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\n\n[24] The panel finds that the Claimant would be subjected personally to a risk to his life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment from the Sinaloa Cartel if he returned to Mexico. The Claimant\u2019s family has been threatened in Sinaloa and Tijuana, due to the information he gave to the police and the court cases against the men of the Sinaloa Cartel whom he gave information to the police about, are still open. The Claimant has also failed to accede to the demands of the Sinaloa Cartel to withdraw the statement he made to the police. The panel finds on a balance of probabilities that the Claimant continues to be at risk during the pendency of the criminal cases filed against the men about whom the Claimant testified to the police. The panel notes that the Claimant stated that even though he reached out to the consulate to make them aware that he is still willing to give evidence from Canada, neither the consulate nor the Attorney-General\u2019s office has reached out to him. The panel further notes that the last time summonses were sent to the Claimant by the Court was in 2019. However, the panel finds that the fact that the cases are still open, coupled with the Claimant\u2019s failure to withdraw his \u2018denunciation\u2019\/statement made to the police, continue to put the Claimant\u2019s life at risk.\n\n[25] The objective evidence before the panel offers insight into the precise nature of the risk faced by those, like the Claimant, who are targeted by the criminal gangs in Mexico.\n\n[26] A National Documentation Package (NDP) report for Mexico states that organized crime is a major contributor to Mexico\u2019s problems of crime and violence.[6] According to this and past reports, a major portion between a third and half of all Mexican homicides since 2006 can be attributed to organized crime, especially drug trafficking organizations.[7] For 2018, which is the year the Claimant left Mexico, the most conservative estimates estimate that 20 percent of all homicides in Mexico are attributable to organized crime, while the high-end estimates are more than two (2) thirds of all homicides are attributable to organized crime.[8] The report presents a comprehensive assessment of publicly available data to help understand Mexico\u2019s ongoing public security crisis and specifically the role of organized crime. Mexican organized crime groups are more fragmented, and their activities are diversified.[9] In recent years the nature of violence has changed as the country\u2019s major drug trafficking organizations have become more fragmented, decentralized and diversified.[10] And this has contributed to a proliferation of smaller regional and local criminal gangs and a more complex set of challenges for the Mexican government.[11] At page 14, the same report states the review of available data shows that many homicides in recent years bore characteristics typically associated with organized crime style violence: executions, torture, beheading, dismemberment, assault with weapons, mass graves, and other methods used by organized crime.\n\n[27] The NDP at item 7.34 states that that the Sinaloa Cartel is a powerful organisation whose reach goes as far as \u201cNew York City to Buenos Aires and almost every city in between\u201d.[12] TAB 7.2 reports that the Sinaloa Cartel is regarded as the most enduring and most powerful criminal organisation in the Northern hemisphere, with operations in more than 50 countries and in control of about 60% of Mexico\u2019s drug trade.[13] Another NDP also notes that a large number of people have just \u2018disappeared\u2019 in Mexico.[14]\n\n[28] A document at NDP Item 7.7 by the Immigration and Refugee Board includes a report that organized crime groups track and retaliate against individuals. In correspondence with a research director, the director for Mexico and migrant rights at the Washington office on Latin America Research and Advocacy Organization stated that if a criminal group had very strong motivation to find and retaliate against a certain person, especially if the criminal group is one of the more powerful groups in Mexico or a group with indications of having cooperation from relative authorities, then the ability to track or retaliate against a certain person would be a reasonable concern to have.[15] The research professor stated that if organized crime groups in other parts of Mexico are interested and willing to retaliate against people, they could easily do it. According to sources, criminal groups are motivated to track individuals because they steal or lose money due to personal rivalries, for political incentives or reasons or due to personal vengeance, perceived betrayal, or cooperation with authorities as informants.[16] And according to the director of criminology, it is an oversimplification to say that a group will track just anyone. It really depends on who you are and what you did. Low ranking members are not worth time or resources for armed groups to track and kill. Instead, high ranking members or someone who betrayed a high-ranking criminal organization may cause you to be tracked or targeted.[17]\n\n[29] Similarly, the safety of an individual who relocates to flee from one of these organizations\u2019 threats depends on the interests the group may have to punish or retaliate against the fleeing individual. If the interest is not too serious, relocation may work, but if any of the organizations are interested in harming an individual, no city will provide a safe haven. Any of these organizations have the ability to commit violent acts against any person anywhere in the country.[18]\n\n[30] Similarly, NDP Item 7.19 says, Mexico in 2019, once again suffered the highest homicide rate in its history, organized crime, having survived the government\u2019s militarized assault and corrupted many officials, has broke up into smaller outfits. Armed self defence groups have popped up, but most have criminal ties themselves.[19]\n\n[31] Based on the evidence before the panel and the country condition evidence noted above, the panel finds that that the Claimant would be personally subjected, on a balance of probabilities, to a risk of kidnapping, assault or murder at the hands of the Sinaloa Cartel. The panel finds that these harms amount to a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\n\nThe risk is not one faced generally by others.\n\n[32] In this case, the Claimant is not facing a general risk of violence in Mexico. The Claimant is caught between withdrawing his testimony given to the police or facing the wrath of the Sinaloa gang. The Claimant and the family have already been threatened. What distinguishes this case from the generalized violence in Mexico is the fact that the Claimant has been specifically identified and targeted by the Sinaloa Cartel, who have continued to look for him in different parts of Mexico. While violence is a widespread risk in Mexico, the general population does not currently face a risk to their life for failing to comply with the demands of a criminal organization. As such the Claimant is therefore at risk of being killed by members of the Sinaloa Cartel, and the risk is substantially more pronounced and targeted than that faced by the general population.\n\n[33] The panel finds that these circumstances distinguish the nature of the Claimant\u2019s risk from a generalized risk of indiscriminate crime that may be faced generally by other individuals in Mexico. The panel finds that the Claimant faces a risk that is particular to him and that is not faced generally by other individuals in or from Mexico. For the foregoing reasons, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the Claimant faces a personal risk to his life that is not faced generally by others in Mexico.\n\nState PROTECTION\n\n[34] Except in situations where the state is in complete breakdown, states must be presumed capable of protecting their citizens. To rebut this presumption, the onus is on the Claimant to establish, on a balance of probabilities and through clear and convincing evidence, that their state\u2019s protection is inadequate.[20] The panel notes that the more democratic a state, the harder it is to displace this presumption.[21] The panel finds that this presumption has been rebutted in this case.\n\n[35] A report at Item 10.2 of the NDP speaks directly to the complicity between police and illegal armed groups.[22] The report quotes the International Crisis Group report to the effect that corruption, including corruption within the federal police, underpin state collusion with criminals. This collusion is problematic. Mexico is amid what the Open Society described in its May 2018 report as a crisis of atrocity and impunity based on the level of government collusion and cartel brutality.\n\n[36] The Claimant\u2019s testimony is consistent with the country reports referred to above, which report that Mexican police protection is inadequate. The panel notes the Claimant\u2019s testimony that members of the cartel came to his home immediately after he gave his statement to the police. In the circumstances, the panel finds that the Claimant has rebutted the presumption of state protection with clear and convincing evidence that the Mexican state would be unable or unwilling to offer him adequate protection.\n\nInternal Flight ALTERNATIVE\n\n[37] The Federal Court of Appeal in Rasaratnam,[23] developed a two-prong test when assessing IFA. For an IFA to be viable on the first prong, there must be no serious possibility of the Claimant being persecuted in the IFA, and there must be no risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or danger of torture, on a balance of probabilities. The second prong of the test requires that conditions in that IFA must be such that it would not be unreasonable in all the circumstances for the Claimant to seek refuge there.\n\n[38] The Claimant has been threatened by the Sinaloa Cartel, which objective evidence has shown has reach throughout Mexico. As shown in the reports cited in the previous sections, criminal groups, especially powerful criminal groups, can track targeted individuals through country-wide networks. There is no doubt that the Sinaloa Cartel is one of the powerful criminal organisations in Mexico. The panel thus finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the agent of harm has the means to locate the Claimant anywhere in Mexico.\n\n[39] The Claimant testified that he moved to another part of Sinaloa, and then to Tijuana but was still traced and located by the Sinaloa Cartel. The panel finds that this, coupled with the information in the NDP, shows that the Sinaloa Cartel are motivated to find the Claimant in other areas of the country. The Claimant has refused to withdraw his \u2018declaration\u2019 or statement made to the police. The criminal cases are still open. The panel finds that the Sinaloa Cartel would continue to be motivated to find the Claimant for failing to withdraw the declaration, especially during the pendency of the cases filed against their members. As such, the panel finds that the Claimant would be personally subjected, on a balance of probabilities, to a risk to his life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment throughout Mexico.\n\n[40] As such the panel finds there is no viable IFA for the Claimant anywhere in Mexico.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[41] For the reasons above, the panel finds that the Claimant is a person in need of protection pursuant to paragraph 97(1)(b) of the Act as he has established, on a balance of probabilities, that he would be personally subjected to a risk to his life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in Mexico.\n\n(signed) Ademiju Olatunji\n\nDecember 27, 2023\n\n[1] Maldonado v.

These are the reasons for decision in the claims of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, who is the principal claimant, and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, who is the associate claimant, both of whom claim to be citizens of Mexico and are claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n\n[3] In reaching this decision, I have considered the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline, gender considerations in proceedings before the Immigration and Refugee Board.\n\n[4] The claimants\u2019 allegations are fully contained in their Basis of Claim forms and in their testimony at the hearing. In summary, the claimants are a common law couple. The principal claimant worked as both a XXXX XXXX for XXXX, a XXXX XXXX XXXX, and as a XXXX XXXX in a local XXXX XXXX in Monterrey, Mexico. He says that he provided reports to XXXX approximately once or twice per month and that he was invited to XXXX in 2016. And he XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX XXXX across all age groups. The XXXX XXXX where he XXXX had anywhere from 2,000 to 3,000 XXXX, and his XXXX averaged between 40 to 45 XXXX in each XXXX.\n\n[5] He would XXXX for approximately two (2) to three (3) hours a day and when asked, he said that he XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, including professionalism and balance. It was while working in the XXXX in XXXX 2021 that he observed drug activity amongst the XXXX and decided to XXXX XXXX XXXX about this, to do a XXXX, to do a XXXX XXXX about the drugs in XXXX. Initially, he would start with his own XXXX, but then plan to expand to others. He had observed a XXXX receiving drugs from a cartel member and reported this to the XXXX XXXX, who at the time showed no interest in any dealing with that.\n\n[6] Another \u2014 on another occasion, he saw a XXXX receiving a package and \u2014 sorry. I should back up. He reported \u2014 a few days after he witnessed this incident, he received a call from someone identifying themselves being with the CJ \u2014 the C\u00e1rtel de Jalisco Nueva Generaci\u00f3n, CJNG, and let them know that they were aware he had reported \u2014 he had been part of this incident and that he would be killed for sticking his nose where it did not belong. He thought it was one (1) of the XXXX or XXXX\u2019s friends trying to scare him.\n\n[7] A week later, the principal claimant witnessed a XXXX hiding a package. He took the XXXX to the XXXX. And when they \u2014 when the XXXX opened the bag, they found drugs. The XXXX said that he would call the police. Two (2) weeks later, the claimant was kidnapped by the cartel who physically abused him. He was held for approximately three (3) hours, during which time he was physically assaulted and told that he had to make up for their lost revenue by paying them XXXX XXXX XXXX pesos per month, and if he did not do this, they would take and harm the associate claimant. The principal claimant went to hospital after, and a police officer who overheard him speaking about his experience pulled him aside and advised him to hide. They told him that the cartel told them they would locate him at his home or XXXX to collect the payment. He moved to Mexico City, and in late XXXX, his mother reported that his car was burning in front of their home and that cartel members had told him her, when she had gone outside, to tell him that he should pay his debt.\n\n[8] The principal claimant left for the United States in XXXX 2021, when hoping things would calm down in his absence. But his family continued \u2014 began receiving threats, saying he had to appear or else. The associate claimant went and stayed with friends at a home in a different state. The principal claimant returned to Monterrey in XXXX 2022 because his family not heard from the cartel since XXXX and thought they had forgotten about him. However, a few days after his return, the principal claimant was chased and shot after he had been at a family event. He left the \u2014 or they left (sic) the United States after this. The cartel called the claimant\u2019s mother \u2014 or principal claimant\u2019s mother again in XXXX 2022, telling her she had to return to Mexico and repay what he owed, and they would located him in the US too.\n\n[9] Regardless, the claimants did return to Mexico in XXXX. They said they did so because they needed to get personal documents and to deal with their banks, which they \u2014 only they could deal with directly. They decided to come to Canada to try and rebuild their lives, after arriving \u2014 and arrived here in early XXXX. They fear returning to Mexico as they believe the cartel is motivated to locate, kill them. And they note that their family members, such as the associated claimant\u2019s mother, has received threats directly about them. But also, the principal claimant\u2019s mother and brother.\n\nDETERMINATION\n\n[10] I find the claimants to be Convention refugees as they have established a serious possibility of persecution in Mexico. The claimant\u2019s personal and national identities of citizens of Mexico have been established on a balance of probabilities by the copy of their Mexican passports that are in evidence.\n\nNexus\n[11] For a claimant to be considered a Convention refugee, they must have a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. The principal claimant has a nexus to the Convention ground of political opinion as a XXXX who investigated cartels and for his role as a XXXX. The associate claimant has a nexus to the Convention ground of membership in a particular social group due to her familial connection to the claimant. To be considered persecution, the mistreatment suffered or anticipated must be serious and constitute the denial of a basic human right. Persecution can be considered the sustained or systemic violation of basic human rights.\n\n[12] The particular \u2014 the principal claimant in particular is not free to express his political opinion. And given the experience of the principal claimant, the associate claimant is now also afraid to speak out. If the claimants were to express their beliefs or views based on objective evidence I will talk about, they would face a serious possibility of consequences, including intimidation, threats, and risk to their lives. I find the treatment and harm the claimants face amounts to serious breaches of their freedom of expression and physical integrity, and therefore, amounts to persecution.\n\nCredibility\n\n[13] When a claimant swears to the truth of certain allegations, this creates a presumption that those allegations are true unless there be reason to doubt their truthfulness. However, this presumption does not apply to inferences which are conclusions drawn from facts or speculation for which there is no evidentiary basis. In this case, I found the claimants to be credible, consistent, sincere, and forthright in their testimony. They provided ample detail without exaggerating or tailoring their evidence. And in particular, I found the principal claimant to be credible on a balance of probabilities about his work as a XXXX in Mexico, as a XXXX, and his experiences there, and the threat of harm for which he fears in Mexico.\n\n[14] The claimants provided several items in support of their allegations, including a copy of the principal claimant\u2019s XXXX degree that shows he studied XXXX. Additionally, there are several items relating to his employment as a XXXX, including a copy of his XXXX employee identification, invoices from them, dated XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX that were paid to the principal claimant for work he did for them, and a letter from their operations manager confirming the claimant\u2019s employment with them and his attack by the cartel. They have also provided photos of the injuries the principal claimant sustained during his kidnapping, which indicate he experienced lacerations, bruising, and missing teeth.\n\n[15] They have support letters from family members, including both claimants\u2019 mothers, and a letter from the principal claimant\u2019s brother who says the cartel has approached him at various times, pretending to be his brother\u2019s former colleagues, and on at least one (1) occasion actually appeared at his home. A letter from the associate claimant\u2019s sister says the cartel has visited her own home twice looking for the claimants. I have no reason to doubt the authenticity of these documents or the veracity of the photos and find they are relevant and probative. I give them high weight and I find that based on this evidence that the principal claimant was a XXXX as he alleged as well as a XXXX.\n\n[16] I note the principal claimant went to the United States on XXXX XXXX, 2021, until XXXX XXXX, 2022, and then again from XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX, but did not make a claim during either visit. The principal claimant said that he initially went to the United States as he hoped the cartel would forget him. The second time he \u2014 the two (2) went together, they did not claim because at one (1) point he answered his phone and was threatened by a cartel member who indicated he knew he was in the US, and they did not feel safe there because of this. I find their explanation to be reasonable and do not find their failure to claim in the US undermines their overall credibility.\n\n[17] I further note the principal claimant returned to Mexico on two (2) occasions. When asked why he returned especially to Monterrey, where the incidents caused him to leave occurred, he stated he believed that since his family had not heard from the cartel since XXXX 2022, that they had forgotten about him, and it was okay for him to return. The incident where he was chased and shot at in XXXX of that \u2014 of 2022 to show that it was a mistake. And he said that they returned a second time to Mexico to gather personal belongings and deal with matters such as banking that they could only themselves do in person. He said that they stayed near the airport, and he had his mother bring his belongings to him and went to a bank branch close to their location so as to not go in the city or travel elsewhere. I find their explanation to be reasonable and do not find that \u2014 particular, the claimant\u2019s returns to Mexico negatively affect their overall credibility.\n\n[18] I find that claimants have credibly established their subjective fears.\n\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution\n\n[19] Having found that the claimants are credible, and they have a genuine subjective fear of persecution based primarily on the principal claimant\u2019s work, both as a XXXX and a XXXX, and for the associate claimant due to her connection to the principal claimant, I must consider whether their fears are objectively well-founded. Information found in the United States Department of State report at Item 2.1 of the National Documentation Package for Mexico notes that while Mexico law allows for freedom of expression and this applies to members of the press and generally speaking, the state respected this right, it reports that journalists who report on state corruption or who openly critique the state or organized crime face a serious threat to their safety.\n\n[20] According to the report, journalists were killed or subject to physical and cyber attacks, harassment, intimidation, especially by state agents and criminal organizations because of their reporting. As a result, the media was limited in their ability to investigate and report since many of the reporters killed cover crime, corruption, and local politics. As a result of the threat to the safety of journalists, some journalists practice self-censorship. Journalists are reported to alter their coverage due to lack of protection from the government, attacks against members of the media and newsrooms and threats of retribution against their families. Journalists are reported to practice self-censorship because of threats from criminal groups and government officials.\n\n[21] In relation to the influence of cartels on members of the media, the DOS report specifically says, \u201ccriminal groups exercise grave influence over media outlets and reporters threatening individuals who publish critical views of criminal groups.\u201d It cites the case of two (2) reporters from Chiapas who covered migration for 30 years and were threatened by cartels repeatedly until the threats escalated to the point where they were \u2014 the reporters received death threats against both them and their daughter, causing them to escape to the United States with the help of Reporters Without Borders.\n\n[22] [According to the United Nations General Assembly Compilation of Mexico at Item 2.5, the special rapporteur found that the pervasive assault on journalists and journalism presented a challenging and immediate threat to freedom of expression in that country. According to the NDP Item at 2.9, which is a special report by the UN special rapporteur on human rights in Mexico, \u201cjournalists who voice critical views often face intimidation. Mexico has become one (1) of the world\u2019s most dangerous places for journalists. Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and United Nations experts have referred to a crisis for freedom of expression in Mexico involving killings, disappearances, physical and psychological attacks on the media, and other forms of interference designed not only to harm individual journalists, but also the public\u2019s right to know. Due to the climate of insecurity and widespread impunity at the state municipal levels, self-censorship has become rife. Many newspapers in violent areas fear reprisals if they publish stories on organized crime, drug trafficking or corruption.\u201d\n\n[23] Human Rights Watch at Tab 2.3 echoes this assessment that Mexico is one (1) of the most dangerous countries in the world to be a journalist, noting that those who expose cartels or criticize public officials face threats, attacks, harassment, and surveillance by criminal groups and\/or government authorities. It further observes that authorities fail to adequately investigate or prosecute attacks on journalists. Freedom House in its report at Tab 2.8 says that 2022 was the deadliest year for journalists in Mexican history, as at least 15 journalists were killed. It further observed that President Lopez Obrador frequently and publicly attacks the press and that attacks against journalists increased by 85 percent in the first three (3) years since he became president.\n\n[24] A report by the US Congressional Research Service found at Tab 11.1 says that journalists are three (3) times as likely as other Mexicans to being the victims of organized crime or drug-related violence. It further says that while murder and disappearances are the most drastic crimes committed against journalists. Others include harassment, cyber surveillance, destruction of property, torture, and threats to journalists\u2019 families. A report by the Immigration and Refugee Board on the Cartel, the CJNG at Tab 7.7, said that this cartel is known more so than others for its excessive use of violence and that it has significant presence in 23 of the 32 states with territorial dominance stretching from the south of Mexico up to its border with the United States. It has international presence, too, as it has contacts in the United States, Canada, Australia, China, and southeast Asia. They are largely involved in drug trafficking. Sources indicate that if the CJNG wants to find a person in Mexico, they can and will as they have the resources to do so. Additionally, it says that they control the police and have financed many politicians.\n\n[25] To be considered persecution, the mistreatment suffered or anticipated must be serious and constitute the denial of the basic human right. Persecution can be considered the sustained or systemic violation of basic human rights. The principal claimant in particular is not free to express his political opinion and he said his passion for journalism is so strong that if he had to return to Mexico, he would continue being a XXXX. The claimants face a serious possibility of persecution, including intimidation, threats, kidnapping, physical, and in the case of the associate claimant, sexual assault, and a risk to their lives. I find the treatment and harm the claimants face amount to serious breaches of their freedoms of expression and their physical integrity and this does amount to persecution.\n\n[26] I find that their subjective fears are grounded in the objective evidence.\n\nState Protection\n\n[27] In refugee claims, there is a presumption of state protection. Although this presumption may be rebutted with clear and compelling evidence, the claimants would not have access to adequate state protection. The United States Department of State report at Item 2.1 that I previously mentioned observes that impunity and extremely low rates of persecution remain a problem for all crimes, including human rights abuses, and notes that human rights abuses within the country include violence against journalists. There were reports of some government agents who are complicit with international organized crime gangs, and there were low prosecution and conviction rates in these abuses.\n\n[28] It further states that while the government investigated and prosecuted some crimes, majority are neither investigated nor prosecuted. Further, the Freedom House report mentioned earlier at tab \u2014 which is also found at Tab 2.8 notes that while the Interior Secretariat operates the federal protection mechanism for human rights defenders and journalists, and it has in some cases successfully helped reporters by providing them with safe house bodyguards, it is chronically underfunded and not always effective since at least two (2) journalists under its protection have been killed. Moreover, the report by the US Congressional Research Service previously mentioned \u2014 cites a survey of Mexican journalists from 2019 where 85 percent of respondents said that authorities do little or nothing to protect them. It says that as of January 2022, President Lopez Obrador ordered a review of the federal protection mechanism for human rights defenders and journalists to better coordinate with state officials.\n\n[29] The principal claimant reported drug activity in a XXXX to police and a few weeks later was kidnapped by a cartel. When he mentioned this to police, an officer warned him he should hide. They did not investigate his kidnapping and instead, he continued to face targeting through \u2014 in some instances through his family. Based on the totality of the evidence before me, I find that although there is some mixed evidence of efforts by the state to make improvements, there continues to be an absence of operationally effective state protection available. I find the state protection is not available for these claimants.\n\nInternal Flight Alternative\n\n[30] Based on the objective information previously cited, including that of the US DOS report and the IRB\u2019s research report that says the CJNG has resources to track people in Mexico, including journalists, that \u2014 and that relocation is not a solution for people fleeing from them, I find that XXXX and their family are subject to persecution throughout Mexico, and therefore, the claimants face a serious possibility of persecution everywhere in Mexico.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[31] Having considered all the evidence, I find the claimants are Convention refugees under section 96 of the Act, and I accept their claims.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

She gave birth to a daughter in 2011 from rape from a XXXX. She believes that these men are operating in conjunction with the Los Zetas Cartel.\n\n[4] The claimant was also raised in the Indigenous community of XXXX, and although not Indigenous herself, she is perceived to be Indigenous, as her native language is the Indigenous Nahuatl and she has a notable accent when speaking Spanish. Her cultural characteristics such as her dress and appearance also reflect the Nahuatl community. Consequently, she has faced discrimination and harassment due to being perceived as Indigenous, and she advocates for the Nahautl people and culture.\n\n[5] The claimant arrived in Canada in XXXX 2022 and signed her BOC form in January 2023.\n\nDETERMINATION\n\n[6] I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee as per s. 96 of IRPA, as she has established a serious possibility of persecution if she were to return to Mexico.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nIdentity\n\n[7] I find that the personal identity of the claimant and her identity as a national of Mexico have been established through her testimony and the copy of her passport in evidence,[5] along with a copy of her Mexican birth certificate.[6]\n\nNexus\n\n[8] I find that the allegations establish a nexus to a Convention ground for the claimant, specifically membership in a particular social group as a woman facing gender-related violence due to her allegations of forced prostitution, non-domestic sexual violence, and attempted femicide. As per the guidance offered in Guideline 4 regarding an intersectional analysis, I have also considered her profile as a single mother perceived by her agents of persecution and Mexican society as Indigenous. For this reason, her claim will be analyzed under s. 96 of IRPA.\n\nCredibility\n\n[9] A claimant\u2019s sworn testimony is presumed truthful unless there are reasons to doubt the veracity of their allegations.[7] In this case, the claimant\u2019s testimony was candid, straightforward, spontaneous, and appeared genuine. The claimant did not attempt to embellish her testimony nor enhance the favourability of her claim, despite opportunity to do so. She testified extensively about her experience of growing up in an Indigenous community, the poverty and lack of services the community faced, the role of the XXXX within the community, including the common practice of recruitment of local Indigenous girls for trafficking at the age of 15 and their connections and operations with Los Zetas and local authorities, and the discrimination, harassment, and physical violence she faced by Mexican society in Puebla, Hidalgo, and Tlaxcala, including random physical assaults in the street, discrimination in employment, and a lack of medical and police services, on account of being perceived as Indigenous. The claimant\u2019s testimony was generally consistent with the information provided in her BOC form, narrative, and amendments, and I find that there were no material inconsistencies in her testimony. Overall, I find the claimant to be a credible witness regarding the material facts established below.\n\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution\n\nFindings of fact\n\n[10] The claimant provided supporting documents at exhibit 4.1, including: a copy of her Mexican voter ID card issued in Puebla in 2012; a stamped copy of a police report filed by the claimant for the crime of \u201cvictim of kidnapping, traffic, and prostitution\u201d in Puebla in XXXX 2018; a stamped and signed hospital release report from XXXX 2018 stating that the claimant was hospitalized for XXXX days for \u201cfractures in the body, signs of sexual violence and injuries by firearm\u201d and required follow-up treatment; a XXXX 2009 certificate stating that the claimant is certified as a XXXX XXXX; photographs of the claimant as a child participating in a traditional Nahuatl ceremony of initiation into the community; and photographs of injuries the claimant suffered when kidnapped and confined. I find no reason to doubt the genuine nature of these documents and give them full weight in establishing, along with the claimant\u2019s credible testimony, the facts outlined below:\n\n\u00b7 The claimant was born and raised in the Nahuatl community and culture. Her first language is Nahuatl, she underwent cultural initiations into the Nahuatl community, she is perceived as Nahuatl due to her dress, accent, and practices, and she has faced discrimination and harassment both within her local community and other cities within Mexico due to the perception of others that she is Indigenous. She also advocates for the Nahuatl people in ways such as learning Spanish and becoming certified as a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX so she could XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX;\n\n\u00b7 The claimant was kidnapped, kept at a \u201ccapture house\u201d in Tenancingo, and forced into prostitution by the XXXX at age 15. There was a large group of criminals participating in this operation, and she frequently witnessed the exchange of drugs and women between the XXXX and members of Los Zetas. She heard these men verbally identified as Los Zetas in conversation with the XXXX. She additionally overheard their discussions about trafficking routes and operations. She also stated that it is common knowledge that Los Zetas control the drug trade in the Tlaxcala region. She stated that members of Los Zetas were the \u201cmain market\u201d for the sex trafficking of the XXXX and that the XXXX often paid Los Zetas for drugs by giving them women. It was through the permission and business of Los Zetas that the XXXX were permitted to traffick in that region, and these women were often used as drug mules for Los Zetas. While the claimant heard many of the names of the traffickers, she did not know exactly who they were until she escaped and saw news about a man who had been captured and imprisoned in the USA for trafficking between Mexico and the USA. She recognized him as one of the XXXX who had held her captive;\n\n\u00b7 The claimant gave birth to a daughter who was fathered by a XXXX in 2011. As the XXXX control the paperwork of the region, this man filed for a birth certificate, and is listed as the claimant\u2019s daughter\u2019s father on her birth certificate. However, this man has never met the claimant\u2019s daughter nor attempted to contact or meet her;\n\n\u00b7 The claimant escaped from the capture house on two occasions. After her first escape, she lived in Puebla, roughly an hour and a half drive away from Tenancingo, where she kept her daughter hidden and only went outside to work. She was found by men she recognized from the capture house which she believes was by coincidence, as they recognized her when she was out in public, she ran from them, they put a gun to her head, and forced her into their vehicle;\n\n\u00b7 The second time the claimant escaped with the assistance of another man who was working for, but fearful of, the XXXX and also wanted to leave. They intended to go to Puebla to get her daughter and escape to another city, but they were found by the XXXX in Puebla, where they were shot at and crashed their vehicle. The man assisting the claimant died. The claimant received medical attention and filed a police report. The claimant then relocated to Hidalgo, around a four to five hour drive from Tenancingo, where she attempted to change her clothing and hairstyle and live in hiding as much as possible;\n\n\u00b7 Around one year after relocating to Hidalgo, the claimant began to receive weekly phone calls from different people who did not identify themselves but continually told her that they knew where she was and that they would come to take her back to the capture house. The claimant moved houses and changed her phone number, but continued to receive these phone calls, which then began every 2 days. It was at this point she decided to come to Canada;\n\n\u00b7 The claimant has not heard from any member of the XXXX or Los Zetas since arriving in Canada. The claimant\u2019s daughter continues to live in Mexico with her parents, who moved cities after she left. The last time the claimant spoke with her parents was one year ago, as she wishes to keep them safe, and they informed her that they would continue to live in hiding to keep her daughter safe. While the claimant stated that no member of her family has been threatened or harmed by her agents of persecution, she is fearful for her daughter\u2019s safety, as she is now 12 years old and the recruitment of women into the prostitution ring beings around age 15. She fears that if her daughter is found and connected to her, her daughter will experience the same assaults she did.\n\nDelay in claiming protection in Canada\n\n[11] The claimant travelled to Canada in XXXX 2022 and she signed her BOC form in January 2023. She entered Canada on a visitor\u2019s eTA that provided her with legal visitor status until XXXX 2022. She stated that before her status expired, she began doing research into protection for individuals in her situation and she learned online about refugee protection. She then filed a claim with legal aid since she did not have money, and waited for their approval. In September 2022 she was matched with a lawyer, and she began filling out her forms to claim refugee protection. Additionally, she filed an application for an extension on her visitor\u2019s visa, but found out in October 2022 that it was denied. I find these explanations reasonable, as the claimant did not know about refugee protection until she began doing research when her legal status was expiring, she submitted an extension application and did not find out it was denied until October 2022, and she had already been working with a lawyer at this time to complete her refugee application. I, therefore, do not draw a negative inference regarding the claimant\u2019s subjective fear from her delay in claiming protection in Canada after entering in XXXX 2022.\n\nConclusions on subjective fear\n\n[12] Overall, I find that the claimant has established a subjective fear of persecution from the XXXX and members of the Los Zetas cartel, including a future risk of forced prostitution and death. I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant was raised in the Nahuatl community and culture, is perceived by her kidnappers and generally by Mexican society to be an Indigenous Nahuatl woman, and that she has experienced discrimination, harassment, and physical violence due to perceptions that she is Indigenous. I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant was kidnapped by the XXXX, that the claimant was in close contact with members of Los Zetas, that the XXXX work in collaboration with Los Zetas, and that the claimant has detailed information about the human, sex, and drug trafficking operations of the XXXX and Los Zetas.\n\nObjective basis\n\n[13] According to the objective evidence in the National Documentation Package (NDP) for Mexico, last updated September 29, 2023,[8] \u201cpatriarchal and conservative values are still prevalent in Mexican society\u201d[9] and violence against women is a significant problem. Item 2.8 indicated that in a 2023 report, \u201csexual abuse\u2026against women [is] common, and perpetrators are rarely punished\u201d.[10] Mexico is listed as being within the top 20 worst countries in the world for violence against women.[11] NDP item 5.24 states that between 2018-2020, \u201cthe National Register of Disappeared and Unlocated Persons documented the disappearance of 19,938 women, girls, and adolescents in Mexico\u201d. Sources from a 2021 RIR indicate that the rate of femicides in Mexico has increased by 137 percent over the last five years, while homicides have comparatively increased by 35 percent over the same period.[12] According to official statistics, 968 femicides were recorded in 2022; some nongovernmental sources say the true number is likely much higher.[13] It is widely acknowledged between many sources that rates of femicide are underreported.\n\n[14] Item 2.8 states that \u201cMexico is a major source, transit, and destination country for trafficking in persons, including women and children, many of whom are subject to forced labor and sexual exploitation. Organized criminal gangs are heavily involved in human trafficking in Mexico and into the United States.\u201d[14] According to the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women, the Mexican state adopted in 2012 the \u201cGeneral Act for the Prevention, Punishment and Eradication of Crimes of Trafficking in Persons and for the Protection and Assistance of Victims\u201d.[15] However, the Committee expressed concerns regarding a lack of harmonized and coordinated mechanisms between state and municipal levels; a lack of comprehensive anti-trafficking strategy and limited data; low prosecution and conviction rates of traffickers; revictimization and prosecution of trafficking victims; insufficient assistance, rehabilitation, compensation, and reintegration measures for victims; and complicity between State agents and international organized crime gangs, corruption and impunity, and insufficient coordination with neighbouring countries in preventing and prosecuting traffickers and supporting victims.[16]\n\n[15] Further, the Committee reported police violence and extortion of women in prostitution, arbitrary arrests and detention without warrants, and insufficient services and programs for women including exit programmes for women seeking to leave prostitution.[17] Additionally, the objective evidence indicates an increased vulnerability for Indigenous women[18]\u2014or, in the claimant\u2019s particular circumstances, a woman perceived as Indigenous\u2014regarding trafficking and sexual violence, including a lack of accessibility to victims services,[19] an increased danger to criminal violence,[20] a lack of a structured and comprehensive strategy on the design and implementation of culturally appropriate policies to prevent, investigate, punish, and redress acts of violence against indigenous women,[21] a higher growth rate of femicides amongst Indigenous communities,[22] stereotyped and negative portrayals of Indigenous women in the media,[23] limited access to the formal labour market,[24] insufficient access to health care, education, and employment opportunities,[25] a higher susceptibility to being \u201cre-victimized\u201d by authorities,[26] amongst other factors. NDP item 5.21 states that cartels place Indigenous women in danger and that seventy percent of human trafficking victims are Indigenous women.\n\n[16] An exhibit 4.2 article identifies Tenancingo as the \u201ccenter of trafficking in women for sexual exploitation\u201d and states that \u201cin safe houses built in that demarcation the victims are received who are then sent to houses, hotels and bars in neighbouring municipalities and to other entities and countries such as the United States\u201d.[27] This article also indicates that trafficking of women in Tenancingo includes underage girls and that prosecution levels are low in comparison to complaints filed.[28] An additional exhibit 5.2 article identifies Tlaxcala as \u201cknown worldwide for the trafficking network that operates in the municipality of Tenancingo\u201d, and speaks about the XXXX XXXX XXXX whom I find the claimant credibly established, on a balance of probabilities, were individuals who were involved in her capture and forced prostitution, as she recognized them as individuals at the capture house.[29]\n\n[17] Item 5.20 indicates that \u201c[m]any of the femicides linked to organized crime are of women whose partner was involved with or targeted by a criminal group\u201d.[30] While I note that the claimant was not romantically involved with a XXXX, her child\u2019s legally-recognized father is a XXXX, she was the subject of sexual abuse and assaults by members of these organized crime groups over many years, and I find that she is perceived as property of these groups due to their continued efforts to pursue her and bring her back to their capture house after she escaped. According to the objective evidence, in the culture surrounding cartels and gangs, \u201cwomen are \u2018considered disposable\u2019\u2026and violence committed against them represents \u2018gang cohesion and masculinity\u2019\u201d, and organized crime culture is \u201c\u2018very macho, patriarchal, with very sexist undertones\u2019\u201d.[31] NDP item 7.8 states that criminal violence has become highly intense, diversified, and popularized over the past two decades in Mexico, with widespread violence and ungovernability affecting almost all Mexican states.\n\n[18] The claimant has established that the men who kidnapped, held, and forced her into prostitution were working in partnership with the Los Zetas cartel. It is objectively well-established that a high percentage of police officers in Mexico work in partnership with criminal organizations,[32] and that Los Zetas are a prominent transnational drug trafficking organization that are known for organized violence. They have a significant presence in the Gulf side of Mexico and have extended reach in Chihuahua and some pacific states.[33] While the Los Zetas are no longer as powerful as in their peak in 2011 and 2012, they still are active, are known to kill those who cannot pay extortion fees or who refuse to work for them, and have resisted government efforts to curtail their networks.[34] Item 7.2 indicates that Los Zetas\u2019 \u201cmain asset is not drug smuggling but organized violence.\u201d[35] Item 7.16 indicates that murder, kidnappings, and torture are seen by cartels as a legitimate part of their drug-trafficking business. Item 7.32 states that Los Zetas are active throughout numerous provinces in Mexico, and the group has fragmented into smaller groups, which continue to be active under different names throughout many regions in Mexico. Today, the fragmenting of larger groups has resulted in \u201ccriminal organizations and groups form[ing] temporary alliances based on common but constantly evolving interests\u201d.[36]\n\n[19] Overall, I find that the objective evidence is aligned with the claimant\u2019s testimony regarding her personal experience of being kidnapped, forced into prostitution, and pursued by the XXXX and their Los Zetas accomplices.\n\nConclusions on well-founded fear of persecution\n\n[20] Based on the totality of the evidence, I find that the claimant has established a well-founded fear of persecution, including further forced prostitution and death, if she were to return to Mexico.\n\nState Protection\n\n[21] Except in situations of complete breakdown of the state apparatus, the state is presumed to be capable of protecting its citizens unless there is clear and convincing evidence to the contrary. I find that the claimant has rebutted this presumption, as her testimony and the objective evidence demonstrate that the state will not provide her with adequate protection.\n\n[22] The claimant testified that the Nahuatl community she grew up in was frequently denied attention from authorities due to their Nahuatl language and culture. She attempted to obtain protection from authorities in Puebla when she first escaped the capture house, but the police officers listened to her story and refused to file a complaint. When she escaped the second time, she was hospitalized, and police came to see her in the hospital. She was able to file a report on this occasion, a copy of which is in evidence.[37] She stated that while they initially did not want to take her report, the presence of the state police and media due to the shooting involved in the incident pressured the police into taking a formal complaint. However, she stated that although they gave her a copy of the complaint, they did not offer her protection, and even after following up on the report, they did not assist her. When the claimant was in Hidalgo, she attempted to seek protection from police and they told her that since she was kidnapped in a different location and was now living in Hidalgo, they could not do anything, and she could continue living there until the XXXX found her again. She again attempted to report to police when she began receiving the threatening phone calls, but they did not pay attention to her or file a report.\n\n[23] The NDP at item 7.18 states that \u201cvarious police forces in Mexico\u2026lack human and material resources in order to properly investigate crimes\u201d. Numerous sources report that police forces in Mexico are corrupt, collude with criminal organizations, and often are influenced by bribes, attributed to \u201cpoor working conditions in law enforcement agencies\u201d.[38] This item also states that \u201c93.2 percent of all crimes committed were either not reported or not investigated\u201d with a large amount of blame placed on police, as citizens saw reporting as \u201ca waste of time\u201d, they had a \u201clack of trust in authorities\u201d, there were \u201cdifficulties and a [long reporting] process\u201d, authorities had a \u201chostile attitude\u201d, and they feared \u201cbeing victims of extortion\u201d.[39] More than half of Mexican citizens saw both police and the Attorney General\u2019s office as corrupt.[40] Item 7.15 states that \u201cLos Zetas or associated splinter groups have infiltrated police departments\u2026[and] state governments\u201d in some regions. NDP item 10.2 corroborates the high risk of police corruption in Mexico, that \u201ccorruption\u2026underpins state collusion with criminals\u201d, and that in most Mexican states, local police \u201chave been infiltrated by organized crime\u201d. This source states that this includes police at all levels\u2014federal, state, and local\u2014and that entire police forces have been disbanded, suspended, or arrested due to the penetration of organized crime and corruption. Due to this reality, there is no trust between police forces and this leads to a lack of communication between different levels of security forces due to the infiltration of drug cartels.[41] Police forces are often paid bribes by cartels and are known to have participated in kidnappings and murders for cartels, including Los Zetas.[42]\n\n[24] Compounding the above, the country condition documents indicate that laws addressing violence against women are not effectively enforced. Item 5.11 states that \u201cthere are often large differences between the existing laws and their implementation. Despite strong existing legislation protecting women\u2019s rights and preventing violence against women, enforcement varies widely and largely depends on social norms\u201d. Implementation of a 2007 law[43] designed to protect women from such gender-based crimes remains halting, particularly at the state level, and impunity is the norm for the killers of hundreds of women each year.[44] State authorities can issue \u201cgender alerts\u201d that trigger greater scrutiny and an influx of resources to combat an epidemic of violence against women, but the mechanism has proven ineffective.[45] The government cut funding for women\u2019s services in 2022, and \u201cthe president frequently dismissed feminists as allies of the political opposition\u201d.[46] As mentioned above, implementation for legislation against sex trafficking is insufficient and victims are often criminalized themselves.\n\n[25] The Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) also stated that there was \u201csystemic impunity\u201d for crimes against women in Mexico, where 90% of crimes go unreported, uninvestigated or unpunished.[47]The United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women, amongst other sources, has emphasized that there are \u201cdeep-rooted institutional, structural and practical barriers\u201d which continue to hinder access to justice for women, including that officials within the criminal justice system, including law enforcement officers, hold \u201cdiscriminatory stereotypes\u201d and \u201climited knowledge\u201d of women\u2019s rights.[48] Item 5.12 states that \u201cthe Mexican police and armed forces routinely torture and ill-treat women, and that sexual violence is routine during arrest and interrogation\u201d, with 72% of arrested women reporting sexual violence during arrest or in the hours that followed.[49] Consequently, it is reported that an estimated 78% of women facing gender-based violence do not seek institutional help or report to authorities.[50]\n\n[26] I find that the lack of assistance the claimant received on multiple occasions when reporting to police in multiple states of Mexico is aligned with the conditions set out in the objective documentation. I, therefore, find that state protection is inadequate at an operational level and that it would not be forthcoming to the claimant in her particular circumstances.\n\nInternal Flight Alternative\n\n[27] For an internal flight alternative (or IFA) to be viable, it must satisfy both prongs of a two-prong test on a balance of probabilities. I must assess whether there is another location in Mexico in which the claimant would not face a serious possibility of persecution or a risk of harm, and whether it would be reasonable to expect her to move there.[51] At the start of the hearing, Mexico City and Merida were proposed as potential IFA locations.\n\nMotivation\n\n[28] As established above, the XXXX found the claimant\u2019s location on two occasions when she escaped. While she testified that she believes it was a coincidence she was found in Puebla when she saw XXXX in public, I also note that she stated in her narrative the XXXX believed she was dead, and she had only escaped after they left her for dead in the countryside. Therefore, I find that although this encounter may have been by coincidence and not a targeted search for the claimant, it is reasonable that they would not be searching for her after they believed they had previously killed her. I also note that immediately upon seeing her, these men put a gun to her head and forced her into their vehicle where they took her back to the capture house. The second occasion she escaped, she was followed, shot at, and the man who assisted her escape died. Once she moved to Hidalgo, I find that she credibly established that the men from the XXXX continued to harass and threaten her through phone calls, stating they were coming to get her, despite moving homes and changing phone numbers. Further, I find that the claimant credibly established that she revealed \u201cabsolutely everything she had lived over various years\u201d to the police when she attempted to file, and on one occasion successfully filed, a report against the XXXX and Los Zetas men.\n\n[29] I note that the objective evidence mentioned above points to a high level of revictimization of sex trafficking victims. I also note that the objective evidence states at NDP item 7.32 that \u201csome of the motivators or factors that influence Los Zetas\u2019 desire to track or retaliate against certain individuals include drugs, money, economic status, perceived rivals, \u2018defectors,\u2019 and filing a police report against Los Zetas\u201d, and that \u201cpersonal feuds, money, and love affairs are \u2018common motivators or factors\u2019\u201d.[52] This source also states that \u201cthe more personal the feud, the higher the possibility of retaliation\u201d.[53] While there is limited information regarding potential motivators for XXXX to pursue a victim who has escaped, as the claimant has credibly established that the XXXX work in close partnership with Los Zetas, that she personally overheard confidential conversations between XXXX and Los Zetas, and that she reported against both the XXXX and Los Zetas when she told the police about her entire experience while captured, I find that members of Los Zetas would be equally motivated to find and harm the claimant due to her reports made against them and the confidential information she has about their operations. Furthermore, I find that the XXXX\u2019 continued pursuit of the claimant after she escaped, the fact that they brought her back into captivity after she had escaped and was found in a different city, and the fact that she also has confidential information about the XXXX create a set of circumstances that establish, on a balance of probabilities, that the XXXX are motivated to find and harm her anywhere in Mexico, including forcing her back into captivity and prostitution, or death.\n\nMeans\n\n[30] The claimant testified that the XXXX travel to different regions in Mexico to find girls to \u201crecruit\u201d into their sex trafficking operation. She states that there are people working for them throughout the entire country and they are looking in general to capture women with her characteristics\u2014particularly those they perceive to be Indigenous. She states that between the XXXX and Los Zetas, many women are killed, so they need to consistently recruit more women to replace the ones who are murdered. Therefore, not only will she be personally searched for by the XXXX, she stated she is also vulnerable to being captured while living in hiding by men working for the XXXX who are not aware of her personal identity, simply based on her characteristics as a woman perceived to be Indigenous. As outlined above, the objective evidence demonstrates that Indigenous women, including those perceived by these criminal groups to be Indigenous, are more vulnerable to gender-based violence and sexual assaults, including sex trafficking.\n\n[31] I find that the claimant has credibly established that members of the Los Zetas cartel would be willing to assist the XXXX in employing their resources to find the claimant throughout Mexico for the reasons mentioned above. NDP item 7.32 states that \u201cLos Zetas is \u2018capable of tracking down enemies, defectors, and people of specific interest, including people fleeing to other states and cities using \u2018different methods ranging from direct tracking to information provided by corrupt authorities\u2019\u201d. This source also states that \u201cit may not be too hard for a specific violent actor to retaliate against a person, no matter where in the country [they] may be relocated\u201d as there is a \u201ccurrent situation of impunity and weakness of the rule of law\u201d.[54] This source further specifies that \u201cLos Zetas uses satellites, antennas, communication networks, and GPS, as well as taxi drivers as informal informants\u201d and that \u201c\u2018anyone can be found anywhere\u2019 through family, friends, social media, as well as information from telephone companies, and government and law enforcement databases\u201d.[55]\n\n[32] Los Zetas are said to have an extensive covert communications network across Mexico which allows them to monitor drug trafficking throughout the country and into neighbouring countries.[56] This network has also been used to \u201cplan attacks and seize territory held by other groups\u201d along with surveillance and \u201coff the grid\u201d communication.[57] The source states that \u201cthe network could be managed remotely, connecting members from different areas to coordinate and communicate about operations\u201d.[58] Los Zetas also use employed lookouts, the monitoring of social media feeds and accounts, and mapping software as tracking tools. Item 7.8 states that \u201ccriminal groups use phone and cellphone companies\u201d and that they may bribe these companies to track phone accounts, messages, and social networks of relatives to find targeted individuals in hiding. Further, it is reported that \u201ccorrupt Mexican officials have helped drug cartels acquire spyware \u2018which can be used to hack mobile phones\u2019\u201d.[59] Counsel submitted that Los Zetas have used their connections with telephone companies to obtain the claimant\u2019s telephone number, and their phone calls to the claimant have been a means to track her location. While I find there is insufficient evidence before me to establish the agent of persecutions\u2019 intention of finding the claimant through telephone calls, I do note that the objective evidence establishes Los Zetas have connections with telephone companies, and have used information obtained from these companies to find targeted individuals.\n\n[33] NDP item 7.8 states that \u201cif a criminal group has \u2018very strong motivation to find and retaliate against a certain person,\u2019 \u2018especially if the criminal group were one of the more powerful groups in Mexico\u2019 and\/or \u2018a group with indications of having cooperation from relevant authorities,\u2019 then \u2018[the ability to track or retaliate against a certain person] would be a reasonable concern to have\u2019\u201d. This source also states that if organized crime groups in other parts of Mexico are interested and willing to retaliate against people relocated in Merida, Campeche, Cabo San Lucas or Mexico City, they could do it easily.[60] An RIR at item 7.15 states that \u201ca personal vendetta could motivate a gang to track someone outside their area, and that gangs can use \u2018corrupt law enforcement agents\u2019 to obtain information about people they pursue\u201d.[61] I find that the history of these men finding out information about the claimant, including her location and telephone numbers, their profiles as members of a prominent sex trafficking operation and Los Zetas, and the objective evidence outlined above establish that these men would have the means to find the claimant in the IFA locations or anywhere in Mexico.\n\n[34] As I have found that these XXXX and members of Los Zetas have the motivation and means to find the claimant throughout Mexico, and it is therefore not safe for the claimant to return anywhere in Mexico, including the proposed IFAs, there is no need to consider whether her relocation to an IFA location would be reasonable. I find that the claimant would face a serious possibility of persecution throughout Mexico.\n\n[35] Based on the information before me, I find that the claimant does not have a viable IFA in Mexico.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[36] I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee and accept her claim.\n\n(signed) Kylee Carreno\n\nDecember 8, 2023\n\n[1] Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n\n[2] Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (IRB) Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 4: Gender Considerations in Proceedings before the Immigration and Refugee Board, updated July 18, 2022.\n\n[3] Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (IRB) Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 8: Accessibility to IRB Proceedings\u2014Procedural Accommodations and Substantive Considerations, updated October 31, 2023.\n\n[4] Exhibits 2.1-2.2.\n\n[5] Exhibit 1.1.\n\n[6] Exhibit 4.1.\n\n[7] Maldonado v.

The claimant also lived in the USA undocumented from 1999 to 2016.\n\n[7] At the XXXX of 2019 the claimant began to work for a company that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in Mexico called XXXX XXXX. I was told I would be fired if I he didn\u2019t XXXX XXXX XXXX in one month. The claimant\u2019s uncle, XXXX XXXX XXXX, who lived in California, USA, had a XXXX XXXX in Cancun and the claimant connected his uncle with this company in order to secure a XXXX and keep his job. The claimant and his uncle completed the paperwork and submitted it to the company and paid a lot of money for the process. Once the claimant\u2019s uncle paid the fees and the claimant gave the company the paperwork saying the XXXX XXXX XXXX was the XXXX XXXX, he was never compensated for his expenses nor the XXXX, and never heard from them again.\n\n[8] In XXXX 2020 the claimant\u2019s uncle came to Mexico from the USA with all the documents proving the transaction and went to make his complaint and file a lawsuit. He went to the XXXX XXXX to submit his complaint. He was given a file number: XXXX. He then returned to the USA however he had provided the claimants phone number and address for follow up. The claimant began feeling as though he was being followed by people and vehicles, so he eventually set up video cameras around his house.\n\n[9] The claimant was accosted by people a few times. One time in XXXX 2021 he was approached by a few people who cut his hand when he went to protect himself. Another time, he exited his truck and was attacked my masked perpetrators who said nothing at all and did not try to rob him, which made the claimant think they were sent as hitmen to take him out.\n\n[10] The claimant went to Oaxaca, to a small village where he has relatives, for two weeks in XXXX 2021 in order to evade being harmed again. While there his grandparents and distant cousin informed him that there were people who came to the village looking for him by name, so he left and returned to his mother\u2019s house in Mexico City.\n\n[11] After his uncle\u2019s claim was not pursued by the authorities the claimant attempted to file a follow up claimant at the XXXX XXXX on three occasions. He was finally successful in filing another complaint in XXXX 2021 however, they never followed up.\n\n[12] The claimant went to the local police twice to report on being followed and accosted in Mexico City, however the police stated that if they didn\u2019t have hard evidence like names, or profiles there was nothing they could do.\n\n[13] When the claimant was heading to the airport to leave Mexico for Canada in XXXX 2022 a car pulled up next to his and shouted at the claimant, threatening to kill him.\n\n[14] The claimant came to Canada in XXXX 2022 and made his refugee claim in April 2023.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nIdentity\n\n[15] I am satisfied with the personal and national identity of the claimant as a citizen of Mexico, which is established by his testimony, and the copy of his passport in evidence.[3]\n\nCredibility\n\n[16] When a claimant swears to the truth of allegations, this creates a presumption that those allegations are true, unless there is reason to doubt their truthfulness.[4] The claimant testified in a straightforward, forthright, detailed, and candid manner. Although there were a few inconsistencies I find that the claimant provided reasonable explanations. He did not appear to exaggerate or tailor his evidence. In summary, his testimony was mostly consistent with the other evidence on central aspects of his claim.\n\n[17] I find that the claimant provided ample details to expand upon his allegations. The claimant also provided evidence in exhibit 4 which included,\na. Complaint that he submitted to the national complaint\u2019s office in XXXX 2021\n\nb. Complaint that his uncle, XXXX XXXX, submitted to the complaint\u2019s office from XXXX 2020\n\nc. Witness information for claimant\u2019s uncle who testified in the hearing.\n\nd. Cover sheet for XXXX contract for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX from the XXXX company, where the claimant encountered the agent of harm and accomplices.\n\n[18] During the hearing the claimant testified that he fears retribution from the agent of harm, the owners of the XXXX XXXX company, as both the claimant and his uncle, Mr. XXXX, reported the agent of harm to the authorities. When the claimant was asked for additional evidence to support his allegations, he referred to the items in exhibit 4 and then offered to call his uncle as a witness. During the hearing the claimant spontaneously called his uncle, who currently resides in California, USA. He testified before the board. The claimant\u2019s uncle answered questions in a candid and detailed manner, and provided additional information on the deceptive business deal that he was involved with, the theft of his XXXX in Cancun without compensation by the XXXX XXXX company, and how he reported this to the authorities in Mexico in XXXX 2020. He further testified that since returning to the USA he reported his case to the Mexican consulate in California, and it is now an ongoing case. He testified that he could provide the documents to substantiate his allegations of having an open case with the Mexican consulate in the USA. The uncle concluded his testimony by stating that the claimant was being targeted by these criminals as the claimant worked for XXXX XXXX, and the uncle had been in the USA and therefore avoided any type of direct threats or harm.\n\n[19] I have no reason to doubt the genuineness of these documents, nor of the claimant\u2019s uncle\u2019s testimony, which corroborated the claimant\u2019s allegations and his documentary evidence. Since the documents and witness testimony relate to the claimant\u2019s experiences in Mexico, including his place of employment, the theft of the witnesses XXXX, the steps they took to file formal complaints, and the steps the witness took in pursuing this case in the USA, and the ongoing interest in the claimant and his uncle, and therefore the risks the claimant faces if he were to return to Mexico, I place significant weight on these documents and on the witness testimony in support of the claimant\u2019s allegations.\n\n[20] Concerns were raised when the claimant testified about the time that the XXXX XXXX XXXX closed, as it was during the COVID pandemic, as well as the length of time he took before making his complaint to the XXXX XXXX complaints department. When this was put to the claimant, he testified that it took time for his office to fully close however it finally closed in XXXX or XXXX 2020. The claimant further testified that before the office closed his manager asked him about his visit to the XXXX XXXX, which is when he attempted to make his first complaint but was unsuccessful. When the claimant was asked about the length of time he took before making his complaint he testified that he attempted to make a complaint in XXXX 2020, then his uncle made his original complaint in XXXX 2020, and the claimant tried one more time before he finally was able to submit it, as the complaint office was often extremely busy. I accept the explanation provided by the claimant over these concerns and do not find that these inconsistencies undermine the claimant\u2019s subjective fear nor his overall credibility.\n\n[21] The claimant arrived in Canada in XXXX 2022 and submitted his BOC in April 2023. When this delay was put to the claimant he testified that he did not intend to make a refugee claim at first as he had planned to come to Canada until the issue improved in Mexico and he felt safe to return and he further testified that he had originally planned to work for a period of time in Canada, which is why he delayed in making a refugee claim. He further testified that he does not feel safe returning now as his uncle continues to be in regular contact with the Mexican Consulate in California, USA regarding his case against the claimant\u2019s former company of employment in Mexico and therefore the claimant testified that they will still be motivated to find him and his risk of harm is ongoing. I find that this explanation seems reasonable in the claimant\u2019s alleged circumstances. I accept the claimant\u2019s explanation for delaying in his claim and therefore it does not appear to raise significant concerns with respect to his subjective fear or credibility.\n\n[22] While living in the USA the claimant was arrested for two counts of driving under the influence. The claimant testified that on each occasion he spent one night in jail and had to pay a bond as well as a court mandated course on alcohol consumption after his first arrest.\n\n[23] Prior to the hearing the RPD notified the Minister, pursuant to RPD Rule 28(1)(a), of possible inadmissibility, considered under Subsections 36(1)(b) and (c) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, inadmissibility may be founded on a conviction for, or the commission of, an offence where committed outside of Canada, which would if committed in Canada, be punishable by a maximum punishment of at least 10 years, and the grounds for so believing are that:\na. The claimant, in his IMM 008 schedule 12, said that he had been detained by US Police in Washington State, from XXXX XXXX 2009 to XXXX XXXX 2009, for a DUI and that he was convicted on XXXX XXXX 2009.\n\nb. The claimant, in his IMM008 schedule 12, said that he had been detained by US Police in California State, from XXXX XXXX 2016 to XXXX XXXX 2016, for a DUI and that the charge was dismissed on XXXX XXXX 2022.\n\n[24] The Minister did not respond to the invitation to intervene in this claim. Furthermore, the RPD notes that the Canadian equivalent provision for this offence is found at section 320.14 of the Criminal Code of Canada and, pursuant to section 320.19(1)(a) the maximum punishment for this offence, if prosecuted by indictment in Canada, is imprisonment for a term of not more than 10 years. Therefore, I did not consider excluding the claimant based on the above-mentioned arrests.\n[25] Given the claimant\u2019s careful testimony and supporting documents, I find that the claimant has established, on a balance of probabilities, the facts alleged in his claims, including that the claimant\u2019s problems began in late 2019 or early 2020 when he worked for the XXXX XXXX company for a short period of time and subsequently involved his uncle in XXXX them his XXXX, with out being compensated. I also accept, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant and his uncle filed complaints against this company at the national level. Therefore, I accept, on a balance of probabilities, the subjective fear he has of returning to Mexico now as he fears retribution for filing these complaints. In sum, I find the claimant to be a credible witness, and therefore believe what he has alleged in support of his claim.\n\nSection 97\n\n[26] In order to satisfy the definition of a Convention refugee found in section 96 of the Act, a claimant must establish that he or she has a well-founded fear of persecution by reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. In terms of section 96 of the Act and whether the claimants\u2019 allegations establish a nexus to any of the 5 Convention grounds, I find that it does not.\n\n[27] I find that the claimant\u2019s fear of harm results from criminality, as he is targeted since he was involved with a business that initiated a fraudulent XXXX deal which the claimant and his uncle reported to the authorities. However, the harm faced is not persecution based on a Convention ground. Therefore, I have assessed this claim under section 97 of the Act.\n\nRisk of Harm\n\n[28] The definition of a person in need of protection in the Act requires that a claimant show that their removal will subject them, personally, to a risk to life, to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or a risk of torture. In the present case, the claimant is specifically targeted by the criminals involved with the XXXX XXXX company or their affiliates, due to his involvement in a fraudulent XXXX deal and reporting it to the authorities.\n\n[29] In order to assess whether that the claimant personally faces a risk to his life from the agent of harm, I will assess the objective evidence regarding criminal activity in Mexico. According to the country conditions evidence, organized crime is pervasive in Mexico and is responsible for alarmingly high levels of violence in the country. While the claimant has not alleged that he was targeted by a specific criminal organization, he testified that he was targeted by his former workplace, which appeared to be affiliated with a criminal group, as they were involved with fraudulent XXXX deals and then they pursued him for making a complaint at the national level.\n\n[30] According to the most recent version of the National Documentation Package (NDP) for Mexico, at NDP item 2.1 on Mexico, criminal organizations carried out widespread killings and other illegal activities throughout the country, and there were reports of numerous enforced disappearances by organized crime groups, sometimes with allegations of state collusion. According to an RIR in the NDP at item 7.8, criminal violence has become highly intense, diversified, and popularized over the past two (2) decades in Mexico. The same report states that \u201cwidespread violence and ungovernability has affected almost all Mexican states.\n\n[31] I find that the agents of harm in this case have personally targeted the claimant due to a personal vendetta with the claimant, and that the claimant will therefore be subjected, personally, to a risk to his life in all of Mexico as he reported them to the police and to the XXXX XXXX complaint department. I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the agent of harm would continue to target the claimant should he return to Mexico.\n\nGeneralized Risk\n\n[32] The next question to consider is whether the risk that the claimants face is faced generally by other individuals in Mexico. The federal court has held that the question is not whether others with similar characteristics could find themselves in the claimant\u2019s position, but whether others generally are in that position now. The evidence before me establishes that the claimant was targeted for a personal vendetta by the criminals in his former place of employment, as the claimant was tracked and his life was threatened as they had a vendetta against the claimant, as the claimant and his uncle reported them to the authorities in Mexico City as well as at the Mexican consulate in California, USA.\n\n[33] The claimant is being threatened because of his knowledge of the fraud and whatever information regarding it he still has, as well as for reporting it to authorities. Based on the claimant\u2019s former job, the threats, and the harm he received, and the suspicious men around the home of his family member, I find that the claimant faces a likely risk of section 97(1)(b) harm if he returns to Mexico and that it is objectively well-founded.\n\n[34] Furthermore, given the objective evidence above where it is indicated that criminal groups in Mexico are known to track individuals based on personal vendettas, I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the agent of harm has pursued the claimant with the intent to harm him in retribution for reporting them to the authorities.\n\n[35] While all people in Mexico could face the possibility of being targeted by criminal organizations, the evidence in this case establishes that the claimant has been personally targeted in Mexico. As the claimant has been specifically named and under surveillance, I find that his situation is therefore distinct from that of the general population of Mexico.\n\n[36] Adopting the language from Correa v Canada, the claimant has been specifically and personally targeted for death in circumstances where others are generally not. I find that the claimant has established that the risk he faces is one he is personally facing, and that it is not faced generally by the population in Mexico.\n\nState Protection\n\n[37] Except in situations where the state is in a state of complete breakdown, states are presumed to be capable of protecting their citizens. The presumption of state protection can only be rebutted with clear and convincing evidence of the state\u2019s inability to protect a particular claimant. In reviewing the country conditions evidence in this case, I find that the presumption of state protection has been rebutted with clear and convincing evidence.\n\n[38] The claimant testified that he went to the police to report being harassed and accosted by unknown people on two occasions and the police did not file his report nor take any action as the claimant did not know the names of the individuals who accosted him. Furthermore, the claimant and his uncle filed reports with the XXXX XXXX complaint department and did not receive any response. In his candid testimony, the claimant\u2019s uncle, testified that he has since made a report to the Mexican consulate in California, and they are in the process of collecting relevant information.\n\n[39] According to the NDP at item 2.8, police corruption in Mexico remains a major problem. While Mexico has made legislative reforms to address police corruption and involvement with criminal cartels, the objective evidence establishes that the effectiveness of these reforms has not manifested. According to a Freedom in the World report of 2023, at 2.8 of NDP, violence is perpetrated by organized criminals, corruption amongst government officials, human rights abuses by both state and non-state actors, and rampant impunity are among the most visible of Mexico\u2019s many governance challenges. Item 7.16 of the NDP explores how corruption has infiltrated all ranks of the Mexican authorities, noting, the culture of corruption in Mexican government entities, including public safety, political and other institutional elements have subjected municipal, state, and federal police forces to criminal elements because of coercion, force, or death. Threats and acts of retribution convert police officers into surrogate organized crime actors, who, in turn, participate in extortion, kidnapping and assassination at the behest of their criminal sponsors.\n\n[40] In view of the objective evidence, I find, on a balance of probabilities, that adequate state protection would not be forthcoming to the claimant should he return to Mexico. The objective evidence indicates that although legislative reforms have been implemented, that implementation has not translated to that of an operationally effective state protection. Therefore, I find that the perception of state protection has been rebutted.\n\nInternal Flight Alternative\n\n[41] The test for a viable IFA has two prongs and I must be satisfied of both on a balance of probabilities in order for there to be a viable IFA. First, I must be satisfied that the claimants would not face a serious possibility of persecution and that they would not be personally subjected to a risk to life, of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or danger of torture in the IFA. Second, I must be satisfied that it would not be unreasonable in all the circumstances, including those particular to the claimants, for the claimants to seek refuge there. Once an IFA has been proposed, the onus is on the claimants to show that the IFA location is unreasonable, which requires the existence of conditions which would jeopardize their life and safety.[5]\n\n[42] For the reasons below, I find that the claimant does not have a viable internal flight alternative in Mexico.\n\n[43] At the outset of the hearing, I identified La Paz and Merida as potential IFA locations. After reviewing the country condition evidence, I find the agent of harm has demonstrated, on a balance of possibilities, both the motivation and means to track the claimant in other areas of Mexico. Therefore, I find that the IFA test fails on the first prong.\n\n[44] The claimant testified that he was followed to his home, and tracked and assaulted when he went to visit his mother on public transport. He further testified that he was pursued in a small village in Oaxaca when he was there in hiding in XXXX 2021 and when he drove to the airport before fleeing to Canada in XXXX 2022. Additionally, the claimant and his uncle testified that his uncle is pursuing the matter with a Mexican consulate in the USA, which will likely come to the attention of the agent of harm, if it has not already, and will put the claimant at further risk.\n\n[45] Furthermore, if the claimant were to return to Mexico and relocate, his location could be divulged through the claimant\u2019s family members, who still live in Mexico. The Federal Court has repeatedly held that a refugee claimant cannot be expected to live in hiding in order for a proposed IFA to be reasonable. In Zamora Huerta, Erika Angelina v. M.C.I., one ruling, (F.C., no. IMM-1985-07) \u2013 para 29, the Court noted that \u201c[n]ot to be able to share your whereabouts with family or friends is tantamount to requiring the Applicant to go into hiding.\u201d\n\n[46] While it is typical to expect that family members will not divulge the location of the claimant to the agent of harm, in this case the evidence indicates that the claimant will face a risk of his relatives eventually informing the agents of harm of the claimant\u2019s location, such as in a situation of duress if the claimant were to return and relocate elsewhere in the country.\n\n[47] Therefore, I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the agents of harm have both means and motivation to pursue the claimant throughout Mexico and no viable IFA exists for him.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[48] For the foregoing reasons, I find that the claimant is a person in need of protection pursuant to section 97(1) of the Act and I accept his claim.\n\n(signed) Hannah Gray\n\nDecember 13, 2023\n\n[1] Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n\n[2] BOC 2\n\n[3] Exhibit 1.\n\n[4] Maldonado v.

[2] I applied this guideline during the hearing when it did not require detailed testimony regarding the sexual assault she faced. I found that the documentary evidence and her allegations, as outlined in her Basis of Claim form, credibly established the details of this incident.\n\nALLEGATIONS\n\n[3] The total allegations are in the claimant\u2019s Basis of Claim (BOC) form.[3] In summary, The claimant fears persecution based on her ethnicity as a person of African descent. The claimant fears the racist segments of the Mexican community, the Mexican authorities and her former boss.\n\n[4] A synopsis of the allegations is as follows: The claimant testified that she had been subjected to humiliation, assaults, and insults from racists and the police due to her Afro-Mexican identity. She explained that she has faced discrimination and persecution in many facets of her life, including education, employment, housing, healthcare, and public places. She stated that she did not want to return to Mexico because she had never been treated and respected as a human being. She also fled from her former boss, who sexually assaulted and threatened to harm her because she left her job and stopped contacting him.\n\nDETERMINATION\n\n[5] I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee as per s. 96 of IRPA, as she has established a serious possibility of persecution if she returns to Mexico.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nIdentity\n\n[6] I find that the personal identity of the claimant and her identity as a national of Mexico have been established through her testimony and the copy of her passport in evidence.[4]\n\nNexus\n\n[7] I find that the allegations establish a nexus to a Convention ground of race and ethnicity. There is also a second nexus to a Convention ground, specifically membership in a particular social group as a woman facing gender-related violence due to her allegations of threats from her former boss to harm her and his previous use of sexual violence to harm her.\n\nCredibility\n\n[8] A claimant\u2019s sworn testimony is presumed truthful unless there are reasons to doubt the veracity of their allegations.[5] In this case, the claimant\u2019s testimony was candid, straightforward, emotional, and genuine. Despite the opportunity to do so, I find that the claimant did not attempt to embellish her testimony or enhance her claim\u2019s favourability. The claimant\u2019s testimony was consistent with the information provided in her BOC form. She was forthcoming in providing details above that were outlined in her BOC form, and I found that there were no material inconsistencies in her testimony. The claimant is a credible witness regarding the material facts established below.\n\nWell-founded fear of persecution\n\nFindings of fact\n\n[9] The claimant testified that she belonged to the Afro-Mexican community in Oaxaca. The claimant provided extensive oral testimony along with her BOC narratives about the countless ways she has faced exclusion, discrimination, and persecution from members of Mexican society and the state itself. She testified to being on multiple occasions the victim of sexual harassment and assault, abuse, marginalization, bullying, targeting, and mockery in school and public places, all based on who she is, a member of the Afro-Mexican community.\n\n[10] The claimant also testified that she was a victim of a sexual assault perpetrated by her former boss. She further testified that people often called her \u201cnegrita,\u201d which is the equivalent of an \u201cn\u201d word in English. On many occasions, Mexican men who sexually harassed her made derogatory comments that \u201cnegritas have hot blood.\u201d The claimant was discriminated against at work when she was given the most difficult tasks requiring physical effort. Her colleagues commented, \u201cThis is what the blacks are good for.\u201d\n\n[11] The claimant provided supporting documents in Exhibit 4. I find no reason to doubt the genuine nature of these documents and give them full weight in establishing the facts outlined below. These documents include letters from her mother in Mexico, her aunt in Mexico, her classmates in Mexico, numerous documents related to the claimant\u2019s education, and photographs of the claimant with her colleagues. All letters the claimant provides are signed and accompanied by respective identification documents. I find that these documents and the claimant\u2019s testimony credibly establish the following facts:\n\n\u00b7 The claimant is an Afro-Mexican woman from Oaxaca, Mexico. According to local traditions, her family sold her to a wealthy man from the same community. The claimant escaped and went to Pueblo, where, despite an adverse environment, she managed to complete university studies.\n\n\u00b7 The claimant was sexually harassed throughout the years. In XXXX 2021, her former boss raped her.\n\n\u00b7 The claimant was denied access to a public event by the police based on the colour of her skin. The police told the claimant that she was not a Mexican and that Mexico does not have black people. They also told her that she probably had faked Mexican ID documents because she looked like a foreigner.\n\n[12] The claimant arrived in Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2022. The claimant signed her BOC form in November 2022. At first, she tried to get a work permit through an agent and waited months for the agent to get back to her. She stated that she did not know about the refugee protection system in Canada. Only later, someone at the library told her she could apply for refugee protection. She applied for refugee protection as soon as she knew that she could apply. The claimant\u2019s explanation is reasonable, and I find that she did not significantly delay filing her claim for refugee protection in Canada. Therefore, I do not draw an adverse inference regarding her delay of nine months in submitting her claim for refugee protection in Canada.\n\nConclusions on Subjective Fear\n\n[13] Based on all the evidence before me, I find that the claimant has established a subjective fear of persecution from members of Mexican society if she were to return to Mexico, including the men who assaulted her.\n\nObjective basis\n\n[14] The US DOS report in the most recent National Documentary Package on Mexico indicates the following on the treatment of indigenous and Afro communities in Mexico:\n\nThe Constitution prohibits discrimination based on ethnicity and a federal law prohibits all forms of discrimination. Nonetheless, discrimination was common against racial and ethnic minorities, including Black, Afro-Mexican, and Indigenous groups. All states have additional laws against discrimination. A 2019 constitutional reform recognizes Afro-Mexicans as an ethnic group. The government did not enforce the law effectively. According to a 2021 report by the National Council to Prevent Discrimination (CONAPRED), in Mexico City, dark-skinned individuals experienced the most discrimination, followed by Indigenous peoples. INEGI reported that 2 percent of the population (2.5 million) self-identified as Afro-Mexican. CONAPRED\u2019s 2017 national survey on discrimination found 58 percent of Afro-Mexicans and 65 percent of Indigenous persons considered their rights were respected \u201clittle or not at all.\u201d The survey also reported 22 percent of persons said they would not share a household with an Afro-Mexican. The survey reported that persons with darker skin completed 6.5 years of schooling, while those with white skin completed 10 years. A report from the Black Alliance for Just Immigration found black migrants faced widespread racial discrimination from individuals and authorities, particularly in accessing employment and services. Black migrants reported migration authorities detained Black migrants for longer periods than other migrants.[6]\n\n[15] Item 13.1 of the NDP describes the roots of the systemic discrimination towards people with darker skin in Mexico. According to the research, discrimination is deeply rooted in the colonial past of Mexico. During Spanish colonization, the Spaniards established a caste system in Mexico. Many Mexicans identify as mestizos, a term with historical roots dating back to Spanish colonization. The term mestizo originally referred to the offspring of a Spanish man and an Indigenous woman are considered lower in caste than a peninsular (one who was born in Spain) or a criollo (one who was born in the New World to Spanish parents). The caste system established during these times created terms for various racial mixtures of Spanish, Indigenous, and Black people, as depicted in paintings of those times. Some of these include mulato (a Spanish man with a Black woman) and morisco (mulatto man with a Spanish woman). One caste painting shows that if a castizo man (offspring of a mestizo man and a Spanish woman) had a child with a Spanish woman, their offspring would then be considered an espa\u00f1ol (Spaniard), showing that the addition of Spanish blood (and thus diminution of Indigenous blood) could confer higher status. In addition to establishing the caste system and assigning castes to individuals, skin colour was another determinant of social status during these times. For example, if an Indigenous person had fair skin, then they could pass as mestizo or white. These concepts of European descent and whiteness dictating social status are still reflected in modern Mexican society.[7]\n\n[16] The same source describes the situation for Afro-Mexicans and people with darker skin in Mexico. It states: \u201d Racial discrimination is pervasive in Mexico and has significant effects on Afro-Mexicans and Black migrants, including unequal treatment by government officials and barriers to accessing services and integrating into society.\u201d[8] The report describes cases of Afro-Mexicans who were detained by Mexican police because the Mexican police did not believe that black people were Mexican. In some egregious cases, black Mexicans were deported to countries such as Haiti. In 2019, the Mexican Constitution was amended to recognize Afro-Mexicans officially. This was an important first step to address the discrimination, including based on race, that affects both Afro-Mexicans and Black migrants in Mexico. This racism manifests overtly, such as almost a quarter of all Mexicans saying they would not rent to an Afro-descendant person, and structurally, such as the inverse correlation between dark skin and educational and economic outcomes in Mexico.[9]\n\n[17] In its concluding observations on Mexico from December 2019, the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (\u201cCERD Committee\u201d) found that Mexico is not doing enough to combat racial discrimination within its borders. The CERD noted that racial discrimination against Afro-Mexicans \u201ccontinues to be deeply rooted and is an obstacle to constructing a multicultural society based on equality and fairness.\u201d The CERD Committee further noted that Afro-Mexicans \u201ccontinue to face discrimination, high levels of marginalization and social exclusion.\u201d[10]\n\n[18] NDP item 13.2 states: \u201cMexican immigration officials have even detained and, in some egregious cases, deported Afro-Mexicans and Indigenous Mexicans due to discriminatory assumptions that they are non-citizens. Discrimination, on the basis of skin colour and race, is prevalent throughout Mexico and adversely impacts Black and Indigenous migrants and citizens.\u201d[11]\n\n[19] Gender Guideline at para 6 talks about intersectionality, which is \u201ca framework for understanding how multiple identity factors including, but not limited to gender, disability, race, religion, indigenous identity, age, or sexual orientation may interact to create distinct and compounded forms of discrimination, mistreatment or marginalization.\u201d[12] The claimant is an Afro-Mexican woman who experienced gender-based violence in Mexico. According to NDP, \u201cblack women in particular face widespread racial and gender-based discrimination in Mexico.\u201d[13] Item 13.7 states: \u201c. In July 2018, the UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women expressed concern at ongoing discrimination and stereotyping against groups, including Afro-Mexican women, as well as at practices such as forced evictions affecting them.\u201d[14]\n\n[20] The Mexican NDP also indicates high levels of violence against women, widespread patriarchal attitudes about women, rising rates of femicide, and mistreatment of women by police officers.[15] The rate of femicides in Mexico has increased by 137 percent over the last five years, while homicides have comparatively increased by 35 percent over the same period. [16] The NDP indicates that \u201colder women in Mexico are among the groups most vulnerable to violence, because of both their gender and their age,\u201d that \u201cbetween January 2019 and March 2020, 158 women over 60 were victims of femicide\u201d, and that \u201ca third of older women are victims of physical or psychological violence.\u201d[17]\n\nConclusions on well-founded fear of persecution\n\n[21] Considering all of the objective evidence, alongside the claimant\u2019s particular circumstances, experiences, and intersectionality, I am satisfied that if the claimant returned to Mexico today, she would face a well-founded fear of persecution.\n\nState Protection\n\n[22] Except in situations of complete breakdown of the state apparatus, the state is presumed to be capable of protecting its citizens unless there is clear and convincing evidence to the contrary. I find that the claimant has rebutted this presumption, as her testimony and the objective evidence demonstrate that the state will not provide her with adequate protection.\n\n[23] The claimant tried to report the sexual assault to the police. However, when the claimant arrived at the station, the police asked her for her passport because they didn\u2019t believe she was Mexican. They told her there was insufficient evidence to launch an investigation and \u201cit was natural for a man to look at a woman and that there was no crime.\u201d[18]\n\n[24] NDP item 7.18 states that \u201cvarious police forces in Mexico\u2026lack human and material resources in order to investigate crimes properly\u201d. This item also states that \u201c93.2 percent of all crimes committed were either not reported or not investigated,\u201d with a large amount of blame placed on the police, as citizens saw reporting as \u201ca waste of time,\u201d they had a \u201clack of trust in authorities,\u201d there were \u201cdifficulties and a [long reporting] process,\u201d authorities had a \u201chostile attitude.\u201d They feared \u201cbeing victims of extortion.\u201d[19]\n\n[25] More than half of Mexican citizens saw both the police and the Attorney General\u2019s office as corrupt.[20] According to the BTI 2020, \u201c[a]s a consequence of impunity and the fact that official forces are in many cases involved in criminal acts, people who are victims of crime rarely report the crime to the police. People are afraid that as the police may be involved, they will be victimized again or because they feel it is useless\u201d.[21] NDP item 10.2 outlines a high risk of police corruption in Mexico, that \u201ccorruption\u2026underpins state collusion with criminals\u201d, and that in most Mexican states, local police \u201chave been infiltrated by organized crime\u201d. This source states that this includes police at all levels\u2014federal, state, and local\u2014and that entire police forces have been disbanded, suspended, or arrested due to the penetration of organized crime and corruption. When violent crimes are reported, according to NDP item 7.18, \u201cif a victim or their family does not pay for the police investigators\u2019 expenses, no arrest will be made.\u201d[22]\n\n[26] The country\u2019s condition documents indicate that laws addressing violence against women are not effectively enforced. Item 5.24 states: \u201cThe most recent information from the SESNSP, from January to December 2020, shows that 10.2 women and girls are murdered every day in Mexico. The prevalence of femicides shows that actions continue to be insufficient to prevent, address and punish violence against women, which is framed in a context of generalized violence, discrimination, and impunity.\u201d[23]\n\n[27] When discussing police treatment of women, item 5.5 states that \u201cin a context where social constructs are based on a predominantly patriarchal culture, women\u2026face particular discrimination simply because they do not have a male partner. Women in Mexico are expected to have a male partner; if they do not, this is seen as suspicious\u201d. Sources in item 5.5 indicate that there has been \u201csystemic impunity\u201d in terms of how gender-based violence is addressed, and note the \u201ccomplicity, indifference, and mismanagement of cases\u201d involving violence against women. The United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women, amongst other sources, has emphasized that there are \u201cdeep-rooted institutional, structural and practical barriers\u201d which continue to hinder access to justice for women, including those officials within the criminal justice system, including law enforcement officers, hold \u201cdiscriminatory stereotypes\u201d and \u201climited knowledge\u201d of women\u2019s rights.[24]\n\n[28] I have considered the country conditions noted above, that the agents of persecution are members of the Mexican society, including the police and the claimant\u2019s testimony that she did not receive any protection after she attempted to report the sexual assault to the police. I find state protection inadequate at an operational level and would not be forthcoming to the claimant in her circumstances.\n\nInternal Flight Alternative\n\n[29] For an internal flight alternative (or IFA) to be viable, it must satisfy both prongs of a two-prong test on a balance of probabilities. I must assess whether there is another location in Mexico where the claimant would not face a serious possibility of persecution or a risk of harm and whether it would be reasonable to expect her to move there.[25]\n\n[30] There is considerable objective evidence on the treatment of Afro-Mexicans in Mexican society. Black and Afro-descendent people face longstanding systematic racial discrimination in Mexico. Item 13.7 states: \u201cThe African presence in Mexico was still often denied or trivialized, and where popular culture depicts black people, they tend to be caricatured and ridiculed.\u201d[26]\n\n[31] NDP item 13.2 states: \u201cDiscrimination, on the basis of skin color and race, is prevalent throughout Mexico and adversely impacts Black and Indigenous migrants and citizens.\u201d[27] Item 13.11 describes economic inequalities between black or dark-skinned people and those with a fairer skin colour. It states: \u201cA 2019 Oxfam report found that 35 percent of Mexicans who self-identify as dark-skinned (and 72 percent of those who speak an Indigenous language) fall in the bottom quartile of an index that measures occupational, educational, and economic indicators.\u201d[28]\n\n[32] Based on the information before me, I find that the claimant does not have a viable IFA in Mexico.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[33] I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee and accept her claim.\n\n(signed) Tereza Kazieva\n\nOctober 27, 2023\n\n[1] Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n\n[2] Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (IRB) Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 4: Gender Considerations in Proceedings before the Immigration and Refugee Board, updated July 18, 2022.\n\n[3] Exhibit 2.\n\n[4] Exhibit 1.\n\n[5] Maldonado v.

And these are the reasons for my decision in the claim of Principal Claimant, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, an Associate Claimant XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX XXXX who claim to be citizens of Mexico and claim refugee protections pursuant to Section 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n\n[2] The allegations of your claim are found in a Basis of Claim form documents at Exhibits 2.1 to 2.4 and the amended narrative at Exhibit 7. You have alleged the following: You are citizens of Mexico, you fear harm at the hands of the CJNG also known as the Jalisco Cartel. You paid extortion money to this cartel from XXXX 2019 until XXXX of 2022, but couldn\u2019t pay a higher amount demanded in XXXX of 2022.\n\n[3] The Principal Claimant was attacked and assaulted due to the failure to pay additional money. And you further alleged that there is no state protection or Internal Flight Alternative available to you anywhere in Mexico.\n\n[4] There is a framework of analysis for claims under Section 97(1)(b) of the Act and I\u2019m going to explain how your situation meets these requirements. The first stage is to determine the risk faced by the claimant. An ongoing or future risk is a real risk that a claimant continues to face. For example a claimant may face a risk of death, sexual violence or other serious harm. In this case, the Principal Claimant faces, on a balance of probabilities, a risk of death, sexual violence or future harm from the Jalisco Cartel. The basis of this is historical because the Claimant has already experience the latter two elements in Mexico and has received threats to her life from the cartel relating to non-payment of extortion moneys.\n\n[5] The claimants have been paying extortion fees for a period of 2019 to 2022. They were targeted by the cartel as XXXX business owners. They were repeatedly threatened by phone and in-person between 2019 and 2022, including threats to their family and attacks on the Principal Claimant\u2019s father. There is a pattern of harassment from the Jalisco Cartel, and the harassment and demands have only increased as they raised the extortion amount from XXXX XXXX XXXX pesos to XXXX XXXX XXXX pesos in XXXX of 2022, which caused the claimants to flee. This shows a high degree of risks faced by the Principal Claimant and her family.\n\n[6] The second stage is to determine whether the risk is generally faced by others. The risk faced by the Principal Claimant and her family is of a serious nature, and it is different from the risks generally faced by others in the country. They were targeted as XXXX business owners while everyone in Mexico is touched by cartel activities, particularly Jalisco, which is at some level throughout the entire country. The direct, immediate risk of harm is significant and more for these claimants because they have defied the cartel and fled the country.\n\n[7] Further, the cartel has continued to harass their family they\u2019ve left behind in Mexico, and attacked or injured the Principal Claimant\u2019s brother. There is a clear risk of harm that is not generalized.\n\n[8] I find their identities as nationals of Mexico are established by the documents provided namely their passports and supporting identity documents in Exhibit 1. I find that they faced a Section 97 risk in Mexico.\n\n[9] On the matter of credibility, when a claimant swears to the truth of their allegations it creates a presumption that those allegations are true, unless there is a reason to doubt that. In your case, when considering all of the evidence, I find that the testimony and evidence to be credible on the balance of probabilities, I found no substantial reason to doubt any of your truthfulness.\n\n[10] The Principal Claimant testified in a very straightforward, direct and convincing manner. You were able to answer all of the questions that I asked. And there was no hesitation. I found that you did not exaggerate your testimony or omit any details. There were some material inconsistencies between your testimony and the documentary evidence. But in every instance you were able to provide a reasonable explanation. I find you to be a credible witness on the whole and therefore I believe what you have alleged in support of your claim.\n\n[11] I have no reason to doubt the authenticity of the documentary evidence that you disclosed and find that the evidence supports and corroborates your allegations. For example, you disclosed letters of support from family members corroborating what you\u2019ve said in the Basis of Claim form, you provided prior employment records and photos showing injuries that you and your brother sustained.\n\n[12] On the matter of objective basis of future risks, based on the credibility of your allegations and the documentary evidence that I\u2019m about to set out, I find that you have established on a balance of probabilities that if you were to return to Mexico, you would be subjected to violence at the hands of the Jalisco Cartel. The cartel is also identified as CJNG. And it\u2019s reportedly among the largest and most powerful cartels operating in Mexico, and reportedly exists in the majority of Mexican states and is embroiled in a patchwork of rivalries nationwide. InSight Crime, a foundation that studies organized crime in Latin America and the Caribbean, reports that Jalisco is truly the dominant criminal actor in multiple Mexican states.\n\n[13] A 2023 report produced by the IRB\u2019s Research Directorate cite sources describe Jalisco Cartel as distinct among other major criminal groups in its extreme and public use of violence and its brazenness, brutality and use of public executions. The objective evidence also indicates that in addition to drug trafficking and kidnapping the cartel often engages in extortion.\n\n[14] According to one researcher interviewed by the IRB\u2019s Research Directorate, CJNG\u2019s extortion of civilians has increased in the last two years, particularly in the territories under their control in Central Mexico.\n\n[15] On the matter of state protection, there is a presumption that states are capable of protecting their own people, their own citizens except where the state is completely broken down. And that presumption is rebuttable by a claimant with clear and convincing evidence of state\u2019s unwillingness or inability to protect them.\n\n[16] I accept the Principal Claimant sought state protection at previous times in her life and the assistance was not forthcoming. In light of her experiences and the documentary evidence (inaudible 02:34:36) I find that there is clear and convincing evidence that state protection in Mexico is inadequate for your circumstances. I find the presumption has been rebutted in these claims.\n\n[17] The documentary evidence establishes that the cartel throughout the country aim to dominate and intimidate local politicians and law enforcement. They infiltrate state authorities, and they use corrupt law enforcement agents to obtain information about the people that they pursue.\n\n[18] Jalisco is capable of confronting and corrupting the Mexican state at every level of government, employing bribes or bullet strategies with state authorities, and they have a history in infiltrating police forces. Police corruption remains a serious problem in Mexico. There is little indication of improvement in recent years. In most Mexican states, local police have been infiltrated by organized crime.\n\n[19] Analysis of drug trafficking, organized crime and human trafficking, human rights violations also indicate the highlight the role of police at all levels in facilitating illegal business, working for organized crime and systematically violating human rights. A report from Human Rights Watch state that since the beginning of the war on organized crime in 2006, the rates of violent crime has skyrocketed in Mexico. Although authorities often blame this violence on criminal groups, most crimes are not investigated and those responsible are never identified or prosecuted.\n\n[20] Similarly, according to the United States Department of State impunity and extremely low rates of prosecution remain a problem for all types of crime in Mexico. Criminal organization thus \u2014 they continue to carry out human rights abuses and widespread killings throughout the country with the majority of their crimes going uninvestigated and unprosecuted.\n\n[21] The objective evidence also shows that in many cases Mexican police have been found to have colluded with organized criminal groups. A 2020 report produced by the IRB\u2019s Research Directorate says that in Mexico organized crime is deeply permeated police institutions. The IRB report site sources that indicate that low pay contributes to police corruption and that local police are particularly vulnerable to corruption, infiltration from organized crime groups as they are overworked, underpaid and understaffed.\n\n[22] Now, on determining whether you could live safely in any other part of Mexico, for a refugee claim to succeed a claimant has to establish on a balance of probabilities that the claimant would face a serious possibility of persecution forward more likely than not be subjected to a risk of their life, a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or danger of torture in the proposed IFA, or it is objectively unreasonable and unduly harsh in all the circumstances to ask the claimant to relocate to the proposed IFA. So, I have to consider if the Jalisco Cartel would have the motivation and capacity to pursue you if you relocated in Mexico.\n\n[23] Now, I acknowledge that Mexico is a large country made up of about 130 million people, but after considering all the evidence I find that you have established on a balance of probabilities that your agent of harm has the motivation as well as the capacity to locate you throughout Mexico.\n\n[24] I have considered the Jalisco Cartel\u2019s level of interest in you in determining whether on a balance of probabilities there is a risk for you in Mexico. I accept your testimony that they tracked and pursued you while you had a business, they\u2019ve threatened you, they called you, they attacked you and they continued to look for you and have attacked members of your family before and after you left Mexico.\n\n[25] I find that the test for an IFA fails on the first prong of the case. There is nowhere in Mexico that you could be safe and out of reach of the Jalisco Cartel. The cartel has a growing presence in the country. They have the means and the motivation to track individuals nationally. The information and the country conditions also establishes that the cartel is powerful and violent, and InSight Crime reports that the changing criminal dynamics in Mexico mean that there is no guarantee that zones currently considered relatively safe are going to remain so. Moreover according to a 2020 report from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency, the Jalisco Cartel is one of the fastest growing cartels in Mexico and they already have a significant presence everywhere.\n\n[26] A criminology professor interviewed by the IRB\u2019s Research Directorate also said that Mexico\u2019s ports of entry including airports and land borders are strategic locations for the Jalisco Cartel, smuggling and that the group placed its lookouts there such as police officers, soldiers, cartel members and port employees who report back to the cartel. And the criminal groups also control a lot of the major highways in Mexico, where they have install roadblocks and checkpoints to stop commuters, verify their identification, verify their identity and potentially identified potential rivals and impose extortion payments. Other sources report that the cartel has gained access to the Mexico City International Airport through its presence and ties to local gangs in Mexico City.\n\n[27] The objective evidence also indicates that a personal vendetta or a debt can trigger a group to target a person even outside of the cartel zone\u2019s territory. And gangs can use corrupt law officials to obtain information about the people that they are pursuing.\n\n[28] I find all of the evidence cited above and on a balance of probabilities that you could be located and harmed by the agents of harm anywhere in Mexico. And for that reason I find on a balance of probabilities that they would pursue and harm you throughout the country, because of this there is no viable internal flight location for you in that country.\n\n[29] I note that all of the Associate Claimants are linked to the Principal Claimant as her spouse and children. She testified that her husband was extorted for years via phone and in-person and was physically attacked in 2021 as well as her brother having been attack since she left the country and came to Canada.\n\n[30] I find that the three Associate Claimants would be in danger in Mexico due to their relationship to the Principal Claimant as her immediate family.\n\n[31] The evidence supports that the Jalisco Cartel is tracking and harassing family of the Claimant, all of the Claimant that are left behind in Mexico, and that they have committed acts of violence. Therefore I find there is a forward-facing risk for all of the claimants anywhere in Mexico.\n\n[32] I concluded on the balance of probabilities that the claimants face a personalized and prospective risks to their lives or a cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in every part of Mexico. This is a specific personal risk faced by them as opposed to an indiscriminate or random risk generally faced by others.\n\n[33] I therefore find that the claimants are all persons in need of protection under Section 97(1)(b) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act and we accept the claims.\n\n[34] The hearing is now concluded.\n\n[35] COUNSEL: We would like to say, thank you so much Madam Member.\n\n[36] MEMBER: Thank you all very much for you time today and for your testimony, and also for the 45 minutes that I needed to do that. I appreciate it, and I wish you all a wonderful weekend and time in Canada. Thank you.\n\n[37] COUNSEL: And they will be safe after now.\n\n[38] CLAIMANT: Thank you very much. We also wish you a very nice weekend, and really our sincere, most sincere gratefulness for everything.\n\n[39] MEMBER: Take care.\n\n[40] CLAIMANT: Thank you.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

Guerriero\nCountry: Mexico\nRPD Number: TC3-32706\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2023-01721\nATIP Pages: N\/A\n\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n[1] This is the decision in the claim of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, who alleges to be a citizen of Mexico, and is seeking protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).[1]\n\nALLEGATIONS\n\n[2] The claimant\u2019s allegations are set out in full in her Basis of Claim form and attached narrative (BOC).[2] In summary, the claimant alleges that she worked for the XXXX XXXX at the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, a XXXX XXXX in charge of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. On XXXX XXXX, 2021, the claimant was approached by members of the Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generacion (CJNG) and pressured to provide them information about XXXX XXXX. They also threatened to harm her family if she failed to comply with their demands. The claimant resigned from her job, filed a report with the authorities and moved to another city. The claimant was accosted on two subsequent occasions on XXXX XXXX, 2022, and XXXX XXXX, 2022. The cartel members located the claimant at her new residence and since her departure from Mexico, they assaulted her friend, XXXX XXXX, while seeking to find out the claimant\u2019s whereabouts. The claimant alleges that she faces a risk of harm in Mexico from the CJNG because she refused to cooperate with them and provide the information they wanted.\n\nDETERMINATION\n\n[3] The panel finds that the claimant is a person in need of protection, pursuant to subsection 97(1) of the IRPA, in that her removal to Mexico would, on a balance of probabilities, subject her personally to a risk to life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nIdentity\n\n[4] The claimant\u2019s identity as a national of Mexico is established by her testimony and passport in evidence.[3] The panel finds that she has established her personal and national identity on a balance of probabilities.\n\nNexus\n\n[5] The panel finds that the allegations made by the claimant are criminal in nature. Victims of crime cannot generally establish a nexus to a Convention ground.[4] The panel has therefore assessed the claim under subsection 97(1) of the IRPA.\n\nCredibility\n\n[6] When a claimant swears to the truth of certain allegations, this creates a presumption that those allegations are true unless there be reason to doubt their truthfulness.[5] However this presumption does not apply to inferences or speculation, for which there is no evidentiary basis.\n\n[7] The claimant testified in a straightforward manner, consistent with her BOC narrative. Her responses to the panel\u2019s questions were spontaneous and she did not embellish her testimony. The claimant provided detailed testimony about the incidents involving the CJNG. She testified that she feared for her safety and the safety of her family. She further testified about her efforts to seek help from the authorities and how her visible distress after being targeted by the CJNG was met with condescension and contempt by the Mexican authorities. The claimant further testified about the fear and anxiety that she experienced and how she struggled to leave her home. She was responsive to questioning and provided additional information and details that filled gaps in allegations set out in her BOC.\n\n[8] The panel has no reason to doubt the credibility of the claimant\u2019s allegations. The testimony was detailed, spontaneous, internally consistent and in line with the documentary evidence. The claimant has presented disclosure to corroborate her claim, including copies of the reports she filed with the office of the Attorney General, a copy of her rental agreement for her new residence in Cuernavaca, as well as letters from her mother and her friend, XXXX XXXX.[6] The panel has no reason to doubt the credibility of the documents and finds them probative. Accordingly, the panel assigns them full weight in corroborating the claimant\u2019s allegations.\n\n[9] Accordingly, the panel finds that the claimant has established her core allegations on a balance of probabilities.\n\nRisk of Harm\n\n[10] The panel finds that the claimant faces a personal, forward-looking risk to life or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment from the CJNG, which is not experienced generally by others. The first step of the analysis under subsection 97(1)(b) of the IRPA is to define the risk, while the second step involves comparing the risk to the risk faced by others generally.[7]\n\n[11] The risk stems from the claimant\u2019s former position as an XXXX for XXXX. The claimant testified that she was pressured to work for the cartel and disclose sensitive information to which she had access when they approached her on XXXX XXXX, 2021. However, she refused and immediately resigned from her position, filed a report with the authorities and moved to another city. The claimant was accosted again on XXXX XXXX, 2022, when she was leaving the organization where she performed volunteer work with a friend. The claimant was successful in evading the cartel members; however, they physically assaulted her friend, XXXX XXXX. On XXXX XXXX, 2022, the CJNG accosted the claimant outside of her new residence in Cuernavaca and threatened to kill her. Since the claimant\u2019s departure from Mexico, the CJNG have once again assaulted her friend, XXXX XXXX, demanding that he reveal her whereabouts.\n\n[12] The panel finds that the claimant faces of risk that is personal to her, considering she has been threatened and accosted by the agents of harm. The risk is on going and forward-looking, given the claimants credible testimony that the CJNG have approached her on multiple occasions, located her at her new place of residence and assaulted and threatened her friend while trying to discover her whereabouts. This shows that the agents of harm have an ongoing motivation to locate and harm the claimant. The risk is personal to the claimant and forward-looking.\n\n[13] In assessing the proximity and the degree of the risk, it is important to consider the CJNG\u2019s capacity. The CJNG is a powerful cartel which has presence in most Mexican states.[8] This cartel engages in a variety of criminal activities, including extortion, and uses extreme violence to achieve its goals.[9] The CJNG has also been known to work with corrupt police officers.[10] Based on the objective country documentation, the panel finds that the risk is proximate to the claimant and severe in degree, given that the CJNG is a powerful cartel which uses extreme violence and has the capacity to track and harm individuals in different parts of Mexico.\n\n[14] The panel accepts the claimant\u2019s allegations which show an escalating pattern of demands and threats towards the claimant. The agents of harm have demonstrated their capacity and motivation to track down the claimant in another of Mexico and to harm people close to her in search of information about her whereabouts. These factors further support the notion that the risk the claimant faces in Mexico is proximate and serious.\n\n[15] The panel finds that the risk the claimant faces is not generalized. Mexico is a country of approximately 129 million people[11] with a high crime rate and prevalence of organized criminal activity.[12] People living in Mexico face risk of serious harm stemming from criminal activity. However, the panel finds that the claimant\u2019s risk is greater in degree in different in nature that the risk faced by others generally. The claimant was approached and pressured to work for the cartel on account of the position that she held in the XXXX XXXX and threatened and harassed when she refused to cooperate. Most people in Mexico are not in this type of situation.\n\n[16] In summary, the panel finds that the claimant has established that she faces a forward-looking personal risk of death or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in Mexico from the CJNG.\n\nState Protection\n\n[17] The state is presumed to be capable of protecting its citizens, unless there is clear and convincing evidence to suggest otherwise.[13] The panel finds that the claimant has rebutted this presumption by showing that state protection available to her in Mexico is inadequate.\n\n[18] There is ample information in the NDP to suggest that corruption is endemic in Mexico and permeates all levels of government institutions.[14] There are credible reports of police collusion with the cartels, kidnapping for ransom and taking bribes.[15] The objective documentary evidence further states that the CJNG is capable of confronting and corrupting the Mexican state at all levels of government.[16] The NDP specifically refers to instances of collaboration between the CJNG and corrupt police officers.[17]\n\n[19] The claimant is at risk from individuals belonging to a powerful cartel. Given the corruption within the Mexican police force and the well-documented links between the CJNG and state actors, the claimant would not be offered adequate state protection on a balance of probabilities. The claimant testified that she went to the police and to the office of the Attorney General on three separate occasions to report the incidents when she was accosted and threatened by CJNG. However, the authorities never provided any assistance or protection to the claimant. This further supports the notion that the Mexican state is unable and\/or unwilling to protect individuals against powerful cartels.\n\n[20] The panel therefore finds on a balance of probabilities that the claimant has rebutted the presumption of state protection with clear and convincing evidence.\n\nInternal Flight Alternative\n\n[21] The panel has considered whether a viable IFA exists for the claimant. During the preliminary stage of the hearing and prior to beginning examination, the panel gave the claimant and counsel notice that Monterrey, M\u00e9rida, and Campeche would be considered as IFAs for the claimant.\n\n[22] It is well established that international protection is a measure of last resort. The Federal Court of Appeal has held that there is a two-pronged test for assessing an IFA.[18]\n\n(1) The Board must be satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that there is no serious possibility of the claimant being persecuted in the part of the country to which it finds an IFA exists and\/or the claimant would not be personally subject to a risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture in the IFA; and\n\n(2) the conditions in the part of the country considered to be an IFA must be such that it would not be unreasonable in all the circumstances, including those particular to the claim, for the claimant to seek refuge there.\n\n[23] Both prongs of the test must be satisfied to find that a claimant has an IFA. Once the issue of IFA has been raised and potential IFAs identified, the burden of proof rests with the claimant to show that they do not have an IFA.\n\n[24] The panel finds that the claimant faces a risk of harm in Mexico because there is sufficient evidence to establish, on a balance of probabilities that the agents of harm have the means and the motivation to locate the claimant in Mexico.\n\nFirst Prong \u2013 Safety\n\n[25] Mexico is a large country with a population of over 129 million people covering an area of over 1.9 million sq. km.[19] The law provides for freedom of movement and the right to travel within Mexico. The panel must assess whether the agent of harm has both the \u201cmeans and motivation\u201d to locate the claimant in the proposed IFA locations. In making this assessment the panel considered the area of operation and level of interest in the claimant by the agent of harm.\n\nThe agents of harm have the means and motivation to locate the claimant in the IFA\n\n[26] The panel finds that the CJNG have the capacity to locate the claimant in any part of Mexico. The country condition evidence states that major cartels can locate individuals anywhere Mexico, if there is motivation to do so.[20] Cartels employ a variety of methods, including using \u201cprivate investigators to track people, as well as property records in the US and Mexico and placing GPS trackers on cars.\u201d[21] Criminal groups use informants as \u201csystems of local surveillance.\u201d[22] Cartels have been known to bribe individuals working for phone companies to track phone calls, text messages or social media activity.[23] Major cartels also have connections with corrupt government officials and police, who may provide the cartels with information from the official databases in order to locate individuals.[24] The most recent NDP update states that the CJNG can locate individuals of interest in any part of Mexico, even if they are not the dominant criminal actor there.[25]\n\n[27] Based on the country condition evidence, the CJNG have the capacity to locate the claimant in any part of Mexico. Further, the evidence before the panel indicates that the agents of harm have previously found the claimant outside of her hometown, confirming that they have the means to track down individuals of interest.\n\n[28] The panel further finds that the agents of harm are motivated to locate and harm the claimant based on the persistence of their efforts.\n\n[29] The objective evidence states that \u201ccriminal groups are motivated to track certain individuals because they steal or lose money; due to personal rivalries; for political incentives\/reasons or due to personal vengeance; perceived betrayal; public exposure of relationships with public officials, politicians or investments; or cooperation with authorities as informants or collaborative witnesses.\u201d[26] In this case, the claimant has a profile as someone who was employed for a XXXX XXXX in charge or XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. She was privy to sensitive information regarding XXXX XXXX, including its location, and was in charge of ensuring that the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.\n\n[30] The claimant did not comply with the cartel\u2019s demands to disclose this information to them. Instead, she promptly resigned, reported the incident to the police and moved to another city. Despite taking these steps to ensure her safety, the claimant was accosted on two subsequent occasions and the agents of harm located her at her new residence in another city. The agents of harm have also assaulted the claimant\u2019s friend when seeking to obtain information about the claimant\u2019s whereabouts. The panel therefore finds that the agents of harm have demonstrated continued motivation to harm the claimant over time.\n\n[31] The panel finds that the claimant has established on a balance of probabilities that the agents of harm have the means and motivation to find her in anywhere in Mexico. Accordingly, the panel finds on a balance of probabilities that the claimant would be subject personally to a risk to her life, to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or to a danger of torture in Mexico. From this perspective, the panel finds that the proposed IFA locations fail under the first prong of the test. Accordingly, the panel finds that the claimant does not have a viable IFA in Mexico.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[32] Based on the totality of the evidence and the analysis above, the panel finds that the claimant is a person in need of protection pursuant to sections 97(1)(a) or (b) of the Act.\n\n[33] Accordingly, her claim is accepted.\n\n(signed) Danijela Stajic\n\nDecember 6, 2023\n\n[1] Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n\n[2] Exhibit 2.\n\n[3] Exhibit 1.\n\n[4] Kang, Hardip Kaur v.

Guerriero\nCountry: Mexico\nRPD Number: TC3-31007\nAssociated RPD Number(s): TC3-31008, TC3-31009\nATIP Number: A-2023-01721\nATIP Pages: N\/A\n\nDECISION\n\n[1] MEMBER: This is the decision for the claims made by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, who is the principal claimant, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, who is the first associate claimant, and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, who is the second associate claimant. They allege that they are citizens of Mexico, and they claim protection pursuant to sections 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n\n[2] The claimants\u2019 allegations can be found in their Basis of Claim form narratives at Exhibit 2.1 to 2.3. The associate claimants allege that they are a couple and the principal claimant is their friend. The claimants allege that they face a risk of persecution in Mexico from homophobic members of society due to their sexual orientations. They allege that they were targeted by a liquor shop keeper with a criminal affiliation because the first associate claimant rejected his advances and because of the claimants\u2019 sexual orientations.\n\n[3] In rendering this decision and considering this claim, the Panel has considered and applied guideline 9 on proceedings before the IRB involving sexual orientation, and gender identity and expression, and sexual characteristics, and the Panel has considered and applied Chairperson guideline 4, which is on gender considerations in proceedings before the Immigration and Refugee Board.\n\n[4] The Panel determines that the claimants are Convention refugees pursuant to section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. The claimants\u2019 fear stem from their sexual orientations. The claimants\u2019 respective sexual orientations each constitute a particular social group. Therefore, the claims are assessed under section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. Moreover, the threats alleged by the associate claimants are intrinsically linked with their gender, and those fears have nexus with membership in a particular social group, as women fearing gender-based violence.\n\n[5] With regards to identity, the Panel finds that the claimants have established their identities and the country of reference for this claim with their testimony and with copies of their passports issued by Mexican authorities and provided by the Minister at Exhibit 1.\n\n[6] Having questioned the claimants and assessed the evidence on the record, the Panel finds that the claimants are credible witnesses. The claimants provided spontaneous and frank testimony regarding their respective sexual orientations. The first associate claimant provided convincing testimony to establish that the associate claimants are in a genuine relationship. She described how they met, how their relationship initiated, and gave spontaneous, detailed testimony on their relationship. The principal claimant provided detailed testimony on a same-sex relationship that he had in Mexico, and he provided a letter of support from his former partner, and his testimony included spontaneous tangential details not in the Basis of Claim narrative, which were presented in an unrehearsed manner with the ring of truth.\n\n[7] The principal claimant also testified that the claimants experienced harassment, intimidation, and an unsafe environment when they attempted to participate in public life together in Mexico. Specifically, the principal claimant and the first associate claimant provided testimony consistent with each other and with their narrative about being harassed and threatened by the liquor store owner, with the associate claimant first in 2019, and then also about being attacked by the same man in XXXX and XXXX of 2022.\n\n[8] The claimants provided witness statements from family and friends in Mexico confirming each of their sexual orientations and confirming that the associate claimants have been in a relationship since 2019. They provided a copy of the police denunciation filed by the second associate claimant against the agent of harm, and they provided employment and medical documents that corroborate the surrounding allegations in their claim.\n\n[9] Sworn testimony is presumed true unless there is a reason to doubt it, and in the case at hand, the claimants\u2019 testimony was consistent with their allegations, and the Panel finds no valid reason to doubt the genuineness or the veracity of the documents or the allegations that the documents support. The Panel finds on a balance of probabilities that the claimants are genuine in their alleged sexual orientations and that the associate claimants are in a same-sex relationship together. The Panel finds that the claimants have a genuine fear of harassment, intimidation, and an unsafe environment in Mexico. And based on the totality of the evidence, the Panel finds that the claimants have established a subjective fear of return to Mexico based on their sexual orientations.\n\n[10] The claimants\u2019 fears of return to Mexico is grounded in the objective evidence. The SOGIESC guidelines mention that concealment of one\u2019s sexual orientation constitutes a serious interference with fundamental human rights, and that may constitute or that may amount to persecution. While there have been changes in the law in Mexico in an effort to curb violence and discrimination, sources indicate that sexual minorities continue to experience discrimination, harassment, and violence. This information can be found at Exhibit 3 at Item 6.2 of the National Documentation Package. An article submitted by the claimants to the RPD indicates that Mexico is experiencing a surge in violence against LGBT individuals despite the legal advances, and that can be found at Exhibit 5. The ongoing violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity is reflected in the United States Department of State report at Item 2.1 of Exhibit 3, and that report highlights discrimination remains prevalent, and hate crimes based on sexual orientation and gender identity persist in Mexico despite legislative changes. The objective evidence also highlights that the rates of violence reported are likely underestimated, given the authorities\u2019 complicity and indifference to acts of violence. And the objective evidence is consistent with the claimants\u2019 evidence that they faced harassment and violence because of their sexual orientation. It also supports their assertion that they cannot live openly in Mexico without experiencing threats of violence. So, based on this analysis and the above information, the Panel finds that the claimants\u2019 subjective fear of return to Mexico is well-founded.\n\n[11] With regards to state protection, I find the claimants would not have access to adequate state protection upon return to Mexico. According to a report from the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, same-sex couples showing public displays of affection are a frequent target of abuse and arbitrary detention by the police. This report also highlights that police have used violent raids to target members of the LGBT community, and that report can be found at Item 6.1 of Exhibit 3, which is the Austrian Red Cross document. Reports from non-governmental organizations indicate that crimes against LGBT individuals in Mexico are often incorrectly tracked and that there is a general failure of authorities to investigate these crimes. In this context, I find that the claimants would not have access to adequate state protection, should they return to Mexico.\n\n[12] In considering whether the claimants could safely relocate within Mexico, I find that the objective evidence highlights that the incidents of discrimination and violence are widespread across Mexico. Item 6.4 of Exhibit 3 documents how even in the more friendly parts of the country, individuals are still at risk of violence and mistreatment. Therefore, I find that the claimants would have to hide their sexual orientation in order to live safely and openly in Mexico. And therefore, I find that they do not have a viable internal flight alternative.\n\n[13] So, based on the foregoing analysis, the Panel has determined that the claimants have established that there is a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground if they were to return to Mexico. Their claims are therefore accepted.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

Winbaum\nCountry: Mexico\nRPD Number: TC3-17271\nAssociated RPD Number(s): TC3-17313\nATIP Number: A-2023-01721\nATIP Pages: N\/A\n\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n\n[1] This is the decision in the claims for refugee protection made by XXXX XXXX XXXX (the \u201cprincipal claimant\u201d or \u201cPC\u201d) and her adult daughter, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (the \u201cassociate claimant\u201d or \u201cAC\u201d). The claimants allege that they are citizens of Mexico and they are claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (the \u201cIRPA\u201d).\n\nALLEGATIONS\n\n[2] The claimants\u2019 allegations are set out in their Basis of Claim (BOC) forms and in the narrative of the PC dated February 3, 2023,[1] and in an amendment to that narrative dated November 12, 2023.[2] In summary, the claimants allege that their lives have been threatened by members of the \u201cJalisco cartel\u201d. They allege that in XXXX 2016 the PC\u2019s son, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (\u201cXXXX\u201d), opened a XXXX in their hometown of XXXX, in the Mexican state of Vera Cruz. In XXXX 2017, members of the cartel came to the XXXX and demanded that XXXX pay them XXXX XXXX XXXX pesos a month, and threatened to harm if he failed to do so. He refused their demands and told them he did not make enough money to pay what they had asked. They warned him that they would return at the end of the month. XXXX recognized the men, as they had all grown up together in XXXX. At the end of the month, XXXX was confronted on the street by the cartel members as he walked home. They assaulted him, threatened to kill him, and attempted to drag him into their vehicle. He was able to escape, and fled to the city of Oaxaca where his father lives, and where he hid until he left Mexico in XXXX 2018. XXXX made a refugee claim in Canada, but that claim is currently suspended due to pending criminal charges.\n\n[3] After her son left their hometown, the cartel members questioned the PC about his whereabouts. She denied having any knowledge of his location. One evening in XXXX 2021, the PC was returning home from work when she was stopped by three cartel members, all of whom she knew by name. When she again denied any knowledge of her son\u2019s whereabouts, they assaulted her, leaving her with a broken nose and a swollen and bleeding face. They threatened that she would continue to face such treatment if she didn\u2019t reveal her son\u2019s location. At the clinic where she received medical treatment, the PC was encouraged to report the assault to the police but declined to do so out of fear of reprisals should the cartel members discover that she had gone to the authorities. The PC alleges that the authorities are corrupt and pass information to the cartel. She also alleges that one of the local cartel leaders has a brother in the army. Following her medical treatment, the PC immediately fled to Oaxaca with her daughter, the associate claimant. The PC sent them money from Canada so that they could remain in hiding without needing to work. The claimants wanted to flee to Canada but had to wait until they could be vaccinated against COVID-19. They were finally able to leave Mexico in XXXX, and arrived in Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2021.\n\nDETERMINATION\n\n[4] I find that the claimants are persons in need of protection pursuant to subsection 97(1) of the IRPA as they face a risk to their lives, a danger of torture and\/or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in Mexico that is not faced generally by other Mexican citizens.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nPreliminary Issue \u2013 Post-hearing disclosure\n\n[5] Counsel for the claimants submitted an application for post-hearing disclosure of the birth certificate of the PC\u2019s son, who also appeared as a witness at the claimants\u2019 hearing, as well as copies of photographs of the XXXX he owned in Mexico, and a copy of a threat made against him on Facebook. While I find that the documents could have been provided sooner, their relevance, probative value and newness is clear on their face and weighs in favour of admitting them. The birth certificate is directly responsive to a concern I raised at the hearing \u2013 namely, it corroborates the familial relationship between the claimants and XXXX. The photograph and Facebook screenshot are translations of images XXXX showed me at the hearing on his phone. The documents are admitted as evidence.[3]\n\nIdentity\n\n[6] The claimants\u2019 Mexican passports were seized by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada when they initiated their refugee claims. Copies of those passports are part of the evidence before me,[4] and I have no reason to doubt the genuineness of those documents. I find that the claimants\u2019 passports and their testimony establish, on a balance of probabilities, their personal identities as well as their national identities as citizens of Mexico.\n\nNexus\n\n[7] The claimants allege a risk to their lives at the hands of an organized criminal group. The risk they face does not have a nexus to the Refugee Convention. As a result, I analyzed these claims under subsection 97(1) of the IRPA.\n\nCredibility\n\n[8] A refugee claimant\u2019s sworn testimony is presumed truthful unless there are valid reasons to doubt the veracity of their allegations. In this case, I found both the PC and the AC to be credible witnesses. Their testimony was entirely consistent with their narrative and with the other evidence in the claims. Their claims were also supported by the credible testimony of the witness, who is the son of the PC and the brother of the AC. He gave candid and straightforward testimony that was entirely consistent with the claimants\u2019 BOC narrative and their testimony.\n\n[9] I do note that the claimants submitted very little documentary evidence in support of their claims. I asked the PC if she had attempted to obtain copies of her medical records pertaining to the treatment she received after the XXXX 2021 assault. She testified that she did try to obtain the records but that she was unable to access them from outside Mexico. I also asked her if she tried to obtain a letter from XXXX\u2019 father corroborating that he fled to Oaxaca in 2017 after he was attacked by the cartel. She testified that she did not consider doing so because they do not communicate. During his own testimony XXXX stated that he asked his father for a letter, but that he did not receive a response. He testified that his father was rarely part of their lives as they were growing up. I asked the PC who she stayed with in Oaxaca when she and the AC hid there after her own assault and she testified that she stayed with her son\u2019s uncles, but that it didn\u2019t occur to her to ask them for evidence corroborating this. She testified that thinking about the threats against her and her family in Mexico makes her very anxious and that she avoids revisiting it as much as possible. I asked her if she has sought counseling since arriving in Canada and she testified that she is considering seeing a XXXX.\n\n[10] I also asked the PC why she had not submitted evidence of the threats made against her son since his arrival in Canada. She stated that her son had the evidence and I could ask him about it. During his own testimony, XXXX stated that he had received threats from the cartel on Facebook as recently as XXXX 2022. I asked him if he could show me these threatening messages, and he was able to do so on his phone. Similarly, while the claimants did not submit documents in advance of the hearing corroborating that the PC\u2019s son ran a XXXX, during the hearing he was able to show me multiple pictures posted on Facebook corroborating the existence of the XXXX, including screenshots promoting various events, all of which had been posted within the timeframe that he testified he was operating the business.\n\n[11] The claimants also provided copies of photographs of the PC[5] and of her son,[6] wherein they both have significant injuries to their face that appear to be consistent with physical assault. While the photographs are not inherently probative of the cause of those injuries, when I consider the photos alongside the credible testimony of the PC and XXXX as to the source of those injuries, I am willing to place weight on the photos as further corroborating the claimants\u2019 allegations that both the PC and her son were violently assaulted by members of the Jalisco cartel.\n\n[12] I did have concerns about the claimants\u2019 delay in filing their refugee claims, and I carefully considered whether this delay undermines their credibility. The claimants arrived in Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2021, but did not file refugee claims until late 2022, after they were discovered by CBSA to have overstayed.\n\n[13] I asked them to explain the delay. The PC testified that her son\u2019s refugee claim was suspended due to pending criminal charges and that she had been worried that if she started the refugee claim process while his claim was suspended it could negatively affect him. She testified that they decided to file their claims after CBSA came to their home and told them they would be deported if they did not. The PC was candid in her testimony, including when I asked her if their legal status in Canada had expired by the time they filed their claims. She was straightforward and forthright in response to my questions, and readily acknowledged that she had been aware that their status had expired six months after their arrival in Canada. While their delay was undoubtedly imprudent, the claimants\u2019 explanation for that delay is coherent. I find that on a balance of probabilities the claimants\u2019 failure to file refugee claims sooner does not undermine their credibility.\n\n[14] In summary, I find that the claimants have presented sufficient credible evidence, through their testimony, the witness\u2019 testimony, and the supporting evidence they did provide, to establish on a balance of probabilities that they were targeted by the Jalisco Cartel, an organized criminal group; that the PC was threatened and brutally assaulted by cartel members who were seeking information about her son\u2019s location; and that since his arrival in Canada the cartel has continued to make threats against the PC\u2019s son.\n\nForward-facing risk to life\n\n[15] I find that the claimants\u2019 fear of harm in Mexico is objectively well-founded. In reaching this conclusion, I considered the documents in the National Documentation Package (NDP) for Mexico dated September 29, 2023.[7]\n\n[16] The Jalisco Cartel, or \u201cJalisco New Generation Cartel\u201d (\u201cCJNG\u201d), is reportedly among the largest and most powerful cartels currently operating in Mexico, and reportedly \u201cexists in the majority of Mexican states\u201d and is \u201cembroiled in a patchwork of rivalries nationwide\u201d.[8] Insight Crime, a foundation that studies organized crime in Latin America and the Caribbean, reports that the CJNG is \u201ctruly the dominant criminal actor\u201d in nine different Mexican states, including the claimants\u2019 home state of Veracruz.[9] A 2023 report produced by the IRB\u2019s Research Directorate cites sources who described the CJNG as \u201cdistinct among other major criminal groups through its \u2018extreme and public use of violence\u2019 or its \u2018brazenness, brutality\u2019 and use of \u2018public executions\u2019\u201d [sources omitted].[10]\n\n[17] The objective evidence also indicates that in addition to drug trafficking and kidnapping, the CJNG engages in extortion. According to one researcher interviewed by the IRB\u2019s Research Directorate for its 2023 report, \u201cCJNG\u2019s extortion of civilians has increased in the last two years, particularly in territories under their control in central Mexico.\u201d\n\n[18] Moreover, a 2021 report from the IRB\u2019s Research Directorate cites sources who report that \u201ccriminal groups abduct and \u2018torture\u2019 relatives in order to find information about the targeted individual\u2019s whereabouts\u201d.[11] The 2023 IRB report states that, \u201cin particular\u201d, the CJNG targets \u201cwomen and family members\u201d, who are \u201c\u2018used in symbolic attacks\u2019 meant to \u2018send a message\u2019 to rivals or the communities where they operate\u201d.[12]\n\n[19] After considering all of the evidence, I find that the claimants have established that they personally face a risk to their lives that is not faced generally by the population of Mexico.\nState Protection\n[20] There is a presumption that states are capable of protecting their own citizens, except where the state has completely broken down. That presumption is rebuttable by a claimant with \u201cclear and convincing\u201d evidence of a state\u2019s unwillingness or inability to protect. I find that the presumption has been rebutted in these claims.\n\n[21] A report from Human Rights Watch states that \u201c[s]ince the beginning of the \u2018war\u2019 on organized crime in 2006, rates of violent crime have skyrocketed in Mexico, reaching historic highs under the administration of current President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, who took office in December 2018. Although authorities often blame this violence on criminal groups, most crimes are not investigated and those responsible are never identified or prosecuted\u201d.[13] Similarly, according to the U.S. Department of State, \u201cimpunity and extremely low rates of prosecution\u201d remain a problem \u201cfor all crimes\u201d in Mexico.[14] Criminal organizations thus continue to carry out human rights abuses and widespread killings throughout the country with impunity, with the majority of their crimes going \u201cuninvestigated and unprosecuted.\u201d[15]\n\n[22] Moreover, the objective evidence indicates that in many cases Mexican police have been found to have colluded with organized criminal groups. A 2020 report produced by the IRB\u2019s Research Directorate cites a 2017 article on police in Latin America from InSight Crime, which states that \u201c[i]n Mexico, organized crime has deeply permeated police institutions\u201d,[16] while a 2021 report cites sources who state that upwards of seventy to eighty percent of police forces in Mexico have been infiltrated by organized crime.[17] The 2023 IRB report cites sources who indicate that \u201clow pay contributes to police corruption\u201d and that \u201c[l]ocal police are particularly vulnerable to corruption and infiltration from organized crime groups, as they are overworked, underpaid and understaffed\u201d.[18]\n\n[23] After considering all the evidence, I find that the claimants would not have access to adequate state protection from the CJNG in Mexico.\n\nInternal Flight Alternative\n\n[24] For a refugee claim to succeed, claimants must establish that there is nowhere safe within their country of nationality to which they can reasonably be expected to relocate.[19] I proposed Quintana Roo and Yucatan as potential IFAs in this case.\n\n[25] The two-pronged test for an IFA was articulated by the Federal Court of Appeal in Rasaratnam v. Canada. For a claim to succeed, a claimant must establish, on a balance of probabilities, that:\n\na) the claimant would face a serious possibility of persecution, or would more likely than not be subjected to a risk to their life, a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or a danger of torture in the proposed IFA; or\n\nb) it is objectively unreasonable or unduly harsh, in all the circumstances, to ask the claimant to relocate to the proposed IFA.[20]\n\n[26] After considering whether the agents of harm have both the motivation and the means to pursue the claimants in the proposed IFAs, I find that the test for an IFA fails on the first prong in these claims.\n\n[27] With respect to motivation, the evidence before me suggests that the Jalisco cartel continues to be interested in punishing XXXX \u2013 and the claimants in lieu of him \u2013 for his refusal to pay them. XXXX testified that when he was initially asked by the cartel for monthly payments, he told them he could not afford to pay them and that he would simply have to close his business. The cartel told him that was not an option. He testified that he believes they remain angry at him for failing to follow their orders. The PC also testified that she believes the cartel is motivated by vengeance and a desire to make an example out of those why defy them. She testified that they don\u2019t forgive those who fail to comply with their demands. The objective evidence corroborates that this can indeed be a motivation for organized criminal groups in certain cases, listing \u201cpersonal rivalries\u201d, \u201cpersonal vengeance\u201d and \u201cperceived betrayal\u201d as among the potential motivations for criminal groups to track certain individuals.[21]\n\n[28] The claimants have also credibly established that the cartel has continued to pursue and threaten XXXX since he fled XXXX in 2017. During his testimony he stated that when he arrived in Oaxaca he had intended to stay there permanently. He believed he would be safe there until, seven or eight months into his stay, individuals who appeared to be associated with the cartel appeared at the home of his aunt. When she spoke to them through her intercom they asked for XXXX. She denied knowing anything about his location, and after that incident she told XXXX\u2019 father that she didn\u2019t want him around. After his arrival in Canada he began to receive threatening phone calls on his cell phone, and threatening messages on Facebook messenger, from the cartel members who attacked the PC in XXXX 2021, and most recently from a relative of one of those men. As mentioned above, he showed me one of those messages on his phone during the hearing, and a translated copy was admitted as post-hearing disclosure.[22] One of the messages stated that the cartel knew that XXXX was in Canada. I asked XXXX if he had any idea how the cartel members could know that and he testified that there are many temporary farm workers from Mexico who live in the Ontario community where he works, including individuals from XXXX, and that he suspects that such information was passed on to the cartel members, perhaps even inadvertently.\n\n[29] With respect to means, I find that there is nowhere in Mexico that the claimants could be safely out of reach of the CJNG. Insight Crime reports that the \u201cchanging criminal dynamics\u201d in Mexico \u201cmean there is no guarantee that zones currently considered relatively safe are likely to remain so\u201d.[23] Moreover, according to a 2020 report from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency\u2019s 2020 National Drug Threat Assessment, the CJNG was among the \u201cfastest growing\u201d cartels in Mexico and already had a \u201csignificant presence in 23 of the 32 Mexican states\u201d.[24] A criminology professor interviewed by the IRB\u2019s Research Directorate also stated that \u201cMexico\u2019s ports of entry, including airports and land borders, are \u2018strategic locations\u2019 for the CJNG\u2019s smuggling of drugs, people and weapons, and the group places lookouts there, such as police officers, soldiers, cartel members and port employees\u201d who report back to the cartel, and that criminal groups also \u201ccontrol \u2018a lot\u2019 of the major highways in Mexico, where they install \u2018roadblocks and checkpoints\u2019 to \u2018stop commuters, verify their IDs, identify potential rivals\u2019 and impose extortion payments\u201d.[25] Furthermore, the 2023 IRB report cites a source who states that Mexican nationals deported from Canda or the U.S. are vulnerable to being targeted by the CJNG upon their return, and are \u201c\u2018highly\u2019 likely to be \u2018noticed\u2019 by the CJNG\u2019s lookouts at Mexico\u2019s ports of entry\u201d.[26] Congruent with the claimants\u2019 evidence, Insight Crime also states that the CJNG has \u201ccontacts\u201d in many other countries, including Canada.[27]\n\n[30] In conclusion, I find that on a balance of probabilities the cartel members who threatened the claimants and assaulted the PC have both the means and the motivation to locate the claimants should they return to Mexico. They do not have a viable IFA.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[31] Having considered all the evidence, I find that the claimants are persons in need of protection pursuant to subsection 97(1) of the IRPA. Their claims are therefore accepted.\n\n(signed) Jessica Norman\n\nNovember 20, 2023\n\n[1] Exhibit 2, Basis of claim form and narrative.\n\n[2] Exhibit 5, Personal and country disclosure package #1 (received November 12, 2023) [Exhibit 5].\n\n[3] See Exhibit 8, Post-hearing disclosure package (received November 27, 2023) [Exhibit 8].\n\n[4] Exhibit 1, Claim referral information from the Minister.\n\n[5] Exhibit 5.\n\n[6] Exhibit 6, Personal disclosure package #2 (received November 22, 2023).\n\n[7] Exhibit 3, National Documentation Package, Mexico, 29 September 2023.\n\n[8] National Documentation Package, Mexico, 29 September 2023, tab 7.7: The Jalisco New Generation Cartel (C\u00e1rtel de Jalisco Nueva Generaci\u00f3n, CJNG) its activities, areas of operation, and influence; ability of the CJNG to track and retaliate against people who move to other areas of Mexico; the profiles of people they would be motivated to track and target (2021\u2013August 2023) .

The claimant is seeking refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (\u201cIRPA\u201d).[1]\n\nALLEGATIONS\n\n[2] The full allegations are contained in the Basis of Claim (\u201cBOC\u201d).[2] In summary, the claimant alleges that he fears persecution in Mexico as a journalist who is interested in reporting on corruption, criminal activity and the collusion between criminal organizations and the government.\n\nDETERMINATION\n\n[3] I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nIdentity\n\n[4] The claimant has established his personal and national identity by presenting a copy of his Mexican passport.[3]\n\nNexus\n\n[5] I find that there is a nexus to the Convention based on the claimant\u2019s allegations around his political opinion. The claimant is critical of widespread government corruption and the collusion between the government and criminal organizations. Further, I find that the claimant is a member of particular social group as a journalist.\n\nCredibility\n\n[6] I find the claimant to be a credible witness, so I accept the core allegations. In making my findings, I am guided by the principle that there is a rebuttable presumption of truthfulness which applies to oral testimony[4].\n\n[7] The claimant\u2019s testimony was spontaneous and sufficiently detailed, while there were no notable discrepancies within the testimony or between the testimony and the documentary evidence which went to the core of the claim.\n\n[8] The claimant testified in a credible manner on how he became interested in the issues of government corruption and collusion between the cartels and the government. The claimant stated that these issues are the biggest and most important problems Mexico faces. The claimant stated that he wants his professional work to benefit society. The claimant offered detailed testimony on the crime situation in Mexico, the government inadequacy in addressing the crime issue and the corruption within the government.\n\n[9] The claimant testified that he had worked as a XXXX for a XXXX XXXX in Mexico. He ended his employment with the company because of the restrictions on journalistic freedom. Corrupt government officials and criminal elements paid the company to \u201cadjust the truth\u201d by promoting certain stories, while censoring others. The claimant stated that he is aware of these dynamics because of the investigation conducted on the links between the government and organized crime in his hometown.\n\n[10] The claimant stated that he had tried to report on a corruption story but was told by the executives of the company to stop and to focus on other issues. He was also warned by other colleagues to avoid researching and reporting on such stories.\n\n[11] The claimant testified on an article he XXXX XXXX XXXX, which has been presented as part of the claimant\u2019s disclosure.[5] The claimant decided to write this article because he wants to continue to expose government corruption and cartel collusion. The claimant stated that he will XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and would continue to engage in similar type of journalism if he returns to Mexico.\n\n[12] The claimant has provided disclosure to corroborate the claim allegations, including education certificates, support letters corroborating the claimant\u2019s professional activity[6] and photographs of himself working for the XXXX XXXX.[7] I have no reasons to doubt the trustworthiness or reliability of these documents. I find them to be probative and give them full weight in corroborating the claim allegations.\n\n[13] The claimant has established with credible evidence that he holds a political opinion which is critical of the crime situation in Mexico, the government corruption and the collusion between criminal groups and the government. I accept the allegations that the claimant worked as a journalist in Mexico, and that his journalistic freedom was limited by his employer. I further accept that the claimant holds deep anti-corruption views, and that he is likely to continue to report on related issues if he returns to Mexico.\n\n[14] I find that the claimant has established a subjective fear of persecution at the hands of corrupt state officials and criminal elements in Mexico, as a journalist who exposes their crimes.\n\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution\n\n[15] I find that the claimant\u2019s subjective fear is objectively well-founded. The claimant faces a serious possibility of persecution in Mexico as a journalist who reports on crime, corruption and the collusion between government officials and criminal organizations.\n\n[16] The National Documentation Package (NDP) states that Mexico ranks 143rd out of 180 countries in terms of press freedom.[8] The government has rewarded media outlets which promote government agenda, while using various methods to suppress its critics.[9] Journalists in Mexico \u201ccould criticize the government \u2026with no restrictions\u201d, although many self-censored to avoid problems.[10] Journalists who report on crime and corruption often experience repercussions.[11] The primary perpetrators of aggression towards journalists are criminal entities and state actors.[12]\n\n[17] Journalists have been murdered, subjected to other forms of violence, harassment and intimidation in Mexico by state actors and criminal organizations due to their reporting.[13] The Congressional Research Service report from March 2022 states that since the year 2000 more than 150 journalists have been killed in Mexico.[14] The same source states that attacks against journalists have been on the rise since the start of 2022. The country condition evidence filed in support of the claim indicates that Mexico has seen some of the highest numbers of journalist murders in the world in recent years.[15]\n\n[18] Criminal groups have influence over media outlets in Mexico.[16] Those who publish stories criticizing criminal organizations face threats and violence.[17] In 2021 and in the first half of 2022 15 of 19 journalist killings were linked to criminal groups.[18]\n\n[19] Between 2012 and 2021 there were 632 verbal and physical attacks on journalists, 47% of which were attributed to state actors.[19] The Ministry of National Defense of Mexico has been known to monitor journalists electronically through spyware.[20]\n\n[20] The authorities have attempted to address impunity for journalist killings and have made some arrests.[21] There are measures in place to protect journalists, including the Mechanism to Protect Human Rights Defenders and Journalists, which provides bodyguards and other protective measures to journalists who ask for assistance.[22] However, these measures have been criticized as ineffective, mainly due to the lack of resources.[23]\n\n[21] The objective evidence before me indicates that Mexico is one of the most dangerous countries in the world for journalists who report on crime and corruption. While there is freedom of expression on paper, the reality is that there is limited press freedom in Mexico. Journalists who criticize the government and\/or criminal entities face intimidation, threats and violence. While the government has taken steps in recent years to address the issue of violence against journalists, corruption is a major issue, and state actors are often the perpetrators of these crimes. The government has been known to monitor certain journalists through spyware technology.\n[22] The claimant testified in a credible manner that he would be reporting on the issues of crime and corruption if he returns to Mexico. The claimant is XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, which he XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I note that the claimant\u2019s right to express his political opinion is a fundamental right, which the claimant is not expected to supress.[24]\n\n[23] I find that the claimant faces a serious possibility of violence in Mexico from criminal organizations and state actors, which in itself constitutes persecution. Therefore, the claimant\u2019s subjective fear is objectively well-founded.\n\nState Protection\n\n[24] The state is presumed to be capable of protecting its citizens, unless there is clear and convincing evidence to suggest otherwise.[25] I find that the claimant has rebutted this presumption by showing that state protection available to him in Mexico is inadequate.\n\n[25] There is ample information in the NDP to suggest that corruption is endemic in Mexico and permeates all levels of government institutions.[26] There are credible reports of police collusion with the cartels, abduction for ransom and taking bribes.[27]\n\n[26] I note that the Mexican government has implemented measures to protect journalists and to investigate the crimes against them. However, the mechanisms in place are largely ineffective.[28] The Congressional Research Service report from March 2022 states that since 2018 seven journalists were killed while under the protection of the Mechanism to Protect Human Rights Defenders and Journalists.[29]\n\n[27] The country condition evidence notes widespread impunity for crimes against journalists.[30] A 2019 survey of journalists found that 85% of the respondents felt that the government did little or nothing to protect them.[31] The Special Prosecutor for Crimes Against Freedom of Expression (FEADLE) is a federal entity responsible for investigating crimes against journalists. Out of 105 investigations into killings of journalists conducted since 2010, only six cases resulted in homicide convictions.[32]\n\n[28] If the claimant returns to Mexico, he will continue to report on the issues of criminality and corruption, as well as the collusion between the state and criminal organizations. The claimant is unlikely to receive adequate state protection, given the high levels of corruption in Mexico and the fact that the state is often the perpetrator of crimes against journalists. The mechanisms which are in place to protect journalists in Mexico are ineffective. For these reasons, I find that the state protection available to the claimant in Mexico is inadequate.\n\nInternal Flight Alternative\n\n[29] I find that the claimant has established that he does not have a viable IFA in Mexico. The claimant faces a serious possibility of persecution anywhere in Mexico.\n\n[30] The country condition evidence previously cited indicates that corruption and collusion between the government and criminal organizations are widespread in Mexico. The NDP states that journalists are particularly at risk in the states of Guerrero, Sonora, Veracruz, and Michoac\u00e1n.[33] Even though certain parts of Mexico are safer than others, such as low-crime Merida, criminal entities still operate there.[34]\n\n[31] Major cartels have national reach and are able to track down and harm individuals in every part of Mexico.[35] Cartels employ a variety of methods, including using \u201cprivate investigators to track people, as well as property records in the US and Mexico and placing GPS trackers on cars\u201d.[36] Criminal groups use informants as \u201csystems of local surveillance\u201d.[37] Cartels have been known to bribe individuals working for phone companies to track phone calls, text messages or social media activity.[38] Major cartels also have connections with corrupt government officials and the police, who may provide the cartels with information from the official databases in order to locate individuals.[39]\n\n[32] I find that the claimant faces a serious possibility of persecution in any part of Mexico. If he reports on local issues pertaining to corruption and\/or criminal activity, he faces a serious possibility of violence and other serious repercussions from local corrupt state actors and criminal organizations. If the claimant reports on broader nation-wide issues or events in other parts of Mexico, corrupt government officials and major cartels would be able to track him down and harm him anywhere in Mexico.\n\n[33] The first prong of the IFA test is not met, as the claimant faces a serious possibility of persecution in every part of Mexico. I find that the claimant does not have a viable IFA.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[34] The claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA.\n\n(signed) Victor Sokolov\n\nNovember 20, 2023\n\n[1] Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n\n[2] Exhibit 2.\n\n[3] Exhibit 1.\n\n[4] Maldonado v.

Eberhard\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Johnathan Hidalgo Pinargote\nCountry: Mexico\nRPD Number: TC2-22417\nAssociated RPD Number(s): TC2-19304\nATIP Number: A-2023-01721\nATIP Pages: N\/A\n\nDECISION\n\n[1] MEMBER: This is the decision of file number TC2-22417. I have had an opportunity to examine the evidence before me, and as I explained to you when we were still together, I have decided to accept your claims. This is the fuller that is a supplement to the information that I already gave you when we were together. The claimants, XXXX XXXX XXXX, who is the principal claimant, and her adult daughter XXXX XXXX XXXX, claim to be citizens of Mexico and are claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. I find that you are Convention refugees because you have established that you face a serious profitability of persecution in Mexico on two (2) intersecting nexus grounds, namely religion and membership in a particular social group, specifically women facing gender-based persecution.\n\n[2] In deciding your claims, I have taken into account the Chairperson\u2019s guidelines on gender considerations in proceedings before the Immigration and Refugee Board, otherwise called the gender guidelines. The details of your claims are set out in your Basis of Claim forms dated 12 December 2021, which is in Exhibits 2.1 and 2.2. In short, you fear forward-facing religious and gender-based persecution in Mexico because you have experienced discrimination, harassment, violence including sexual assault, and threats to your lives. You fear a family member, in particular, because he has threatened to kill you. He is a XXXX XXXX. You also fear community members who find your religious faith offensive and express themselves through violent. You, the principal claimant, converted from Catholicism to Islam in 2012. Your daughter followed your example shortly thereafter. You were both inspired by the spiritual aspects of your faith, which you express through prayer and by choosing to wear a veil and other dress that reflects your relationship with God.\n\n[3] In XXXX 2015, the discrimination that you had both faced worsened when the younger claimant was violated at school by classmates. Following this targeted attack, you, the younger claimant, left school for a long period, preferring to study online. While you reported the incident to the principal, the principal was not helpful, and you were discouraged from seeking any assistance from state authorities, including because of retaliation that you would face if you did so. You were together when, in XXXX 2018, you faced another violent attack, this time by several armed men who pointed guns at you and threatened to kill you. At the time, you were travelling to a religious gathering with another woman and her young daughters in a car, alongside a bus of fellow believers. While the attack was de-escalated, you were terrified. You decided at this time to leave Mexico permanently. In the interim, you had both feared threatened kidnapping by harassing callers. Specifically, the callers would phone the principal claimant and indicate that they had kidnapped up the younger claimant and attempted to extort money for her return. You finally fled Mexico together on XXXX XXXX 2020, XXXX before the spread of COVID-19. You sought protection as soon as possible following efforts to find a lawyer and make your claim in the global pandemic context.\n\n[4] You have established your identities as nationals of Mexico on a balance of probabilities by your testimony and the copies of your passports, which are in Exhibits 1 and 4. You are both only citizens of Mexico and of no other country. Because of the principal claimant\u2019s marriage in Canada to a man who may have citizenship in the Netherlands, I asked you related questions about any status you may have there. Based on the totality of evidence before me, including your testimony and the citizenship provision set out in the National Documentation Package on the Netherlands in section 3, particularly Items 3.1 and 3.6, I find that neither of you has, or has access to, any citizenship or residency status in the Netherlands. The NDP for the Netherlands is Exhibit 3.1.\n\n[5] I find you both to be very credible witnesses, and I believe what you have alleged in support of your claims. Your testimony was straightforward, natural, detailed, and responsive to all of my questions, and there were no material inconsistencies between your testimony and the other evidence before me that you did not satisfactorily explain. In particular, I accept your explanations for why you delayed leaving Mexico until you were able to afford doing so. I also accept your explanations for why you delayed making your claim despite the documented efforts \u2014 of your efforts to seek protection very soon after you arrived in XXXX 2020. Specifically, the Board and many lawyers\u2019 offices closed within XXXX XXXX of your arrival to Canada and remained closed for several months. Your personal documents, primarily in Exhibit 5, are consistent in content and chronology, with your account of the circumstances that called you to fear \u2014 caused you to fear religious and gender-based persecution in Mexico, particularly as a family of two (2) Muslim women.\n\n[6] I especially note in Exhibit 5 the three (3) sets of correspondence and related support letters written on your behalf by other women who witnessed your faith and your fear in Mexico, including during the XXXX 2018 attack when your lives were threatened by armed men while you travelled to a religious gathering. At the time, you were wearing recognizably Muslim dress, including veils on your head. I also note the reluctance by one (1) of the authors of these letters in Exhibit 5 to provide her identification because of her own fear in Mexico as a Muslim woman. Also among this package of documents and evident is evidence of your efforts to seek protection in Canada, and to secure a lawyer as early as XXXX 2020, shortly after you arrived into Canada in the midst of the global pandemic, only to find, again, that offices and the Board were closed. Having regard to the documents before me, together with your testimony, I accept your evidence and find that it is credible.\n\n[7] I also find you have established that you have a well-founded fear of presentation on two (2) intersecting Convention grounds, namely religious persecution as Muslims and gender-based persecution as members of a particular social group of women facing gender-based discrimination, harassment, and violence. Each of these parts of your identities factors into the broader risk you face in Mexico, where Muslims are a very tiny minority of believers in a country that is largely dominated by Catholicism and patriarchy. Your decision to flee Mexico in order to seek protection in Canada is consistent with having a subjective fear of persecution for the reasons that you have set out.\n\n[8] I further find that the objective documents before me in Exhibit 3 form a clear basis for your subjective fear. The country condition documents in the National Documentation Package for Mexico dated 29 September 2029 \u2014 I mean, \u201922 \u2014 are also consistent with information that Counsel provided on a single page in Exhibit 5 at the end. These are all consistent with your allegations that you face a serious possibility of religious and gender-based persecution if you return to Mexico. There is surprisingly little information about religious persecution in Mexico as it relates to persons of Muslim faith. The United States Department of State\u2019s International Religious Freedom report for 2021, which is Item 12.1 of the National Documentation Package for Mexico, states the following: \u201cAccording to the 2020 Mexican government census, approximately 78 percent of the population identifies as Roman Catholic, compared with 83 percent in 2010. 10 percent are Protestant or Christian Evangelical, and 1.5 percent are other religious groups, including Judaism, Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and Islam.\u201d The absence of information in the National Documentation Package about religious persecution against Muslims in Mexico reflects the predominance of Catholicism in the country rather than a lack of discrimination, harassment, or violence amounting to persecution, including against Muslims.\n\n[9] In assessing your risks, in addition to your membership in a religious minority group, I have also considered the intersection of your membership in this religious group as Muslims with your gender and the prevalence of gender-based violence in Mexico, specifically as against members of an all-female household. Violence in Mexico against women is widespread. This is clear in several of the reports that are in section 5 of the National Documentation Package for Mexico. Statistically, 10 women die every day. Femicides are not a priority for the Mexican government, or on the Mexican government\u2019s agenda even, and the current president of Mexico has even normalized violence against women. The United States Department of State Report, which is Item 2.1 of the National Documentation Package, indicates that more than 1600 killings of women, including 375 femicides, took place between January and June 2020, which is the time that you fled Mexico for Canada. And in April of the same year, there was a new record, with 263 killings of women in a single month. The 911 hotline received almost 108,800 calls reporting incidents of violence against women between January 30th and May, which was an increase during the pandemic of over 20.5 percent. Killing a woman because of her gender, according to reports, particularly in section 5 again, is called \u2018femicide\u2019, and it is a federal offence punishable by between four (4) and seven (7) years\u2019 prison. It is also a criminal offence in all Mexican states. Item 5.6 of the National Documentation Package calls the last few years a double pandemic of both femicide and COVID-19.\n\n[10] I also note evidence in the National Documentation Package that indicates there is corruption among state agents, including police, and that it is widespread. In your case, one (1) of the agents of persecution that you fear is a family member who is a XXXX XXXX. This man has threatened your lives if you do not stop wearing your hijabs, or veils. I have taken into account in assessing and deciding your claims information in the United Nations High Commissioner handbook guidelines on assessing whether discrimination, harassment, and violence in your cases cumulatively rises to the level of persecution. Specifically, I have looked at UNHCR handbook, paragraphs 53 to 55. I find, given the nature, frequency, severity, and particulars of the incidences you have suffered over several years, the effect of these incidents on you, personally, spiritually, and the likelihood that you will face such incidents in the future if you return to Mexico, including because you have been threatened with death by a family member who is a XXXX XXXX, your situation cumulatively rises to the level of persecution. I have applied the factors set out in the UNHCR handbook, and this is my conclusion. Having taken into account the objective evidence before me, I find your fear of persecution in Mexico is well founded, given the totality of evidence before me both personal and objective, I find you face a serious possibility of persecution in Mexico if you return.\n\n[11] There is a presumption that a state is capable of protecting its citizens except in situations where there is complete breakdown. Your burden of proof as claimants increases with the level of democracy of the state in question. The Mexican state is a multiparty federal republic that provides citizens with the ability to choose their own government through free and fair elections, so your burden is a very heavy one (1). However, I note you sought out state protection in Mexico and none was forthcoming. When you complained to the principal about the gender-based assault on the younger at school in 2015, you were clearly told not to report to state authorities, not only because the principal was equivocal about the incident and the details themselves, but also because you feared retaliation that you were warned may result. Given too that your family Member has threatened your lives and that he is a XXXX XXXX XXXX, I except as reasonable your conclusion that police would not help you and that he or others may even hurt you, or that you might otherwise suffer retaliation and be harmed by others for reporting to state authorities.\n\n[12] In assessing whether you have adequate access to state protection, or access to adequate state protection in Mexico, I have undertaken a contextual approach considering your particular circumstances, and I am mindful of the guidance on the issue of state protection contained in the Chairperson\u2019s guidelines 4, otherwise called the gender guidelines. While a claimant cannot rebut the presumption of state protection in a functioning democracy only by asserting reluctance to engage the state, it is also the case that a claimant is not expected to risk her life seeking ineffective protection merely to demonstrate that ineffectiveness. Clear and convincing evidence of a state\u2019s inability to protect may include evidence of similarly situated individuals who have not been helped by the state despite their best efforts. Following the Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s decision of Ward, I am relying on your personal experiences and the experiences of other women, Muslims similarly situated to you, taking into account that you are Mexican women who have been targeted. I find that this is clear and convincing evidence that rebuts the presumption that adequate state protection is available to you. In other words, where \u201cdocumentary evidence situates the individual claimant\u2019s experience as part of a broader pattern of state inability or refusal to extend protection, then the absence of state protection is made out.\u201d\n\n[13] In assessing your general access to state protection from religious discrimination, harassment, and violence amounting to persecution, I have also considered the very fact that you are forbidden by the Mexican state to where a hijab in formal government identification photographs, which as you testified is why you are not wearing a hijab in your passport photographs. Having considered all of the evidence, I find on a balance of probabilities and in light of your particular circumstances, you have presented sufficient clear and convincing evidence to rebut the presumption that adequate state protection is available to you. I therefore find adequate state protection is not available to you in Mexico if you return and seek it, on a balance of probabilities.\n\n[14] I have also considered whether a viable state \u2014 a viable internal flight alternative exists for you, specifically and in Merida in Yucatan Peninsula. I find on a balance of probabilities that you do not have a viable internal flight alternative in Mexico. I find you would be readily identifiable based on your Muslim dress and attendance at mosque. I further find that while your threatening family member may not have reach or influence in the proposed internal flight alternative of Merida, even as a XXXX XXXX, the risk he poses to you given his threats against your life must be balanced against the fact that there are very few Muslims in Mexico. My job is to assess your forward-facing risk. There are limited places for Muslims to attend mosque in Mexico and therefore, it would not be so difficult for your cousin to watch mosques to find you, or for him to otherwise harvest information about your whereabouts from family numbers for the purpose of locating and harming you if you return to Mexico and continue to practice your faith.\n\n[15] In other words, your religion creates the conditions which make the proposed internal flight alternative unsafe, and in making this finding I have taken into account your ongoing subjective fear of this cousin as well as the gender-based violence that you have experienced in the past and that is seriously possible in future. So, I also note the general risk you face for reasons already described as Muslim women in a female household facing religious and gender-based persecution, which together heightens your overall risk if you return to Mexico and practice your faith freely there. For all of these reasons, I find you face a serious possibility of persecution throughout Mexico and there is no viable internal alternative for you.\n\n[16] Based on the totality of evidence before me, I find you have established you face a serious possibility of persecution in Mexico on a Convention ground, and I therefore find that you are Convention refugees and I accept your claims.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

In hearing and assessing this claim, I considered the Chairperson\u2019s Guidelines 4, gender considerations and proceedings before the Immigration and Refugee Board.\n\nALLEGATIONS\n\n[2] You have experienced a long history of physical, psychological, financial, and sexual abuse in Mexico from various individuals, including a person named XXXX (ph). You met XXXX while you were working at a XXXX in Reynosa, Tamaulipas. He was a customer and would come into your place of work to XXXX XXXX. He began sharing with you that he knew details about your daily routine. He began to call you his girlfriend, and he was violent towards you and exerted control over your life.\n\n[3] You became aware that he was affiliated with the Gulf Cartel, and he would use threats related to his connections. Sorry, I will just repeat that. You became aware that he was affiliated with the Gulf Cartel, and he would threaten to use his connections to kidnap, harm, or extort you to the point where you would be out of work if you do not do what he asked.\n\n[4] In XXXX 2022, XXXX forced you to quit your job because he did not like the way customers were looking at you, and accused you of being too flirtatious with male customers. He said he would support you, but he did not follow through with that promise, and you struggled to find a new job. You eventually did find another job and you moved in with a friend, and things cooled off in XXXX 2022. And towards the end of XXXX 2022, XXXX vanished, and you felt that this was your chance to escape.\n\n[5] You left Mexico for Canada on XXXX XXXX 2022, and after getting a lawyer, you made a refugee claim in May 2023. In XXXX 2023, XXXX reappeared and he began approaching your friends in Tamaulipas, looking for you. His persistence in trying to find you forced one (1) of your friends to move, and his inquiries about you continued up until recently.\n\nDETERMINATION\n\n[6] I find you to be a Convention refugee for the following reasons.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nIdentity\n\n[7] Your identity as a citizen of Mexico is established on a balance of probabilities by the supporting documentation filed, namely a copy of your valid Mexican passport and voter\u2019s card found at Exhibits 1 and 4.\n\nCredibility\n\n[8] When a claimant swears to the truth of certain allegations, this creates a presumption that those allegations are true unless there is reason to doubt their truthfulness. In this case, I found you testified in a consistent and straightforward manner, and the information you provided was consistent with your Basis of Claim form in your supporting documents. There were no relevant inconsistencies in your testimony, or contradictions between your testimony and the other evidence that caused me to doubt your truthfulness.\n\n[9] You provided additional details at the hearing about XXXX\u2019s connections, namely that he is affiliated with the Gulf Cartel. And you also provided details about how you found out, and know that he is affiliated with that group. You also provided additional details as to what you know about his ongoing inquiries about you since XXXX 2023, and the reason you think he would be able to find you in other areas in Mexico.\n\n[10] I overall found you to be a credible witness. You have also provided documents in support of your claim, including letters from your mother, your aunt, and two (2) of your friends who provide details about what they know regarding XXXX\u2019s obsession about you and his controlling nature. One (1) of your friends also describes the ongoing inquiries she has received from him, and about how he has been making threats against you and her, and for her specifically to obtain information about your location.\n\n[11] I have no reason to doubt the information provided in these letters, as I do not see any relevant inconsistencies in them. Consequently, given your credible testimony and the supporting documents, I accept your allegations as alleged, and I find that they establish your subjective fear of persecution from XXXX.\n\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution and State Protection\n\n[12] I also find that your fear of harm is well-founded, and has a connection to the Convention ground of membership in a particular social group as a woman fearing gender-based violence. XXXX has in the past been physically, sexually, financially, and psychologically abusive towards you, and he has been making recent threats towards one (1) of your friends in order to find you. The country condition evidence such as Items 5.10, 2.8, as well as the country condition evidence you provided at Exhibit 6, confirm that gender-based violence against women is common in Mexico, and that perpetrators are rarely punished.\n\n[13] Implementation of a 2007 law designed to protect women from such crimes remains halting, particularly at the state level. And impunity is the norm for the killers of hundreds of women each year. State authorities can issue gender alerts that trigger greater scrutiny and an influx of resources to combat an epidemic of violence against women, but the mechanism has proven ineffective. According to official statistics, 968 femicides were recorded in 2022. Some non-governmental sources say the true number is likely much higher.\n\n[14] Given XXXX\u2019s past history of violence towards you, his recent search for you and the country condition evidence, I find that you face a serious possibility of persecution because of your status as a woman if you return to Mexico. I also note that the above country condition evidence confirm that while Mexico is a democracy, there are significant barriers to women seeking state protection for issues related to gender-based violence, because the mechanisms put in place by the state are ineffective, and this results in perpetrators going unpunished.\n\n[15] And you have experienced this when you tried to approach the police in the past, regarding another incident of gender-based violence that you experienced. Furthermore, XXXX has told you that he has connections in many different areas, and you have seen him talking to individuals that look like the police in the past. The country condition evidence confirms particularly at Item 10.2, that Mexico\u2019s police force is overworked, underpaid and understaffed, and vulnerable to corruption and infiltration from criminal groups. It notes that most local police forces have been infiltrated by organised criminal groups to a level described as control over the police forces, and police at all levels work with criminals and systematically abuse human rights.\n\n[16] There are recent credible reports of police involvement in crimes such as kidnapping for ransom. And the country condition evidence confirms that efforts to fight corruption have been ineffective, and the result is an environment of impunity for criminals. Consequently for all of these reasons, I find on a balance of probabilities that state protection is unlikely to be forthcoming to you from XXXX. I find that the presumption of state protection has thus been rebutted.\n\nInternal Flight Alternative\n\n[17] At the hearing, I suggested Cabo San Lucas as a potential IFA location. However after further consideration of the evidence, I find that you do not have an IFA in this location. XXXX\u2019s recent threatening and persistent inquiries about your whereabouts demonstrate that he is motivated to find you. In the past during a trip to your home state of Yucatan, he was able to find out about, and keep track of your daily routine from his location in Tamaulipas some 2,000 kilometres away.\n\n[18] I find that this demonstrates that he has the means to locate you in other areas in Mexico. Consequently, I find that you do not have a viable IFA in Mexico.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[19] For the foregoing reasons, I find that you are a Convention refugee and I accept your claim.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

The nexus between her allegations and the Convention is membership in the particular social group of women.\n\n[3] In hearing and assessing this claim, I have considered and applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 4: Gender Considerations in Proceedings Before the Immigration and Refugee Board[2] (\u201cGuideline 4\u201d) which offers guidance in recognizing women as members of a particular social group and with respect to other gender specific issues present in this claim.\n\nALLEGATIONS\n\n[4] The claimant\u2019s allegations are contained in her Basis of Claim (\u201cBOC\u201d) form.[3] The following is a summary:\n\n[5] The claimant is a citizen of Mexico. She was in Canada from XXXX 2021 to XXXX 2022 staying with a boyfriend. When her relationship with him did not work out, the claimant felt ashamed and wanted to keep this information from her family. After communicating with one of her friend\u2019s former boyfriends (\u201cAS\u201d), he invited the claimant to stay with him and his family in Cancun, and she decided to take him up on the offer.\n\n[6] The claimant was struggling to find work in Cancun, and AS invited her to go with him on a vacation to Colombia. After they arrived in Colombia, AS began to introduce the claimant to different people and asked her to clean and cook for them in the home where they were staying. He also started to drink and became physically and verbally abusive towards the claimant, threatening her not to leave and pressuring her to be his girlfriend.\n\n[7] The claimant initially assumed that the people staying with them were AS\u2019s friends, but one of them later revealed that they had all paid AS to smuggle them into the United States. One of the clients suggested that the claimant go with them and try to escape AS. AS let her accompany them to Bogota but before they could leave the country, he came and told the claimant that she could not accompany the clients to Mexico.\n\n[8] AS then asked the claimant to accompany one of the clients through Ecuador where they would take a flight back to Mexico together. After some problems at the border, the two were able to go to Guyaquil where AS sent the claimant money to purchase their plane tickets back to Cancun. AS picked them up in Cancun and rented a home for them to stay in a private neighbourhood. The claimant eventually convinced AS that her mother was unwell and that she needed to return home to look after her.\n\n[9] The claimant remained at her mother\u2019s home for one month. AS and his parents started to press her to return to Cancun, telling her that they would help her if she returned. However, the claimant also started to receive messages from individuals in Colombia who said that they were friends with AS, that he owed them money, and that he said that he would send the claimant back to Colombia as payment for his debt. The claimant already had a valid Canadian visa and decided to return to Canada to avoid AS. While in Canada she has continued to receive messages from Colombian numbers as well as from AS and his father, with the most recent messages coming in the fall of 2023.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nIdentity\n\n[10] I find that the claimant\u2019s identity as a national of Mexico is established on a balance of probabilities by her sworn testimony and the copy of her Mexican passport in evidence.[4]\n\nCredibility\n\n[11] When a claimant affirms to tell the truth, this creates a presumption that her allegations are true unless there is reason to doubt their truthfulness. In this case I have found the claimant to be a credible witness. She testified in a consistent and emotional manner and there were no material unexplained inconsistencies, omissions, or contradictions. She was able to provide significant and spontaneous detail concerning her predicament. As such, I place significant weight on the claimant\u2019s testimony.\n\n[12] The claimant provided some documentary evidence in support of her claim.[5] This included a picture of AS\u2019s passport, IDs from some of AS\u2019s clients, and screen shots of text messages between AS and his clients. I find no reason to doubt the authenticity of these documents and they help to corroborate some of the allegations concerning AS\u2019s criminal enterprise. I find it reasonable that the claimant was unable to provide further documentary evidence given that the only individuals who were aware of what happened to the claimant are AS, his family (who support AS\u2019s criminal enterprise) and AS\u2019s clients with whom the claimant has no contact. The claimant further explained that she did not want to tell her family about anything that had happened as she didn\u2019t want them to get in trouble. I find this reasonable.\n\n[13] I did question the claimant about the text messages that she has continued to receive from AS and his family as well as individuals in Colombia. She said that she deleted these messages and has continued to delete them without reading them. She did show me some messages that she has received from Colombian numbers, but they did not contain any information specific to the claimant. While I do not find it entirely reasonable that the claimant deleted the messages from AS and his father rather than submitting them into evidence, I do not find that it overcomes her credible testimony, especially given the fact that the claimant has never been represented by counsel and has described that she suffers from anxiety attacks and insomnia when she is reminded of her situation.\n\nAS\u2019s Criminal Connections\n\n[14] I find on a balance of probabilities that AS has criminal connections in Mexico. The claimant testified that at times when AS was threatening her, he would mention working with a cartel, although he did not mention the name of the cartel. Additionally, she listened in on a phone call from one of AS\u2019s clients who indicated that she was transported by cartel members with guns through the desert into the United States. In light of this, and the fact that AS was involved in a criminal enterprise, I find it reasonable to assume that AS has criminal connections on a balance of probabilities.\n\n[15] Taking together the claimant\u2019s documentary evidence and her credible testimony, I find that she has established her allegations on a balance of probabilities. In particular, I find that she has established that she was coerced by AS into helping him with his criminal enterprise in Colombia and Ecuador, that she was able to escape from AS upon her return to Cancun, and that AS and his family have been contacting her since she left in an effort to get her to return and work with AS again.\n\n[16] I find that the claimant has also established her subjective fear on a balance of probabilities. In making this finding I note that while the claimant did leave Mexico as soon as she was reasonably able to, she did not claim refugee protection in Canada until more than 6 months after her arrival. In her BOC the claimant explained that she didn\u2019t know how the refugee process worked and was worried that AS and his family would harm her family. She also testified that she believed that making a refugee claim was equivalent to filing a police report and this again made her worry for her family\u2019s safety. I find this explanation reasonable, given that the claimant never had the assistance of counsel.\n\n1F(b) Exclusion\n\n[17] I have considered whether the claimant should be excluded under Article 1F(b) of the Refugee Convention due to her participation in human smuggling in Colombia and Ecuador. Given what I have found to be the claimant\u2019s credible testimony and the corroborating documentary evidence, I do not find that there are serious reasons to consider that the claimant has engaged in a serious non-political crime which would exclude her from refugee protection under Article 1F(b).\n\n[18] Article 1F(b) of the Convention states as follows:\n\n1F. The provisions of this Convention shall not apply to any person with respect to whom there are serious reasons for considering that:\n\nb) he has committed a serious non-political crime outside the country of refuge prior to his admission that country as a refugee.\n\n[19] While regard should be had to international standards in analyzing the question of exclusion under Article 1F(b), Canada\u2019s perspective cannot be ignored in determining the seriousness of the crime.[6] In this case I find that the claimant has established that she has a defence of duress as such I find that there are not serious reasons to consider that the claimant committed a serious non-political crime in Colombia and Ecuador.\n\n[20] While the claimant was not entirely sure how AS\u2019s operation worked, she did confirm that she was aware that she was making appointments for individuals to obtain Colombian passports using false documentation. I find that the following Canadian crimes would cover the actions taken by the claimants:\n\nUse, trafficking or possession of forged document\n\n368 (1) Everyone commits an offence who, knowing or believing that a document is forged,\n\n\u2026\n\n(b) causes or attempts to cause any person to use, deal with or act on it as if it were genuine;\n\n(c) transfers, sells or offers to sell it or make it available, to any person, knowing that or being reckless as to whether an offence will be committed under paragraph (a) or (b); or\n\n\u2026\n\n[21] However, I find that the claimant has made out the defense of duress with regards to this offense. The defence of duress was outlined by the Supreme Court of Canada in Ryan. It states as follows:\n\nThe defence of duress may be used to justify participation in certain offences providing:\n\na. The perpetrator was in danger of explicit or implicit imminent harm;\n\nb. The perpetrator reasonably believes that the threat will be carried out;\n\nc. There is no safe avenue of escape;\n\nd. There is no close temporal connection between the threat and the harm threatened, the evil threatened them was on balance, greater than or equal to the evil which they inflicted on the victim;\n\ne. The perpetrator is not a party to a conspiracy or association whereby they are subject to compulsion and actually knew that the threats and coercion to commit an offence were a possible result of this criminal activity, conspiracy or association; and they were not responsible for their own predicament.[7]\n\n[22] In the recent case of Seydi,[8] the Federal Court also specified that the Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s findings in Ruzic[9] should be explicitly taken into account with regards to the duress defence in immigration as well as criminal proceedings. In Ruzic, the Court requires that, in applying the defence of duress, a decision maker \u201ctake into consideration the particular circumstances where the accused found himself and his ability to perceive a reasonable alternative to committing a crime, with an awareness of his background and essential characteristics.\u201d[10]\n\n[23] In this case, the claimant was essentially being held captive in Colombia by AS. She was not aware of AS\u2019s criminal enterprise when she went to Colombia and only became aware of it after she had been there for some time. While she describes that she wanted to leave, she was not a citizen of the country and had no financial means to leave AS. AS was physically and verbally abusive towards her during her time with him in Colombia and made threats concerning how he deals with people who do not listen to him. When she was initially unable to book the appointments for AS\u2019s clients to obtain their passports, AS threatened the claimant. AS did not allow the claimant to leave Colombia but demanded that she accompany one of his clients through Ecuador before she could return to Mexico. The claimant did not have money to pay for a return flight as AS had taken her bankcards. He did not provide her with the money needed to book their flights back to Mexico until she had reached Guyaquil. Upon returning to Mexico, the claimant took the first available opportunity to leave AS.\n\n[24] Given the foregoing, I find that the claimant has established that her situation rises to the level of the test for duress. The evidence shows that AS threatened the claimant with violence, which he had carried out in the past, and that she was unable to escape due to AS\u2019s control over her means of travel. She was also not aware of AS\u2019s criminal operation until she was already under his control and had lost the ability to freely leave. I find on a balance of probabilities an offence was not committed.\n\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution\n\n[25] To be considered a Convention Refugee, the claimant must demonstrate that she has a well-founded fear of persecution which includes both subjective fear and an objective basis for that fear. Based on the claimant\u2019s BOC, testimony, documentary evidence and the National Documentation Package for Mexico (\u201cNDP\u201d)[11], I find that the claimant does face a serious possibility of harm that is forward looking.\n\n[26] The claimant was a victim of domestic violence and unlawful imprisonment by AS. Despite efforts of the Mexican government, violence against women and girls continues to be a widespread problem in that country. Not a single Mexican state was free of femicide in 2020.[12] average of 10 women were killed each day in 2019. The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women has reported that the persistence of high levels of insecurity, violence and organized crime in Mexico is negatively affecting the enjoyment of women and girls of their human rights.[13]\n\n[27] While there are laws against domestic violence, including the Law on Women\u2019s Access to a Life free of Violence, women are reluctant to report violence because of social stigma, victimization, threats or mistrust in the criminal justice system. A 2011 national survey reported that 44.8 percent of women living with a partner experienced some form of violence. Additionally, 77.7 percent of separated or divorced women were the subject of attacks of all kinds from their former partners or spouses.[14] A 2016 national survey reports similar numbers and notes that 64 percent of women experienced severe or very severe violence at the hands of their spouse or partner. Mexican society often believes that \u201c\u2026women provoke the violence they suffer\u201d and violence against women is largely normalized.[15] The broader message is that the onus is on women to find ways to stay safe.[16] Given all the foregoing objective documentary and testamentary evidence, I find that the claimant has established a well-founded fear of persecution from the agent of persecution in Mexico.\n\n[28] Criminal groups who deploy violence as a matter of routine have exacerbated the conditions under which gender-based violence takes place in Mexico, allowing it to proliferate.[17] many femicides are linked to organized crime and women whose partner was \u201cinvolved with or targeted by a criminal group.\u201d Within gang culture, women are \u201cconsidered disposable\u201d and violence against them represents \u201cgang cohesion and masculinity.\u201d Female partners are seen as \u201cproperty who is not free to leave the relationship when they want.\u201d In addition to domestic abuse, these women and girls face the risk of sex trafficking by organized crime groups.[18]\n\n[29] Given all of the forgoing objective, documentary and testamentary evidence, I find that the claimant has established a well-founded fear of persecution from AS and his criminal associates in Mexico.\n\nState Protection\n\n[30] There is a presumption that countries can protect their citizens. The claimant bears the burden of rebutting that presumption with clear and convincing evidence. I find that there is clear and convincing evidence that adequate state protection is not available to the claimant in Mexico.\n\n[31] While the claimant never went to the authorities in Mexico, I find this reasonable given her particular circumstances and the objective evidence. The objective evidence suggests that state and municipal laws affecting domestic violence are often unenforced and do not meet federal standards. State agents responsible for implementing the laws \u201cdo not have a gender perspective\u2026 or are openly misogynistic.\u201d The federal government also made cuts to the National Institute of Women in 2020, and in 2019 suspended public funding to civil society organizations supporting women victims of domestic violence.[19]\n\n[32] When women do report domestic violence, authorities often fail to investigate, and perpetrators are rarely brought to justice. The New York Times reports that \u201claw enforcement officials and authorities can be passive, complicit or in some cases even abusive towards women who try to report violence.\u201d In 2009, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights ruled that \u201cMexico did not adopt the norms and measures necessary for the authorities to carry out investigations with due diligence and that this contributed to creating a climate of impunity.\u201d[20] In 2015, Mexico implemented a gender alert mechanism, however, state authorities have in cases refused to use the system. Impunity, which is often the result of chronic corruption and lack of government funding and planning, still prevails and women do not have access to justice. [21]\n\n[33] Further, women whose past or present partners are involved in organized crime can be perceived as guilty or an accomplice to that partner\u2019s criminal activities by the authorities. The authorities are also often reticent to help these women in particular because they do not want to become targets themselves.[22]\n\n[34] Given all the foregoing, I find that state protection would not be forthcoming to the claimant in Mexico, and as such the presumption has been rebutted.\n\nInternal Flight Alternative\n\n[35] I have considered whether the claimant has an internal flight alternative (\u201cIFA\u201d) in Mexico and have concluded that she does not. In making this finding I acknowledge that there is no evidence before me that AS has been looking for the claimant with her family or friends, nor have they made any threats against her since she has left. However, AS and his father have continued to message the claimant since she has been in Canada trying to convince her to come back. Such messages were sent to the claimant as recently as XXXX 2023. Although these messages have not been threatening in and of themselves, the fact that they continue to message the claimant, even a year after she escaped and has not responded, indicates a continued motivation to locate her.\n\n[36] AS also has connections with criminal elements. The objective evidence notes that within the organized crime world, there is little distinction between past and present partners and that women will be targeted even after they leave a partner, either by the partner themselves or by rival criminal groups. Additionally, where a woman is believed to be the witness of a crime, they will be \u201ctargeted and retargeted by the perpetrator.\u201d[23] In this case, the claimant has intimate knowledge about AS\u2019s operation which could put him at risk if she takes it to police. Sources further state that organized crime groups can track and retaliate against individuals throughout Mexico using spyware and information technology or connections within law enforcement.[24] While I acknowledge that we don\u2019t know which criminal organization AS is working with, the objective evidence suggests that cartels often work together based on constantly evolving interests and strategic alliances.[25]\n\n[37] Given the foregoing, I find that the claimant has established that the AS has the means and motivation to locate her anywhere in Mexico, and that, as such, she would face a serious possibility of persecution anywhere in Mexico. For this reason, I do not need to consider the second prong of the test and find that there is no viable IFA for the claimant.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[38] For the forgoing reasons, I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee. The claim is therefore accepted.\n\n(signed) Katarina Bogojevic\n\nDecember 13, 2023\n\n[1] Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n\n[2] Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (IRB) Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 4: Gender Considerations in Proceedings Before the Immigration and Refugee Board.

Hughes\nCountry: Mexico\nRPD Number: VC3-04220\nAssociated RPD Numbers): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2023-01721\nATIP Pages: N\/A\n\nDECISION\n\n[1] MEMBER: This is the decision of the Refugee Protection Division for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. You are claiming to be a citizen of Mexico and are claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Act or IRPA. In assessing this claim, I have considered and applied the following guidelines. Guideline 9, proceedings before the IRB involving sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, and sex characteristics. I have used the Guideline to ensure I substantively assess the claim and use trauma-informed questioning including leaving and coming back to questions as the claimant needed. I have considered your testimony and the other evidence in the case, and I am ready to render my decision orally. The written decision will come to you shortly and may be amended to include specific citations to exhibits and case law as needed.\n\nDETERMINATION\n\n[2] I find that you are a Convention refugee on the grounds of membership in a particular social group as a member of the LGBTQ+ community for the following reasons.\n\nALLEGATIONS\n\n[3] Your allegations are contained in your BOC narratives and testimony, but are summarised here. You are a citizen of Mexico. Starting around age nine (9), you experienced repeated sexual assault and rape from a cousin who will be referred to as JS. This has created lasting trauma with significant effects to your mental and physical health. You realised you were gay at around the age of 19 and were able to tell some close friends, but did not tell your family out of fear. The following year, in 2019, you were drugged and sexually assaulted by a XXXX professor who will be referred to as JC. You were eventually able to escape and retained an audio recording of part of this incident. You reported this including the audio recording to the university, but they only switched your class and refused to help you further or hold the professor accountable. You then reported this to the police, but they also offered no support or protection for you.\n\n[4] In 2020, you disclosed your experience with sexual assault to your parents and also told them that you are gay. In response, your father verbally and physically assaulted you and continued to threaten you in various ways even after your return to university. Throughout 2020 and 2021, your father and brother continued to threaten you, and your father threatened to send you to an institution to change your sexual orientation. As a result of these experiences, you left Mexico and came to Canada in XXXX 2021. You learned about the possibility of making a refugee claim in the summer of 2022 and applied to legal aid to make your claim. In XXXX 2023, you started a relationship with your current partner, XXXX. You met his family at his graduation XXXX XXXX XXXX and travelled to Ontario to meet his extended family in XXXX. You allege that, if you return, you will be persecuted by the community at large as well as the police and state based on your sexual orientation. You alleged that there is no state protection for you or an internal flight alternative.\n\nIdentity\n\n[5] Your personal identity and national identity as a citizen of Mexico has been established by your testimony in the supporting documents before me including your genuine Mexican passport.\n\nNexus\n\n[6] I find that there is a link between what you fear and one (1) of the five (5) Convention grounds, namely particular social group due to your being part of the LGBTQ+ community as a gay man. I have, therefore, assessed this claim under section 96 of IRPA.\n\nCredibility\n\n[7] Claimants benefit from the presumption that their allegations are true. In this case, there were no omissions, inconsistencies, or other irregularities in the evidence that were not reasonably explained. Your testimony was spontaneous, detailed, responsive to questioning, and unrehearsed. You spoke with clarity and emotion about coming to an understanding of your identity and exploring that part of yourself and your first relationship with a classmate in XXXX school. You spoke in detail about the pain of coming out to your parents, how it caused your father to hit you for the first time, and how he didn\u2019t speak to anyone in the family for months after this. You spoke about the continuous discrimination and violence you have experienced even as a child, when your XXXX teacher wouldn\u2019t let you play soccer because he said your body was too feminine. You spoke about the pain and the violence you and others you know have experienced in every city and town you have ever lived. You also spoke with detail and joy about your current partner, XXXX, about how you met and started dating a week later, and how you love the pride he has in himself, and how supportive the relationship has been for you. You spoke in detail about meeting his family recently and how it cemented for both of you the future you would like to create together. You testified to your life in Canada, how you are more aware of who you are and less afraid of exploration, and more authentic and loyal to yourself.\n\n[8] I note that your claim is supported by the following documents; affidavits from two (2) close friends corroborating core elements of your claim, copies of WhatsApp messages and audio recordings from the night of the 2019 sexual assault, a copy of the Vancouver lease where you were living with your ex-partner RP, a letter and photos from your current partner XXXX, country conditions documents on conditions for LGBTQ+ individuals in Mexico.\n\n[9] I have no reason to doubt the authenticity of any of these documents and they corroborate core elements of your claim. I, therefore, assign them full weight. Accordingly, on the whole, in terms of your general credibility, I have found you to be a credible witness and I therefore, accept what you have alleged in your oral testimony and Basis of Claim form. Namely, you have experienced extensive sexual assault and rape first from JS in your childhood and then from JC in university. You shared your sexual orientation with your parents in 2020, and as a result, your father verbally and physically assaulted you. Your father and other family members have continually threatened you including threatening to institutionalise you as a result of your sexual orientation. You have experienced and witnessed countless acts of discrimination even as a child for taking ballet and having adults comment on the shape of your body or the way that you walk. You had two (2) serious relationships in Mexico including an ex-partner who moved to Canada and lived with you in 2021 and 2022, and you have been in a close and strong relationship with your current partner, XXXX, since XXXX 2023. Your subjective fear is established by your credible and corroborated testimony. I also find that your claim is objectively well-founded.\n\n[10] According to the U.S. Department of State report on Mexico, Mexican Federal Law prohibits discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex individuals. I note that the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline nine (9) directs that the absence of laws that criminalise or discriminate against LGBTQ+ individuals in a country does not signify a lack of discrimination in that country nor does it indicate that state protection is available. Furthermore, the existence of laws addressing discrimination against LGBTQ+ individuals does not mean that discrimination does not take place. Discrimination and violence against LGBTQ+ individuals does continue to be prevalent in Mexico. For example, Item 6.1 is a report from 2017 that states that an average of 71 killings motivated by homophobia were committed per year for the previous 10 years. The report also notes that those numbers are based on newspaper reports, so the actual numbers are likely higher. A 2021 report at Item 6.7 describes how in Guadalajara, where you lived, there have been frequent attacks on men who use the male-specific dating app Grindr. An LGBTQ+ rights activist is a source in the report and they state that these attacks are not new, but it is just an easier way for attackers to get to their victims. The report also describes how victims are afraid to report these crimes due to fear of further retaliation.\n\n[11] A U.S. Department of State report at Item 2.1 states that there were 50 hate-crime homicides and four (4) forced disappearances against LGBTQ community members in the first eight (8) months of the year in 2021. The report also indicates that discrimination against the community is prevalent. While the country condition evidence such as the Freedom House report at Item 2.8 indicate that Mexico has taken legislative steps to prevent violence and discrimination against the LGBTQ+ community, it also indicates that those laws are not adequate or uniformly enforced. This is also found in Response to Information Request at Item 6.4 that indicates that legislation to protect sexual minorities is only partially effective. That RIR also quotes a Mexican official who indicates that crimes against sexual minorities are \u201cconsistent and in many cases motivated by prejudice.\u201d As indicated by the UN Special Rapporteur, there is \u201can alarming pattern of grotesque homicides of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender individuals in Mexico and there is a broad impunity for those crimes, sometimes with the suspected complicity of investigative authorities.\u201d 271 transgender and gender-diverse persons were reported to have been killed in Mexico between 2008 and 2016. There have been several incidents in which police officers have been accused of kidnapping, torturing, and killing LGBTQ+ individuals.\n\n[12] The U.S. Department of State reports that violence targeting LGBTQ+ persons is one (1) of the most significant human rights issues in the country. You have also experienced this personally. You have faced extensive and violent experiences of sexual assault from a family member and a university professor, with the university and the police providing no measures of support including when presented with audio evidence of the assault. You have experienced countless incidents of discrimination and threats of violence including from your own family and including threats to have you institutionalised on this basis. In sum, while the laws themselves appear to be progressive, the social circumstances in Mexico reflect a heavily discriminatory and violent situation for the LGBTQ+ community. The discrimination and abuse that the LGBTQ+ individuals face in Mexico is persistent, pervasive, and serious without protection from the state, and I find that it amounts to persecution. I also note under the SOGIESC Guidelines, section 5.1.1 that being compelled to conceal one\u2019s sexual orientation or gender identity constitutes a serious interference with fundamental human rights that may, therefore, amount to persecution. A claimant cannot be expected to conceal their sexual orientation or gender identity as a way to avoid persecution in their country of reference. As such, I find that you have established that you would face a serious possibility of persecution as a gay man in Mexico. In sum, I find that you have established a well-founded fear of persecution from the community at large as well as from the state.\n\nState Protection\n\n[13] A state is presumed to be capable of protecting its citizens, except in situations where the state is in a state of complete breakdown. A claimant can rebut the presumption of state protection by providing clear and convincing evidence that state protection is inadequate. Item 7.18 notes that Mexico has an extremely low rate of prosecution for all forms of crime. Prosecutions can take years to complete and crime is unreported due to a generalised mistrust in authorities. The objective evidence also indicates that the legislation that has been passed by the government to protect LGBTQ persons, which includes the Federal Law to prevent discrimination, is only partially effective and that the discrimination and violence against LGBTQ+ persons continues to be constant and prevalent across the country. Item 6.4 indicates that the government does not adequately investigate crimes against LGBTQ+ individuals. Even in larger cities, police are often involved in intimidation or extortion of same-sex couples. In addition to mistreatment by police, the judicial system is not effective in investigating crimes committed against sexual minorities. Item 6.4 also reports that the government did not generally investigate and punish those complicit in abuses against LGBTQ+ persons. You have also experienced this personally after getting sexually assaulted by a professor. You brought audio evidence of the assault to the police to make a report. They told you that you didn\u2019t have enough evidence and provided no measures of support or protection for you, with you stating \u201cthe laws only pretend to take care of you.\u201d As such, I find that state protection would not be reasonably forthcoming in this case.\n\nInternal Flight Alternative\n\n[14] Similarly, I find that an Internal Flight Alternative would not be available to you in Mexico. The test for a viable IFA has two (2) prongs. First, I must be satisfied that you would not face a serious possibility of persecution and that you would not be personally subjected to a risk to life of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or danger of torture in the IFA location. Second, I must be satisfied that it would not be unreasonable in all of the circumstances including those particular to you for you to seek refuge there. Although some evidence suggests that larger cities like Mexico City may be more gay-friendly than other areas of the country, the remaining evidence suggests that the brutal violence and discrimination described above against LGBTQ+ individuals still exists in these cities. The evidence before me including NDP Item 6.4 indicates there is a pattern of grotesque homicides of LGBTQ+ individuals, and there is broad impunity for these crimes and sometimes complicity of authorities is suspected. In terms of Mexico City, there are conflicting reports. Some of the evidence before me indicates that hate crimes against LGBTQ+ persons are almost unheard of in Mexico City. Yet, the same document goes on to indicate that there were several murders in Mexico City motivated by hate or prejudice.\n\n[15] Further, a more recent 2021 report at Item 6.7 indicates that Mexico City has one (1) of the highest LGBTQ+-targeted murder rates in the country. The report also describes Zona Rosa as the gay village of Mexico City, but states that violence and discrimination against LGBTQ+ persons in establishments within Zona Rosa are frequent. I also note that you have lived in several different towns and cities throughout your life, from small towns to large cities such as Guadalajara, and testified to experiencing violence and discrimination in all of them. Therefore, despite certain safe zones, I do not find that there is a viable Internal Flight Alternative in Mexico where you could live openly as a gay man. I find that the levels of discrimination you would experience would be sufficiently high to constitute a serious possibility of persecution throughout the country and the risk of physical attacks would be similar. As such, an IFA is not viable in this case.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[16] Based on the totality of the evidence and my analysis above, I find you to be a Convention refugee and I accept your claim.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

Wrong \u2014 Chairperson\u2019s Guideline on gender considerations in proceedings before the Immigration and Refugee Board.\n\nALLEGATIONS\n\n[3] You fear that you will be persecuted in Mexico because of your sexual orientation. In your Basis of Claim form, you describe being bullied at school because of your appearance and manner. When your mother tried to report the bullying to the school principal, the bullying intensified. When you were between eight (8) and 10 years of age, you were raped by \u2014 the second rape by a police officer who held a gun to your head. You did not tell anyone what had happened for shame and fear.\n\n[4] As an adult, you experienced overt discrimination in the XXXX or XXXX XXXX in which you worked. You eventually left the company but had trouble finding other jobs, in part, because of your sexual orientation. You also describe the challenges you had in finding housing with your gay partner and these experiences, together with other incidents of discrimination, have taken a toll on your mental health.\n\n[5] In XXXX 2022, you and a fellow XXXX came to Canada to volunteer with a local XXXX company and the director of that company had promised to help you get work permits. When you arrived, however, you learned that she would not be able or was not willing to help you with work permits. You could not face returning to the discrimination and fear in which you had lived in Mexico and so you filed this claim for protection in January 2023.\n\nDETERMINATION\n\n[6] I find that you are a Convention refugee, pursuant to section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, on the basis of your membership in a particular social group, namely gay men.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nIdentity\n\n[7] I am satisfied as to your identity by virtue of your testimony, the corroborative evidence that you have filed and your Mexican passport, a certified copy of which is on file.\n\nCredibility\n\n[8] I found you to be a very credible witness. You answered my questions readily and thoughtfully. I asked you about the Pride flag hanging on the wall behind you. You said the flag symbolizes your ability to express yourself freely, something you could not do in Mexico. You describe the humiliation, frustration and horror of repeated discrimination because of your sexual orientation.\n\n[9] You recounted accompanying your sister, who was transitioning from being male to female, to surgery related to her transition. You said the two (2) of you experienced discrimination on the bus. When returning from the surgery, you tried to get a taxi. The driver refused to let you in. An onlooker intervened and said that she would report the taxi driver if he did not accept you. He took you part of the way and forced you to get out, leaving you to walk home in the streets that were dangerous.\n\n[10] When I asked you how classmates or landlords or employers would know that you were gay, you said that it is, in part, because of your appearance and the way you walk. You are a XXXX and have a \u2014 I think you used the word, \u2018delicate,\u2019 way of walking. You also used the word, \u2018effete or effeminate,\u2019 to describe yourself in your Basis of Claim form.\n\n[11] You described an incident in which you and a partner were returning from a hike. Two (2) police officers were at the base of the trail. They stopped you and said they needed to search you, your bodies and your belongings for drugs. They fondled your buttocks. When you asked them to let you go, they said they would do so if you performed oral sex on them. The officers then realized that others were coming down the trail and so let you go. You immediately left and returned home. You said that you never filed a complaint with the police about the discrimination assaults or other problems you experienced. You said that you have not wanted to have anything to do with the police since childhood. The sight and thought of them fills you with fear and disgust.\n\n[12] You filed many documents to corroborate your allegations and these include one (1), statements from two (2) XXXX, one (1) male and one (1) female, from the XXXX company where you worked for five (5) years. They each describe the discrimination that you and other gay men in the company suffered. Two (2), statements from two (2) of your former partners, XXXX and XXXX (ph), XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and XXXX. They confirmed their relationship with you and the experiences that they have experienced as gay men in Mexico. Photos of your sister who is a transwoman. Four (4), photos of the XXXX company where you worked for five (5) years. I have no reason to doubt the reliability or the authenticity of any of the documents that you have provided.\n\n[13] In view of your credible testimony, as well as the corroborative evidence, I am satisfied that you are a gay man and that you have experienced the problems you describe in your BOC.\n\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution\n\n[14] The next question is whether you have a well-founded fear of persecution, in the future, if you go back to Mexico. This is two (2) parts. First, are you generally afraid of harm if you go back? And secondly, is your fear well-founded?\n\n[15] I find that you are \u2014 you have shown a genuine fear of persecution in Mexico if you return and try to live your life as a gay man. You have described the harassment and harm and discrimination and violence that you experienced over many years.\n\n[16] The next question is whether your fear is well-founded and I find that it is. The country reports in the Board\u2019s National Documentation Package from Mexico says that the government of Mexico has taken some steps to affirm the rights of LGBTQ persons. In 2011, the first article of the Constitution was updated to include discrimination based on sexual orientation. As well, federal laws to prevent discrimination were amended in 2014 to prohibit violence against sexual minorities. All 32 states in Mexico have anti-discrimination laws. Unfortunately, these legal initiatives did not seep down into the culture. A source in the IRB Response to Information Request, at Tab 6.4 of the NDP, states that discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity continues to be a structural phenomenon with extensive social roots.\n\n[17] The Response to Information Request, at Tab 6.5 of the NDP, elaborates on these social roots. \u201cIn Mexico, there are traditionally two (2) primary gender roles, machismo and marianismo.\u201d M-A-R-I-A-N-I-S-M-O. \u201cIn Mexico, the confluence of two (2) cultures, Spanish and Indigenous, that have idealized the hypermasculinity of a warrior, has produced a popular culture that is particularly hostile to any sign of effeminate in a man. Spaniards and Aztecs alike were draconian in their treatment of sexual nonconformists.\u201d\n\n[18] The Response to Information Request, at Tab 6.2 of the NDP, indicates that discrimination against sexual minorities remains prevalent across Mexico, including in the workplace. Access to housing and access to healthcare. This accords with your account of discrimination when looking for work and looking for accommodation. The Response to Information Request, at Tab 6.4 of the NDP, includes observations by the UN\u2019s special rapporteur, who notes that there has been an alarming pattern of homicides against gays, lesbians, bisexual and transgender individuals in Mexico. The special rapporteur says there is broad impunity for these crimes and sometimes complicity is facilitated by the complicity of investigative authorities. US Department of State report, at Tab 2.1 of the NDP, says that violence targeting LGBTQ persons is one (1) of the most significant human rights issues in Mexico.\n\n[19] And I note that the IRB\u2019s Gender Guidelines remind us that, \u201c11.3.2, discrimination may amount to persecution if the consequences to the individual are of a substantially prejudicial nature, such as the right to earn a livelihood, rights to private and family life, rights to access public places, freedom of movement or the right to education. Harassment in some cases may constitute persecution if it is sufficiently serious and occurs over a period of time such that a claimant\u2019s physical or moral integrity is threatened.\u201d\n\n[20] So I find in your case that you have experienced incidents of violence, but also incidents of discrimination, that have occurred over a long period of time that have affected your ability to earn a living and livelihood, to move about freely in public spaces and or to find safe housing. I further find that this persistent harassment and discrimination has threatened your physical or moral integrity. I, therefore, find that you, as a member of the LGBTQ community, have established a well-founded fear of persecution.\n\nState Protection\n\n[21] States are presumed to be capable of protecting their citizens, except in situations where the state is in a condition of complete breakdown. To rebut the presumption of state protection, claimants have to show clear and convincing evidence that the state protection would be inadequate.\n\n[22] For your case, I find that you have rebutted the presumption of state protection. Many of the experiences of violence, harassment and threats were at the hands of the police, including your rape by a police officer when you were a child. You also described how your sister, a transwoman, was recently injured when trying to escape police who were running after her.\n\n[23] Your account of police misconduct accords with the information in the National Documentation Package. The US Department of State report at Tab 2.1, the Austrian Red Cross report at Tab 6.1 and the Response to Information Requests at Tabs 6.2 and 6.4 indicate that members of the LGBTQ community continue to face violence and the police are, at best, indifferent or perhaps, at best, ineffective and, at worst, actively complicit. The RIR, Response to Information Request, at Tab 6.2 of the NDP, reports that, \u201cCivil society groups claim police routinely subjected LGBTI persons to mistreatment while in custody, including physical violence, arbitrary detention and due process violations.\u201d And the same report indicates that police harassment against the LGBT community remains high, even in Mexico City, which is considered the safe city for LGBTQ persons.\n\n[24] The Austrian Red Cross report, at Tab 6.1 of the NDP, says same sex couples showing public displays of affection are a frequent target of police abuse and arbitrary detention, often with excessive use of force or verbal abuse, because of what is considered immoral behaviour in public spaces.\n\n[25] So given your own experiences and the country reports on the attitudes of police towards LGBTQ persons, I find that the state would be unwilling or unable to provide adequate protection to you if you were to return to Mexico.\n\nInternal Flight Alternative\n\n[26] The final question is whether you can avoid the problems you fear by moving to a different part of Mexico. In particular, I proposed Mexico City as an internal flight alternative. I find that you would not have a viable IFA. You stated that you moved to different states, in an effort to get away from the discrimination and violence, Nayarit and Michoacan, but that life was no better for you in those states.\n\n[27] The country evidence suggests that larger cities like Mexico City are more gay friendly than other parts of the country, but the reports indicate that the violence and discrimination, which has been outlined above, still exist in these cities. The report entitled, \u201cQueer Refugee Hearings,\u201d at Tab 6.8 (sic) of the NDP, states as follows, \u201cAlthough Mexico City is internationally perceived as, \u201cgay friendly,\u201d a 2017 report states that homophobic and transphobic discrimination is pervasive. Participants said they were primarily discriminated against in public spaces at school and by their family. 20 to 25 percent of the population reported not being able to speak openly about their SOGIE.\u201d S-O-G-I-E. SOGIE refers to sexual orientation and gender identity and expression. \u201cAdditionally, almost one (1) third of participants said they would not experience \u2014 report experience of discrimination based on their SOGIE because of perceived state corruption in favour of the perpetrator, the unlikelihood of state action and the bureaucracy that would be associated with the claim process. Mexico also has one (1) of the highest LGBTIQ targeted murder rates in the country.\u201d\n\n[28] So given the totality of the evidence before me, I find that you would face persecution because of your sexual orientation throughout Mexico and that there is no viable IFA available to you.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[29] I, therefore, find that you have established a well-founded fear of persecution in Mexico on the basis of your sexual orientation. I accept your claim.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

Olearnek\nCountry: Mexico\nRPD Number: VC3-02711\nAssociated RPD Numbers): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2023-01721\nATIP Pages: N\/A\n\nDECISION\n\n[1] MEMBER: This is the decision of the Refugee Protection Division in the claim of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, a citizen of Mexico who is claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. In hearing and assessing this claim, I considered the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 4, gender considerations in proceedings before the IRB.\n\nALLEGATIONS\n\n[2] You fear harm from your ex-husband. Your ex-husband was jealous, controlling, and possessive, and over a period of about 38 years, he physically, emotionally, sexually, verbally, and financially abused you. You fear that if you return to Mexico, this violence against you from him will continue.\n\nDETERMINATION\n\n[3] I find you to be a Convention refugee for the following reasons.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nIdentity\n\n[4] Your identity as a citizen of Mexico is established on a balance of probabilities by the supporting documentation filed, namely a copy of your Mexican passport found at Exhibit 1.\n\nCredibility and Well-Founded Fear of Persecution.\n\n[5] When a claimant swears to the truth of certain allegations, this creates a presumption that those allegations are true unless there is reason to doubt their truthfulness. In this case, I overall found you to be a credible witness. Your testimony was given in a consistent and straightforward manner, and the information you provided was consistent with your Basis of Claim form and your supporting documents.\n\n[6] I note that you did delay in filing your refugee claim. You arrived in Canada in XXXX 2017 and filed your claim in around December 2022. The documentary evidence confirms that you had been without status in Canada for about four (4) years prior to filing your refugee claim, and this delay raised concerns about your subjective fear.\n\n[7] Based on your testimony, I however find that you have reasonably explained your delay claiming protection. Your testimony indicates that you initially tried to get help in extending your status in Canada, and that you did raise the reasons you could not return to Mexico with a lawyer. But it was your impression that any help from the lawyer would cost you money, which you did not have.\n\n[8] It was also not clear to you at that time that the type of application the lawyer would be assisting you with was a refugee claim. You indicated that had this been the case, you would have done it. And after you had that consultation with the lawyer, you did proceed to file an application to restore and extend your status with the help of a friend. And because of your fear of returning to Mexico when your status ran out in Canada, you tried not to be noticed.\n\n[9] And it was after the fire at your apartment in the last half of 2022 that you learned through community support workers that you could file a refugee claim in Canada with the help of legal aid. And shortly after you found this out, you filed your refugee claim.\n\n[10] I note that in assessing the reasonableness of your explanation and your delay in filing your claim, I have considered your age and your level of education, which I find supports that you may not have had the knowledge and ability to figure out how to legally stay in Canada on your own. I also note that you have provided letters from family members such as your parents and your siblings that confirm the abuse you suffered over the years from your husband.\n\n[11] I also found your testimony at the hearing was consistent with the abuse that you have set out in your narrative. And for all of these reasons, I found that you were a credible witness, and I accept your allegations of abuse that you have suffered from your husband that are set out in your narrative and the supporting documentary evidence. I also accept that you have established on a balance of probabilities that your husband is still interested in locating you, as evidenced by your testimony of his attempts at contacting you in Canada.\n\n[12] I found this testimony credible and spontaneous. You have indicated that since coming to Canada, you received calls and messages, including messages threatening that you would pay for everything when you come back. And as recently as three (3) months ago, your husband also grabbed your son\u2019s phone in order to talk to you.\n\n[13] While I note that your husband is currently 79 years old, I find that the evidence indicates that he is still capable of harming you. You have indicated that he is still living independently, and while he has XXXX, he generally was able to manage it while you were together. And based on your testimony, it does not appear that he had any major complications with his condition, and you have no information that anything has changed regarding his health.\n\n[14] The country condition evidence, such As Items 5, 10, and 2.8, also confirm that gender-based violence is common in Mexico. Consequently, given the country condition evidence, the years of abuse that you have endured at the hands of your husband, as well as his ongoing attempts at contacting you, I find that your subjective fear of persecution, as well as an objective basis for that fear, is established. I find that your fear also has a nexus to the Convention grounds of membership in a particular social group, as a woman fearing gender-based violence.\n\nState Protection\n\n[15] I find that the country condition evidence noted previously, specifically 5.10 and 2.8 establishes that state protection is unlikely to be forthcoming to you. The country condition evidence confirms that perpetrators of gender-based violence are rarely punished. Implementation of a 2007 law designed to protect women from such crimes remains halting, particularly at the state level, and impunity is the norm \u2014\n\n\u2014\u2014 END OF AUDIO #1 \u2014\u2014\n\n\u2014\u2014 BEGINNING OF AUDIO #2 \u2014\u2014\n\n[16] MEMBER: \u2014 hundreds of women each year. State authorities can issue gender alerts that trigger greater scrutiny and an influx of resources to combat an epidemic of violence against women. But the mechanism has proven ineffective.\n\n[17] According to official statistics, 968 femicides were recorded in 2022. Some non-governmental sources say the true number is likely much higher. And I also note that the country condition evidence you provided also confirms this.\n\n[18] This country condition evidence also confirms your own experiences that you had in going to the police in the past. And therefore, I find that overall, the evidence establishes that operationally effective state protection would not be available to you in Mexico. And I find that the presumption of state protection has been rebutted.\n\nInternal Flight Alternative\n\n[19] In this case, your husband has been able to track you down in other states in the past through your children. And he most recently was using one (1) of your children\u2019s phones to try and talk to you. Given your evidence about his use of your children to locate you in other states and Mexico in the past, and his attempts at contacting you recently through your children, I find that you do not have a viable internal flight alternative in Mexico.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[20] For the foregoing reasons, I find you to be a Convention refugee and I accept your claim.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

[4] I have also considered the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 8 which offers guidance on procedural accommodations and trauma-informed adjudication, as per counsel\u2019s request prior to the hearing.[5]\n\n[5] The principal claimant has also provided a XXXX report which I have considered when conducting the hearing and rendering my decision.[6]\n\nALLEGATIONS\n\n[6] The full allegations are set out in the claimants\u2019 Basis of Claim (BOC) forms and narrative.[7] The associate claimant and minor claimant\u2019s claims are based on the same allegations outlined in the narrative provided by the principal claimant\u2014their respective spouse and mother. In summary, the claimants fear the principal claimant\u2019s ex-husband who physically, financially, and psychologically abused the principal claimant for many years when they were in a relationship, kidnapped the daughter she had with him and refused to give the daughter back to the principal claimant despite the principal claimant maintaining legal custody of her daughter, and threatened her with death. The principal claimant\u2019s ex-husband is a member of the Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generacion (CJNG), and she was also threatened with death if she told anyone about the activities she had witnessed regarding their trafficking of goods. The associate claimant and minor claimant have also been threatened with death by the principal claimant\u2019s ex-husband as a means of harming the principal claimant.\n\n[7] The claimants arrived in Canada in XXXX 2022 and signed their BOC forms in October 2022.\n\nDETERMINATION\n\n[8] I find that the claimants are Convention refugees as per s. 96 of IRPA, as they have each established a serious possibility of persecution if they were to return to Mexico.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nIdentity\n\n[9] I find that the personal identities of the claimants and their identities as nationals of Mexico have been established through their testimonies and the copies of their passports in evidence.[8]\n\nNexus\n\n[10] I find that the allegations establish a nexus to a Convention ground for each claimant. The principal claimant has a nexus to membership in a particular social group as a woman facing gender-related violence, arising from her allegations of threats and abuse from her ex-husband. I have also considered the intersectional impact of gender-related violence from her allegations of childhood sexual abuse.\n\n[11] The associate claimant and minor claimant each have a nexus to membership in a particular social group, specifically that of family members of the principal claimant, as their risks arise from their familial association to the principal claimant as her spouse and child. For these reasons, all three claims will be analyzed under s. 96 of IRPA.\n\nCredibility\n\n[12] A claimant\u2019s sworn testimony is presumed truthful unless there are reasons to doubt the veracity of their allegations.[9] In this case, the principal claimant\u2019s testimony on behalf of herself and the minor claimant, and the associate claimant\u2019s testimony on his own behalf, were candid, forthcoming, and consistent with the information contained in their BOC forms, narrative, and personal evidence. The claimants did not attempt to embellish their testimonies nor enhance the favourability of their claims, despite opportunity to do so. The claimants became emotional during their testimonies, particularly the principal claimant, when speaking about their fears of the principal claimant\u2019s ex-husband carrying out his death threats, along with the principal claimant\u2019s desire to get her daughter back in her care. The claimants were open and forthcoming about the fact that they were nervous, yet I found their testimonies to be clear, spontaneous, and detailed. I find that the principal claimant\u2019s emotional testimony was not inconsistent with the impact of trauma when recounting traumatic incidents outlined in Guidelines 4 and 8 and her psychological report at exhibit 5. Overall, I find the claimants to be credible witnesses with respect to the material facts of their claims as outlined below.\n\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution\n\nFindings of fact\n\n[13] The claimants provided personal supporting documents to corroborate their claims at exhibit 4.1, including: birth certificates for the minor claimant and the principal claimant\u2019s daughter in Mexico; Mexican voter identification cards for the principal claimant and associate claimant; a copy of the principal claimant\u2019s marriage certificate with her ex-husband; a copy of the principal claimant\u2019s divorce judgement from her ex-husband; a copy of a police report and acknowledgement of a case with the Prosecutor General filed by the claimants in Mexico against the principal claimant\u2019s ex-husband, along with a copy of the interview notes taken by the Prosecutor General when interviewing the principal claimant about this report, and an acknowledgement of authentication of these documents from the Prosecutor General\u2019s office; a copy of the principal claimant and associate claimant\u2019s marriage certificate; a notarized document authorizing the principal claimant\u2019s mother the power to conduct lawsuits, administrative acts, and ownership acts on behalf of the principal claimant; and affidavits from the principal claimant\u2019s uncle and the principal claimant\u2019s aunt, both signed and accompanied by their respective identification documents. I find no reason to doubt the genuine nature of these documents and give them full weight in credibly establishing, along with the claimants\u2019 allegations and credible testimonies, the following facts:\n\na) The principal claimant was sexually assaulted for a number of years by her stepfather as a child and struggled with her mental health as a result. She was able to tell her mother about these experiences as a child with the assistance of her uncle;\n\nb) The principal claimant married her ex-husband in 2009 and they had a daughter together in 2010, as confirmed by the copy of her birth certificate in evidence. They lived together in Comitan, Chiapas. Her ex-husband did not form a relationship with her daughter and was resentful that she was not a boy;\nc) The principal claimant\u2019s ex-husband was emotionally, psychologically, verbally, physically, and sexually abusive and threatening towards her, including during her pregnancy and often in front of their daughter;\n\nd) The principal claimant was forced to work for her ex-husband\u2019s family\u2019s XXXX business, which had multiple stores and a warehouse. She was not permitted to speak with her ex-husband\u2019s coworkers, was locked away in her room when he spoke with his drivers, and was not permitted to enter the warehouse or his parents\u2019 bedroom. She was told she could not open any of the merchandise, and she was only allowed to be in the kitchen to prepare food or to manage sales of the XXXX stores. She witnessed large quantities of merchandise and saw that drugs were stored within the XXXX boxes. She was told by her ex-husband that their distribution route was large and went to the Guatemalan border. She confronted her ex-husband about the drugs and distribution, and he threatened to silence her;\n\ne) The principal claimant\u2019s ex-husband directly told her that he was involved with the CJNG cartel. When she suggested that they move away and start a new life together in a new city, he told her that he could not leave, as he was involved with the CJNG and there were CJNG men in every part of Mexico. She saw him always with other men, communicating on radios, and being called a nickname. After separating from her ex-husband, he continually threatened her, saying that CJNG men existed throughout the Republic of Mexico and that he would use these connections to search for her anywhere she went if she did not remain quiet about what she witnessed with his business;\n\nf) The principal claimant separated from her ex-husband in 2011 and moved to Tapachula, Chiapas with her daughter. She did not speak with her ex-husband for 5 months, and they then initiated divorce proceedings. She moved back to Comitan in XXXX 2013, while her ex-husband was living in Cancun. The principal claimant\u2019s ex-husband granted her a divorce under the threat that she could not tell anyone what she witnessed regarding his business, associates, and merchandise distribution. She was also forced to sign a document waiving her legal rights to any financial support. Her ex-husband\u2019s parents attempted to bribe her for custody of her daughter, and she refused;\n\ng) The principal claimant was awarded full custody and guardianship of her daughter in XXXX 2013, and her ex-husband was granted visitation rights every second Saturday. This is the only and most up-to-date legal custody arrangement regarding their daughter. The principal claimant moved with her daughter to XXXX, Chiapas in XXXX 2013, began a relationship with the associate claimant, became pregnant, moved to Tapachula in XXXX 2013, and was visited twice per year by her ex-husband\u2019s parents;\n\nh) The principal claimant and associate claimant married in XXXX 2013 and the minor claimant was born in XXXX 2013. His birth certificate in evidence and his passport list the principal claimant and associate claimant as his parents;\n\ni) In XXXX 2020 the principal claimant\u2019s ex-husband told her that he was back in Chiapas and wanted to see his daughter. He continued to be abusive to her when he came to pick up his daughter in XXXX 2020, and advised that he would call her. The principal claimant\u2019s daughter was not returned, and she found out that they were no longer in Comitan. She was contacted occasionally on the phone by her daughter and told that her daughter was living with the principal claimant\u2019s ex-husband\u2019s parents. He refused to allow the principal claimant to see her daughter or know her location. When the principal claimant heard that her daughter was not returned to school, she threatened to reveal information about what she had witnessed about his business and to sue him. He responded by threatening to kill the associate claimant and minor claimant;\n\nj) The principal claimant attempted to get her daughter back through talking with the courts in Tapachula and Comitan in XXXX and XXXX 2021, but she was advised that she could only do that by initiating a lawsuit. During this process, she told the courts about her ex-husband\u2019s business activities and involvement with the CJNG in an attempt to inform them about the seriousness of the situation and his violent nature. She was fearful that her ex-husband would act on his death threats if she attempted to sue him, so she did not initiate a lawsuit. She attempted to get the assistance of the police by telling her story, and they said they would help with a bribe, but said that they could not guarantee the return of her daughter, and that her ex-husband could be released on bail immediately even if he was arrested, which would increase the risk to all three claimants. This advice was also given to her by her cousin who is a lawyer and a human rights activist, who both told her it was better to come to an agreement with her ex-husband, and that suing him would make the situation worse and lead to more violence;\n\nk) The principal claimant was informed by a friend that her daughter was seen at a school in Las Margaritas, Chiapas. The principal claimant went to see her daughter at school, spoke with her daughter, and when she attempted to negotiate with her ex-husband to arrange visits with her daughter, he refused. The principal claimant and associate claimant attended her daughter\u2019s school year-end ceremony in XXXX 2022 and were threatened with death by her ex-husband;\n\nl) The principal claimant and associate claimant went to her aunt\u2019s home in XXXX the same day, and her ex-husband arrived with 30 men who violently threatened them regarding the principal claimant\u2019s exposure of information to authorities about their business activities in an attempt to get her daughter back. Two months later, the principal claimant and associate claimant returned to the principal claimant\u2019s aunt\u2019s home, where the principal claimant\u2019s ex-husband appeared with 20 men who threatened all three claimants with death and pushed the principal claimant\u2019s mother. He did not ever say how he knew the claimants were at her aunt\u2019s home; and\n\nm) The claimants left for Canada two weeks later and have not had any contact with the principal claimant\u2019s ex-husband nor daughter since arriving in Canada. Their family members have not told them about any problems with her ex-husband since they arrived in Canada. The principal claimant has met a lawyer since being in Canada who advised that once the claimants have secured permanent residency in Canada, they can initiate legal proceedings to get her daughter from her ex-husband. The principal claimant also testified that if returned to Mexico, she would \u201cuntil her final breath\u201d continue trying to get her daughter back from her ex-husband, as she is fearful for her daughter\u2019s safety in a cartel environment and due to her ex-husband\u2019s violent nature.\n\nDelay in claiming protection in Canada\n\n[14] The claimants entered Canada in XXXX 2022 and signed their BOC forms in October 2022. While they stated that their intention in coming to Canada was to file claims for refugee protection, as they heard about this possibility while in Mexico and informed the police in their report that they were intending on coming to Canada to seek protection,[10] they testified that they did not file their claims at the border because when they attempted to seek protection at the border, they were told by the border officials that there was no available translator so they should make their claims from within Canada. They then met a lawyer, changed lawyers to their current lawyer, and signed their BOC forms within two months of arrival. I find this reasonable, as they maintained legal visitor status in Canada, attempted to initiate claims at the earliest opportunity, and immediately sought legal advice upon entry to Canada. Therefore, I do not draw a negative inference regarding their subjective fears from their delay of 2 months in claiming protection in Canada.\n\nConclusion on subjective fear\n\n[15] As discussed above, the claimants\u2019 evidence, which I have found credible, establishes that they have all three been threatened by the principal claimant\u2019s ex-husband, and he has a long history of abuse towards the principal claimant in the presence of her daughter, which itself constitutes child abuse towards her daughter. I find the claimants have established, on a balance of probabilities, the principal claimant\u2019s ex-husband\u2019s involvement in drug trafficking and membership in the CJNG cartel. I find that the claimants have credibly established the principal claimant\u2019s ex-husband\u2019s persistence in pursuing the claimants, such as repeatedly utilizing the cycle of violence[11] to convince the principal claimant to return to the relationship multiple times after his abuse over many years; his use of threats to create fear in the claimants of pursuing legal matters to enforce the legal custody the principal claimant maintains of her daughter; and his persistence in travelling to the principal claimant\u2019s aunt\u2019s home on multiple occasions to threaten and verbally abuse the claimants.\n\n[16] Additionally, due to his threats against the principal claimant related to her knowledge of his involvement in the CJNG and his business, including his willingness to threaten to harm the associate claimant and minor claimant in retaliation for the principal claimant speaking out about these activities to the authorities in an attempt to get her daughter back, I find that his motivation to harm all three claimants is compounded. As the principal claimant has testified that she will not give up on trying to get her daughter back and enforce her legal custody, I find that the claimants will continue to be at risk of persecution from the principal claimant\u2019s ex-husband. Based on all the evidence before me, I find that all three claimants have established a subjective fear of persecution if they were to return to Mexico.\n\nObjective basis\n\n[17] The objective evidence before me supports the claimants\u2019 fear of returning to Mexico.\n\n[18] According to the objective evidence in the National Documentation Package (NDP) for Mexico,[12] \u201cpatriarchal and conservative values are still prevalent in Mexican society\u201d[13] and violence against women is a significant problem. Item 2.8 indicated that in a 2023 report, \u201csexual abuse and domestic violence against women are common, and perpetrators are rarely punished\u201d.[14] Item 5.3 identifies domestic violence as a \u201cwidely acknowledged problem\u201d and states that \u201cMexican women are often mistreated by their spouses or by male members of their family\u201d. This source also states that \u201c46 percent of women have suffered some form of violence\u201d and states that this includes abuse, violence, and attacks from former partners or spouses. [15]\n\n[19] Mexico is listed as being within the top 20 worst countries in the world for violence against women.[16] NDP item 5.24 states that between 2018-2020, \u201cthe National Register of Disappeared and Unlocated Persons documented the disappearance of 19,938 women, girls, and adolescents in Mexico\u201d. Sources from a 2021 RIR indicate that the rate of femicides in Mexico has increased by 137 percent over the last five years, while homicides have comparatively increased by 35 percent over the same period.[17] According to official statistics, 968 femicides were recorded in 2022; some nongovernmental sources say the true number is likely much higher.[18] It is widely acknowledged between many sources that rates of femicide are underreported. Item 5.20 indicates that \u201c[m]any of the femicides linked to organized crime are of women whose partner was involved with or targeted by a criminal group\u201d.[19] According to the objective evidence, in the culture surrounding cartels and gangs, \u201cwomen are \u2018considered disposable\u2019\u2026and violence committed against them represents \u2018gang cohesion and masculinity\u2019\u201d, and organized crime culture is \u201c\u2018very macho, patriarchal, with very sexist undertones\u2019\u201d.[20]\n\n[20] NDP item 7.8 states that criminal violence has become highly intense, diversified, and popularized over the past two decades in Mexico, with widespread violence and ungovernability affecting almost all Mexican states. It is objectively well-established that a high percentage of police officers in Mexico work in partnership with criminal organizations,[21] and that the CJNG is one of the two largest and most powerful cartels in Mexico with \u201csignificant presence in 23 of the 32 Mexican states\u201d, an expanding, growing presence in the remaining states and along key border locations, and has alliances with other cartels.[22] The CJNG is said to have control over certain key highways and ports where they have installed checkpoints, verify identification, and impose extortion payments, they have placed lookouts at local airports and land borders who report back to the CJNG, and they have access to information at the Mexico City International Airport.[23] Areas of safety are continually shifting, and thousands have been displaced, such as in the claimants\u2019 home area of Chiapas, in which \u201cclashes between organized crime groups have displaced thousands of inhabitants in 2023\u201d, including clashes between the CJNG and Sinaloa cartels.[24] The CJNG is unique in its violent public displays, and is said to have very powerful weaponry, even surpassing that of the Mexican armed forces.[25] The CJNG is also identified as the criminal group with the most money-laundering businesses in Mexico, including legal sales of items such as alcohol, tobacco, and tortillas,[26] reflective of the XXXX business described by the principal claimant operated by her ex-husband.\n\n[21] Drug cartels such as the CJNG engage in extreme forms of violence as a means of maintaining power, such as displaying dead and mutilated bodies to terrorize the public and ensure compliance with their demands.[27] Further, \u201cthose who betray or steal from the cartel are dehumanized and portrayed as \u2018rats\u2019 who must pay with a gruesome death for their betrayal\u201d; examples of what they consider to be betrayal include reporting the cartel to police or failing to pay a bribe or quota.[28] NDP item 7.15 states that a motivation for cartels to track people throughout Mexico include a personal vendetta. The 2023 RIR at item 7.7 states that \u201cthe CJNG has \u2018what it needs\u2019, in terms of technological and weapons capabilities, \u2018to reach whoever they want, wherever they want\u2019 in Mexico, \u2018even if they are not the dominant actor\u2019 in that state\u201d. The claimants\u2019 credible testimony has established that the principal claimant\u2019s CJNG-involved ex-husband has threatened all three claimants with death following the principal claimant\u2019s disclosure of information to authorities about his criminal activities linked to the CJNG, and has a personal vendetta against the principal claimant which involves illegally keeping her daughter away from her, to which the principal claimant has established she will not cease trying to get her daughter back. Overall, the objective documentation supports the claimants\u2019 subjective fear of the principal claimant\u2019s ex-husband.\n\nConclusions on well-founded fear of persecution\n\n[22] While I note that the principal claimant stated that she has not had contact with her daughter or made any attempts to get her daughter back since she saw her at her school in XXXX 2022, I have considered the totality of the principal claimant\u2019s circumstances, fear of her ex-husband, feelings of being misunderstood and unsupported by authorities, the history of abuse from her ex-husband, and his profile as a CJNG member, along with the guidance provided in Guideline 4[29] when assessing her forward-facing risk related to getting her daughter back. I find it reasonable that after exhausting what she believes were all legal avenues to get her daughter back with Mexican authorities and weighing the safety risks posed to the claimants and her daughter, she believes it was safest to cut communication with her daughter and ex-husband until she can continue the legal process to get her daughter back after the claimants have secured their permanent immigration statuses in Canada.\n[23] Based on the totality of the evidence, I find that the claimants have established a well-founded fear of persecution if they were to return to Mexico, as they face further abuse and death from the principal claimant\u2019s ex-husband due to the principal claimant speaking to authorities about his involvement in drug trafficking with the CJNG cartel and her persistence in pursuing the enforcement of legal custody of her daughter.\n\nState Protection\n\n[24] Except in situations of complete breakdown of the state apparatus, the state is presumed to be capable of protecting its citizens unless there is clear and convincing evidence to the contrary. I find that the claimants have rebutted this presumption as their testimonies and the objective evidence demonstrate that the state will not provide them with adequate protection.\n\n[25] When the principal claimant was in an abusive relationship with her ex-husband, she did not attempt to obtain state protection, as she was fearful of his connections with the CJNG and that his abuse towards her would escalate into more violence. I find this reasonable in consideration of the guidance provided at Guideline 4 regarding hesitations and fear of seeking protection from authorities in cases of gender-based violence.[30]\n\n[26] As outlined above, the principal claimant unsuccessfully attempted to get protection and support from numerous authorities in Mexico to get her daughter back. She was told by the XXXX XXXX in Comitan and the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in Tapachula that her daughter was not technically kidnapped as she had given her consent for her daughter to go with her ex-husband, that they could not create an amber alert in her circumstances, and that her custody arrangement allowed for her ex-husband to have visits with her daughter. They stated that the only means for her to get her daughter back was to hire a lawyer and pursue a lawsuit for full custody in which her ex-husband would have no visitation rights. Aside from the advice she received from multiple lawyers and a human rights activist that she would increase the risk to herself and the other two claimants if she pursued a lawsuit, she was also told that without knowledge of the address where her daughter was living, she could not file a lawsuit. When she approached police about accompanying her to see if her daughter was at the home of a known relative of her ex-husband, they agreed to do it with a bribe, but informed her that it would most likely not result in prosecution and would create greater danger for her and her family.\n\n[27] In general, both the principal and associate claimant testified that there is a general sense in Mexico that police are corrupt, involved with cartels, and do not offer protection for women. While there is a copy of a police report in evidence, this report outlines that the claimants intended to leave for Canada to file claims for refugee protection, and they testified at the hearing that this report was made on the advice of a lawyer who told them to document the history of facts regarding the principal claimant\u2019s ex-husband in the event that proof was needed for future legal proceedings. The police did not offer the claimants protection following this report.\n\n[28] The NDP at item 7.18 states that \u201cvarious police forces in Mexico\u2026lack human and material resources in order to properly investigate crimes\u201d. Numerous sources report that police forces in Mexico are corrupt, collude with criminal organizations, and often are influenced by bribes, attributed to \u201cpoor working conditions in law enforcement agencies\u201d.[31] This item also states that \u201c93.2 percent of all crimes committed were either not reported or not investigated\u201d with a large amount of blame placed on police, as citizens saw reporting as \u201ca waste of time\u201d, they had a \u201clack of trust in authorities\u201d, there were \u201cdifficulties and a [long reporting] process\u201d, authorities had a \u201chostile attitude\u201d, and they feared \u201cbeing victims of extortion\u201d.[32] More than half of Mexican citizens saw both police and the Attorney General\u2019s office as corrupt.[33]\n\n[29] Compounding the above, the country condition documents indicate that laws addressing violence against women are not effectively enforced. The Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) also stated that there was \u201csystemic impunity\u201d for crimes against women in Mexico, where 90% of crimes go unreported, uninvestigated or unpunished.[34]The United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women, amongst other sources, has emphasized that there are \u201cdeep-rooted institutional, structural and practical barriers\u201d which continue to hinder access to justice for women, including that officials within the criminal justice system, including law enforcement officers, hold \u201cdiscriminatory stereotypes\u201d and \u201climited knowledge\u201d of women\u2019s rights.[35] Item 5.12 states that \u201cthe Mexican police and armed forces routinely torture and ill-treat women, and that sexual violence is routine during arrest and interrogation\u201d, with 72% of arrested women reporting sexual violence during arrest or in the hours that followed.[36] Consequently, it is reported that an estimated 78% of women facing gender-based violence do not seek institutional help or report to authorities.[37]\n\n[30] Item 5.11 states that \u201cthere are often large differences between the existing laws and their implementation. Despite strong existing legislation protecting women\u2019s rights and preventing violence against women, enforcement varies widely and largely depends on social norms\u201d. Implementation of a 2007 law[38] designed to protect women from such crimes remains halting, particularly at the state level, and impunity is the norm for the killers of hundreds of women each year.[39] State authorities can issue \u201cgender alerts\u201d that trigger greater scrutiny and an influx of resources to combat an epidemic of violence against women, but the mechanism has proven ineffective.[40] The government cut funding for women\u2019s services in 2022, and \u201cthe president frequently dismissed feminists as allies of the political opposition\u201d.[41]\n\n[31] I find that the principal claimant\u2019s fear of reporting her ex-husband\u2019s abuse and criminal activities while she was in a relationship with him to be reasonable given the treatment of women by Mexican authorities, her fear of his power within the CJNG, and the objective evidence regarding a lack of implementation of laws protecting women and collusion between criminal actors and authorities. Furthermore, I find that the objective evidence supports the lack of support the claimants received when attempting to get the principal claimant\u2019s daughter back from her ex-husband due to his involvement with the CJNG and the lack of assistance offered to women. I, therefore, find that state protection is inadequate at an operational level and that it would not be forthcoming to the claimants in their circumstances.\n\nInternal Flight Alternative\n\n[32] For an internal flight alternative (or IFA) to be viable, it must satisfy both prongs of a two-pronged test on a balance of probabilities. I must assess whether there is another location in Mexico in which the claimants would not face a serious possibility of persecution or a risk of harm, and whether it would be reasonable to expect them to move there.[42] I find that there is no viable IFA within Mexico for the claimants, as there is no location in Mexico in which the claimants would not face a serious possibility of persecution.\n\n[33] The principal claimant established that after she was threatened on multiple occasions by her ex-husband to not reveal information about his business activities and involvement with the CJNG cartel to anyone, she revealed information about her ex-husband\u2019s activities with drug trafficking and the CJNG cartel to authorities when attempting to seek assistance in getting her daughter back from her ex-husband. Following these conversations with authorities, her ex-husband then threatened the lives of all three claimants while stating that the principal claimant was \u201cbig-mouthed\u201d and would see retaliation for this. As mentioned above, CJNG motivations for tracking and harming a particular individual include those who have privileged information or important contacts the CJNG perceives to be a threat to their interests. Further expanded, this is those who \u201chave \u2018valuable\u2019 or \u2018sensitive\u2019 information, betrayed them, or if they hold a personal animosity with them, such as previous romantic partners, leaders or high-ranking members of rival criminal groups, journalists, former government employees, or former police officers\u201d.[43] This is in line with the principal claimant\u2019s circumstances, particularly since she previously revealed this sensitive information to authorities.\n\n[34] Furthermore, I find that the principal claimant\u2019s ex-husband has been abusive towards her for over a decade during and after their relationship, and that he has insisted that he is in control of their daughter, that their daughter lives with him now, and that the principal claimant is not permitted to see her daughter. I find that the claimants have credibly established that the principal claimant\u2019s ex-husband has the ongoing motivation to find and harm all three claimants in retaliation for the principal claimant\u2019s previous efforts to get her daughter back, which involved revealing information about his illicit activities to authorities, along with that arising from the principal claimant\u2019s stated intention to continue pursuing the enforcement of her legal custody of her daughter until her daughter is back in her care.\n\n[35] Aside from the power and reach of the CJNG cartel documented within the objective evidence, and the principal claimant\u2019s ex-husband\u2019s history of threatening the claimants at the principal claimant\u2019s aunt\u2019s home, the claimants\u2019 home, and over the telephone for many years, I find that the principal claimant\u2019s ex-husband has the means to find and harm the claimants through the principal claimant\u2019s continued efforts to enforce the legal custody she has of her daughter and get her daughter back into her care.\n\n[36] Furthermore, It is well established in the Federal Court that it is not reasonable to expect a claimant to avoid contact with family members, that family members would face dangers from knowledge of a claimant\u2019s whereabouts, and it is not reasonable for family members or friends to place their own lives in danger by either denying knowledge of a claimant\u2019s whereabouts or deliberately misleading the agent of harm.[44] While the principal claimant has not spoken with her daughter since XXXX 2022, my analysis above on this fact finds that this decision is a product of fear arising from death threats from her ex-husband towards herself, the associate claimant, and the minor claimant. Additionally, I find that the principal claimant\u2019s testimony establishes that this is a temporary decision while the claimants seek safety in Canada and until they are able to find the legal assistance to enforce this custody agreement in a means that is safe for all of the claimants. The principal claimant has testified that if returned to Mexico, she would continue trying to get her daughter back, as she fears for her daughter\u2019s safety and both her and her daughter have expressed to one another that they wish to live together. Therefore, I find that the evidence before me establishes that the principal claimant values an ongoing relationship with her daughter and will continue to fight to have her daughter in her legal care. It is, therefore, unreasonable to expect her to keep her location from her daughter, as this is tantamount to hiding. Additionally, her daughter could not be reasonably expected to keep the claimants\u2019 location hidden from the principal claimant\u2019s ex-husband, as this may put her life at risk, notably given the ex-husband\u2019s history of threats, violent behaviour, and abuse of the principal claimant in the presence of her daughter.\n\n[37] As I have found that the principal claimant\u2019s ex-partner has the motivation and means to find all three of the claimants throughout Mexico, and it is therefore not safe for the claimants to return anywhere in Mexico, there is no need to consider whether it is unreasonable.\n\n[38] Based on the information before me, I find that the claimants do not have a viable IFA in Mexico.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[39] I find that the claimants are Convention refugees and accept their claims.\n\n(signed) Kylee Carreno\n\nDecember 5, 2023\n\n[1] Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n\n[2] Refugee Protection Division Rules, SOR\/2012-256.\n\n[3] Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (IRB) Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 3: Child Refugee Claimants: Procedural and Evidentiary Issues, effective September 30, 1996.\n[4] Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (IRB) Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 4: Gender Considerations in Proceedings before the Immigration and Refugee Board, updated July 18, 2022.\n\n[5] Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (IRB) Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 8: Accessibility to IRB Proceedings\u2014Procedural Accommodations and Substantive Considerations, updated October 31, 2023.\n\n[6] Exhibit 5.\n\n[7] Exhibits 2.1-2.3.\n\n[8] Exhibit 1.\n\n[9] Maldonado v.

Garza\nCountry: Mexico\nRPD Number: VC2-08210\nAssociated RPD Numbers): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2023-01721\nATIP Pages: N\/A\n\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n[1] These are the reasons for the decision in the claim of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX who claims to be a citizen of Mexico and is claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).[1]\n\n[2] In conducting the hearing and rendering these reasons, I have considered and applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 4 which offers guidance on the gender-specific aspects of this claim.[2]\n\nALLEGATIONS\n\n[3] The full allegations are set out in the claimant\u2019s Basis of Claim (BOC) form.[3] In summary, the claimant, from Jalisco state, fears men from the Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generacion (CJNG) who have threatened to rape and kill her if she does not fulfill their demands of becoming a sexual servant for them. The claimant assisted a young woman escape who had been taken by the CJNG to be a forced sex worker. The cartel members later came to the claimant\u2019s home and shot at her, and she attempted to file a report with police. When the cartel members found out about this report, they threatened that she needed to take the place of the young girl she helped escape by becoming their sex worker, or else they would rape and murder her. She attempted to move to multiple other addresses in a different city, but her location was found out by these men, and she was threatened. She decided to come to Canada and arrived in XXXX 2018. She signed her BOC form and initiated her claim for refugee protection in June 2022.\n\nDETERMINATION\n\n[4] I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee as per s. 96 of IRPA, as she has established a serious possibility of persecution if she were to return to Mexico.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nIdentity\n\n[5] I find that the personal identity of the claimant and her identity as a national of Mexico have been established through her testimony and the copy of her passport in evidence,[4] along with a copy of her Mexican birth certificate.[5]\n\nNexus\n\n[6] I find that the allegations establish a nexus to a Convention ground for the claimant, specifically membership in a particular social group as a woman facing gender-related violence due to her allegations of threats from the cartel members to force her into prostitution for their benefit and to rape her if she does not comply. I acknowledge that a significant fear of the claimant\u2019s is murder and forced work for the cartel for losing them money, going against them by reporting to police and helping their kidnapped woman escape, and not complying to their demands. Despite no allegations of previous gender-based violence, I find it necessary, in light of the intersectional approach outlined in the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 4,[6] to account for the content of these men\u2019s threats which include a gender-based element\u2014forced prostitution and rape. Considering the nature of the claimant\u2019s allegations, including statements made by the cartel that she would have to take the place of the kidnapped woman whom they had taken for forced prostitution, along with the objective evidence outlined below, which I find demonstrates a heightened risk for women in Mexico of gender-based violence and femicide, especially women in contact with authorities and women targeted by cartels, and a general patriarchal attitude throughout the country, I find that the claimant has sufficiently established that she has been and would be targeted due to her gender, and the harm she fears from the alleged threats involves gender-based violence. For this reason, her claim will be analyzed under s. 96 of IRPA.\n\nCredibility\n\n[7] A claimant\u2019s sworn testimony is presumed truthful unless there are reasons to doubt the veracity of their allegations.[7] In this case, the claimant\u2019s testimony was candid, straightforward, emotional, and appeared genuine. The claimant was visibly anxious, fearful, and upset, and spoke throughout the hearing about the impact the alleged events had on her mental health, including periods of XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX, which in turn impacted her ability to think clearly when making decisions regarding her safety, such as a failure to change her telephone number in Mexico after months of receiving threatening phone calls or her willingness to remain in Canada beyond the validity of her immigration status without making efforts to legalize her status. While the claimant did not provide medical documentation or a psychological assessment in evidence, I find that the claimant\u2019s allegations regarding her mental health have been credibly established through her testimony and the supporting letters provided at exhibit 4. Consideration of her mental health and trauma response will be discussed further below in my assessment of her subjective fear. Overall, I find the claimant\u2019s testimony to be consistent with a traumatized claimant\u2019s experience while testifying to traumatic events as outlined in the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 4.[8]\n\n[8] I find that the claimant\u2019s testimony captured the full knowledge she had about the profile of her agents of persecution\u2014various unknown men who have identified themselves to her as CJNG cartel members and who are associated with an original group of 11 men who had come to the XXXX where she worked and were identified to her as members of the CJNG cartel by the kidnapped young woman. She was credible in her testimony that she did not know them on a personal level, including their names or details of their connections or positions in the cartel. I find that the claimant did not attempt to embellish her testimony nor enhance the favourability of her claim, despite opportunity to do so. The claimant\u2019s testimony was generally consistent with the information provided in her BOC form and narrative, and I find that there were no material inconsistencies in her testimony. Overall, I find the claimant to be a credible witness regarding the material facts established below.\n\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution\n\nFindings of fact\n\n[9] The claimant provided supporting documents at exhibit 4, and I find no reason to doubt the genuine nature of these documents and give them full weight in establishing the facts outlined below. All letters provided by the claimant are signed and accompanied by respective identification documents. I find that these documents and the claimant\u2019s testimony corroborate her allegations as follows:\n\n\u00b7 The claimant testified that in XXXX 2018 she was working at a XXXX as a XXXX when she encountered a group of 11 men with a scared young woman. She testified that she spoke with another XXXX about the young woman\u2019s behaviour, as the young woman would not lift her gaze and appeared sad and manipulated, and they believed it was strange that this woman was at a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX with these 11 men. She testified that when the young woman went to the washroom accompanied by one of these men, the claimant entered the washroom and the young woman became desperate, begging for help and saying she had been kidnapped. The claimant stated that she did not have any doubt about helping the woman escape, that it happened very quickly, and they exited the XXXX together through a back window of the bathroom. The claimant testified that she drove the woman as requested to the bus terminal about 25 minutes away from the XXXX, and during this drive the woman told the claimant that she had gone to meet her boyfriend, but her boyfriend did not show up and the cartel members did instead, taking her and telling her that she was going to pay them for what her boyfriend owed them. The claimant\u2019s testimony is consistent with her documentary evidence, which includes a pay slip and photograph of a name tag from a XXXX consistent with the name of that identified in her testimony, along with letters from her mother, aunt, uncle, and two friends speaking of their knowledge of the claimant\u2019s assistance to this young woman. I find that the claimant has credibly established the abovementioned facts of this incident;\n\n\u00b7 The claimant testified that the young woman told her directly that these men were members of the CJNG cartel. While they did not have any identifying features as members of this cartel, they appeared rough, and their clothing appeared as if they were carrying weapons. Further, the trucks they were driving called attention, as they were black and polarized. She stated that when she received threatening phone calls from many different men between the time of this incident and when she left Mexico in XXXX 2018, the men would identify themselves verbally as members of the CJNG cartel. I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant has credibly established that these men are members of the CJNG cartel;\n\n\u00b7 The claimant testified that when she arrived back at her home, she parked her car and was walking to her front door when she saw a pick-up truck parked a few houses away from hers, so she immediately returned to her vehicle and attempted to flee as quickly as possible. One of the men approached her quickly and tried to open her car door, then he shot at her and broke the back and side windows of her vehicle. While she did not recognize his face, she recognized his vehicle and his way of dressing as similar to the men at the restaurant she had encountered earlier. The claimant provided a letter from her friend corroborating that she was told by the claimant details of this incident immediately after it occurred. I find that the claimant has credibly established the facts of this incident;\n\n\u00b7 The claimant testified that she attempted to file a police report on two occasions, and on both occasions received threatening phone calls immediately after leaving the station from men identifying themselves as members of the CJNG cartel and stating that they knew she was reporting to police. Further, she stated that she received phone calls from these men after she went to the clinic and each time she moved to a different address, each time stating that they knew where she was and identifying her location. The claimant has provided letters from a friend and her Mexican lawyer corroborating her attempts to file a police report, along with letters from a friend and her mother corroborating that the cartel continually knew the claimant\u2019s location in Mexico. I find that the claimant has credibly established the abovementioned facts;\n\n\u00b7 The claimant testified that immediately after she left the police station when she first attempted to report and received the first threatening phone call, she relocated to her best friend\u2019s home in Ciudad Guzman\u2014a city 30 minutes away from where she had been living in Zapotlan\u2014and she stayed there for 3 months. She then relocated to her aunt\u2019s home in Ciudad Guzman for one month, and later to another friend\u2019s home in Ciudad Guzman where she stayed until she came to Canada in XXXX 2018. There are letters from her two friends and her aunt corroborating that the claimant stayed in their homes during the time periods testified by the claimant. I find that the claimant has credibly established that she moved cities and moved homes 3 times in Mexico;\n\n\u00b7 The claimant testified that after the first threatening phone call she received in XXXX 2018, she continued to receive threatening phone calls until she left Mexico in XXXX 2018. She stated that at the start, she would answer these phone calls, but then she stopped answering them. These phone calls were made by different men, as identified by the claimant through different voices, all stating that they were with the CJNG cartel and they do not forget. The men stated that she made them lose a lot of money, she will work for them no matter what or they will kill her, that they will torture her, that they would rape her, that they would cover her in acid, and that they were going to prostitute or pimp her. She stated that she did not change her telephone number until she arrived in Canada, as she was in a bad mental state at that time and \u201cher head was not helping her\u201d so she never thought of changing her phone number. She stated that the men calling her did not ever inform her of how they had obtained her phone number, address, or location, and she believed they had the power to find out any information about her. I have applied the guidance offered in the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 4 at section 7.7 that states \u201cthe assessment of whether an explanation is reasonable is contextual\u201d and at section 5.1 that states \u201ctrauma may completely overwhelm an individual\u2019s ability to cope with, or integrate the ideas and emotions involved in that experience\u2026and can elicit intense feelings of fear, terror, helplessness, hopelessness, and despair\u201d. In light of the claimant\u2019s description of her mental health during this time and her limited capacity to cope with the threat she was facing, including a belief that she was helpless against these men\u2019s ability to find out information about her, I find that the claimant\u2019s failure to change her phone number is not indicative of a lack of subjective fear, as she was taking alternative actions to protect herself to her capacity, including moving homes each time she believed these men knew her location, attempting to seek state protection on two occasions, and stopping answering these phone calls when she knew they were from these men. I find that the claimant has credibly established the content of the threats she was receiving, and that she was receiving them from XXXX-XXXX 2018 via telephone;\n\n\u00b7 The claimant testified that she hired a lawyer she had heard about from family and friends to save her life in XXXX 2018. He had agreed to conduct an investigation for her, which was continued when the claimant was in Canada. I find that the letter in evidence from the lawyer corroborates this allegation which I find has been credibly established;\n\n\u00b7 The claimant testified that she decided to leave Mexico because she had tried to keep her mother at a distance from these threats, but in XXXX 2018 her mother began receiving threatening phone calls from these men and the claimant believed if she left the country until the men forgot about her, her family would be safer. Since being in Canada, these men have continued speaking with her aunt, her mother, and her neighbours, and they have gone to the places that she lived, but she has not personally had any communication with these men. While these men threaten to harm the claimant and demand to know her whereabouts when speaking with these individuals, the threats are always directed towards the claimant and they have not threatened or harmed her family, friends, or neighbours personally. She stated that the last time she heard that these men were looking for her was in XXXX 2022 when her aunt was approached at her home by men who stated that they knew the claimant was out of the country, asked where she was, and stated that they were from the CJNG and they never forget. Letters from the claimant\u2019s mother, aunt, neighbours, uncle, and lawyer in evidence all corroborate these allegations and speak of their experiences of being approached and threatened by these men. I find that the claimant has credibly established that these CJNG men have contacted her family, friends, neighbours, and lawyers looking for her since she has arrived in Canada, as recently as XXXX 2022.\n\nFailure to claim protection and delay in claiming protection in Canada\n\n[10] The claimant testified that she has travelled extensively to countries in North America, Europe, and Africa, with her most recent travel being in 2017. She stated that at the time of these travels, she did not have any fear of returning to Mexico. I find that, since the incident from which the claimant\u2019s fear arises began in XXXX 2018, there is no negative inference to be drawn regarding her subjective fear for failing to claim refugee protection in any of these countries, as the claimant was not at risk in Mexico at this time.\n\n[11] The claimant travelled to Canada in XXXX 2018 and she signed her BOC form in July 2022. She entered Canada on a visitor\u2019s visa that provided her with legal visitor status until XXXX 2019. She stated that she made the decision to find a way to remain in Canada in XXXX 2021 after she received a letter from her Mexican lawyer stating that he could no longer assist her, that there was nothing to be done for her protection in Mexico, that he could not obtain copies of the police reports she attempted to file, and that he had to close his office in Ciudad Guzman due to threats from the CJNG cartel in relation to the claimant. A copy of this letter is provided at exhibit 4. She stated that this news deeply impacted her mental health and she could not do anything for a few months because of her XXXX and XXXX. Once she felt capable of taking action, it took time to get an appointment with a lawyer, especially a lawyer she felt comfortable talking to in her language. She found her lawyer in XXXX 2022, at which time she learned about refugee protection.\n\n[12] She stated that from the time her immigration status expired in XXXX 2018 until she received this letter from her lawyer in XXXX 2021, she was waiting to hear news from her lawyer that she could return to Mexico. She stated that her intention when she came to Canada was not to leave her family, friends, and country permanently, and she did not wish to stay in Canada, so she did not ever apply to extend her status or seek options of how to stay in Canada. She did not know about refugee protection until she met her current lawyer in XXXX 2022, and when she arrived in Canada she was XXXX and trying to survive from churches and food banks. While I find that a willingness to remain in Canada without legal immigration status for over 3 years without seeking options or filing an application to legalize her status is negligent, I also refer to guidance from Guideline 4 which states at section 4.4 that an incorrect assumption members should avoid when assessing claims involving gender-based violence is that \u201conce in Canada, a person who has experienced gender-based violence will automatically seek out counselling or assistance in overcoming trauma\u201d. I have considered the claimant\u2019s mental health, her belief that her Mexican lawyer would help her find a way to safely return to Mexico, and her struggles to survive in Canada during this period. Furthermore, I note that the RPD\u2019s assessment of persecution is forward-facing, and as outlined below, I have found that the totality of the evidence credibly establishes forward-facing persecution. I, therefore, do not draw a negative inference regarding the claimant\u2019s forward-facing subjective fear from her delay in claiming protection in Canada after entering in XXXX 2018.\n\nConclusions on subjective fear\n\n[13] Based on all the evidence before me, I find that the claimant has established a subjective fear of persecution from members of the CJNG cartel if she were to return to Mexico.\n\nObjective basis\n\n[14] According to the objective evidence in the National Documentation Package (NDP) for Mexico, last updated September 29, 2022,[9] cartel and gang violence are serious problems throughout Mexico. Freedom House reports in 2022 that Mexicans are subject to the threat of violence at the hands of multiple actors, including individual criminals, criminal gangs that operate with impunity, and police officers who are often susceptible to bribery.[10] NDP item 7.8 states that criminal violence has become highly intense, diversified, and popularized over the past two decades in Mexico, with widespread violence and ungovernability affecting almost all Mexican states. A missing-persons registry\u2014which continues to grow despite increased government efforts in recent years\u2014reflects an epidemic of enforced disappearances.[11]\n\n[15] It is objectively well-established that a high percentage of police officers in Mexico work in partnership with criminal organizations,[12] and that the CJNG is the leading cartel in Mexico, \u201cthe \u2018only cartel\u2019 with a national presence\u201d, and that it has the \u201c\u2018most operational capacity\u2019 in the country\u201d.[13] NDP item 7.12 states that although the CJNG has suffered some setbacks due to internal divisions and splintering, the group has maintained its dominance and continues expanding. NDP item 7.18 states that the CJNG operates in 27 states and has alliances with other cartels. The Government of Mexico considers the CJNG to be a consolidated, well-organized criminal group with solid financial networks and diverse criminal activities with a supranational presence through its own presence or through allies in most of the country\u2019s states. InSight Crime reports that the CJNG is \u201ctruly the dominant criminal actor\u201d in Jalisco, Nayarit, Colima, Veracruz, Guanajuato, Puebla, Quer\u00e9taro, Hidalgo, and the L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas port in Michoac\u00e1n.[14] This source also identifies that the CJNG extorts individuals and uses \u201cextreme violence\u201d and bribes to steadily expand control of the drug trade.[15]\n\n[16] Drug cartels such as the CJNG engage in extreme forms of violence as a means of maintaining power, such as displaying dead and mutilated bodies to terrorize the public and ensure compliance with their demands.[16] Further, \u201cthose who betray or steal from the cartel are dehumanized and portrayed as \u2018rats\u2019 who must pay with a gruesome death for their betrayal\u201d; examples of what they consider to be betrayal include reporting the cartel to police or failing to pay a bribe or quota.[17] NDP item 7.15 states that motivations for cartels to track people throughout Mexico include a personal vendetta or a large debt. The claimant\u2019s credible testimony has established that the CJNG members have directly told her that they will make her pay for the debt she owes them and for reporting to police.\n\n[17] The Mexican NDP also indicates high levels of violence against women, widespread patriarchal attitudes about women, rising rates of femicide, and mistreatment of women by police officers.[18] The rate of femicides in Mexico had increased by 137 percent over the last five years, while homicides have comparatively increased by 35 percent over the same periods.[19] Sources indicate that the number of femicides committed by organized crime groups is \u201con the rise\u201d with some analyses indicating that 63 percent of femicides reported in March and April 2020 were connected to organized crime.[20]\n\nConclusions on well-founded fear of persecution\n\n[18] Based on the totality of the evidence, I find that the claimant has established a well-founded fear of persecution if she were to return to Mexico.\n\nState Protection\n\n[19] Except in situations of complete breakdown of the state apparatus, the state is presumed to be capable of protecting its citizens unless there is clear and convincing evidence to the contrary. I find that the claimant has rebutted this presumption, as her testimony and the objective evidence demonstrate that the state will not provide her with adequate protection.\n\n[20] The claimant went straight to the police station in Zapotlan when the cartel members shot at her vehicle in XXXX 2018. She stayed at the station for 2-3 hours, the police wrote down her statement, and they told her because there was a staff turnover, there was no one available to help her at the time so she should come back the following day. They did not offer her any protection at that time, and when she left, she was immediately contacted on her phone by the CJNG men. She did not return to the station the next day, as she believed the police had given the CJNG men her information and told them she had filed a report, and she immediately went to live with her friend in Ciudad Guzman. In XXXX 2018 she attempted to file an addendum to her initial report at the same police station, as there were many updates she wished to report, such as the harassing phone calls and threats she and her mother had received. She stated that no one would assist her and they kept telling her to wait. She eventually filed her addendum with the police, but no one helped her further. She was told to go home and that they would call her to return for further assistance, but she never received any call from them. They did not provide her with a copy of the report on either occasion. As she had obtained a lawyer at this time, she did not follow up on the reports again, as the lawyer had attempted to obtain copies of the report and stated that he was unable to do so. This allegation is corroborated by the lawyer\u2019s letter at exhibit 4, which states that he believes the police did not ever file the reports due to interference from CJNG associates. While the claimant did not have any knowledge of why the lawyer believes that these reports were not filed or why he believed this was the result of CJNG interference, she credibly established that she did not receive copies of these reports, follow-up from police as stated, nor protection from police.\n\n[21] NDP item 7.18 states that \u201cvarious police forces in Mexico\u2026lack human and material resources in order to properly investigate crimes\u201d. This item also states that \u201c93.2 percent of all crimes committed were either not reported or not investigated\u201d with a large amount of blame placed on police, as citizens saw reporting as \u201ca waste of time\u201d, they had a \u201clack of trust in authorities\u201d, there were \u201cdifficulties and a [long reporting] process\u201d, authorities had a \u201chostile attitude\u201d, and they feared \u201cbeing victims of extortion\u201d.[21]\n\n[22] More than half of Mexican citizens saw both police and the Attorney General\u2019s office as corrupt.[22] According to the BTI 2020 \u201c[a]s a consequence of impunity and the fact that official forces are in many cases involved in criminal acts, people who are victims of crime rarely report the crime to the police. People are afraid that as the police may be involved, they will be victimized again or because they feel it is useless\u201d.[23] NDP item 10.2 outlines a high risk of police corruption in Mexico, that \u201ccorruption\u2026underpins state collusion with criminals\u201d, and that in most Mexican states, local police \u201chave been infiltrated by organized crime\u201d. This source states that this includes police at all levels\u2014federal, state, and local\u2014and that entire police forces have been disbanded, suspended, or arrested due to the penetration of organized crime and corruption. Due to this reality, there is no trust between police forces, and this leads to a lack of communication between different levels of security forces due to the infiltration of drug cartels.[24] Police forces are often paid bribes by cartels and are known to have participated in kidnappings and murders for cartels.[25] When violent crimes are reported, according to NDP item 7.18, \u201cif a victim or their family does not pay for the police investigators\u2019 expenses, no arrest will be made\u201d.\n\n[23] NDP item 10.2 states that there have been national anti-corruption measures taken, with bodies under the National Anti-Corruption System created for civilians to report corruption at the municipal, state, and federal levels. However, this source also indicates that despite passing the law governing these bodies in 2016, as of 2018 \u201cseveral important aspects\u201d had not been implemented and systems were not yet in place. Further, despite the ability to report corruption to the National Human Rights Commission, citizens were highly unlikely to report due to fear of reprisals and a belief that it was a waste of time.[26] In the unlikely instance that the claimant was to report to higher authorities that were willing to take her report, she could become involved in a court case or be at heightened risk of reprisals, and the NDP evidence indicates that the witness protection program in Mexico \u201cdid not provide protective measures to all the witnesses and other individuals implicated in criminal trials\u201d, that it does not guarantee sufficient protection, and that it was recently scaled back, leaving many individuals without protection despite the continued expectation for them to testify against cartel members or corrupt authorities.[27]\n\n[24] Compounding the above, the country condition documents indicate that laws addressing violence against women are not effectively enforced. When discussing police treatment of women, item 5.5 states that \u201cin a context where social constructs are based on a predominantly patriarchal culture, women\u2026face particular discrimination simply because they do not have a male partner. Women in Mexico are expected to have a male partner; if they do not, this is seen as suspicious\u201d. Sources indicate that there has been \u201csystemic impunity\u201d in terms of how gender-based violence is addressed, and note the \u201ccomplicity, indifference, and mismanagement of cases\u201d involving violence against women. The United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women, amongst other sources, has emphasized that there are \u201cdeep-rooted institutional, structural and practical barriers\u201d which continue to hinder access to justice for women, including that officials within the criminal justice system, including law enforcement officers, hold \u201cdiscriminatory stereotypes\u201d and \u201climited knowledge\u201d of women\u2019s rights.[28]\n\n[25] I have considered the country conditions noted above, that the agents of persecution are members of the CJNG cartel, and the claimant\u2019s testimony that she did not receive any protection after two attempts to report to police, that copies of her reports could not be obtained by the lawyer, and that exposing herself by reporting to police increased the threats she was receiving from the agents of persecution. I find that state protection is inadequate at an operational level and that it would not be forthcoming to the claimant in her circumstances.\n\nInternal Flight Alternative\n\n[26] For an internal flight alternative (or IFA) to be viable, it must satisfy both prongs of a two-prong test on a balance of probabilities. I must assess whether there is another location in Mexico in which the claimant would not face a serious possibility of persecution or a risk of harm, and whether it would be reasonable to expect her to move there.[29] At the start of the hearing, Mexico City, Merida, and Oaxaca were proposed as potential IFA locations.\n\nMotivation\n\n[27] As established above, the CJNG men directly identified the motivation for finding and harming the claimant as a large debt owed to them, of betraying them, of the claimant having to take the place of the woman she helped escape, and of reporting to police; these were outlined in the objective evidence as known reasons for the CJNG to track an individual throughout Mexico and are personal in nature. The claimant credibly established that the CJNG men continued to harass her through phone calls from XXXX 2018 until she left Mexico in XXXX 2018, and they continued to track her movement and location, which they accurately informed her of on these phone calls. Further, the claimant credibly established above that since being in Canada, her family members, friends, neighbours, and lawyer continued to see unknown men around her home and the homes of the individuals she stayed with in Mexico when hiding, to be asked about the claimant and her whereabouts, to be informed that the CJNG men knew the claimant was outside of Mexico, and to receive threatening phone calls about the claimant, as recently, to the claimant\u2019s knowledge, as XXXX 2022.\n\n[28] Based on the totality of the evidence relating to the claimant\u2019s profile, the incidents that sparked the CJNG members\u2019 motivation to find and harm the claimant, the serious nature of the threats against her, and these men\u2019s demonstrated persistence in knowing her location 5 years after the initial incident, including contacting her continually when she was in Mexico, threatening her friends and family, and going to her home and the homes of her family members, I find that it has been established that there is an ongoing motivation to find and harm the claimant. For the totality of these reasons, I find that there is a serious possibility that the CJNG men would be motivated to find and harm the claimant anywhere in Mexico.\n\nMeans\n\n[29] The claimant testified that the moment she lands in Mexico, whether that is in any of the IFA cities or elsewhere, these men from the CJNG will know. Further, she fears with that any service she would access such as a hospital or clinic or government service, she would be registered in a system, and because these men know her name, they would be able to find her. She stated that she does not know more about a central registration system in Mexico, but she believes these men have access to information due to the history of them obtaining her and her family\u2019s phone numbers, finding out information about the lawyer that was helping her, knowing when she was at the police station and medical clinics previously, and where she was living each time she moved.\n\n[30] NDP item 3.5 confirms that personal information, including an individual\u2019s address, is included within the electoral database when an individual obtains a voter ID card, which is considered to be the national identity document and the most popular identification card in Mexico.[30] Further, individuals part of the electoral registry are obligated to report any changes of address to their local registry office within 30 days of their move.[31] While legally this information is contained within a confidential database accessible by only the electoral committee and political parties for election purposes, NDP item 3.5 states that this information can be readily obtained through bribes, through purchase on the black market, or online leaks. I find that, as outlined above, the level of corruption between varying levels of authorities in Mexico, as well as, as outlined below, the information accessible to cartels through their networks supports the claimant\u2019s allegations that these CJNG men could have access to her personal information, such as her address, through a national database system like the electoral registry.\n\n[31] NDP item 7.8 states that \u201cif a criminal group has \u2018very strong motivation to find and retaliate against a certain person,\u2019 \u2018especially if the criminal group were one of the more powerful groups in Mexico\u2019 and\/or \u2018a group with indications of having cooperation from relevant authorities,\u2019 then \u2018[the ability to track or retaliate against a certain person] would be a reasonable concern to have\u2019\u201d. This source also states that if organized crime groups in other parts of Mexico are interested and willing to retaliate against people relocated in Merida, Campeche, Cabo San Lucas or Mexico City, they could do it easily.[1] An RIR at item 7.15 indicates that, \u201ccartels use family networks and private investigators to track people, as well as property records in the US and Mexico and placing GPS trackers on cars.\u201d A source in this RIR also stated that \u201ca personal vendetta could motivate a gang to track someone outside their area, and that gangs can use \u2018corrupt law enforcement agents\u2019 to obtain information about people they pursue\u201d.[2] Item 7.8 states that \u201ccriminal groups use phone and cellphone companies\u201d and that they may bribe these companies to track phone accounts, messages, and social networks of relatives to find targeted individuals in hiding. Further, it is reported that \u201ccorrupt Mexican officials have helped drug cartels acquire spyware \u2018which can be used to hack mobile phones\u2019\u201d.[3] I find that the history of these men finding out information about the claimant, her family, and her associates, their profiles as members of the CJNG, and the objective evidence outlined above establish that these men would have the means to find the claimant in the IFA locations or anywhere in Mexico.\n\n[32] As I have found that these men from the CJNG cartel have the motivation and means to find the claimant throughout Mexico, and it is therefore not safe for the claimant to return anywhere in Mexico, including the proposed IFAs, there is no need to consider whether her relocation to an IFA location would be reasonable. I find that the claimant would face a serious possibility of persecution throughout Mexico.\n\n[33] Based on the information before me, I find that the claimant does not have a viable IFA in Mexico.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[34] I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee and accept her claim.\n\n(signed) Robert Cox\n\nDecember 28, 2023\n\n[1] Exhibit 3, item 7.8.\n[2] Exhibit 3, item 7.15.\n[3] Exhibit 3, item 7.8.\n\n[1] Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n\n[2] Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (IRB) Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 4: Gender Considerations in Proceedings before the Immigration and Refugee Board, updated July 18, 2022.\n\n[3] Exhibit 2.\n\n[4] Exhibit 1.\n\n[5] Ibid.\n\n[6] Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 4, section 6.

XXXX seeks refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).[1]\n\nALLEGATIONS\n\n[2] The allegations are set out in XXXX\u2019s Basis of Claim Form (BOC)[2], which may be summarized as follows. XXXX is originally from Mexico City, Mexico, has a university education in XXXX XXXX and has worked and taught within the same field for the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and for private enterprises. XXXX identifies with the LGBTQ2+ community and alleges fears of personal harm or even death from the Mexican society because of XXXX\u2019s sexual orientation. XXXX alleges inhumane harassment, discrimination, and threats because of XXXX\u2019s LGBTQ2+ identity. According to XXXX\u2019s narrative, XXXX has been the subject of ridicule and psychological and physical abuse since attending high school which continued into XXXX\u2019s adulthood. The discrimination, ridicule and psychological abuse eventually led XXXX to resign from the XXXX; however, XXXX alleges that the XXXX fraudulently kept XXXX\u2019s name on its employment and pay records, kept XXXX from receiving any benefits (including the income) and threatened XXXX with further harm if XXXX attempted to dispute, report, or denounce the XXXX\u2019s corrupt and fraudulent actions. Fearful of the XXXX\u2019s threats and actions, XXXX decided to leave Mexico.\n\n[3] The immigration documents which form part of XXXX\u2019s application for refugee protection demonstrate that XXXX flew from Mexico to Montreal, Quebec, Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2023, and then applied for refugee protection from Canada on May 1, 2023.\n\nDETERMINATION\n\n[4] Having considered all the evidence, the panel finds that XXXX has established a well-founded fear of persecution throughout Mexico under s. 96 of the Convention based on XXXX\u2019s sexual orientation and identity within the LGBTQ2+ community.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nIdentity\n\n[5] XXXX\u2019s personal and national identity as a citizen of Mexico has been established by a certified true copy of XXXX\u2019s Mexican passport.[3]\n\nNexus\n\n[6] XXXX has alleged and established a nexus to the Convention ground of particular social group based on XXXX\u2019s sexual orientation and identity within the LGBTQ2+ community. As such, the panel has assessed XXXX\u2019s claim pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA.\n\nCredibility\n\n[7] The process of determining whether a claimant is a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection under the IRPA requires the panel to decide whether they believe the claimant\u2019s evidence and how much weight to give that evidence. In determining this, the panel must assess the credibility of the claimant and the documentary evidence. The law imposes a duty upon RPD members to assess the credibility of refugee claimants.\n\n[8] Maldonado established the principle that claimants benefit from the presumption that their allegations are true. In this case, the panel did not find any reason to doubt the truthfulness of the claimant\u2019s allegations. The claimant\u2019s narrative and BOC are detailed and consistent with the supporting documentation and the country evidence before the panel.\n\n[9] XXXX submitted over 260 pages of detailed documents. Based on the evidence, the panel accepts the XXXX\u2019s allegations as they are set out in the original and updated narrative which form part of XXXX\u2019s application for refugee protection and as they were confirmed by XXXX\u2019s genuine and sincere oral testimony. The panel finds that XXXX has completely, sincerely, and genuinely demonstrated a membership within the LGBTQ2+ community and that said membership has led to XXXX being victimized by and suffering enduring persecution at the hands of the XXXX XXXX and Mexican society in general. The panel further finds that XXXX has been targeted and pursued by the XXXX XXXX and the Mexican society for reasons related to nothing else other than XXXX\u2019s sexual orientation and XXXX\u2019s membership in the particular LGBTQ2+ social community.\n\n[10] Given the foregoing, the panel finds that XXXX\u2019s allegations of persecution and subjective fear have been established on a balance of probabilities.\n\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution\n\n[11] Having considered the claimant\u2019s documentary evidence coupled with the objective evidence set out below, the panel finds the claimant has established a prospective risk and an objective basis for a fear of persecution in Mexico. The Panel considered the country conditions in Mexico for members of sexual minorities as depicted in the most recent National Documentation Package (NDP) for Mexico[4]. The Panel notes that conservative attitudes prevail in Mexico and public displays of affection between couples of diverse sexual orientations are not considered socially acceptable as noted in item 6.1 and item 6.2 of the National Documentation Package, NDP, for Mexico.[5] The DOS report provides that the government did not always investigate and punish those complicit in abuses\u201d against LGBTQ individuals, \u201cespecially outside of Mexico City\u201d. Discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity was prevalent, despite a gradual increase in public tolerance of LGBTQ individuals. According to public opinion surveys, 72 percent of individuals 18 years of age and older feel that the rights of transgender individuals are \u201clittle or not at all respected\u201d in Mexico, while 66 percent feel that the rights of gay or lesbian individuals are \u201clittle or not at all respected.\u201d At the national level, 64.4 percent of individuals aged 18 years or older feel that there is \u201clittle or no justification for two people of the same sex to live as a couple,\u201d while in Mexico City, Nuevo L\u00e9on, and Yucat\u00e1n the figures are 40.5, 72.2, and 64.3 percent, respectively. Letra S, in its annual report for 2020 on the violent deaths of LGBTQ+ individuals, provides that, in 2020, \u201cat least\u201d 79 LGBTQ+ individuals were killed in Mexico. The same source notes that this represents a 32 percent decrease in the number of LGBTQ+ individuals killed compared to 2019, with Veracruz and Chihuahua at the top of the list Treatment of individuals based on their sexual orientation, gender identity and expression having the highest number of LGBTQ+ homicides. However, the same source notes that the decrease is \u201cin line\u201d with a general reported decrease in homicides in 2020 compared to 2019, and that decrease is owed more to the social impact of the COVID-19 pandemic than to the implementation of public crime prevention and law enforcement policies.\n\n[12] Document 6.5 of the NDP provides that the CEAV, Executive Commission of Attention to Victims, and Fundaci\u00f3n Arcoiris report, trans women and homosexuals represent the group most affected by hate motivated physical assaults. Furthermore, the RIR provides the following information. Between January 2014 and December 2016, 202 sexual minorities or persons perceived as such, were killed because of their sexual orientation or gender identity or expression, including 108 trans women, 93 gay men, and one lesbian woman. The highest number of victims, 76, was recorded in 2016. Of the total 202 victims, 33 showed signs of torture, while 15 showed signs of sexual violence. 17 cases were investigated as hate crimes, while 20 were investigated as a crime of passion. 64 people were accused as perpetrators. The states with the highest number of killings are Veracruz, 22 murders, the State of Mexico, 15 murders, Quintana Roo, 15 murders, and Chihuahua, 14 murders. There were eight murders presumably motivated by hate or prejudice in Mexico City, two in 2014, one in 2015, and five in 2016. In the first quarter of 2017, 20 killings of sexual minorities were registered, including six gay men, one bisexual man, and 13 trans women.\n\n[13] The documentary evidence indicates that the claimant\u2019s fear of persecution for reasons of sexual orientation is objectively well-founded.\n\nSTATE PROTECTION\n\n[14] States are presumed to be capable of protecting their own citizens; however, this presumption is rebuttable with clear and convincing evidence to the contrary. Document 6.4 of the NDP provides that \u201c[a]ccording to the CEAV and Fundaci\u00f3n Arcoiris report, there are high levels of distrust in authorities.\u201d According to The Guardian, \u2018rights for gay people are still treated as exceptions to be granted at the discretion of local officials.\u201d\n\n[15] The same RIR also notes: According to the US Country Reports 2016, \u201c[c]ivil society groups claimed that police routinely subjected LGBTI persons to mistreatment while in custody.\u201d The CEAV and Fundaci\u00f3n Arcoiris report indicates that at least one out of 10 people surveyed has been detained, and that abuse during detention was evident, including physical violence, arbitrary detention, and due process violations. According to the report by the Transgender Law Center and Cornell University Law School LGBT Clinic, \u201c[p]olice harassment against the LGBTQ community remains high in Mexico City.\u201d The 2016 CEAV and Fundacion Arcoiris report indicates that out of 425 persons interviewed, 139 reported some form of abuse by authorities, including delays or refusal to provide services as well as insults and violence.\n\n[16] The objective evidence further provides that, in 2014, the Supreme Court of Justice of Mexico issued a non-binding protocol for judges on the adjudication of cases involving sexual minorities. The protocol provides tools to assist judges to identify and eliminate stereotypes and social misconceptions during the decision-making process and ensure access to justice for sexual minorities. Sources indicate that despite special procedures and policies of institutions to protect sexual minorities, in practice, these policies and procedures do not effectively or necessarily protect them. According to sources, the judicial system is not effective in investigating crimes committed against sexual minorities. The Researcher stated that: \u201cif someone has been threatened by a gang, [they] can file a complaint with the Judicial Authorities but that doesn\u2019t translate into any special protection unless [they] have already been victim of a crime and they [have been] threatened\u2026again. This is particularly problematic for LGBTQ persons who are at risk\u201d.\n\n[17] The 2016 CEAV and Fundaci\u00f3n Arcoiris report indicates that there are low levels of\nreporting crimes. The Researcher stated that less than ten percent of crimes committed in Mexico\nare solved, \u201cand in the case of homophobic crimes, even people who are found guilty are set\nfree.\u201d According to the US Country Reports 2016, \u201cthere were reports that the government did\nnot always investigate and punish those complicit in abuses [against sexual minorities], especially outside Mexico City\u2026\u201d\n\n[18] Furthermore, there is evidence that state actors have been and continue to be involved in\nforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings, adding to the reasons why LGBTQ persons\nwould fear even approaching the state for protection.\n\n[19] The panel finds that the claimant\u2019s testimony and the objective evidence demonstrate that adequate state protection would not be available to the claimant in Mexico.\n\nINTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE (IFA)\n\n[20] Given that the XXXX XXXX, state actor, has been identified as the agent of persecution and that the Mexican society has been identified as being conservative a state which is unaccepting of diversity vis-\u00e0-vis an individual\u2019s sexual orientation, the panel finds that the claimant will face a serious possibility of persecution throughout Mexico. Accordingly, the panel finds that there is no viable IFA for the claimant.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[21] Based on the totality of the evidence, the panel finds that the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA. As such, the claim for refugee protection is accepted.\n\n(signed) Robert Cox\n\nDecember 28, 2023\n\n[1] Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (S.C. 2001, c. 27)\n\n[2] Exhibit 2, Basis of Claim (BOC) Form TC3-46740, originally signed on May 1, 2023, then signed a second time August 11, 2023.\n\n[3] Claims referral information from CBSA\/IRCC.\n\n[4] National Documentation Package (NDP) for Mexico, September 29, 2023\n\n[5] Ibid.\n\n",

The claimant is a citizen of Mexico, claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n\nALLEGATIONS\n\n[3] The details of the claimant\u2019s allegations are fully set out in the claimant\u2019s Basis of Claim form narrative. In short, the claimant alleges that she fears for her life and her safety by her abusive ex-husband, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, if she is to return to Mexico.\n\nDETERMINATION\n\n[4] Having considered the totality of the evidence, the Panel finds that the claimant has satisfied the burden of establishing a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground, based on her membership in a particular social group, as a woman who is a victim of domestic violence or gender-based violence.\n\n[5] In fact, the Convention refugee grounds of membership in a particular social group set out in section 96 of the IRPA, and the refugee Convention, includes individuals fearing gender-based persecution.\n\n[6] In deciding this claim. The Panel has taken into consideration and applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 4, gender considerations in proceedings before the Immigration and Refugee Board.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nIdentity\n\n[7] With respect to the issue of identity, the claimant\u2019s identity has been established on a balance of probabilities through a passport issued by the United States of Mexico, copy of which was provided to the Board.\n\nCredibility\n\n[8] When a claimant affirms to tell the truth, this creates a presumption of truthfulness, unless there is evidence to the contrary. In this case, the claimant has been consistent and straightforward in her testimony. She has provided spontaneous details in support of her allegations.\n\n[9] Further, the claimant\u2019s testimony was consistent with her Basis of Claim form and the evidence she provided to the Board. The Panel finds the claimant to be a credible witness, and therefore believes what she has alleged in support of her claim.\n\n[10] Based on the credible testimony and overall evidence, the Panel makes the following findings of fact.\n\n[11] The claimant met her husband in 2011. Since the beginning, the claimant\u2019s husband\u2019s behaviour toward the claimant was violent and abusive. The claimant wrote in intricate detail multiple abuse situations she had endured from her husband in her narrative. Despite the abuse, the couple got married in XXXX 2018.\n\n[12] After the marriage, the abuse continued and worsened. In 2020, the abuse started getting physical.\n\n[13] Since 2019, XXXX was working as the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Queretaro. Hence, he has a lot of political connections, and connections with the state authorities.\n\n[14] On XXXX XXXX, 2021, the claimant and her husband arrived in Montreal, Canada. The abuse continued. In XXXX 2021, the claimant went to the police station in Montreal to file a complaint against her ex-husband for abuse. XXXX was arrested, and a restraining order was ordered by the court.\n\n[15] In XXXX \u2014 in XXXX 2021, the claimant learned that her ex-husband left Canada. According to the claimant, she cannot go back to her country because she could be killed by her husband, and that the state authorities will not protect her if any harm happened to her. In fact, XXXX told the claimant many times in the past that it would be very easy and inexpensive to order someone to be disappeared, and to be killed. He also repeatedly, said to the claimant that she could never hide from him.\n\n[16] I am going to mute the microphone because there\u2019s a lot of \u2014 sorry, I muted you. The claimant provided substantial documentation to corroborate her allegations regarding her marriage and the abuse that followed. The claimant presented reliable evidence, including police reports detailing the domestic abuse, medical reports, and letters from family and friends.\n\n[17] On the face of it, the Panel has no reason to doubt the authenticity of the extensive documentary evidence the claimant disclosed, and finds on a balance of probabilities that the evidence supports and corroborates the allegations of the claimant. The Panel therefore assigns the evidence full weight in corroborating the claimant\u2019s core allegations regarding the abuse she suffered from her ex-husband.\n\n[18] The Panel finds that the claimant\u2019s experience of gender-based violence amount to persecution. The Panel considered the seriousness of the harm, the cumulative acts of the agent of persecution, and the fact that the harm was repetitive. The Panel therefore finds that the claimant has a subjective fear of persecution if she returns to Mexico on a balance of probabilities.\n\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution\n\n[19] The Panel finds that the objective evidence supports the claimant\u2019s subjective fear and establishes a serious possibility of persecution for the claimant if she is forced to return to Mexico. The Panel\u2019s reasons are as follows. According to the objective documentary evidence, violence against women is widespread in Mexico. In fact, some sources indicate that the patterns of widespread gender-based violence against women and girls across Mexico, including physical, psychological, sexual, and economic violence, as well as the increase in domestic violence. Feminicides especially are persistent.\n\n[20] The United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women regrets that the persistence of high levels of insecurity and violence is negatively affecting the enjoyment by women and girls of their human rights. Moreover, access to justice is hindered for women by the stereotypical interpretive criteria, and judicial bias, in the resolution of cases and the lack of accountability of judges who fail to comply with gender-sensitive jurisdictional performance.\n\n[21] Significant human rights issues included credible reports of acts of corruption by authorities were reported, including the corruption of police officers and judge.\n\n[22] The Panel therefore finds that there is an objective basis for the claimant\u2019s subjective fear. The Panel also finds on a balance of probabilities that the claimants fear of persecution is objectively well-founded.\n\nState Protection\n\n[23] Despite the several efforts that have been made by the state of Mexico to improve access to justice for women, the Panel is concerned, however, that deep-rooted institutional, structural, and practical barriers continue to hinder women\u2019s access to justice, in light of the documentary evidence I reviewed above.\n\n[24] According to the objective evidence, state and municipal laws addressing domestic violence were often unenforced. A report notes that corruption, including within the armed forces and federal police, underpins state collusion with criminals. In the case at hand, the claimant\u2019s ex-husband was very well connected with the authorities of the country as the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.\n\n[25] Consequently, the Panel finds that it would be objectively unreasonable for the claimant to seek protection of the state in these circumstances, and that adequate state protection would not be reasonably forthcoming for the claimant.\n\nInternal Flight Alternative\n\n[26] The Panel identified the city of Merida as a potential viable IFA location. The Panel finds the claimant would face a serious possibility of persecution in the proposed IFA location, and that it would be objectively unreasonable for the claimant to relocate to the proposed IFA location.\n\n[27] The reasons are as follows. The evidence before the Panel demonstrate that the claimant\u2019s ex-husband is sufficiently motivated to look for the claimant, and has sufficient means to do so. As for his motivation, the Panel is of the opinion that it is more likely than not that after he was arrested in Canada because the claimant reported him, XXXX would be interested in revenge if the claimant return back to Mexico.\n\n[28] His motivation notwithstanding, the Panel finds that the agents of persecution does have the means to locate the claimant in the proposed IFA location. The claimant testified credibly that her husband \u2014 that her ex-husband has very good connections with political and security authorities. He is a XXXX, was working as a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Queretaro. He was working closely with local authorities and police departments. The Panel considers on a balance of probabilities that there is a serious possibility that XXXX will use his network in Mexico to seek revenge from the claimant following his arrest in Canada.\n\n[29] Based on all the evidence before it, the Panel finds that the claimant will face a serious possibility of persecution if she relocates to the proposed IFA, and that it would be objectively unreasonable in all the circumstances to ask the claimant to relocate to the proposed IFA.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[30] For the foregoing reasons, the Panel finds that the claimant is a Convention refugee under section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. Accordingly, her claim is accepted.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

The claimant responded as XXXX or by she or her. In its decision therefore, the panel refers to the claimant according to her preferences.\n\nALLEGATIONS\n\n[3] The details of the allegations of persecution are fully set out in the claimant\u2019s Basis of Claim (BOC).[3] To summarize, the claimant alleges a fear of persecution at the hands of her father and stepmother, and Mexican society in general due to membership in a particular social group, namely transgender women in Mexico. She also fears a woman called XXXX who tried to force the claimant into the illicit drug trade. The claimant states that neither state protection, nor an internal flight alternative exist for her in Mexico. The specifics of her allegations are as follows.\n\n[4] The claimant is from the city of Huimanguillo, Tabasco State, Mexico, and self-identifies as a transgender woman by the name of XXXX. XXXX testified that growing up her family life was chaotic. Her biological parents were not married; her father had another family and was frequently absent, and her mother passed away from XXXX in 2003, when the claimant was only 9 years old. After her mother\u2019s death, the claimant went to live with her father and stepmother but was mistreated.\n\n[5] The claimant testified that while she was a male assigned at birth, she realized at 13 that she enjoyed dressing like a girl and putting on makeup. At 16, she would go out to bars with other transgender females whom she befriended. The claimant recounted that her family found out she dressed like a girl and that their reaction was mostly negative, in particular her father and stepmother, who were physically and verbally abusive.\n[6] The claimant stated that she faced discrimination from Mexican society in general, which made it difficult for her to find work and support herself and personally experienced violence due to her transgender identity.\n\n[7] The claimant recounted that she XXXX XXXX in Mexico. When she worked, she had some medical insurance and therefore could afford her medication, but when she did not, it was more difficult for her to get proper medical care.\n\n[8] The claimant stated that a woman called XXXX tried to lure her to sell drugs, but she refused. XXXX was persistent and the claimant feared her, as she appeared to have connection to some cartel.\n\n[9] Given the conditions for transgender women in Mexico and XXXX\u2019s insistence that the claimant sell drugs, the claimant fled Mexico on XXXX XXXX, 2022, arriving in Canada the same day. After speaking to people in the LGBTQ+ community the claimant learned that she could apply for refugee protection in Canada and filed on August 19, 2023.\n\nDETERMINATION\n\n[10] The panel finds that the claimant is a Convention refugee, having established a serious possibility of persecution in Mexico based on the ground of membership in a particular social group, namely transgender women in Mexico.\n\nANALYSIS\n\n[11] In making its assessment, the panel has considered all the evidence, including the claimant\u2019s testimony, the submitted written evidence,[4] and the objective country conditions documentation.[5] The panel was also mindful of the difficulties faced by refugee claimants in establishing their claim, including the difficulties inherent in providing testimony through an interpreter, nervousness, past trauma, cultural and social factors, the claimant\u2019s age and educational background, the unfamiliar hearing environment, and the high-stakes nature of refugee proceedings.\n\nNexus\n\n[12] As the claimant alleges a fear of persecution on one of the Convention grounds, her refugee claim was assessed under s. 96 of the IRPA.\n\nIdentity\n\n[13] The claimant\u2019s national and personal identities have been established, on a balance of probabilities, her Mexican passport, a certified true copy of which was provided by the Minister.[6]\n\nCredibility\n\n[14] When a claimant swears that certain facts are true, this creates a presumption that they are true, unless there is valid reason to doubt their veracity.[7] The panel however is entitled to draw negative inferences based on inconsistencies, contradictions, or omissions in a claimant\u2019s evidence. The determination as to whether a claimant\u2019s evidence is credible is made on a balance of probabilities. The courts have held that a lack of evidence corroborating important aspects of the claim may undermine a claimant\u2019s credibility.[8] The Maldonado presumption however does not apply to inferences, conclusions a claimant may draw from the facts, or speculation regarding future events, nor to fears that are not sufficiently supported by the objective evidence.[9]\n\n[15] The panel finds the claimant overall to be a credible and trustworthy witness. She testified in a spontaneous, direct, and consistent manner. She was able to recount her journey of self-discovery and describe her family\u2019s reaction and Mexican society\u2019s attitude in general towards transgender women. She gave very specific examples of the discrimination and violence she experienced in Mexico due to her identity, more specifically, how she could not get a job unless she dressed as a man and how when she went out with her friends at night people would shout obscenities at them, throw alcohol bottles at them and even try to run them off the road. One time at a night club a man proposed that she go with him for a ride, but when she refused, he grabbed her by her hair and dragged her into his vehicle. The claimant managed to escape, but the incident traumatized her. The claimant said she did not approach the police for help because the people who were to support them also discriminated against them.\n\n[16] There were no discrepancies, omissions or contradictions between the claimant\u2019s oral and written evidence and the objective country conditions documentation that went to the heart of her claim.\n\n[17] In support of her allegations, that claimant provided numerous documents,[10] including:\n\nA letter from a doctor at the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in Toronto, dated November 23, 2023, which confirms that the claimant XXXX XXXX before arriving in Canada, is on XXXX medications and attends the clinic for ongoing XXXX management.A letter of support from a community caseworker at the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX attesting to the claimant being a transgender woman with XXXX.A letter signed by the Chairwoman of XXXX, a nonprofit organization for the Latinx LGBTQ+ community stating that the claimant is a trans community member of XXXX.Social media post made by the claimant in Mexico dressed as a woman and with other transgender women.\n[18] The panel finds these documents to be relevant, reliable, and probative and therefore assigns them full weight.\n\n[19] Based on the totality of the evidence, the panel finds the claimant\u2019s allegations to be true. She has established on a balance of probabilities her subjective fear of persecution due to her membership in a particular social group, namely transgender women in Mexico, if returned to Mexico. The claimant\u2019s subjective fear is supported by the objective documentary evidence as follows.\n\nObjective basis\n\n[20] The objective sources in the National Documentation Package for Mexico[11] and the country conditions documentation report that \u201cbetween 2019-2022, sexual minorities suffered 305 reported violent acts motivated by hate including murders, disappearances, attempted murders, and suicides.\u201d According to the National Observatory of Hate Crimes Against the LGBTQ+ Persons in Mexico, Mexico places second after Brazil for the number of hate crimes against LGBTQ+ persons in Latin America. The violence is attributed to Mexico\u2019s sociocultural context, to some religious groups and to the increase in hate speech, including among politicians.[12]\n\n[21] Transgender women in particular are at risk: on September 30, 2016, Paola Buenrostro, a transgender woman and sex worker in Mexico City, was found murdered a few blocks from where she usually worked. Outraged by her friend\u2019s murder, Kenya Cuevas\u2014 another transgender woman and sex worker\u2014filed a complaint with the Mexico City Human Rights Commission, sparking anonymous threats of violence against her.12 In June 2019, almost three years after Paola\u2019s murder, the Human Rights Commission issued a recommendation that all murders committed against transgender women be registered as \u201ctransfemicide\u201d.[13]\n\n[22] Having assessed all the evidence, and the claimant\u2019s the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant has established a well-founded fear of persecution, due to his membership in a particular social group, namely transgender women in Mexico, if returned to Mexico.\n\nState Protection\n\n[23] States are presumed to be capable of protecting their citizens, except in situations where the country is in a complete breakdown. To rebut this presumption, the claimant must provide clear and convincing evidence that the state is unwilling or unable to protect its citizens. A claimant is required to approach the state for protection if protection might reasonable be forthcoming. However, a claimant is not required to risk their life merely to demonstrate that adequate state protection is available.\n\n[24] The IRB\u2019s Response to Information Request, dated 2 April 2022, entitled \u201cMexico: Treatment of individuals based on their sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, and\/or sex characteristics (SOGIESC) by society and authorities, including legislation,\u201d states that same-sex sexual relations are not criminalized in Mexico, Article 1 of the Constitution prohibits discrimination motivated by ethnic or national origin, gender, age, disabilities, social status, conditions of health, religion, opinions, preferences, civil estate or any other that infringes on human dignity. Article 11 recognizes and protects the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, transvestite, transsexual and intersex persons to live a life free of violence and discrimination and requires the authorities to establish public policies and adopt the necessary measures to address and eradicate behaviors, and attitudes of exclusion or discrimination based on sexual orientation, sexual preference, gender identity, gender expression or sexual characteristics.[14]\n[25] The Federal Law to Prevent and Eliminate Discrimination also prohibits amongst other grounds discrimination based on sexual preferences.[15]\n\n[26] While the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) indicates that Mexico \u201cperforms well regarding the protection of LGBTI people against discrimination and violence, and the progress made by Mexico has been more modest regarding legal provisions addressing barriers to the inclusion of same-sex couples and transgender individuals more specifically\u201d, Noticias Telemundo, an international broadcaster, reports that [translation] \u201conly 14\u201d states in Mexico \u201cconsider hate crimes due to \u2018sexual orientation\u2019 as an aggravating factor\u201d in case of homicide, \u201cbut the Mexican Treatment of individuals based on their sexual orientation, gender identity and expression,\u2026 6\/35 MEX200969.E 7 Federal Criminal Code still does not include it, nor does it mention the term \u2018gender identity'\u201d (Noticias Telemundo 17 May 2021). Similarly, Freedom House notes that while LGBT+ individuals \u201chave strong legal protections,\u201d \u201cthey are not uniformly enforced\u201d (Freedom House 3 Mar. 2021, Sec. F4). The US Department of State\u2019s Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2020 notes that \u201c[t]here were reports the government did not always investigate and punish those complicit in abuses\u201d against LGBTI individuals, \u201cespecially outside of Mexico City\u201d (US 30 Mar. 2021, 36). In correspondence with the Research Directorate, a lawyer from Identity, Diversity, Legality (IDL), a legal bureau that specializes in SOGIESC matters in Mexico (IDL n.d.a), noted that [translation] \u201cprogress regarding sexual diversity has been slow\u201d and the issue considered \u201ctaboo,\u201d meaning that it is \u201cabsent in the legislative and executive agendas\u201d (IDL 23 Feb. 2022).[16]\n\n[27] The International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans, and Intersex Association (ILGA World) reports that \u201c[t]here are no provisions aggravating penalties for crimes motivated by the victim\u2019s sexual orientation at the federal level\u201d.\n\n[28] The UN Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial or Arbitrary Ex\u00e9cutions noted \u201cthe alarming pattern of grotesque homicides of lesbians, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals and the broad impunity for these crimes, sometimes with the suspected complicity of investigative authorities.\u201d[17]\n\n[29] According to the Capital Rainbow Refuge report,\u201cmost hate crimes against the LGBT community go uninvestigated. In many instances, police dismiss investigations of homophobic and transphobic murders by categorizing them as \u2018crimes of passion\u2019.\u201d119 Hate crimes against LGBT individuals are also most often not acknowledged or typified by state officials, which negatively impacts national statistics and responses to LGBT-targeted violence. 120 Less than 3% of the killings of LGBT individuals have resulted in convictions in Mexico since 2013.\u201d[18]\n\n[30] To conclude the panel finds, that the presumption of state protection has been rebutted with clear and convince evidence; the state is unable to provide the claimant with adequate protection at the operational level and it would be objectively unreasonable for her to seek it.\n\nInternal Flight Alternative\n\n[31] The panel considered whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for the claimant in Mexico City. Having considered the country conditions and all the circumstances of this case, including those particular to the claimant, the panel finds that the claimant has no viable internal flight alternative in Mexico. Societal attitudes against sexual minorities including transgender women are prevalent throughout the country. The NDP for Mexico notes that discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity continues to be a structural phenomenon with extensive social roots, and it \u201coccurs on a daily basis, at multiple levels in family, work and institutional environments.\u201d[19] Therefore, the claimant would face a serious possibility of persecution based on being a transgender woman if returned to Mexico. There is no place in her country of origin where she would be safe.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[32] For the foregoing reasons, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, faces a serious possibility of persecution on the ground of his membership in a particular social group namely transgender women in Mexico, if returned to Mexico. Therefore, the panel concludes that the claimant is a Convention refugee and the claimant\u2019s application for refugee protection in Canada is accepted.\n\n(signed) Christine Medycky\n\nDecember 15, 2023\n\n[1] Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), SC 2001, c 27, as amended.\n\n[2] Guidelines issued by the Chairperson pursuant to section 65(3) of the Immigration Act, IRB, Ottawa, May 1, 2017 (revised in December 2021, under the authority found in section 159(1)(h) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n\n[3] Exhibit 2.\n\n[4] Exhibit 5.\n\n[5] Exhibit 3, 5.\n\n[6] Exhibit 1, 4.\n\n[7] Maldonado v.

In reaching this decision, the panel has considered Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 4: Gender Considerations in Proceedings Before the Immigration and Refugee Board.\n\n[3] You are claiming to be a citizen of Mexico, and of no other country, and you are claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n\nDETERMINATION\n\n[4] I find that you are a Convention refugee because you face a serious possibility of persecution for the following reasons.\n\nALLEGATIONS\n\n[5] You allege the following. You are a citizen of Mexico and no other country. You come from a professional family and had a good life in Veracruz with your family and friends. You traveled to Canada in XXXX 2022 to join your ex-partner, R, who had moved here. In Canada, your partner became physically and emotionally abusive towards you and after multiple incidents of abuse, you reported him to the police and left him. However, although instructed by the police to cease all contact, he continues to ask others about your whereabouts, and you have overheard him in the past stating that he will \u201cresolve things\u201d with you once you return to Mexico. His mother has also vowed on the phone that she will harm you when you return to Mexico because of the harm you caused her son.\n\n[6] If you return to Mexico, you could be subjected to kidnapping, enforced disappearance, sexual and gender-based violence, or murder by your ex-partner or his family members. You believe that in Mexico you would not receive adequate protection from the police who do not care about women victims of domestic violence. You allege that there is no state protection for you in Mexico where many similarly situated individuals have been killed and where feminicide is rampant nor is there any Internal Flight Alternative.\n\nIdentity\n\n[7] Your personal identity as a citizen of Mexico has been established by your testimony and the supporting documents filed in the exhibits including a certified true copy of your Mexican passport, birth certificate, and national voting card. I therefore find on a balance of probabilities that identity and country of nationality have been established.\n\n[8] Nexus to section 96 or section 97, I find that there is a link between what you fear and one of the five (5) Convention grounds, specifically, your membership of a particular social group. Therefore, this claim has been assessed under section 96.\n\nCredibility\n\n[9] In terms of your general credibility, I found you to be a credible witness and I therefore accept on a balance of probabilities what you have alleged in your oral testimony and in your Basis of Claim form. Your testimony is presumed to be true. You testified in detail and consistently with your Basis of Claim about how you suffered from your ex-partner, and about the threats you received from both him and his family should you return to Mexico.\n\n[10] In support of your claim, you provided documents in Exhibit number 6 that includes letters of support from individuals familiar with your situation, photographs of injuries you sustained when R assaulted you on two (2) occasions, and copies of text messages from your ex-partner. The panel finds these documents to be consistent with your testimony and credible on a balance of probabilities and thus assigns them significant weight.\n\n[11] Your testimony was in keeping with your Basis of Claim form and there were no significant inconsistencies or omissions and your testimony about why you could not count on adequate state or police protection anywhere in Mexico was also persuasive and supported by subjective evidence submitted by your counsel in Exhibit number 7.\n\n[12] In reaching these findings, the panel has considered and applied Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 4: Gender Considerations in Proceedings Before the IRB, particularly section 6, 7, and 8. I therefore believe what you\u2019ve alleged in support of your claim, and I find the following to be credible, that on a balance of probabilities, you are a single woman and separated from an abusive partner who is highly motivated and you have credibly established your subjective fear of persecution including fear of being subjected to sexual and gender-based violence or murder.\n\nPersecution Risk\n\n[13] The objective documentation supports your allegations that individuals in your circumstances face persecution.\n\n[14] One, state and municipal laws addressing domestic violence largely fail to meet the required federal standards an often were unenforced. According to a survey, 40 percent of women aged 15 and older reported having experienced physical violence at the hands of their current or most recent partner and 23 percent reported having experienced sexual violence in the last 12 months, NDP 2.1.23, page 26.\n\n[15] Two, the documentary evidence indicates that impunity and extremely low rates of prosecution remined a problem for all crimes including human rights abuses and corruption. There were reports some government agents were complicit with international criminal gangs, NDP 2.1.23, page two.\n\n[16] Three, the documentary evidence indicates feminicide is rampant in Mexico and there were serious flaws in the investigation of these crimes, NDP 2.1.23, page three.\n\n[17] Four, the documentary evidence indicates that human rights organizations asserted authorities at times did not take reports of rape seriously and victims were socially stigmatized and ostracized, NDP 5.3, page 17.\n\n[18] Five, the documentary evidence indicates that the Mexican police and security forces have been hobbled by corruption for decades and that this corruption underpins collusion with criminals, NDP 10.2.\n\n[19] Six, Mexico is plagued by thousands of missing persons and enforced disappearances annually and impunity largely prevailed on this issue, NDP 2.1.23, pages three to five.\n\n[20] Seven, the majority of separated or divorced women, 77.7 percent, have been subjected to attacks of all kinds by their formers or spouses mainly through acts of physical and or\/sexual violence together with one of the other types of violence, 44 percent of cases, NDP 5.3, page 13.\n\n[21] Your counsel also submitted additional credible evidence describing the plague of domestic violence and feminicide in Mexico in Exhibit number 7. Consequently, I find that there is a serious possibility that you could face murder and\/or targeted gender-based violence should you return to Mexico. I find that you have established an objective basis for your subjective fear and therefore, you have a well-founded fear of persecution.\n\nState Protection\n\n[22] I find that adequate state protection would not be available to you were you to seek it in Mexico. The objective documentary evidence outlined above indicates that police and state entities do not effectively enforce domestic violence laws and that feminicide is at epidemic levels and often takes place with impunity. Furthermore, the police are corrupt and sometimes work in collusion with criminal cartels. States are presumed to be capable of protecting their citizens except in situations where the state is in a complete breakdown. However, based on the claimant\u2019s personal circumstances, as well as the country documentation referred to above, the panel finds on a balance of probabilities that the claimant has rebutted the presumption of state protection with clear and convincing evidence. Adequate state protection is not available to her as she fears persecution from a highly motivated ex-partner and his family in a country where impunity for domestic violence and feminicide is all too common.\n\nInternal Flight Alternative\n\n[23] I have also considered whether a viable Internal Flight Alternative exists for you particularly in Merida. The country documentation referred to above indicates that the situation for individuals in circumstances such as yours is the same throughout the country and that you would face a serious possibility of persecution or risk to life anywhere in Mexico as a motivated ex-partner could on a balance of probabilities find you anywhere in Mexico. The panel finds on a balance of probabilities that there is a serious possibility of persecution of the claimant anywhere in Mexico as the security forces are corrupt and vulnerable to bribery and this would make starting a new life safely and undiscovered by your ex-partner and his family elsewhere in Mexico nearly impossible.\n\n[24] As such, I find that the IFA test fails on the first prong and there is no viable Internal Flight Alternative for you in Mexico.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[25] Based on the totality of the evidence, I find the claimant to be a Convention refugee as she faces a serious possibility of persecution because of her membership of a particular social group. Your claim is therefore accepted.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

R. Krumeh\nCountry: Mexico\nRPD Number: TC3-27919\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2023-01721\nATIP Pages: N\/A\n\nDECISION\n\n[1] MEMBER: It is 11:34 a.m. and the reasons and decision begin now. The claimant, XXXX XXXX XXXX, also known as the claimant, is a citizen of Mexico who seeks refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, IRPA.\n\n[2] The claimant identifies as a trans woman, named XXXX XXXX XXXX, and prefers the pronouns she\/her, which will be used throughout these reasons.\n\nALLEGATIONS\n\n[3] The specifics of the claim are set out in detail in the claimant\u2019s Basis of Claim form, BOC. The claimant identifies as a trans woman and fears Mexican society in general due to prevailing homophobic attitudes.\n\n[4] Sexual orientation and gender identity and expression, SOGIESC guidelines, 9. The Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9, for SOGIESC persons were taken into account when considering the process of the hearing and the facts in this case. All relevant factors such as the social and cultural context in which the claimant found herself were examined with consideration of the Chairperson\u2019s SOGIESC Guidelines.\n\nDETERMINATION\n\n[5] The Panel finds that the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of IRPA, based upon her membership in a particular social group, persons identifying as transgender.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nIdentity\n\n[6] The claimant\u2019s personal identity and Mexican citizenship have been established on a balance of probabilities as per a certified true copy of her passport.\n\nCredibility\n\n[7] In assessing the credibility of evidence presented by the claimant, the Panel refers to the Federal Court of Appeal in Maldonado, wherein the court stated in part that when a claimant swears to the truth of certain allegations, this creates a presumption that those allegations are true, unless there be reason to doubt their truthfulness.\n\n[8] The Panel found that the claimant provided testimony in a straightforward manner. The claimant provided substantive documentary evidence, and her mother attended the hearing via video conference from Mexico as a witness to testify to her experiences.\n\n[9] Moreover, with regard to overall credibility and the credibility of the claimant\u2019s subjective and objective fear of violence perpetrated against her, the Panel found that the claimant was succinct in all of her responses to questions posed to her by the Panel. In short, the Panel found the claimant to be a highly credible witness.\n\nObjective Evidence\n\nCountry Conditions\n\n[10] The Panel also considered the country conditions in Mexico for members of sexual minorities. The Panel notes that conservative attitudes prevail in Mexico and public displays of affection are not considered socially acceptable, as noted in Item 6.1 and 6.2 of the NDP for Mexico.\n\n[11] The Department of State report provides the following information. Discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity was prevalent despite a gradual increase in public tolerance of LGBTI individuals, according to public opinion surveys.\n\n[12] A CNDH poll conducted during the year found six (6) of every 10 members of the LGBTI community reported experiencing discrimination in the past year, and more than half suffered hate speech and physical aggression. In the independent documentary evidence, the following is stated.\n\n[13] The 2016 Letra S, which is an LGBTQ non-governmental organization, published that 1,310 cases of killings of LGBTQ persons motivated by homophobia were committed in Mexico between 1995 and 2016. In the last 10 years, there have been 71 homicides a year on average.\n\n[14] The previously referred to RIR indicates the following. The United Nations Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial or arbitrary executions noted the alarming pattern of grotesque homicides of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender individuals, and the broad impunity for these crimes, sometimes with the suspected complicity of investigative authorities.\n\n[15] According to the CAB, which is the Executive Commission of Attention to Victims, (speaking Spanish) report, trans women and homosexuals represent the group most affected by hate motivated physical assaults.\n\n[16] A more updated RIR indicates a worsening situation of targeted violence against LGBTQ individuals throughout many regions of the country. In its annual report on extreme violence against sexual minorities, the organization Letra S, Aids Culture in Daily Life, indicated that more LGBT individuals were killed in 2017 and 2018 than in previous years, for reasons believed to be due to their real or perceived sexual or gender identity.\n\n[17] The documentary evidence indicates that the claimant\u2019s fear persecution for reasons of her sexual orientation is objectively well-founded.\n\nState Protection\n\n[18] With regard to state protection, the RIR indicates the following. The Supreme Court of Mexico \u2014 a Supreme Court of Justice of Mexico issued in 2014 a protocol for judges on the adjudication of cases involving sexual minorities. The protocol, while not legally binding, provides tools to assist judges to identify and eliminate stereotypes and social misconceptions during the decision-making process and ensure access to justice for sexual minorities. Sources indicate that despite special procedures and policies of institutions to protect sexual minorities, they do not necessarily effectively protect them in practice.\n\n[19] According to sources, the judicial system is not effective in investigating crimes committed against sexual minorities. A researcher stated that if someone had been threatened by a gang, they can file a complaint with the judicial authorities. But that does not translate into any special protection unless they have already been victim of a crime and they have been threatened again. This is particularly problematic for LGBTQ persons who are at risk.\n\n[20] The 2016 CAB (speaking Spanish) report indicates that there are low levels of reporting crimes. The researchers stated that less than 10 percent of crimes committed in Mexico are solved, and the case of homophobic crimes, even people who are found guilty are set free. According to a recent Department of State report, there were reports that the government did not always investigate and punish those complicit in abuses against sexual minorities. Furthermore, there is evidence that state actors have been and continue to be involved in forced disappearances and extrajudicial killings, adding to the reasons why LGBTQ persons would fear even approaching the state for protection.\n\n[21] The Panel finds that the claimant\u2019s testimony and the objective evidence presented demonstrate that adequate state protection would not be available to the claimant in Mexico.\n\nInternal Flight Alternative, IFA\n\n[22] During the hearing, the Panel proposed Puerto Vallarta and Mexico City as potential IFAs. In order to determine whether a viable IFA exists, the Panel must consider a two (2)-pronged test. The basis for this test is the cases of Rajaratnam and Thirunavukkarasu. The Board must be satisfied on a balance of probabilities that there is no serious possibility of the appellant, in this case, being persecuted in the part of the country to which it finds an IFA exists.\n\n[23] Conditions in that part of the country considered to be an IFA must be such that it would not be unreasonable in all circumstances, including those particulars of the appellant for him or her to seek refuge there. Claimants bear the burden of proof to show that they face a serious possibility or reasonable chance of persecution in the entire country, and specifically in the potential IFA areas named.\n\n[24] During the hearing and throughout the documentary evidence provided, the claimant testified that she feared homophobic persons in society, discrimination in the workplace, and random physical assaults throughout the country.\n\n[25] Claimant\u2019s statements about the police is supported by information contained in the NDP. One (1) Response to Information Request, RIR, states, according to US Country Reports 2016, civil society groups claim that the police routinely subjected LGBTI persons to mistreatment while in custody.\n\n[26] The Panel notes that objective evidence indicates that in Puerto Vallarta and Mexico City, there is greater tolerance of sexual minorities, at least in select districts of the regions. Despite this evidence, the Panel finds that in the particular circumstances of the claimant, having considered all of her oral testimony, that the threat of harm to her would not be reduced to the extent that there would be no serious possibility that she would face persecution for reasons of her sexual orientation by her relocation to the proposed IFA locales.\n\n[27] The Panel finds that under the particular circumstances of this case, country information indicates that trans women are frequently targeted in Mexico by state and civilian agents for serious harm \u2014 indicates that there is a serious possibility that this claimant would face persecution throughout Mexico. The claimant could not live openly as a trans woman in Puerto Vallarta or Mexico City without fear of attack from members of society.\n\n[28] Further, the Panel finds that the claimant faces a serious possibility of persecution throughout Mexico. The Panel finds that it is unnecessary to make a determination on the second prong of the IFA test as to whether the claimant\u2019s relocation there would be reasonable under all the circumstances.\n\n[29] In the particular circumstances of this claimant, there is no viable internal fight alternative available to her in Mexico.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[30] Having considered all of the evidence, the Panel finds that there is a serious possibility that the claimant would face persecution in Mexico for reasons of her sexual orientation and belonging to the social group of transgender women. Therefore, the Panel finds that the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96, and her claim for protection is accepted.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

He claims a history of widespread discrimination, prejudice, and abuse in the workplace, at school, at home, and in various social and public settings. He also described an attempted hate crime against him that occurred when he was 17 or 18 years old, and fears that something similar might happen again.\n\nDETERMINATION\n\n[4] I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee as contemplated by section 96 of IRPA and therefore accept his claim.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nIdentity\n\n[5] I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant has established his personal and national identity as a citizen of Mexico through the identity documents filed, namely his passport.[2]\n\nNexus\n\n[6] I find that the claimant has established a nexus to a Convention ground, namely membership in a particular social group as a gay man. Accordingly, I will consider his claim under section 96 of IRPA.\n\nCredibility\n\n[7] In claims before the RPD, there is a presumption that sworn testimony is true unless there is valid reason to doubt its truthfulness. I found the claimant\u2019s testimony to be clear, compelling, and genuine, and have no reason to doubt its truthfulness.\n\n[8] I find that the claimant has credibly established his identity a gay man on the basis of his testimony and supporting documents, including letters of support from his cousin (MATO) and his cousin\u2019s wife (MRP).[3] Specifically, the claimant testified in convincing detail about difficulties he experienced growing up in a traditional and conservative family, mistreatment and judgment he experienced from his family during that time, mistreatment and abuse he experienced from his peers and even teachers at school, the mental health issues he developed as a result of this treatment, the counselling he attended in order to try and cope with these issues, his past gay relationship with A, and the discrimination he experienced in the employment context. The claimant also described how free, healthy, unburdened, and happy he has felt since arriving in Canada, as opposed to feeling constantly judged, hurt, and rejected in Mexico. I find that the letters of support bolster the details of the claimant\u2019s testimony with respect to the discrimination he suffered, his mental state, and the problems he had with his family. They have no material inconsistencies with the claimant\u2019s testimony and I attach them full weight.\n\n[9] In particular, the claimant explained the various acts of discrimination he faced due to his sexual orientation at work, at school, and in public generally. He was regularly disparaged and called slurs at work by his coworkers for his mannerisms, tone of voice, choice of attire, and behaviours, which they defined as feminine and did not believe were appropriate for a man. Although he was not officially forced to tender his resignation from any of his positions, he was relentlessly mocked and pressured to leave. The claimant explained that this caused him a great deal of mental anguish and he never lasted long in jobs as a result. He also endured rejection and verbal abuse by his classmates and teachers at school and even within his family. The claimant described how he was not able to feel like himself either in public or at home with his family, and he could not afford to move out on his own. He was mocked for not liking things that boys traditionally liked and having more feminine interests and behaviours. He noted how having to try and hide his mannerisms, his interests, and his sexual orientation from everyone was very traumatizing and burdensome for him.\n\n[10] The claimant described an attempted hate crime against him when he was 17 or 18 years old. He had been walking home from school when a random unidentified driver on the street drove his car right at him and attempted to hit him. The driver shouted homophobic slurs out the window and called him a girl. The claimant speculated that this could have been because of his mannerisms, the way he was dressed, or how he was walking. He stated that he managed to flee down an alley, but otherwise might have been killed. The claimant expressed fear that something similar might happen again due to his sexual orientation and mannerisms, not from the same person but just from any homophobic stranger given his past negative experiences with the public.\n\n[11] The claimant also described his relationship with A, which started when he was 21 and ended after five months because of the abuse they suffered while attending the movies together. They never openly held hands in public, hugged, or kissed, but would often go on dates together and just pose as friends. One day at the movies, however, they did try to subtly hold hands in the dark. The claimant explained that other people in the cinema noticed this, and began to jeer at them, throw popcorn at them, and say things like \u201cthis is not a porn movie\u201d. The claimant and A became afraid of potential repercussions and disillusioned with how secretive they had to be, and ultimately decided to end the relationship.\n\n[12] To this day, the claimant continues to attend counselling sessions for the trauma, pain, and frustration he experienced related to his sexual orientation in Mexico.\n\n[13] Accordingly, I find that the key allegations of the claimant as summarized above have been credibly established on a balance of probabilities. I find that through his testimony and supporting documents the claimant has credibly demonstrated a subjective fear of persecution in Mexico due to his identity as a gay man.\n\nDelay in Claiming Refugee Protection\n\n[14] While it is true that the claimant delayed making his refugee claim by about 14 months, he explained that he initially just came to visit Canada to be able to freely be his authentic self for a little while and had no knowledge about the refugee process. After several months, a friend (F) informed him about the possibility and he began to look into obtaining counsel and advancing a claim. I accept this explanation as reasonable and do not draw any adverse inferences from this delay, nor do I find it detracts from the establishment of the claimant\u2019s subjective fear.\n\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution\n\n[15] I now turn to assessing whether, in light of the NDP and country condition evidence, the claimant has established that his subjective fear is objectively well-founded.\n\n[16] I note that the NDP evidence states that same sex relations are not criminalized in Mexico and that LGBTQ+ individuals have some legislative protections.[4] Same sex marriage has been recognized in certain states, though there is no federal law on this.[5]\n[17] However, the NDP also states that despite some legislative advances, \u201cdiscrimination based on sexual orientation, as well as gender identity and expression, is a structural phenomenon rooted in Mexican society\u201d and \u201coccurs on a daily basis, at multiple levels: in family, work and institutional environments\u201d.[6] According to the NDP, 66% of individuals aged 18 and older in Mexico felt that the rights of gay or lesbian individuals are \u201clittle or not at all respected\u201d and 64.4% of individuals aged 18 and older felt there is \u201clittle or no justification for two people of the same sex to live as a couple\u201d.[7] Dozens of LGBTQ+ individuals are killed every year in hate crimes in Mexico every year.[8] In a 2016 survey of 613 LGBTQ+ individuals, 35% of men and 23% of women had been victims of physical aggression or violence due to their sexual orientation. Mexico saw its highest number of LGBTQ+ targeted murders in five years in 2019, with 117 SOGIESC individuals killed.[9] The claimant also submitted two articles about the ongoing prevalence of hate crimes in Mexico despite some legal progress on gay rights.[10]\n\n[18] Additionally, LGBTQ+ individuals may find it very difficult to obtain housing, particularly if they mention they are LGBTQ+, as over 30% of women and 35% of men would not be willing to rent a room in their home to a gay or lesbian individual.[11] The NDP goes on to state that LGBTQ+ individuals generally have access to employment and a bachelor\u2019s degree of education, but only if they behave in a discreet manner.[12] If they are open about their sexual identity, they face discrimination both in school and the workplace, as a large number of people in the workplace reportedly still need training in inclusion and non-discrimination practices for sexual and gender diversity and most teachers and professors are homophobic.[13] Though some public tolerance has gained traction, Mexico is at its core still a socially conservative country with roots in stark, defined gender roles and significant religious influences, all of which serve to criticize, judge, and abuse sexual minorities.[14]\n\n[19] Accordingly the NDP evidence clearly establishes that despite some recent legislative reforms and social progress, Mexican society still features extensive discrimination against LGBTQ+ individuals throughout its various institutions. This adversely impacts an LGBTQ+ individual\u2019s physical and mental wellbeing, access to education, access to employment, access to justice, access to public spaces, enjoyment of life, and freedom of expression.\n\n[20] The SOGIESC Guidelines note that SOGIESC individuals may face instances of harassment or discrimination that cumulatively amounts to a well-founded fear of persecution. I find that to be the case here with the claimant, due to his status as a SOGIESC individual. The systemic discrimination and widespread prejudice against SOGIESC individuals forces them to face real, tangible risks of elevated violence, homelessness, lack of access to public spaces and services, and limitations on their employment. As a consequence, they are unable to fully enjoy their civil, cultural, economic, political, and social rights. As discussed above in more detail, the claimant experienced many of these first-hand in the form of attempted murder, repeated harassment by people in public, extensive discrimination and mistreatment in the workplace and at school, and publicly concealing his gay relationships out of necessity and safety concerns. I also note that the claimant has experienced a lot of this harassment due to his mannerisms and behaviours that Mexican society tends to attribute to women rather than men. In the Mexican culture of machismo and clearly defined gender roles, failing to conceal his sexual orientation and the aspects of his identity that do not comport with these expectations can expose him to heightened risks even relative to other more gender-conforming and masculine-presenting gay men.[15] I find this discrimination is so pervasive and systemic that it cumulatively amounts to persecution.\n\n[21] On the basis of a prominent lingering public prejudice against LGBTQ individuals that pervades most societal institutions, elevated violence, harassment, and discrimination against LGBTQ individuals, I find the claimant\u2019s subjective fear of persecution in Mexico due to being a gay man is objectively well-founded.\n\nState Protection\n\n[22] States are presumed to be capable of protecting their citizens except in situations where the state is in a state of complete breakdown.[16] The claimant must rebut this presumption with clear and convincing evidence of the state\u2019s inability to protect its citizens for their claim to succeed. I find that the claimant\u2019s evidence, taken together with the objective country evidence, successfully rebut this presumption and serve as clear and convincing evidence that adequate state protection is not available to the claimant in Mexico.\n[23] The NDP evidence indicates that police forces in Mexico lack human and material resources to properly investigate crimes and that for all murders registered between 2010 and 2016, 94.8% of cases had no suspect facing charges.[17] According to the 2019 National Survey on Victimization and Perception of Public Safety, 93.2% of all crimes committed were either not reported or not investigated.[18] Other sources indicate that police at all levels (local, state, and federal) play a role in facilitating illegal businesses, working for organized crime, and systematically violating human rights.[19] Additionally, 59.2% of respondents in a 2019 survey reported that they had experienced an act of corruption with public security authorities.[20]\n\n[24] Additionally, the NDP notes that \u201cthere were reports the government did not always investigate and punish those complicit in abuses against LGBTI individuals, especially outside of Mexico City\u201d and that SOGIESC matters are still considered taboo and are often absent from the legislative and executive agendas.[21] Police routinely subjected LGBTI persons to mistreatment while in custody.[22] Another source notes that in the case of homophobic crimes, which are often simply considered \u201ccrimes of passion\u201d, investigations are not always conducted properly and even people found to be guilty have been either not punished or set free.[23]\n\n[25] I note that a claimant is not required to risk their life to seek ineffective protection of a state merely to demonstrate that ineffectiveness.[24] I find the behaviour of the police towards people of the LGBTQ community as referenced by the NDP above gives rise to reasonable concerns of police misconduct and explains why the claimant would not be able or willing to avail himself of their protection.\n\n[26] In light of the objective country documentation and the claimant\u2019s evidence, I find that the claimant has rebutted the presumption of state protection and that adequate state protection would not be available to the claimant in Mexico.\n\nInternal Flight Alternative\n\n[27] I raised the issue of IFA with the claimant at the outset of the hearing and proposed Mexico City as a viable IFA. I note that counsel for the claimant inexplicably addressed the IFA of Cancun in his written submissions, when in fact I had proposed Mexico City (and the Zona Rosa). Nevertheless, I find that the claimant has successfully challenged this IFA under the first prong of the analysis.\n\n[28] The Federal Court of Appeal has held that there is a two-pronged test for assessing an IFA.[25] The RPD must be satisfied that:\n\ni. There is no serious possibility of the claimant being persecuted in the part of the country to which it finds an IFA exists and\/or that it is more probable than not that the claimant would not be personally subject to a danger of torture or to a risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in the IFA; and\n\nii. The conditions in the part of the country considered to be an IFA must be such that it would not be unreasonable in all the circumstances, including those particular to the claim, for the claimant to seek refuge there.\n\n[29] Both prongs of the test must be satisfied to find that a claimant has an IFA. Once the issue of IFA has been raised and potential IFAs have been identified by the RPD, the burden of proof then rests with the claimant to show that they do not have a viable IFA in those locations.\n\nFirst Prong: Prospective Risk of Harm in the IFA\n\n[30] The claimant has established a nexus to a Convention ground under section 96 of IRPA. I will therefore focus the first prong of the IFA analysis on whether the claimant has demonstrated that he faces a serious possibility of persecution in Mexico City. For the reasons that follow, I find that the claimant has successfully established that he would and therefore that Mexico City would not be a viable IFA.\n\n[31] The NDP evidence indicates that, while circumstances for LGBTQ+ individuals are better in Mexico City and the Zona Rosa, authorities and homophobic societal attitudes operate similarly in all parts of Mexico.[26] In a 2015 study, 68% of the LGBTQ+ people surveyed in Mexico City claimed to have been discriminated against at some point and 20-25% reported not being able to speak openly about their sexual orientation.[27] Another source notes that 81.8% of respondents consider that discrimination exists towards gay individuals in Mexico City and that violence towards LGB individuals remains an issue.[28] Mexico City also features one of the highest LGBTQ-targeted murder rates in the country and violence and discrimination frequently occurs throughout the city, even in the Zona Rosa.[29] The NDP also documents that access to housing, even in terms of renting, is \u201cvery difficult\u201d if an individual mentions they are LGBTQ+ and they could quite likely be prohibited or denied access to it without any other reason (and does not distinguish Mexico City from this statistic).[30] Between 30 and 35% of individuals openly conceded that they would not rent a room to a gay or lesbian individual.[31] Additionally, while LGBTQ+ individuals in general have access to employment in Mexico City, they will face discrimination when they share their sexual orientation or when their sexual orientation is discovered.[32] The NDP also documents discrimination in terms of access to healthcare services for LGBTQ+ individuals in Mexico City.[33]\n\n[32] On the basis of these references in the NDP evidence, I find that the same discrimination, prejudice, and risk of harm the claimant would face at home in Pachuca would also be present in Mexico City, or indeed nationwide. Given that these conditions document ongoing widespread discrimination within the context of housing, employment, and healthcare in Mexico City, as well as ongoing violence against LGBTQ+ individuals, I find that the cumulative effects of these amount to persecution. Accordingly, I find the claimant would also face a serious possibility of persecution in Mexico City, and that it would not be a viable IFA.\n[33] As the claimant has successfully challenged the proposed IFA under the first prong of the IFA analysis, I need not proceed with the second prong of the IFA analysis. I find that the claimant does not have a viable IFA in Mexico City or indeed throughout Mexico.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[34] I find the claimant has established he faces a serious possibility of persecution in Mexico on a Convention ground as a gay man. I therefore find that he is a Convention refugee under section 96 of IRPA and therefore accept his claim.\n\n(signed) Matthew Stumpf\n\nDecember 20, 2023\n\n[1] Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, SC 2001, c 27, as amended, ss 96, 97(1)(a) and 97(1)(b).\n\n[2] Exhibit 1.\n\n[3] Exhibit 5, Items 1 and 2.\n\n[4] NDP, Mexico, Tab 6.2 at pp. 1-2, 6-8: Mexico: Treatment of individuals based on their sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, and\/or sex characteristics (SOGIESC) by society and authorities, including legislation; access to housing, employment, education, health care, and support services, particularly in M\u00e9rida, Monterrey, and Mexico City; state protection (2020\u2013March 2022).

Today\u2019s date is December 6th, 2023.\n\n[2] In the hearing and in this decision, I have considered and applied the Immigration and Refugee Board\u2018s Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9 on \u2014 sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, and sex characteristics guideline, also referred to as the SOGIESC guideline. I am mindful of the difficulties faced by the claimant in establishing his claim, including the challenge of remembering difficult emotional events, and as a result, I addressed the claimant with heightened sensitivity and avoided unnecessary details when asking questions. Okay.\n\nALLEGATIONS\n\n[3] The claim details are stated in the claimant\u2019s Basis of Claim form and the claimant\u2019s testimony. The claimant is a 56-year-old man who lived in Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico. In summary, the claimant fears the Mexican state and society on the basis of his sexual orientation as a gay man. The claimant also fears his son, who threatened to kill him if he returns to Mexico. The claimant alleges that there is no adequate state protection for him in Mexico nor is there a safe and reasonable internal flight alternative because the persecution of SOGIESC people exists throughout the country.\n\nDETERMINATION\n\n[4] I find that the claimant has satisfied the burden of establishing that he would face a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nIdentity\n\n[5] I am satisfied with the claimant\u2019s identity as a citizen of Mexico, which is established by his testimony and a copy of his passport in Exhibit 1.\n\nNexus\n\n[6] I find the claimant has established a nexus to a Convention ground, namely his membership in a particular social group as he is a gay man. Therefore, I will assess the claim under section 96 of the IRPA.\n\nCredibility\n\n[7] I find no reason to doubt the claimant\u2019s credibility. Although clearly nervous, the claimant testified in a straightforward manner. The claimant also provided ample details to expand upon his allegation whenever asked. I find that his testimony of discrimination events is aligned with the general country information available on the Mexican National Documentation Package, or NDP, which shows a high persecution level against SOGIESC people, according to Tab 6.2.\n\n[8] The claimant credibly established that he faced continuous prejudice, discrimination, bullying, verbal and physical violence throughout his life due to his sexuality. Moreover, the claimant was assaulted by his own son, who discovered that his father was a gay man and promised to kill him.\n\n[9] The claimant also submitted vast corroborative evidence to support his persecution allegations, which include a XXXX assessment conducted in Mexico and another one (1) in Canada, support letters from family, co-workers, and friends talking about his sexuality and the challenges he was facing in his country.\n\n[10] I find that all prejudice against and violence suffered by the claimant added to the death threat by his son amount to persecution on a balance of probabilities.\n\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution and Risk of Harm\n\n[11] The claimant testified and provided corroborative evidence that his son is actively looking for him. I find that even if his son is motivated, there is no evidence before the Panel that he would have the means to locate the claimant in another part of Mexico, especially in Mexico City, a place with over 22 million people almost 600 kilometres from Guadalajara, where he was persecuted.\n\n[12] However, the objective evidence in the NDP from Mexico at Item 6.2 indicates that while there have been legislative improvements in Mexico, there continues to be harassment and discrimination of sexual minorities by society and discrimination as they seek employment and medical services.\n\n[13] Item 2.1 speaks to the fact that authorities act with impunity with respect to individuals like the claimant. They do not investigate crimes when they suspect they are related to sexual minorities. In fact, Item 6.1 talks about those individuals who demonstrate public attention or affection are, in reality, targeted by the police.\n\n[14] I also considered Item 6.7, which indicates the inability to live openly as a gay person for fear of harassment, persecution, violence, and other negative consequences. The same reference also states that the SOGIESC community is being threatened with impunity by the police.\n\n[15] I find that the claimant has established that he faces cumulative discrimination for his sexual orientation which amounts to persecution if he returns to Mexico. The claimant would be subjected on a balance of probabilities to the persecuted in the country. Therefore, I find the claimant has demonstrated a well-founded fear of persecution on both a subjective and objective basis.\n\nState Protection\n\n[16] There are legal provisions to protect SOGIESC communities in Mexico. However, according to the NDP, Item 6.4, these legal protections are not consistently enforced. According to the NDP, Tab 2.1, state authorities do not always investigate and punish people who commit crimes against SOGIESC people.\n\n[17] Item 6.7 of the NDP states that crimes are often not reported to the police. Only four (4) percent of SOGIESC people who experience discrimination reports it to authorities because of a lack of confidence or trust. Victims of these crimes are reluctant to report anything to the police given that police reportedly intimidate, extort, and harass SOGIESC people. Indeed, the same Item 6.7 reports Mexican state authorities include police, military, and other government officials as being involved in violence targeting sexual minorities.\n\n[18] After considering the evidence, I do not find that the claimant has inadequate \u2014 adequate state protection in Mexico.\n\nInternal Flight Alternative (or IFA)\n\n[19] Finally, the Panel has considered whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for the claimant. Mexico City was suggested as a possible IFA location. The Panel must find \u2014 sorry.\n\n[20] The Panel must consider a two (2) pronged test to determine the viability of an IFA location. First, the Panel must be satisfied that the claimant would not face a serious possibility of persecution in the IFA location. Second, the Panel must be satisfied that the conditions in the suggested IFA are not such that it would be objectively unreasonable in all circumstances for the claimant to relocate and reside there.\n\n[21] I note that there are laws in Mexico to protect sexual minorities. According to the NDP, Item 6.7, there are laws criminalizing hate crimes. Same-sex couples can marry and adopt children in Mexico City, and the city also has a SOGIESC village in a section called Zona Rosa, or \u2018Red Zone.\u2019 However, the same NDP evidence also recognizes that legislation to protect SOGIESC people is only partially effective and that people in this community remain vulnerable to abuse by authorities and discrimination.\n\n[22] Given the absence of adequate state protection, the prevalence of homophobia, and violence against sexual minorities throughout Mexico, I find that the claimant would face a serious possibility of persecution if he were to return. Therefore, it is not objectively reasonable in all the circumstances, including those particular to the claimant, for him to relocate to an IFA location. Accordingly, I find the claimant could not live openly as a gay man in Mexico City without fear of attack from members of society. Therefore, no internal flight alternative is available to the claimant.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[23] Having considered \u2014 in considering all the evidence, the Panel finds that there is a serious possibility that the claimant would face persecution in Mexico for his \u2014 reasons of his sexual orientation as a gay man. Accordingly, the Panel finds that the claimant is a Convention refugee, and therefore, his claim is accepted.\n\n",

Cortes-Diaz\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Eunji Yi for John W. Grice\nCountry: Mexico\nRPD Number: TC3-09332\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2023-01721\nATIP Pages: N\/A\n\nDECISION\n\nMEMBER:\n\nIntroduction\n\n[1] XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is claiming refugee protection under Section 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act alleging that he faces a serious possibility of persecution in Mexico. In assessing his claim, I have taken into account the Immigration and Refugee Board\u2019s Chairpersons Guidelines on sexual orientation and gender identity and expression, SOGIE guidelines.\n\nAllegations\n\n[2] The facts and events alleged in support of the claim are set out in the claimant\u2019s Basis of Claim form. The claimant alleges he is a gay man who fears persecution in Mexico, based on his sexual orientation and his XXXX XXXX XXXX. The claimant has established that he faces a serious possibility of persecution because of his membership in a particular social group. Based on the evidence submitted, including the claimant\u2019s testimony at the hearing, I find that the claimant is subjected to regrettable treatment in Mexico that is discriminatory by virtue of his identification as a gay man and his XXXX XXXX XXXX.\n\nDetermination\n\n[3] I find that this discrimination taken into consideration the duration, severity and emotional impact on the claimant when considered cumulatively does amount to persecution. I find that the claimant is in need of protection and I accept his application for refugee protection under Section 96 of the IRPA.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nIdentity\n\n[4] The claimant has established his personal identity as a national of Mexico by a certified copy of his Mexican passport, contained in the evidence.\n\nCredibility\n\n[5] In assessing the claimant\u2019s credibility, I kept in mind the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in Maldonado when the court stated in part that when a claimant swears to the truth of certain allegations, this creates a presumption that those allegations are true, unless there are reasons to doubt their truthfulness. I am mindful of the many difficulties faced by the claimant in establishing a claim including nervousness, cultural factors, and the difficulties inherent in responding to questions about what may have been traumatic in nature. I find the claimant to be a credible witness and therefore believe what he has alleged in support of his claim.\n\n[6] I also believe that he did not make any efforts to embellish his testimony. With respect to the claimant\u2019s membership in a particular social group, namely a gay man, I find him to be credible. Regarding the discrimination the claimant faced in Mexico and the events that led him to leave Mexico, I also find he has credibly established these facts on a balance of probabilities. In addition to his testimony, the claimant also submitted plenty of evidence corroborating his allegations. Among the documents submitted are letters of support from his friends and family, corroborating the events of discrimination faced by the claimant, pictures depicting his current relationship and also medical information from Mexico and Canada confirming the claimant\u2019s XXXX XXXX.\n\nObjective Basis\n\n[7] In regards to the objective evidence. Although there have been advances in Mexico, legislation to recognize equality, discrimination based on sexual orientation as well as gender identity and expression, is a structural phenomenon rooted in Mexican society and, of course, daily at multiple levels in family, work, and institutional environments. This is at section 6.2 of the National Documentation Package. The evidence also shows that legislative attempts to stop discrimination do not necessarily translate into effective actions for members of the LGBTQ community. Laws providing rights to sexual and gender minorities over the years have made them more visible to Mexican society. And as a result, more vulnerable to homophobic and transphobic violence. Increased visibility has increased public misperceptions and false stereotypes about the gay and transgender communities. This has produced fears about these communities, such as being gay or transgender is contagious and that all transgender individuals are HIV positive. These fears have in turn led to hate crimes and murders of LGBTQ people, and this is at the same section 6.2 of the NDP.\n\n[8] The claimant described facing discrimination in different parts of Mexico, and also described the harassment he experienced at school, work, the verbal aggression, mocking and bullying because of his perceived or known sexual orientation. The claimant described how this constant harassment led him to develop XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The objective evidence supports the claimant\u2019s allegations that even in Mexico City people or gay people also suffered discrimination when they share their sexual orientation or when it is discovered.\n\n[9] The claimant found out about his XXXX XXXX in Mexico. The claimant started treatment in 2019, but testified about the disrespectful manner the treatment was administered to him by doctors. The claimant also talked about the unavailability of drugs at times which made the claimant stop treatment at least two times, risking XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Even though the objective evidence does indicate that some clinics provide comprehensive and free of charge XXXX treatment, whether an individual has access to Social Security or not, the report also says that those receiving treatment still face discrimination, violence and stigma, including sometimes violation of the human rights.\n\n[10] Country conditions report further describes how a significant number of LGBTQ persons are denied access to health services altogether and those who do have access often experience discrimination and harassment by medical staff who are typically untrained or they do not know how to treat or care for LGBTQ individuals. And this is at section 6.7 of the NDP. The documentary evidence also indicates that even though Mexico labor law prohibits employers from demanding XXXX XXXX for employment, individuals are commonly barred from employment because of XXXX XXXX or the employment is terminated when their XXXX XXXX is discovered or disclosed. This was the case with the claimant when he was not given a job at a call center when his XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.\n\n[11] Taking into consideration the repetitive and long lasting instances of past discriminations and abuse against the claimant by general Mexican society combined with the forward-looking risk he faces as XXXX XXXX XXXX gay man, there is enough reliable evidence to suggest that on a balance of probabilities, he will be subjected to persecution if he returns to Mexico. There is also enough convincing evidence to conclude that on a balance of probabilities, and taking into consideration the repetitive instances of past abuse against the claimant again and that he will face a forward-looking risk due to his XXXX XXXX.\n\nState Protection\n\n[12] The country documentation demonstrates that while legislation protection exists regarding sexual orientation, many of Mexico\u2019s institutions are weak and the legislation that is in place right now is either noneffective or not implemented.\n\n[13] The legislation protections are not uniform, they are not enforced and the LGBT community is not protected. Section 6.1 of the NDP reports that same-sex couples showing public display of affections are also a frequent target of police abuse and arbitrary detention by state agents, often with excessive use of force or verbal abuse, because what it is considered immoral behavior in public places.\n\n[14] I find that the homophobic nature of Mexican society is deeply rooted and is reflected in the country police forces and therefore find that in the claimant\u2019s circumstances, he has rebutted the presumption of state protection.\n\nInternal Flight Alternative\n\n[15] In regards to internal flight alternative. I had chosen Mexico City as a possible internal flight alternative. However, I note that the documentary evidence says that there are LGBTQ communities in larger cities where it is possible to express one\u2019s sexuality. However, the National Documentation Package indicates that throughout Mexico, most sexual minorities have experienced physical acts of violence and harassment based on their sexual orientation, gender identity, and XXXX XXXX XXXX. For this reason, and based on the particular circumstances of this case, I find that an internal file alternative is not available for the claimant in Mexico.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[16] Based on the totality of the evidence and the analysis that I have done on this file, I find that the claimant is a person in need of protection pursuant to Section 96 of the Act. Accordingly, his claim for refugee protection is accepted.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, who are the claimants, are citizens of Mexico who seek refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, IRPA.\n\nALLEGATIONS\n\n[2] The specifics of the claim are set out in detail in the claimants\u2019 Basis of Claim forms, BOCs, contained on the record. The claimants are a married couple whose declared sexual orientation is that of bisexual. They also self-identify as swingers. Following a release on social media of a sexually explicit video involving themselves and a third partner, they experienced threats, discrimination and physical intimidation by coworkers, public administrators, and the Mexican public at large. After attempts to seek state protection in Mexico were unsuccessful, they fled to Canada to seek protection.\n\nGuidelines Consulted: Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression, SOGIESC, Guidelines\n\n[3] The Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9 for SOGIESC persons were taken into account when considering the process of the hearing and the facts in this case. All relevant factors such as the social and cultural context in which the claimants found themselves were examined with consideration to the Chairperson\u2019s SOGIESC Guidelines.\n\nDETERMINATION\n\n[4] The Panel finds that the claimants are Convention refugees pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA based upon their membership in a particular social group being persons identifying as bisexual and\/or swingers.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nIdentity\n\n[5] The claimants\u2019 Mexican nationalities and personal identities are established on a balance of probabilities as per a certified true copy of their passports on the record.\n\nCredibility\n\n[6] The process of determining whether a claimant is a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection under the IRPA requires the Panel to decide whether they believe the claimant\u2019s evidence and how much weight to give that evidence. In determining this, the Panel must assess the credibility of the claimants and the documentary evidence. The law imposes a duty upon RPD members to assess the credibility of refugee claimants. The Federal Court has laid out the relevant principles in analyzing credibility in the context of refugee claims. Refugee applicants are presumed to tell the truth, but this is a presumption rebuttable by the applicant\u2019s lack of credibility, for example, where the evidence is inconsistent with sworn testimony or the applicants \u2014 or where the applicant\u2019s explanation for the inconsistencies is not satisfactory.\n\n[7] Even though they may be insufficient when taken individually or in isolation, the accumulation of contradictions, inconsistencies, and omissions regarding crucial elements of a refugee claim can support a negative conclusion about an applicant\u2019s credibility. A negative credibility finding cannot be used on minor contradictions that are secondary or peripheral to the refugee protection claim. A lack of credibility concerning central elements of a refugee protection claim can extend and trickle down to other elements of the claim and be generalized to all of the documentary evidence presented to corroborate a version of the facts.\n\n[8] Credibility findings should not be made based strictly on the absence of corroborative evidence. Where corroborative evidence should reasonably be available to establish an essential element of a claim and there is no reasonable explanation for its absence, a decision maker can draw a negative inference of credibility based on the claimant\u2019s lack of effort to obtain such corroborative evidence and conclusions can be drawn concerning an applicant\u2019s credibility based on implausibilities, common sense and rationality.\n\n[9] In considering credibility, and in particular considering the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9, The Panel is aware of the difficulties that may be faced by the claimant in establishing a claim, (inaudible) the setting of the online hearing room, the sensitive nature of the allegations and the stress inherent in responding to questions. The Panel, in considering the credibility of the claimants, made an assessment of the evidence \u2014 of all the evidence, both oral and documentary. The evidence was also assessed as a whole, so it could be treated in a consistent manner. However, not every piece of evidence will be referred to, but those that the Panel finds relevant to its decision, and even if a piece of evidence is not referred to, the Panel carefully considered it as part of the evidence.\n\n[10] The Panel found that the claimants provided their testimony in a very straightforward manner. The claimants were not represented by Counsel and made best efforts in my finding to provide the Panel with detailed documentary evidence, including copies of human rights complaints made as well as affidavits from colleagues attesting to the discrimination they both experienced. The Panel finds on a balance of probabilities that the claimants are bisexual swingers and that they have established their subjective fear of persecution based upon their sexual orientation.\n\n[11] Moreover, with regard to overall credibility and the credibility of the claimant\u2019s subjective and objective fear of violence perpetrated against them, the Panel found that the claimants were succinct in all of their responses to questions posed by the Panel. In short, the Panel found the claimants to be highly credible witnesses.\n\nObjective Basis\n\n[12] The Panel also considered the country conditions in Mexico for members of sexual minorities. The Panel notes that machismo attitudes prevail in Mexico despite changes in national laws, in particular with regard to the legalization and decriminalization of same-sex marriages, and public displays of affection are not considered socially acceptable, as noted in Item 6.1 and 6.2 of the National Documentation Package, NDP for Mexico. A DOS report provides the following information. Discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity was prevalent despite a gradual increase in public tolerance of LGBTI individuals, according to public opinion surveys. A CNDH poll conducted during the year found six (6) of every 10 members of the LGBTI community reported experiencing discrimination in the past year, and more than half suffered hate speech and physical aggression.\n\n[13] An RIR indicates the following. The United Nations special rapporteur on extrajudicial or arbitrary executions noted the alarming pattern of grotesque homicides of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals and the broad impunity for these crimes, sometimes with the suspected complicity of investigative authorities.\n\n[14] According to the CEAV, the Executive Commission of Attention to Victims, and (inaudible) report, trans women and homosexuals represent the group most affected by hate motivated physical assaults. Furthermore, the RIR provides the following information. Between January 2014 and December 2016, 202 sexual minorities or persons perceived as such were killed as a result of their sexual orientation or gender identity or expression. An additional RIR indicates a worsening situation of targeted violence against LGBTQ individuals throughout many regions of the country. In its annual report on extreme violence against sexual minorities, the organization Letra S, AIDS, Culture and Daily Life, indicated that more LGBT individuals were killed in 27 (sic) and 2018 than in previous years for reasons believed to be due to their real or perceived sexual or gender identity.\n\n[15] The documentary evidence in my finding indicates the claimants\u2019 fear of persecution for reasons of their sexual orientation is objectively well-founded.\n\nState Protection\n\n[16] With regard to state protection, the RIR indicates the following. The Supreme Court of Justice of Mexico issued in 2014 a protocol for judges on the adjudication of cases involving sexual minorities. The protocol, while not legally binding, provides tools to assist judges to identify and eliminate stereotypes and social misconceptions during the decision-making process and ensure access to justice for sexual minorities. Sources indicate that despite special procedures and policies of institutions to protect sexual minorities, they do not necessarily effectively protect them in practice.\n\n[17] According to sources, the judicial system is not effective in investigating crimes committed against sexual minorities. According to a recent Department of State report, there were reports that the government did not always investigate and punish those complicit in abuses against sexual minorities. Furthermore, there is evidence that state actors have been and continue to be involved in forced disappearances and extrajudicial killings, (inaudible) the reasons why LGBTQ persons would fear even approaching the state for protection.\n\n[18] The claimants testified to their frustration and indeed humiliation they experienced when they attempted to seek state protection. At one (1) point, an official hearing their case mocked and laughed at them. An attempt to seek redress through a complaint to the Human Rights Department in Mexico resulted in a response that they had no jurisdiction. The Panel finds that the claimants\u2019 testimony and the objective evidence presented demonstrate that adequate state protection would not be available to the claimants in Mexico.\n\nInternal Flight Alternative, IFA\n\n[19] The Panel proposed the two (2) cities of Mexico City and Puerto Vallarta as potential IFA locations. In order to determine whether a viable IFA exists, the Panel must consider a two (2) prong test, and the basis for this test is Rasaratnam and Thirunavukkarasu, which states the Board must be satisfied on a balance of probabilities that there is no serious possibility of the appellant, in this case, being persecuted in the part of the country to which it finds an IFA exists. Conditions in that part of the country considered to be an IFA must be such that it would not be unreasonable in all the circumstances, including those particular to the appellants, for him or her to seek refuge there. Claimants bear the burden of proof to show that they face a serious possibility or reasonable chance of persecution in the entire country, and specifically in the potential IFA areas named.\n\n[20] During the hearing, when asked whom they feared, the claimants testified that they feared Mexican society in general, which I found to be credible based on their past experiences and equally from a forward-looking perspective. The Panel notes that objective evidence indicates that in Puerto Vallarta and Mexico City, there is greater tolerance of sexual minorities, at least in select districts of the regions. Despite this evidence, the Panel finds that in the particular circumstances of the claimants, having considered all of their oral and documentary testimony, that the threat of harm and discrimination leading to persecution inflicted upon them would not be reduced to the extent that there would be no serious possibility that they would face persecution for reasons of their sexual orientation by their relocation to the proposed locations.\n\n[21] The Panel finds that under the particular circumstances of these claimants, country information indicates that LGBTQ persons are frequently targeted in Mexico by state and civilian agents for serious harm, and that there is a serious possibility that these claimants would face persecution throughout Mexico.\n\n[22] The claimants could not live openly as bisexual swingers in Puerto Vallarta or Mexico City without fear of attack from members of society. Further, the Panel finds that the claimants face a serious possibility of persecution throughout Mexico. The Panel finds that it is unnecessary to make a determination on the second prong of the IFA test as to whether the claimants\u2019 relocation there would be reasonable under all the circumstances. In the particular circumstances of these claimants, there is no viable internal flight alternative available to them in Mexico.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[23] Having considered all the evidence, the Panel finds that there is a serious possibility that the claimants would face persecution in Mexico for reasons of their sexual orientation and belonging to the social group known as bisexual swingers. Therefore, the Panel finds that the claimants are Convention refugees pursuant to section 96 and their claims for protection are accepted. And that completes the reasons.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

The claimant is a single 38-year-old male. His sexual orientation is that of an openly gay man. Following a brutal attack based on his sexual orientation, he fled to find a safe haven. While in Canada, being supported by his family members who remained in Mexico, he became aware of the possibility of claiming refugee status and he made an inland refugee claim in November 2021.\n\nGuidelines Consulted\n\n[3] The Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9 for SOGIESC persons were taken into account when considering the process of the hearing and the facts in this case. All relevant factors such as the social and cultural context, in which the claim found himself, were examined with consideration of the Chairperson\u2019s SOGIESC Guidelines.\n\nDETERMINATION\n\n[4] The Panel finds the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of IRPA based on his membership in a particular social group being a homosexual male.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nIdentity\n\n[5] The claimant\u2019s personal identity and Mexican citizenship have been established, on a balance of probabilities, as per a certified true copy of his passport.\n\nCredibility\n\n[6] In assessing the credibility of the evidence presented by the claimant, the Panel refers to the Federal Court of Appeal in Maldonado, wherein the court stated, in part, that, \u201cWhen a claimant swears to the truth of certain allegations, this creates a presumption that those allegations are true, unless there be reason to doubt their truthfulness.\u201d The Panel found that the claimant provided his testimony in a straightforward manner. The Panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant is a homosexual male and that he has established his fear of persecution based on his sexual orientation.\n\n[7] Moreover, with regard to overall credibility and the credibility of the claimant\u2019s subjective and objective fear of violence perpetrated against him. The Panel found that the claimant was succinct in all of his responses to questions posed to him by the Panel. In short, the Panel found the claimant to be a highly credible witness.\n\nCountry Conditions\n\n[8] The Panel also consider the country conditions in Mexico for members of sexual minorities. The Panel notes that conservative attitudes prevail in Mexico and public displays of affection are not considered socially acceptable, as noted in Item 6.1 and 6.2 of the National Documentation Package for Mexico. The DOS report, Department of State report, provides the following information. \u201cDiscrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity was prevalent despite a gradual increase in public tolerance of LGBTI individuals according to public opinion surveys.\u201d A CNDH poll conducted during the year found six (6) of every 10 members of the LGBTI community reported experiencing discrimination in the past year and more than half suffered hate speech and physical aggression.\n\n[9] In the independent documentary evidence, the following is stated. In 2016, Letter S (ph), which is an LGBTQ non-governmental organization, published that 1,310 cases of killings of LGBTQ persons, motivated by homophobia, were committed in Mexico between 1995 and 2016. 44 of them in 2015 and 15 in 2016. In the last 10 years, there have been 71 homicides a year on average. The previously referred to RIR indicates the following. The United Nations special rapporteur on extrajudicial and or arbitrary executions noted the alarming pattern of grotesque homicides of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals and the broad impunity for these crimes, sometimes with the suspected complicity of investigative authorities.\n\n[10] According to the CEAV, which is the Executive Commission of Attention to Victims and Fundaci\u00f3n Arcoiris report, transwomen and homosexuals represent the group most affected by hate motivated physical assaults. Furthermore, the RIR provides the following information. Between January 2014 and December 2016, 202 sexual minorities or persons perceived as such were killed as a result of their sexual orientation or gender identity or expression, including a 108 transwomen, 93 gay men and one (1) lesbian woman. I will not continue with the details of all the particular murders that have happened throughout Mexico. There \u2014 they were numerous. A more updated RIR indicates a worsening situation of targeted violence against LGBTQ individuals throughout many regions of the country. In its annual report on extreme violence against sexual minorities, the organization Letter S Aids Culture and Daily Life, indicated that more LGBTQ individuals were killed in 2017 and 2018 than in previous years for reasons believed to be due to their real or perceived sexual or gender identity.\n\n[11] The documentary evidence indicates that the claimant\u2019s fear of persecution for reasons of his sexual orientation is objectively well-founded.\n\nState Protection\n\n[12] With regard to state protection, the RIR indicates the following. The Supreme Court of Justice of Mexico issued in 2014 a protocol for judges on the adjudication of cases involving sexual minorities. The protocol, while not legally binding, provides tools to assist judges to identify and eliminate stereotypes and social misconceptions during the decision-making process, and ensure access to justice for sexual minorities. Sources indicate that despite special procedures and policies of institutions to protect minorities, they do not necessarily, effectively, protect them in practice. According to sources, the judicial system is not effective in investigating crimes committed against sexual minorities. The researchers stated that if someone had been threatened by a gang, they can file a complaint with the judicial authorities but that does not translate into any special protection, unless they have already been victim of a crime and they have been threatened again. This is particularly problematic for LGBTQ persons who are at risk.\n\n[13] The 2016 CEAV and Fundaci\u00f3n Arcoiris report indicates that there are low levels of reporting crimes. The researchers stated that less than 10 percent of crimes committed in Mexico are solved and in the case of homophobic crimes, even people who are found guilty are set free. According to the latest Department of State, DOS, report, there were reports that the government did not always investigate and punish those complicit in abuses against sexual minorities. Furthermore, there is evidence that state actors have been and continue to be involved in forced disappearances and extrajudicial killings adding to the reasons why LGBTQ persons would fear even approaching their state for protection.\n\n[14] During the hearing, the Panel asked the claimant if he felt he would be protected by the police. The claimant testified that he feared that if he needed their protection, they would not assist him and testified that he has sought protection in the past and has not been supported. The Panel finds that the claimant\u2019s testimony and the objective evidence presented demonstrate that adequate state protection would not be available to the claimant in Mexico.\n\nInternal Flight Alternative, IFA\n\n[15] During the hearing, the Panel proposed Puerta Vallarta and Mexico City as potential IFAs. In order to determine whether a viable IFA exists, the Panel must consider a two (2) pronged test. The basis for this test is the cases of Rasaratnam and Thirunavukkarasu. The Board must be satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that there is no serious possibility of the appellant being persecuted in the part of the country to which it finds an IFA exists. Conditions in that part of the country, considered to be an IFA, must be such that it would not be unreasonable, in all circumstances, including those particular to the appellant, for him or her to seek refuge there. Claimants bear the burden of proof to show that they face a serious possibility or reasonable chance of persecution in the entire country and specifically in the potential IFA areas named.\n\n[16] During the hearing, when asked whom he feared, the claimant testified that he feared homophobic persons in society and random physical assaults throughout the country. The claimant\u2019s testimony about the police is supported by information contained in the National Documentation Package. One (1) Response to Information Request states, \u201cAccording to the US country reports 2016, civil society groups claim that police routinely subjected LGBTI persons to mistreatment while in custody. The Executive Commission of Attention to Victims report indicates that at least one (1) out of 10 people surveyed has been detained and that abuse during detention was evident including physical violence, arbitrary detention and due process violations. According to the report by the transgender law centre in Cornell University Law School LGBT Clinic, police harassment against the LGBT community remains high in Mexico City.\n\n[17] The Panel notes that objective evidence indicates that in Puerta Vallarta and Mexico City there is greater tolerance of sexual minorities, at least in select districts of the regions. Despite this evidence, the Panel finds that, in the particular circumstances of the claimant, having considered all of his testimony that the threat of harm to him would not be reduced to the extent that there would be no serious possibility that he would face persecution for reasons of his sexual orientation by his relocation to the proposed IFA locales. The Panel finds that, under the particular circumstances of this case, country information indicates that gay men are frequently targeted in Mexico by state and civilian agents for serious harm, which indicates that there is a serious possibility that this claimant would face persecution throughout Mexico. The claimant could not live openly as a gay man Puerto Vallarta or Mexico City without out fear of attack from members of society. Further, the Panel finds that the claimant faces a serious possibility throughout Mexico.\n\n[18] The Panel finds that it is unnecessary to make determination on the second prong of the IFA test as to whether the claimant\u2019s relocation there would be reasonable under all the circumstances. In the particular circumstances of this claimant, there is no viable internal flight alternative available to him in Mexico.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[19] Having considered all the evidence, the Panel finds there is a serious possibility that the claimant would face persecution in Mexico for reasons of his sexual orientation and belonging to the social group of homosexual males. Therefore, the Panel finds that the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 and his claim is accepted. And that concludes the reasons.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

The claimant is seeking refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. In deciding this claim, I have taken into consideration the chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9 proceedings before the IRB involving sexual orientation and gender identity and expression.\n\n[2] Briefly, the claimant is a 25-year-old male. The allegations are contained in the original Basis of Claim form and the amended BOC or Basis of Claim form. In summary, the claimant alleges that he was asked by the Jalisco New Generation Cartel known as CJNG to transport and courier drug shipments in the vehicles owned by his family business. The claimant refused and was threatened with death on an immediate basis if he did not comply. In addition, in his amended BOC, the claimant alleges that he fears persecution in Mexico due to his sexual orientation as he is attracted to men. I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA.\n\n[3] The claimant\u2019s personal identity and Mexican citizenship has been established on a balance of probabilities as per a copy of his Mexican passport contained on the record as well as his testimony there. In assessing the credibility of the evidence presented by the claimant, the panel refers to the Federal Court of Appeal in Maldonado, wherein the court stated in part that when a claimant swears to tell the truth of certain allegations, this creates a presumption that those allegations are true unless, there would be a reason to doubt their truthfulness. I found the claimant\u2019s testimony to be credible with regard to his sexual orientation. The allegations of criminal behavior by the cartel against him are criminal in nature and would normally be assessed under subsection 97(1) one of the IRPA. However, I find that the claim succeeds based on the claimant\u2019s sexual orientation. Therefore, I do not need to analyze the cartel issues in my reasons. As previously stated, I found his testimony regarding his sexual orientation to be straightforward, spontaneous, genuine, and credible. There was no notable contradictions within the testimony or between the testimony and the documentary evidence. The claimant testified on how he grew up in a traditional society where sexual minorities were unable to freely express themselves.\n\n[4] The claimant had to suppress his sexual orientation to avoid harm. The claimant\u2019s father learned of his sexual orientation indirectly while the claimant still lived in Mexico and was not supportive and in fact quite abusive. The claimant\u2019s mother, who now resides in Canada, has provided a letter attesting to the claimant\u2019s sexuality and has been noted to be more supportive in that regard concerning his son. The claimant testified that he is currently in a relationship with a man, and he provided testimony on the nature of that relationship and the activities that he and his partner do. I accept that the claimant is in a relationship with a man. He also testified on how he fears discrimination, harassment, and violence in Mexico, especially because he is attracted to men. The claimant has supported personal disclosure in support of his claim, including a letter from his current partner, corroborating the relationship. In addition, there are several letters in the disclosure package corroborating his sexual orientation from friends as well as a sister. As well, there is a letter of engagement from XXXX XXXX, evidencing the claimant\u2019s involvement in the LGBTQ community. He is attending programs in that regard, the documentary evidence is in line with his allegations. I have no reason to doubt the trustworthiness or the reliability of these documents. Therefore, I give his disclosure full weight in corroborating the allegations around his sexual orientation. I find that the claimant has established a subjective fear of persecution based on his credible testimony and evidence with respect to his sexual orientation. The claimant fears discrimination, harassment, and violence in Mexico from segments of the population who are prejudiced. The panel or I also considered the country conditions of Mexico for members of sexual orientation.\n\n[5] Persecution generally involves sustained or systemic violation of basic human rights. In some cases, however, even a single transgression of the individual\u2019s human rights, if severe enough, may constitute persecution. The chairperson\u2019s guideline-9 states that the following instances of discrimination may cumulatively amount to persecution, restrictions on access to employment, restrictions on access to health care, restrictions on access to housing, being targeted, or repeated acts of intimidation. The National Documentation Package (NDP) states that Mexico has a quote machismo culture where any sign of femininity in men is viewed as problematic. Legislation is in place to protect sexual minorities, although they continue to experience discrimination, harassment, and violence. There have been some improvements in social societal tolerance of LGBTQ individuals in recent years. The international gay, lesbian, bisexual, trans, and intersex association report indicates that 52% of survey respondents strongly disagree with the statement that being an LGBTQ person should be a crime, while only 8% agree with this statement. 81% of respondents stated that they had no concerns with LGBTQ individuals, while 8% stated they should that they would be very uncomfortable. The 69% of the survey respondents believe that homosexuality should be accepted in 2019, which represents a 15% increase from 2002. The same source states that 49% of the respondents opposed same-sex marriage and there was a strong opposition to adoption to same-sex couples. Public opinion polls indicate that attitudes as well towards transgender people are mixed. For example, 83% of the respondents agree that transgendered people should be protected from discrimination by the government; however, only 66.6% agreed that transgender people should be allowed to marry a person of their birth sex.\n\n[6] The country condition evidence indicates that sexual minorities experienced violence in Mexico. Between 1995 and 2014, there was a total of 1218 murders in Mexico, due to the victim\u2019s real or perceived sexual orientation. There were 976 male victims, 226 transgender victims, and 16 female victims. The country conditions indicate that gay men and transgender women are at a higher risk of violence than other categories of LGBTQ individuals, such as lesbians. The NDP states that LGBTQ individuals are mistreated by state authorities. Police selectively apply public indecency laws to prosecute sexual minorities, especially transgender individuals. Sensitivity training has been provided to police officers in some parts of Mexico to promote police empathy towards different vulnerable communities. Further, the NDP states that crimes against LGBTQ individuals are not always investigated and punished. The country conditions indicate that state actors commit abuses against members of the LGBTQ community. The NDP evidence suggests that discrimination and employment is still a problem in Mexico. LGBTQ individuals generally have access to employment if they behave in a discreet manner. For those who are open about their sexual orientation, they are more likely to face discrimination. The NDP item 6.1 indicates that 37% of gay men surveyed stated that HIV testing was a condition of employment for them. While there are antidiscrimination laws in Mexico aimed at protecting LGBTQ individuals, it is evident that employers still use discriminatory tactics to target sexual minorities. Members of the LGBTQ community face discrimination when it comes to housing. According to the NDP, 30% of women and 35% of men would not rent a room in their home to a gay or lesbian individual.\n\n[7] According to the latest Department of State reports, there were reports that the government did not always investigate and punish those complicit in abuses against sexual minorities. Furthermore, there is evidence that state actors have been and continued to be involved in forced disappearances and extrajudicial killings, adding to the reason why LGBTQ persons would fear even approaching the state for protection. I find that the objective evidence presented demonstrates that adequate state protection would not be available to the claimant in Mexico. During the hearing, I proposed that Mexico City would be a potential Internal Flight Alternative for the claimant, in order to determine whether a viable IFA exists, the panel must consider a two-pronged test. The Board must be satisfied on a balance of probabilities that there is no serious possibility of the claimant being persecuted in the country to which it finds an IFA exists. The condition in that part of the country to be considered an IFA must be such that it would not be reasonable in all circumstances, including those particular to the claimant, for him or her to seek refuge there. The claimant bears the burden of proof to show that they face a serious possibility or a reasonable chance of persecution in the entire country and specifically in the potential IFA areas named.\n\n[8] During the hearing, when I asked the claimant whom he feared, he testified that he feared homophobic individuals and that the police often target homosexual people for robberies, assaults, and murder, despite Mexico City having a reputation as one (1) of the more gay friendly areas in Mexico. I do note that the objective evidence indicates that in Mexico City, there is greater tolerance of sexual minorities at least in select districts of the city. Despite this evidence, I find that under particular circumstances of the claimant, having considered all of his testimony and the threat of harm to him, and I find that the threat of harm would not be reduced to the extent that there would be no serious possibility that he would face persecution for reasons of his sexual orientation by relocation to the proposed IFA of Mexico City. I find that under the particular circumstance of this case, country information suggests that gay men are frequently targeted in Mexico by state and civilian agents for serious harm, and it indicates that there is a serious possibility that this claimant would face persecution throughout Mexico. The claimant could not live as an openly gay man in Mexico City without fear of attacks from members of society. Furthermore, I find that the claimant faces a serious possibility of persecution throughout Mexico. I find that it is not necessary to make a determination of the second prong of the IFA test as to whether the claimant\u2019s relocation there would be reasonable under all the circumstances. In his particular circumstances, there is no viable IFA option available to him in Mexico.\n\nHaving considered all the evidence, I find that there is a serious possibility that the claimant would face persecution in Mexico for reasons of his sexual orientation and belonging to the social group of homosexual males. Therefore, the panel or I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96, and his claim for refugee protection is accepted.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

Mary Akhbari\nCountry: Mexico\nRPD Number: TC2-35150\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2023-01721\nATIP Pages: N\/A\n\nDECISION\n\n[1] MEMBER: Okay, I have had an opportunity to examine the evidence before me, and I am ready to render my decision orally. You will receive an unedited copy of the transcript in the near future, and your Counsel will get a copy by email in the next couple of days. The claimant, XXXX XXXX XXXX (ph), claims to be a citizen of Mexico and is claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. The Board\u2019s information record also includes XXXX\u2019s name at birth. Because XXXX has not yet legally changed his name, I will include this name on the cover page of the decision to prevent any processing or administrative problems and because of its consistency with his national identity documents, specifically his Mexican passport.\n\n[2] I find that you are a Convention refugee because you have established you face a serious possibility of persecution in Mexico as a member of a particular social group, namely members of the two (2) spirit LGBTQI community. In deciding your claim, I have taken into account the Chairperson\u2019s Guidelines on sexual orientation and gender identity expression, the guidelines on gender considerations in proceedings before the Board. These are guidelines 9 and 4, respectively.\n\n[3] I have also considered and applied the recently updated accessibility guidelines, guideline 8, which had previously been referred to as the vulnerable persons guidelines. Under the previous guideline 8, which was in effect until October 30th, 2023, you were designated a vulnerable person. Today, we implemented the accommodations you were granted in line with those recommended by professionals that you have seen and with the guidelines as outlined in the new guideline 8.\n\n[4] The details of your claim are set out in your Basis of Claim form, which you signed on the 14 July, 2022, and updated by amendments dated 29 November, 2023. These documents are in Exhibits 2 and 2.1.\n\n[5] In short, since you were five (5) years old, you realized that you felt differently from others around you, particularly little girls. Your preferences for toys and clothing were more aligned to those of your brothers.\n\n[6] You later recognized your attraction to other females. At 15, you came out as a lesbian to your parents after you solidified these feelings together with your first girlfriend. You were in each other\u2019s lives from 2010 to 2016. Your family was not happy but provided you with some space to be together as long as you kept your relationship mainly hidden. In fact, your parents were more focussed on your brother, who had also come out to them as gay.\n\n[7] Your girlfriend\u2019s family was more actively disapproving, and your girlfriend\u2019s mother even attacked you, expressing her opposition.\n\n[8] Despite having to hide the true nature of your relationship and despite bullying and harassment that you faced, you stayed together for many years. You finally left your first love in 2016, returning the engagement ring that she had given you.\n\n[9] By then, you were living with your older siblings alternately in Playa del Carmen, where you were able to work and go to school. There, as you had in your hometown, you faced both gender-based and sexual harassment. You also faced harassment and threats in particular from male co-workers, especially those who knew your sexual orientation and who threatened to rape you to change you. This made you angry, but you maintained your focus on earning the money you needed to save in order to leave Mexico, and despite the challenges that you faced, you managed to work and study hard.\n\n[10] In XXXX 2017, your sister\u2019s boyfriend sexually touched you when you were living with her. You returned at that time to live with your brother, and your sister refused to believe you, even when your brother interceded.\n\n[11] Later, the situation with male co-workers escalated after you were moved to a new workplace. You told these co-workers to stop harassing you and you reported them, but the management and the human resource people did not support you. By XXXX 2022, you quit.\n\n[12] Worse, on XXXX XXXX, 2022, a male co-worker whose advances you rebuffed hit you. He seriously injured your face and your knee. You could not afford to access medical treatment and you were afraid of missing the flight that you had booked for the next day to Germany.\n\n[13] You were travelling to Germany both in order to leave Mexico and because you wanted to meet a woman you had begun to date after you met online. On XXXX XXXX, 2022, you travelled to Berlin, where the relationship with this woman deteriorated after she refused to help you.\n\n[14] In order to save money, you had purchased a less expensive flight to Berlin because it included routing to Canada. When things fell apart in Berlin, you used the remaining portion of your ticket to fly to Canada via Munich. You said help at the airport when you arrived in Toronto on XXXX XXXX 2022, and soon thereafter, you formally sought refugee protection.\n\n[15] In Canada, you have clarified for yourself that you are not a lesbian and you have undertaken a transition process to fully embody your authentic self. You have chosen the name XXXX and you will undertake legal steps necessary to formally change it, and you have also accessed substantial support here in Canada, including at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.\n\n[16] You have established your identity as a national of Mexico on a balance of probabilities by your testimony and a copy of your passport, which is in Exhibit 1 as well as in Exhibit 4 and 7.\n\n[17] I find you are a very credible witness and I believe what you have alleged in support of your claim. Your testimony was open, straightforward, thoughtful, and natural, and you answered my wide-ranging questions about the core aspects of your account without any hesitation. There were no relevant inconsistencies in your testimony or contradictions between it and the other evidence before me that you did not satisfactorily explain. Specifically, I accept your explanations for why you travelled to Germany before coming to Canada and yet did not claim refugee protection there.\n\n[18] You have provided substantial, relevant, and probative personal documentation that corroborates all aspects of your claim. Specifically, these documents are in Exhibit 7. An additional \u2014 in addition to more identity documents, including your national identity card and birth certificate issued by Mexican authorities, you also disclosed many personal, professional, and medical documents that contain information that is consistent in content and chronology with your testimony and your overall account.\n\n[19] Many of the documents confirm your work and education in Mexico and your XXXX XXXX. XXXX of your work are in Exhibit 7, and you sold some of these to raise funds for your airfare to leave Mexico. To the heart of your claim, you provided several medical documents from a number of agencies, including XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. These confirm your efforts to know yourself, to live authentically, and to gather support for your transition process here in Canada. Other evidence include letters from several persons who have witnessed and participated in various ways in your journey, including your mother, your brother, your sister, your former girlfriends, former co-workers, and even a lifelong friend who has watched you grow and overcome challenges since you were in primary school together. I also note the several medical documents in evidence that reflect injuries to your head over your lifetime, and these have XXXX XXXX XXXX and given you XXXX. Other XXXX and XXXX reports reflect the impact of other injuries you have suffered XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, including by former co-workers, your sister\u2019s boyfriend, and even your family members, who have not always fully or unconditionally supported you.\n\n[20] Many photographs (inaudible) Exhibit 7 reflect your past romantic relationships and your newfound community in Canada. Others show your family, and academic accomplishments, and past work experiences, including with a group of women that you very much enjoyed. The photographs also show a range of moments in your life, when you sometimes lived in hiding behind a wall of feminine clothes and hair, and sometimes lived more openly after you cut your hair and wore more comfortable clothes.\n\n[21] Again, all of these documents are consistent with your account of who you are and both who and what you fear if you return to Mexico. In your own words, you fear being raped and killed if you return, and you learned when you were young by the example of a young person who lived near you that such things are possible. For all of these reasons, I accept the evidence that you have presented, both documentary and testamentary, and find it to be credible.\n\n[22] A person who seeks protection as a Convention refugee has to establish what we call a well-founded fear of persecution on a Convention ground. There are two (2) parts. A person has to show that he is afraid of persecution, and there has to be information about what we know is happening in a country \u2014 in Mexico, in your case \u2014 that corroborates why that person is afraid. So, there is a subjective piece and an objective piece.\n\n[23] In your case, the primary Convention ground is membership in a particular social group. You are a member of the 2SLGBTQI+ community. You are subject to persecution in Mexico both as a person who was born into a female body and perceived by many to be female or a woman because you are attracted to females and you face persecution as a person who self-identifies as male and is undertaking a related transition to be able to live fully as XXXX. The nature of persecution you face, therefore, is both general and community-based given the highly patriarchal context in Mexico, where gender norms are very important and expectations around them matter, especially as they relate to religious beliefs, including in your own family, and the persecution that you face is personal because of the direct targeting that you have experienced in the past, including by co-workers, persons connected to your family, and even members of your own family who have not fully embraced all of who you are.\n\n[24] Your actions and decisions which you have undertaken in order to protect yourself and live authentically are consistent with those of a person who fears persecution in Mexico, and I find that you have established that you subjectively fear persecution as a member of the LGBT community there. In making this finding, I have considered that you would not have left Mexico, including your family and your community, unless you had to in order to protect your security and your life.\n\n[25] The objective documents form a clear basis for your subjective fear. The country condition documents in the National Documentation Package for Mexico dated 29 September, 2023, are in Exhibit 3, and Counsel\u2019s documents are in Exhibit 8. All of the documents before me about the situation in Mexico are consistent with your allegations that you face a serious possibility of persecution there if you return.\n\n[26] According to the country condition information, there has been an increase in public tolerance of members of the LGBT community in Mexico. However, the objective evidence is also clear that lethal violence against members of the LGBTQI community continues to be one (1) of the most significant human rights problems in Mexico, including the discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, and these continue to be structurally rooted in beliefs in Mexico.\n\n[27] Crimes against sexual minorities are constant and motivated by prejudice. An estimated 76.4 percent of LGBTQI persons in Mexico have faced physical violence, 53.3 percent having been assaulted in public spaces. The objective evidence indicates that 1,310 lesbian, gay, bisexual, or trans persons were murdered in Mexico between 1995 and 2016, most of them at home or on the street, and in the last three (3) years, more than 200 members of the LGBTQ community have been murdered, with 93 percent of those being targeted being gay men. The violence has increased following the Mexican president\u2019s now-withdrawn proposal to formally constitutionalize the right to same-sex marriage throughout the country, and for every one (1) LGBTQI person\u2019s murder reported in the press, advocates estimate there are at least two (2) others that go unreported. So, the numbers are reported but are much lower than what the people actually working in on the ground know is likely to be true.\n\n[28] According to some of the NDP reports, the Mexican government has taken \u201csignificant steps\u201d toward equality in the protection of members of the LGBTQ community, and there are some details about these different steps in the NDP, but the more important point is that the introduction of legislative protections in Mexico suffers from \u201coperational inadequacies and ineffectiveness.\u201d In other words, the laws do not work if they are not being enforced and used to actually protect people. They are not working.\n\n[29] The United Nations Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial or Arbitrary Executions has condemned the \u201calarming pattern of grotesque homicides of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender persons and the broad impunity for these crimes, sometimes with the suspected complicity of investigative authorities.\u201d In other words, authorities sometimes look the other way when members of the LGBT community are harmed. Killings of LGBTQI persons are marked by either \u201ca total failure to investigate or faulty investigations guided by stereotypes and prejudice, and authorities are quick to close such cases, calling them crimes of passion and choosing not to pursue protection or prosecution as seriously as they should.\u201d In this way, rights for members of the LGBTQ community are treated as exceptions to be granted at the discretion of local officials.\n\n[30] The country condition documents also indicate that less than 10 percent of crimes committed (inaudible), and in the case of homophobic or transphobic crimes, even people who are found guilty are often set free, despite state procedures and policies that are supposed to exist to protect sexual minorities. They do not necessarily effectively protect them in practice.\n\n[31] The documentary evidence also indicates that while Mexico has some laws in place to criminalize official corruption, the government does not enforce these laws effectively either, and elected officials in Mexican \u2014 Mexico enjoy impunity from prosecution, including from corruption offences in office.\n\n[32] (inaudible) very clear the objective evidence reflects a complicity of state actors in the persecution of members of the LGBT community. Same-sex couples engaged in public displays of affection are frequently targeted by police abuse and arbitrary detention by state agents, often with excessive use of force or verbal abuse because of what is considered to be immoral behaviour in public spaces, and officials from public \u2014 from the public ministry often mistreat members of the LGBTQI community and refuse to open investigations for crimes against them.\n\n[33] The relationship between state actors and cartels, especially in certain areas of the country, further complicates the situation for members of the LGBT community who are further endangered by related threats.\n\n[34] (inaudible) are increasing in Mexico, especially since the pandemic. 10 women die every day, and these are not a priority for the Mexican government \u2014 or the Mexican government agenda. Even the current president of Mexico normalizes violence against women, according to the objective documents.\n\n[35] (inaudible) is particularly dire for trans persons. (inaudible) intersection of gender-based expectations with homophobia and transphobia increases risk, including for persons in the midst of a transition.\n\n[36] Mexico City is a federal district that recognizes gender identity. The other federal states in Mexico do not respect the constitutional laws on this topic. This results in a complex and expensive process to get the identity documents changed when somebody transitions, for example. This is one (1) example of how discrimination, which also can contribute to violence, against these members of the LGBT community remains particularly problematic. So, on the one (1) hand, Mexico City is the safest place to live, and yet even people who live there that are members of the LGBTQ community face pervasive discrimination, hatred, violence, and deal with both police abuse and even torture. (inaudible) the community also, for many, face a lifetime of rejection by their families, employers, and society as a whole, and again, there is an alarming pattern of violence.\n\n[37] In particular, I refer to Item 5.6 on the double pandemic of femicide during the COVID-19 pandemic, and Item 6.1 and 6.4 of the National Documentation Package, including Response to Information Request 1059538.E.\n\n[38] So, having taken into account the objective evidence together with your consistent and credible testimony, I find your fear of persecution in Mexico is well-founded. Given the evidence before me, both personal and objective, I find you face a serious possibility of persecution in Mexico if you return.\n\n[39] In regard to the totality of evidence before me, I find you have presented sufficient clear and convincing evidence that rebuts the presumption that state protection would be available to you if you return to Mexico and seek it. I find the state is unwilling or unable to protect you, on a balance of probabilities, if you return to Mexico.\n\n[40] In making this finding, I am following the Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s decision in Ward in relying on your own personal experiences and the experiences of others similarly situated to you, including the young person, XXXX (ph), who was raped and killed at the river near you. I also accept that in the highly patriarchal Mexican context, you have experienced a lifelong series of denials, and rejections, and XXXX, and XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, and otherwise, and in this context, seeking protection from police when you believe it would not be forthcoming is unreasonable.\n\n[41] This possibility of persecution you faced exists throughout the country. There is no viable internal flight alternative available to you. It would not help you to move to another part of Mexico because these feelings are across the country and very deeply rooted. You have done your best to protect yourself even by relocating within Mexico to Playa del Carmen to continue to work and study while staying with your siblings and by keeping a discreet or, sometimes, even hidden profile. It is not reasonable for you to have to hide who you are, XXXX. It is not reasonable for you to have to hide in order to live. So, living fully and safely is not possible for you in Mexico given the situation that exists throughout the country, including the depth of homophobia and transphobia and lack of meaningful protection there.\n\n[42] I find that you have established you face a serious possibility of persecution in Mexico on a Convention ground. I therefore find that you are a Convention refugee, and I accept your claim.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

Sharma\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Yelda Zohal Anwari\nCountry: Mexico\nRPD Number: TC2-25976\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2023-01721\nATIP Pages: N\/A\n\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n[1] These are the reasons for the decision in the claim for refugee protection made by XXXX XXXX XXXX (\u201cthe claimant\u201d).\n\n[2] The claimant alleges to be a citizen of Mexico and is claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).[1]\n\n[3] In rendering this decision, the panel has considered and applied Guideline 9: Proceedings Before the IRB Involving Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression, and Sex Characteristics (SOGIESC Guidelines)[2] and in this regard it has carefully examined the claimant\u2019s oral testimony in line with the factors to be considered when applying this Guideline.\n\nALLEGATIONS\n\n[4] The facts and events alleged in support of the claim are set out in the claimant\u2019s Basis of Claim (BOC)[3] forms. The claimant fears harm at the hand of the XXXX police and C\u00e1rtel de Jalisco Nueva Generaci\u00f3n (CJNG) due to his family\u2019s past altercations with both the police and cartel.\n\n[5] When the claimant\u2019s family departed for Canada in 2019, he continued to live in Mexico with his grandparents. In XXXX 2021, the claimant received messages from a police officer, showing a video of the claimant walking home.\n\n[6] The claimant alleges that he experiences mental health problems emanating from the abuse he experienced as a child, which he has not disclosed to his family. The claimant also identifies as a bisexual man, and he has also not disclosed his sexual orientation to his family.\n\nPROCEDURAL MATTERS\n\n[7] On December 13, 2022, the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) received letters from the claimant\u2019s family members, in which they gave consent to the RPD to access materials of their refugee claim in support of the claimant\u2019s claim. During the hearing, the panel instructed the claimant\u2019s counsel to submit all documentation from the previous refuge claims of the claimant\u2019s family members that the claimant wishes to use in support of his own claim. The claimant\u2019s counsel stated that they understood. On January 16, 2023, the claimant\u2019s counsel submitted their written submissions and post-hearing documents[4], which was entered into evidence.\n\nDETERMINATION\n\n[8] The panel finds that the claimant is a person in need of protection, pursuant to section 97(1)(b) of the IRPA, because he would be subjected personally to a risk to life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, should he return to Mexico, on a balance of probabilities.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nIdentity\n\n[9] The claimant\u2019s personal identity and Mexican nationality were established based on a copy of his Mexican passport.[5] The panel is satisfied, based on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant has established his identity.\n\nNexus\n\n[10] The panel finds that the claimant has established a nexus to a Convention ground, namely his membership in a particular social group as a bisexual man.\n\n[11] In addition to this established nexus, the claimant alleges that he fears harm from the CJNG and the Mexican police, given his family\u2019s previous altercation with the two groups. The panel finds therefore that the claimant was not targeted by the CNJG or the Mexican police by reason of the claimant\u2019s gender, race, nationality, political opinion, religion, or membership in a particular social group. As such, the claimant\u2019s allegations will also be assessed under subsection 97(1)(b) of the IRPA only.\n\n[12] As the panel has made a positive determination on this claim given the 97(1) risk the claimant faces upon return to Mexico, the analysis surrounding the 97(1) risk will be the focus of this decision.\n\nCredibility\n\n[13] When a claimant swears that certain facts are true, this creates a presumption that they are true unless there is a valid reason to doubt their truthfulness.[6]\n\n[14] The claimant testified candidly and spontaneously in a way that reflected the events reported in his BOC narrative and was responsive to all questions asked. There were no significant inconsistencies or omissions which caused the panel concern with regards to relating his experiences in being pursued by the agents of harm, and the panel considers that he provided a truthful and detailed recollection to the best of his abilities.\n\n[15] The claimant testified about his family\u2019s altercation with the police with sufficient detail, consistency, and spontaneity. The claimant testified that in XXXX 2017, the claimant\u2019s brother, was involved in an altercation with the police, where he was beaten up outside their home and threatened with retaliation.\n\n[16] In testimony, the claimant explained that the assault led his mother to make a formal complaint against the police officers with the Specialized Prosecutors Office as well as the Human Rights Commission. The claimant alleged that his mother began to receive threats asking her to withdraw the charges against the XXXX police or she and her family would be killed. The claimant stated that his brother was kidnapped by the CJNG in XXXX 2019, but the claimant admitted that he does not know the details of this ordeal as his brother does not talk about it.\n\n[17] In addition, the panel finds the claimant\u2019s testimony regarding his sexual orientation as a bisexual man to be credible and detailed. The claimant was asked at what point he realized his sexual orientation and was asked about his relationship with his former male partner in Mexico. He testified how he struggled to come to terms with his identity given the abuse he experienced as a child and the machoistic society he grew up in.\n\n[18] The panel finds that the claimant did not exaggerate or tailor his evidence. The claimant was clear about what he experienced. For example, the claimant was restrained in his description of what he experienced, and the panel accepts that those were his experiences.\n\n[19] The claimant also provided supporting documents[7] in support of their claim to corroborate the allegations of harm. This included the Basis of Claim forms completed by his family members, police reports filed by the claimant\u2019s mother, and corresponding evidence of the case filed from the Specialized Prosecutor\u2019s office.\n\n[20] The panel have no reason to doubt the authenticity of these documents and the panel accepts that the claimant has corroborated these allegations outlines in his BOC narrative.\n\n[21] However, the panel did have concerns about the claimant\u2019s delay in leaving Mexico. The claimant testified that his two brothers, mother and stepfather, left Mexico for Canada in the year 2019. The claimant explained that he wanted to continue to live in Mexico with his grandfather and that his mother didn\u2019t have enough money to take him along to Canada.\n\n[22] The claimant further explained that he received WhatsApp messages and videos taken of the claimant walking officer in XXXX 2021. The claimant stated that these messages and videos were taken by a police office, who insinuated that they are watching the claimant. As such, the claimant decided to leave Mexico but his plans were further derailed by the COVID-19 pandemic, until he was able to leave Mexico in XXXX 2021. The panel finds this explanation to be reasonable and the panel does not draw a negative inference in this regard.\n\n[23] Accordingly, the panel finds on a balance of probabilities that the claimant was a credible witness as to his experiences, and the panel is satisfied that he has credibly established his allegations with regards to the threats and harm they faced from the XXXX police and their ties with the CJNG.\n\nState Protection\n\n[24] While not raised as an issue, the panel has also considered whether state protection is available to the claimant and concluded that it is not. There is clear and convincing evidence before me that the state is unable or unwilling to protect the claimant. The panel finds that it would be objectively unreasonable for the claimant to seek further protection of the state in light of his particular circumstances.\n\n[25] In the case at bar, the claimant\u2019s mother filed police reports against the agents of harm, police officers affiliated the CJNG. The claimant alleges that their complaints to the police actually worsened their situation as the CJNG abducted the claimant\u2019s brother in retaliation of the police reports filed and the commencement of the investigation.\n\n[26] In terms of state protection, the local and state authorities in Mexico are generally unwilling and unable to protect victims of gang violence. According to item 7.22 of the National Documentation Package (NDP), ongoing corruption, weakness, and lack of confidence in Mexican law enforcement, particularly of local and state police forces, but also the Federal Police, have created a climate of impunity and increased criminal violence.[8] Despite the state\u2019s attempts to eradicate drug trafficking and target top-level gang leaders, these strategies have simply resulted in shifting alliances and the emergence of new gangs. In addition, the documents evidence in the NDP states corruption and complicity with criminals are rampant.[9]\n\n[27] The government\u2019s Federal Statistics Agency estimated that 94 percent of crimes were unreported or not investigated. And there were reports of some government agents who are complicit with the international organized criminal gangs, and there were low prosecution and conviction rates for these abuses.[10]\n\n[28] For these reasons, the panel finds that the claimant has rebutted the presumption of state protection.\n\nInternal Flight Alternative (IFA)\n\n[29] At the outset of the hearing, the panel proposed the IFA location of Mexico City and Puerto Vallarta.\n\n[30] The panel finds that the claimant does not have a viable IFA. The panel has considered the totality of the evidence and find that there remains a personalized risk under section 97(1) of the IRPA for the claimant in IFA location.\n\n[31] Item 1.2 in the NDP denotes that Mexico is a large country with a population of over 132 million people covering an area of over 1.9 million sq. km. The law provides for freedom of movement and the right to travel within Mexico.[11] In determining whether the CJNG has both the \u201cmeans and motivation\u201d to locate the claimant in the IFA locations, the panel has considered the size of the cartels, their areas of operation, and their levels of interest in the claimant.\n\n[32] The Mexican government designated the CJNG as one of the most dangerous in the country and one with a national reach. CJNG is known to have a presence in at least 27 out of 32 Mexican states. Its rapid expansion throughout Mexico and into the United States has led to a surge in violence and use of heavy weaponry including armoured vehicles and rocket-propelled grenade launchers.[12]\n\n[33] According to NPD item 7.8 and item 3.5, a powerful cartel could use several tactics to locate a person of interest, such as having access to national databases through corrupt government officials. The NDP Item 7.15 describes the strategic alliances that the cartels have forged with each other to extend their reach beyond their areas of operation. Considering the profile of the CJNG being the most influential cartel in Mexico at the moment, the panel finds that, on a balance of probabilities, that the CJNG has the means to locate the claimant if properly motivated.\n\n[34] On the issue of the motivation, according to NDP items 7.8 and 7.15, a personal vendetta to the ones that refuse to collaborate with the cartels could motivate a gang to track someone, even outside their area of operation. Considering previously cited sources, in the circumstances, the panel finds that, on the balance of probabilities, the agents of harm may be motivated to locate and harm the claimant due to the matter of personal revenge. In the particular circumstances of the claimant, his family members have personally angered police officers alleged ties to the CJNG due to the police reports filed against the police officers who physically assaulted the claimant\u2019s brother. According to the claimant\u2019s allegations, which the panel has found credible, the police officers and the CJNG to continue threatening and harassing the claimant and his family members.\n\n[35] The panel has also considered the level of interest of the agents of harm in the claimant in determining whether, on a balance of probabilities, a section 97(1)(b) risk exists for them in the IFA locations proposed.\n\n[36] Country condition evidence suggests that the CJNG has the ability to operate nationally, even where they do not ordinarily control the territory, but that such efforts would be reserved for more high-profile targets, given the level of resource expenditure required. This is especially the case in cities such as the proposed IFA locations where the CJNG is not known to have a significant presence.\n\n[37] However, considering the above, on a balance of probabilities, the panel finds it credibly established that the agents of harm, which in this claim are police officers and their ties to the CJNG, have the means and motivation to seek out the claimant on a national level, and it is very likely they would make significant efforts to seek them out beyond the local area where they originally came to their attention.\n\n[38] Having considered all of the testimony and evidence, the panel finds that the first prong of the IFA test has failed and that there is no viable IFA for the claimant. Therefore, the panel finds on a balance of probabilities that the claimant would face a personal risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, in the IFA locations.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[39] In conclusion, based on the totality of the evidence, the panel finds that on a balance of probabilities that the claimant would face a personalized risk to their life or of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment throughout Mexico. The claim is therefore accepted.\n\n(signed) K.

Cortes-Diaz\nCounsel for the Claimant(s): Suel Hee Lee\nCountry: Mexico\nRPD Number: TC2-19680\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N\/A\nATIP Number: A-2023-01721\nATIP Pages: N\/A\n\nDECISION\n\n[1] MEMBER: So I had the opportunity to look at the evidence and also listen to your testimony and I am ready to give the claimant a decision today.\n\n[2] So these are the reasons for the decision in the claim of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The file number is TC2-19680. Who claims to be a citizen of Mexico and is claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n\n[3] In deciding this claim, I have considered the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 4, all relevant factors, such as the social and cultural context in which the claimant found herself, along with issues of state protection and country conditions were examined through the lens of the Gender Guidelines.\n\n[4] Details of the allegations can be found in the Basis of Claim form, but specifically the claimant alleges persecution at the hands of her stepfather, XXXX (ph). The claimant suffered extensive domestic violence, abuse as a child growing up in a violent household. The claimant claims that her stepfather is a man with criminal connections who has the ability to harm and kill her and her newborn baby.\n\n[5] In reaching my determination, I have considered all the evidence, including the claimant\u2019s testimony and the documentary evidence. I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA.\n\n[6] I find that there is a nexus between the claimant\u2019s allegations and the Convention grounds of membership in a particular social group, as a woman fearing gender-based violence.\n\n[7] I find that the claimant\u2019s personal identity and nationality as a citizen of Mexico has been established by the claimant\u2019s oral testimony and a copy of her passport contained in the evidence.\n\nCredibility\n\n[8] In assessing the claimant\u2019s testimony, I was mindful of the potential difficulties in testifying in a remote hearing setting. I was also aware of the claimant\u2019s state of mind during the hearing. I was also mindful of the fact that the claimant had to testify about sensitive issues that transpired in Mexico. I \u2014 therefore, I understand the difficulties that she had presenting her case at times.\n\n[9] I find that the claimant\u2019s spontaneous, sworn testimony is consistent with my knowledge about the cycle of domestic abuse, which is at its core about power and control, and this power and control dynamics are particularly pronounced in societies where women face serious inequalities and discriminatory and harmful gender roles and expectations. I believe this is the case of Mexico. The claimant became emotional while testifying about the abuse she endured at the hands of her stepfather, which is indicative of the trauma that she has suffered and the fear that she has for her life and the life of her baby, if she was going to \u2014 if she were to go back to the same situation in Mexico. I find that \u2014 the claimant to be credible and trustworthy witness. Accordingly, the claimant has established her subjective fear based on her membership in a particular social group, gender.\n\n[10] The claimant has testified and provided supporting documentation regarding the material allegations. She provided pictures, this depicting injuries and bruises that she sustained due to the physical abuse she endured at the hands of the agent of persecution. She also submitted witness letters that corroborate her allegations.\n\nObjective Basis\n\n[11] I find that the claimant \u2014 the claimant\u2019s subjective fear of harm in Mexico, it is supported by the objective evidence in the National Documentation Package. The claimant\u2019s allegations are consistent with objective reports that say that violence in Mexico is widespread, with over half of separated, divorced or widowed women in Mexico having reported to experience \u2014 having experienced emotional, economic or physical abuse in their current or prior relationship. The reason why I mentioned separated, divorced women who have been in intimate relationships is because the claimant\u2019s mother was in an abusive relationship and she suffered all the abuse because she was in a household where her stepfather was abusing her mother and she suffered all the consequences of that abuse, and the abuse extended to herself and her sisters.\n\n[12] So I find that, like I said before, the objective evidence is very clear about the situation of women in Mexico and it also is clear that even though there are legislation in Mexico that is supposed to protect women, but this legislation is not being enforced. So Mexico has passed several laws intended to give women the right to equality and life free of violence and all 32 Mexican states have created and passed their own laws to address violence against women. However, reporting remains slow.\n\n[13] Reports by the United Nations non-government organizations indicates that the reporting rates of violence against act of violence against women and even the way the authorities respond to that violence is ineffective. Tab 5.1 says that none of the protocols and laws related to violence against women have been effective. State and municipal laws addressing domestic violence largely failed to meet the required federal standards, and after \u2014 often were unenforced. The state agents responsible for the practical implementation of the law do not have a gender perspective and they are not committed to women and are openly misogynistic.\n\n[14] In regards to the internal flight alternative, I find that the claimant does not have an IFA. I find that the test fails mainly under prong two (2) of the assessment. I find that for the claimant to relocate to the suggested locations of Cabo San Lucas and M\u00e9rida is unreasonable, taking into consideration the personal circumstances of the claimant. I have taken into consideration the claimant\u2019s education, age, mental health state and work experience to determine how reasonable and feasible it is for a woman with an infant to relocate in Mexico.\n\n[15] Firstly, the claimant has no work experience or professional education of any time or family support, which is so important in Mexico, that would allow her to live independently. I believe that if the claimant were \u2014 was forced to return to Mexico, she will somehow access to the only supports that she has in Mexico and that will put her at risk. The claimant\u2019s BOC states that she is very worried about her sisters, about her family, the family she left behind. I have no doubt that she will reach out in order to \u2014 you know, out of concern to them and it is very easy to suggest that she will display her new location and that can be \u2014 the agent of persecution can find out where the claimant is.\n\n[16] I take into consideration the profile of the agent of persecution. He has exerted violence against her mother, sisters, the claimant, to find out information about the claimant, where she is living and the claimant testified at the beginning of the hearing that she does not talk to her mother anymore, that she has not been in contact with her for almost two (2) years. Why? Because she does not want the agent of persecution to know where she is living. So I find also that the claimant\u2019s evident trauma acquired through the years of abuse also puts her at risk and in a vulnerable state that can attract further violence and victimization.\n\n[17] Having taken all this into consideration, I find that the suggested internal flight alternatives, the locations, are unsafe and unreasonable and this is, of course, done on a balance of probabilities.\n\n[18] In regards to state protection, the objective evidence establishes that the government authorities are not committed to enforcing legislation pertaining to domestic violence in Mexico. I find that adequate state protection will not be reasonably forthcoming in this particular case. I also take into consideration the claimant\u2019s allegations that her stepfather is involved in criminal activities and he pays the police \u2014 he bribes the police so he can be out of jail because somehow he should be in jail, but like, he gets away with a lot of this because he is colluded with the local authorities. So the objective evidence establishes that government authorities are corrupt and they are also not committed to enforcing legislation pertaining to domestic violence. Women do not have the confidence in the authorities to protect them against such acts of violence. Therefore, based on the claimant\u2019s own experience in seeking protection in Mexico and the objective evidence discussed above, I find that she will be unable to access adequate state protection in Mexico and that the presumption of state protection has been rebutted.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[19] For the reasons above, I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee, under section 96 of the IRPA, based on her membership in a particular social group, this is a woman at risk of gender related violence.\n\n[20] Thank you.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

And Guideline 9, involving proceedings before the IRB regarding sexual orientation, gender identity and expression.\n\n[3] Your allegations are fully set out in your Basis of Claim and the principal claimant\u2019s Basis of Claim narrative. In summary, you allege fear of violence and discrimination from your family members, Mexican state, and society at large in Mexico on account of your sexual orientation as lesbian women.\n\n[4] I find that you are both Convention refugees pursuant to section 96 of IRPA for the following reasons.\n\nIdentity\n\n[5] I find that your personal and national identities as citizens of Mexico are established on a balance of probabilities based on your testimonies and copies of your Mexican passports and evidence.\n\nNexus\n\n[6] I find that your allegations have a nexus to the Convention ground of membership in a particular social group of lesbian women, and therefore, your claims have been assessed under section 96 of IRPA.\n\nCredibility\n\n[7] A refugee\u2019s sworn testimony is presumed to be true unless there are valid reasons to doubt their truthfulness. In your case, I found you to be credible witnesses, and I accept your core allegations. Your allegations are set out in detail in your Basis of Claim narrative.\n\n[8] You testified about how you grew up in a traditional society that does not accept diverse sexual orientations. You testified about the impact of this on your lives and that you kept same-sex relationships private. Both of you also testified about the impact on your family relationships, as most of them \u2013 as most of your family members have not accepted your identities as lesbian women.\n\n[9] You have been together for approximately nine (9) years since 2014. You provided a large number of letters of support which corroborate your relationship. You were married in XXXX of this year, and you have provided your marriage licence and certificate as well as photos from your wedding day. I accord these documents full weight in establishing that you are a couple.\n\n[10] The principal claimant testified extensively about your early experiences when your parents learned of your attraction to women, and you provided fluid and elaborated testimony about attending conversion therapy for several years. You testified about discrimination at work and that you were let go by two (2) separate employers on account of your sexual orientation.\n\n[11] Both of you testified about losing housing as well as facing harassment and violence from neighbours and another residence you had in Mexico. Both of which happened on account of your sexual orientation.\n\n[12] At all times, both of you testified in a detailed and spontaneous manner, and there were no material inconsistencies, omissions, or contradictions in your testimony or between your testimony and Basis of Claim narrative or other documents on file.\n\n[13] The letters of support that you have provided corroborate not only that you are a couple, but also the experiences of violence and discrimination that you faced in Mexico on account of your sexual orientation.\n\n[14] In view of all of the above, I find that your allegations have been established on balance of probabilities. Namely, I find that you have established that you are in a same-sex relationship and that you have experienced violence and discrimination on account of your sexual orientation in Mexico. Accordingly, I find that you have established your subjective fear of persecution in Mexico.\n\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution\n\n[15] I find that your subjective fear in Mexico has an objective basis for the following reasons. Item 6.7 of the National Documentation Package, NDP for Mexico, states that 83 percent of Mexicans identify as being Catholic. And the Catholic church has been opposed to the advancement of human rights for the LGBTQ community. Children are taught to remain within the bounds of strict gender roles or else face ostracization from the community.\n\n[16] The United States Department of State report at Item 2.1 of the NDP states that several states in Mexico have passed laws legalizing same-sex marriage and promoting LGBTQ human rights. However, the Board\u2019s own Response to Information Request at Item 6.2 of the NDP notes that despite these positive steps, progress regarding sexual diversity has been slow. This report says that discrimination based on sexual orientation, as well as gender identity and expression, are structural phenomena rooted in Mexican society and culture and that they occur on a daily basis. It states that there are no laws at the federal level that ban conversion therapy.\n\n[17] Item 6.4 of the NDP says that the issue of sexual diversity is also absent in the legislative and executive agendas and continue to be considered taboo. Sexual minorities experience abuse at the hands of the state, including physical violence, arbitrary detention, and due process violations. Crimes against sexual minorities are constant, including intolerance and discrimination persist in homophobia, homicides, arbitrary detention, and physical violence.\n\n[18] 6.7 of the NDP state that homophobia is prevalent in Mexican society as it has extensive social groups. Crimes against sexual and gender minorities are frequent and motivated by prejudices.\n\n[19] Section 5.2 of the NDP states that violence against women also continues to be a widespread problem in Mexico and that femicide is the main cause of death for women aged 15 to 19.\n\n[20] Items 6.5 and 6.2 indicate that discrimination against sexual minorities remains prevalent across Mexico, including in the workplace, access to housing and healthcare.\n\n[21] 6.4 includes statements from the U.N. Special Rapporteur, which has noted that there is an alarming pattern of homicides of LGBTQ individuals in Mexico. And that the perpetrators of these crimes enjoy impunity. Violence against LGBTQ community members has also reportedly increased since the recognition of same-sex marriage throughout Mexico because of backlash to these progressive changes in the law.\n\n[22] In view of all of the above country conditions evidence, I find that your fear in Mexico is objectively well-founded.\n\nState Protection\n\n[23] You testified that you never sought the assistance of the police in Mexico because you did not feel safe doing so. You testified that you were aware the police perpetrate violence against LGBTQ community and do not take report seriously. Your testimony in this regard is supported by the objective country conditions evidence.\n\n[24] Item 7.18 of the NDP reports that police forces in Mexico lack human and material resources to properly investigate crimes. Sources report that police officers also collude with organized crime and that poor working conditions in law enforcement agencies leave police officers particularly vulnerable to bribes and corruption.\n\n[25] Item 6.7 of the NDP states that rules and public morals are at the police and judges\u2019 discretion, which, combined with prejudice and discriminatory attitudes, can lead to abuses against sexual minorities. Police officers are often perpetrators of human rights violations, and many sexual minority individuals fear further harm from the authorities.\n\n[26] Item 5.20 states that there are deep-rooted institutional, structural, and practical barriers which continue to hinder access to justice for women, including that officials in the criminal justice system hold discriminatory stereotypes and have limited knowledge of women\u2019s rights. Complicity, indifference, and mismanagement of cases by law enforcement perpetuate violence, and culprits often go unpunished.\n\n[27] In light of the objective country conditions evidence, as well as your personal circumstances, I find that you have rebutted the presumption of state protection. And that adequate state protection would not be available to you in Mexico on a balance of probabilities.\n\nInternal Flight Alternative\n\n[28] I have considered whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for you in Mexico City. 6.2 of the NDP provides that Mexico City is known as the most progressive city in Mexico when it comes to LGBTQ rights. It has anti-discrimination laws to protect LGBTQ individual then there are legal provisions in Mexico City which are favourable.\n\n[29] You testified that you would not feel safe there as lesbian women because outside of Zona Rosa, hate crimes and discriminations against the LGBTQ community, particularly lesbian women, are still prevalent. Given the absence of operationally effective state protection and the prevalence of homophobia and violence against sexual minorities in Mexico, including by the police, I find that you would face a serious possibility of persecution throughout the country, including in Mexico City.\n\n[30] While there are indications that rights of LGBTQ individuals vary throughout the country, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights reports at Item 6.2 that deep-rooted stereotypes and prejudice persist throughout the country towards LGBTQ people.\n\n[31] Item 6.2 also states that most sexual minorities reported experiencing physical acts of violence or harassment based on their sexual orientation or gender identity throughout Mexico.\n\n[32] 2.1 supports that those crimes are not isolated events but are emblematic of current patterns of conduct and reflect a series of structural problems of intolerance throughout the country.\n\n[33] Item 6.4 of the NDP indicates that Mexico City, along with some other cities in Mexico, are considered to be more accepting of LGBTQ members. And that LGBTQ individuals have reported feeling safe from societal abuse in Zona Rosa in Mexico City. However, they still report feeling fearful of police abuse and extortion.\n\n[34] This report at Item 6.4 indicates that though Zona Rosa in Mexico City is considered to be a safe space for LGBTQ members, violence and discrimination against them are still frequent. The report states that \u201cIn practice, these zones have also proven not to be safe from LGBT-targeted violence and discrimination.\u201d The report states that Mexico City has one of the highest LGBTQ targeted murder rates in the country.\n\n[35] I find that in view of all of the above evidence, there is no viable internal flight alternative available to the claimants in Mexico City, as you would face a serious possibility of persecution throughout the country.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[36] Based on the totality of the evidence, I find you both to be Convention refugees as per section 96 of IRPA, and therefore, your claims are accepted.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

In deciding this claim I have taken into consideration and applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 4 regarding gender considerations and Guideline 9 involving proceedings before the Board involving sexual orientation, gender identity and expression.\n\n[2] Your allegations are fully set out in your Basis of Claim and subsequent amendment filed in the Exhibits. In summary, you allege fear of harm from your father and his friends due to gender-based violence as well as fear of violence and discrimination from your family members and society at large in Mexico on account of your sexual orientation as a lesbian woman. I find that you are a Convention refugee pursuant to Section 96 of IRPA.\n\nIdentity\n\n[3] I find that your personal and national identity as a citizen of Mexico are established on a balance of probabilities based on your testimony and copy of your Mexican passport.\n\nNexus\n\n[4] I find that your allegations have a nexus to the Convention ground of membership in a particular social group of lesbian women and I have therefore assessed your claim under Section 96 of IRPA.\n\nCredibility\n\n[5] A refugee\u2019s sworn testimony is presumed to be true unless there are valid reasons to doubt their truthfulness. In your case, I found you to be a credible witness and I accept your allegations on a balance of probabilities. At your hearing today, you testified about your experiences of abuse as well as about your sexual orientation. Your testimony was detailed and spontaneous and there were no material inconsistencies, omissions, or contradictions in your testimony or between your testimony and Basis of Claim and other documents on file.\n\n[6] You testified about how you grew up in a traditional society that does not accept diverse sexual orientations. You testified about the impact of this on you and that you kept your same sex relationships private with only your mother and sister knowing about them. Your testified about your fear of violence and discrimination on account of your sexual orientation and one of your experiences in forming this fear was that students at your former school were killed on account of their sexual orientation. You testified about mistreatment and discrimination in society, including at your place of employment. You also testified about your experiences of abuse at the hands of your father and his friends and though I did not require you to testify about the details of these experiences, I found the testimony that you did provide about them to be credible.\n\n[7] Finally, you testified about your pervious marriage to someone here in Canada, which ended, as well as your current marriage to your current spouse who I note was a support person during today\u2019s hearing. In support of your allegations, you have provided copies of marriage certificates from both marriages. Other documents you have submitted in support of your allegations include photographs of you and your spouse, numerous letters of support from friends and community members as well as some family members, all of which confirm that you are married. You also submitted other documents that go to support your marriage to your wife including a joint bank account statement. I see no concerns on the face of the documents you have provided to support your claim and I find them credible and probative. Accordingly, I attach full weight to these documents, which go to support your allegations.\n\n[8] I note that you lived in the United StateS for approximately four (4) years before coming to Canada and that you lived there without a valid immigration status. You testified that you did not claim refugee protection there because you were unaware of the process as well as that you resided there with your father, whom you fear due to the history of abuse. In Canada, you delayed in claiming for several months and you explained this by stating that you were initially unaware of the refugee process and you were also married to a Canadian for several of those months. I note that delay in failure to claim are not determinative in and of themselves. I find that your explanations adequately account for these issues and I do not draw negative inferences with respect to the credibility of your allegations.\n\n[9] So in view of all the above I find that you have established your subjective fear of persecution in Mexico on a balance of probabilities.\n\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution\n\n[10] I find that there is an objective basis for what you fear in Mexico for the following reasons. Item 6.7 of the National Documentation Package for Mexico states that Mexico is a \u2013 is majority Catholic country and that the Catholic church has been opposed to the advancement of human rights for the LGBTQ people. Children are taught to remain within the bounds of strict gender roles or else face ostracization. The United States Department of State Report at Item 2.1 of the NDP indicates that several states have passed laws legalizing same sex marriage and promoting LGBTQ human rights, however, the IRB\u2019s Response to Information Request at Item 6.2 notes that despite these legal provisions, progress regarding sexual diversity has been slow in Mexico. This report says that discrimination based on sexual orientation as well as gender identity and expression are structural phenomena rooted in Mexican society and culture which occurs on a daily basis. It states that there are no laws at the Federal level that ban conversion therapy.\n\n[11] Item 6.4 of the NDP states that the issue of sexual diversity is also absent in the legislation and executive agendas and continue to be considered taboo. Sexual minorities experience abuse at the hands of the state including physical violence, arbitrary detention and due process violations. Crimes against sexual minorities are constant including intolerance and discrimination, persistent homophobia, homicides, arbitrary detention, and physical violence. Item 6.7 of the NDP states that homophobia and transphobia \u2013 sorry, the \u2013 a lot of the talking is getting my voice to break up. Item 6.7 of the NDP states that homophobia and transphobia are prevalent in Mexican society and it has extensive social roots. Crimes against sexual and gender minorities are frequent and are motivated by prejudices.\n\n[12] Section 5.2 states that violence against women also continues to be a widespread problem and that femicide is the main cause of death for women aged 15 to 19. 6.5 of the NDP indicates that discrimination against sexual minorities remains prevalent across Mexico including in the workplace, access to housing, and health care. So in view of all of the above objective evidence I find that your fear of persecution in Mexico is objectively well-founded.\n\nState Protection\n\n[13] So you testified that the police have not helped you in your experiences in Mexico and your experiences are supported by the objective evidence about the availability of state protection in Mexico. Item 7.18 states that police forces in Mexico lack human and material resources to properly investigate crimes and for all murders registered between 2010 and 2016, 94.8 percent of cases had no suspect facing charges. Sources report that police officers collude with organized crime and that poor working conditions in law enforcement agencies leave police officers particularly vulnerable to bribes and corruption. Item 7.8 reports that 80 percent of police forces are controlled by criminals with sources noting that criminal groups bribe the police and local police and politicians have been infiltrated by organized crime.\n\n[14] 6.7 states that rules and public morals are at the police\u2019s discretion, which combined with prejudice and discriminatory attitude against LGBTQ members can lead to abuses against sexual minorities. The report states that police officers are often perpetrators of human rights violations and so many sexual minority individuals fear further harm from the authorities. Furthermore, Item 5.20 states that there are deep-rooted institutional, structural and practical barriers which continue to hinder access for \u2013 to justice for women including that officials in the criminal justice system hold discriminatory stereotypes and have limited knowledge of women\u2019s rights. Complicity, indifference, and mismanagement of cases by law enforcement perpetuates violence and culprits often go unpunished.\n\n[15] In light of the objective country condition documentation, I find that you have rebutted the presumption of state protection and that on a balance of probabilities, state \u2013 adequate state protection would not be available to you in Mexico.\n\nInternal Flight Alternative\n\n[16] I have considered whether a viable Internal Flight Alternative exists for you in Mexico City. Mexico City is known as the most progressive city in Mexico when it comes to LGBTQ rights and Item 6.2 of the NDP states that it has anti-discrimination laws to protect LGBTQ individuals and there are legal provisions in Mexico City that are favourable to LGBTQ individuals. You testified that you would not feel safe there as a lesbian woman and that you also fear being found and harmed there by your father and his friends who abused you. While I find that your evidence does not establish that your father or his friends would be motivated to target you there given that over 20 years and four (4) years respectively have passed since you had any contact with your father\u2019s friends or your father, I do find that overall your particular circumstances and the objective evidence suggest that you do not have a viable IFA in Mexico City.\n\n[17] Given the absence of operationally effective state protection and the prevalence of homophobia and violence against sexual minorities in Mexico including by the police, I find that you would face a serious possibility of persecution throughout the country. While there are indications that rights of LGBTQ individuals vary throughout the country, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights reports at Item 6.1 of the NDP that deep-rooted stereotypes and prejudice persists throughout the country towards LGBTQ people and 6.2 states that most sexual minorities report experiencing physical acts of violence or harassment based on their sexual orientation or gender identity.\n\n[18] Item 2.1 states that these crimes are not isolated events but are emblematic of current patterns of conduct and reflect a series of structural problems of intolerance in Mexico. With respect to Mexico City specifically, Item 6.4 states that even there the rights of LGBTQ people are treated as exceptions and protection is in the discretion of local officials. Based on all of this evidence, I find that there is no viable Internal Flight Alternative available to you in Mexico City and that you would face a serious possibility of persecution throughout the country.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[19] Based on the totality of the evidence, I find that you are a Convention refugee pursuant to Section 96 of IRPA and therefore your claim is accepted.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

The claimants are citizens of Mexico and claim refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n\n[2] I have considered and applied Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 4: \u201cGender Considerations in Proceedings Before the Immigration and Refugee Board\u201d and the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9: \u201cProceedings Before the IRB Involving Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Expression, and Sex Characteristics\u201d in my analysis and my reasons.\n\n[3] I find that the claimants are Convention refugees pursuant to section 96 of the Act.\n\n[4] The facts and the events alleged in support of the claim are set out in the associate claimant on the Basis of Claim form and attached narrative in the Basis of Claim amendments at Exhibit 2.1 and 2.2 and Exhibit 7. To summarize the claimants are same-sex partners. They met in Mexico and began dating in 2018. Prior to meeting the principal claimant, the associate claimant alleges to have briefly dated a boy who one (1) night sexually assaulted her. The AC told her parents, who offered her no support. After the AC made clear that she did not want to see her assailant again, he came to her house and forced his way in. He broke her ankle. Over a year later, he came to the claimant\u2019s shared home with a friend or two (2), and forced his way in, and sexually attacked the two (2) women.\n\n[5] He has continued to stalk the associate claimant and her long-term partner, the principal claimant, despite their attempts to move across the country. The claimants allege they moved to Cancun, to Mexico City, and finally to M\u00e9rida in all locations were located by the agent of persecution. The claimant flew to Canada from your hometown after collecting their passports and made a refugee claim upon arrival.\n\n[6] The claimants\u2019 personal identities and Mexican nationality were established based on copies of their certified true passports at Exhibit 1 and their testimony. I am satisfied, based on a balance of probabilities, that the claimants have established their identity.\n\n[7] With respect to Nexus. As noted above, the associate claimant\u2019s narrative recounts how she has faced violence at the hands of a violent ex-boyfriend, and the claimants also allege that his harassment and attacks are linked to their sexual orientation. I am satisfied that this scenario would constitute being targeted for persecution in an intersectional manner due to their membership of a particular social group on the basis of gender, as women facing gender-based violence and as lesbians. I have examined this claim pursuant to section 96 of the Act.\n\n[8] When a claimant swears that certain facts are true, this creates the presumption that they are true unless there is a valid reason to doubt the truthfulness. The associate claimant testified for the most part in a clear, straightforward, and spontaneous manner, and her testimony was generally consistent with the documentary evidence before me. Both claimants provided emotional testimony about the toll, the violence, and flight from Mexico has taken and that they wish they could return to Mexico safely. Accordingly, on a balance of probabilities, I find that the associate claimant was a credible witness as to her experiences, and I therefore believe what she has alleged, as well as what the principal claimant alleges.\n\n[9] The claimants also provided documentary evidence to support their claim at Exhibit 6 and Exhibit 8. The claimants provided a letter from the associate claimant\u2019s mother indicating that she knows of the threat and of the claimants\u2019 relationship, and a second letter indicating that the agent of persecution had visited the house and wanted inside. They provided a letter from the principal claimant\u2019s mother indicated her knowledge of the threat from the agent of persecution and a second indication that she does not support the principal claimant\u2019s relationship with the associate claimant. The claimants provided a copy of the police report they made when they went to the police in Mexico City after they had fled to Cancun. The associate claimant testified that the officer who took their statement was preoccupied with their relationship and provided no assistance with the threat that they face from the agent of persecution.\n\n[10] The claimants also provided letters from the friends who helped them in Cancun, in Mexico City, both corroborating their relationship and the harassments and threats that they faced. The claimants both provided confirmation of employment in Cancun. In addition, they provided many photographs of the two (2) of them in Mexico and in Canada, a photograph of the associate claimant\u2019s broken leg in a cast, and a photograph of the associate claimant with the agent of persecution. Finally, the claimant provided a letter from the associate claimant\u2019s school corroborating that she showed signs of XXXX in 2018 and that she attended XXXX. The claimants provided XXXX XXXX XXXX reports from XXXX of 2023, corroborating their narrative.\n\n[11] With regard to these documents, I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that they credibly corroborate the details of the claimants\u2019 life, including that they are in a same-sex relationship, and that they have been stalked and assaulted by the associate claimant\u2019s ex-boyfriend. On a balance of probabilities, I consider that the claimants have credibly established their profiles as lesbian women facing gender-based violence.\n\n[12] I find that the objective evidence, as set out in the National Documentation Package for Mexico from September 29th, 2023, at Exhibit 3 supports the claimants\u2019 subjective fear as well-founded. With respect to the claimants\u2019 sexual orientation, the president of the National Council for the Prevention of Discrimination states that discriminations against LGBTQ persons are a structural phenomenon with extensive social groups. The same source indicates violence is constant and discrimination prevalent. For this I refer to Exhibit 3 at Item 6.4. But the same-sex sexual relations are not criminalized in Mexico and have legislation against discrimination of LGBTI individuals.\n\n[13] The Thomson Reuters Foundation reported that access to rights is uneven with dozens killed in hate crimes each year and LGBT+ persons facing prejudice and prevalent discrimination. The same source indicates that there is crisis regarding the treatment of the LGBT community members by society, authorities, and law enforcement. For this, I refer to Item 6.2 at Exhibit 3. The same source indicates there are no provisions aggravating penalties for crimes motivated by victims of sexual orientation at the federal level. The US Department of State\u2019s country reports on human rights practices for 2022 notes that the government did not always investigate and punish those complicit in abuse against LGBTI persons, and the Research Directorate indicated progress and sexual diversity was slow and absent in political agendas.\n\n[14] Though information regarding housing, education, employment, and health care was scarce, 30 to 35 percent of respondents would not rent to a gay or lesbian person. According to the special program on sexuality, health, and HIV representative, LGBA (sic) individuals face discrimination when they share their sexual orientation, or it is discovered, discriminations in health institutions are also documented. The same source says that there is no access to education, given teachers and professors are homophobic or transphobic. And this I refer to Item 6.2 at Exhibit 3.\n\n[15] Counsel for the claimants provided country condition documentation at Exhibit 5. This documentation, it noted considerable violence against gay and lesbian Mexicans reporting the documentation of 78 deaths in 2021. The same sources approximated that the real figure would be closer to 279 homicides.\n\n[16] With respect to the element of gender-based violence. I note that gender-based violence, with Guideline 4, refers to as a cycle of violence and coercive control, is very common in Mexico. For this, I refer to Exhibit 3 Items 5.10, 2.1, and 2.2. All these items refer to the thousands of killings of women reporting throughout the country each year, many of which are investigated as femicide. Given the associate claimant\u2019s testimony in the country evidence regarding the effect of the impunity enjoyed by men in Mexico when engaging in violence against women, including sexual violence and sexual harassment, and the documentation of discrimination and violence as against two (2) LGBTQIA+ persons, I accept the claimants\u2019 fear of persecution from the community and their assailant is an objectively well-founded one (1).\n\n[17] While there is a presumption that states can protect their own citizens except in a state of complete breakdown, that presumption can be rebutted with clear and convincing evidence of the state\u2019s inability or unwillingness to protect its citizens. In this case, however, I find that the documentary evidence supports that the claimants would have no access to adequate or effective state protection if returned to Mexico. The Country Report \u2014 the US Country Report from 2022 states that civil society groups claimed police routinely subjected LGBTI persons to mistreatment in custody. For this, I refer to Item 2.2 at Exhibit 3.\n\n[18] The UN Special Rapporteur, notes that the alarming pattern of homicides of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender individuals, and the broad impunity for these crimes, sometimes with suspected complicity of investigative authorities. For this, I refer to Item 6.4. The same source indicates a high level of distrust in authorities and that 15 percent of gay respondents said they have been detained because of their LGBTI status. Item 6.4 in the NDP indicates that the judicial system is not effective in investigating crimes committed against sexual minorities. In the case of the homophobic crimes, the same source indicates that people who were found guilty were set free, further homophobic crimes are frequently considered crimes of passion, and the authorities fail to investigate, prosecute, or sanctions these crimes.\n\n[19] In terms of gender-based violence, Item 5.6 of the NDP blames the increase in the level of arbitrary violence against women has tied to the impunity offered by Mexico\u2019s judicial system. The likelihood of perpetrators being brought to justice is very low, regardless of the circumstances or evidence. And it is reported municipal authorities have covered up and facilitated violence against women by refusing to conduct adequate investigations. The NDP further notes that the judicial system is hindered by procedural failures that invalidate claims and complainants, in many cases, law enforcement sides with the attackers.\n\n[20] I find that the above evidence and the claimant\u2019s credible testimony is clear and convincing in demonstrating that adequate state protection would not be available to the claimants in Mexico.\n\n[21] I have also considered whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for the claimants in Mexico. In the evidence before me, I find there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout the country. The director of Queer Research stated that Mexico City in Guadalajara are gay friendly zones, and this is at Item 6.4. However, the same source indicates that Transgender Law Centre and Cornell University Law School, LGBT clinic reports the police harassment against the LGBT community remains high in Mexico City. The same source indicates that the highest number of complainants for discrimination were filed in Mexico City and that there are, \u201cpolice officers who look for any way to intimidate or extort couples wherever they are.\u201d This is, again, at Exhibit 6.4.\n\n[22] Further at a national level, 64.4 percent of people aged 18 or older felt there was, \u201clittle to no justification for two (2) people of the same sex to live as a couple.\u201d These numbers are better in Mexico City, but still only at 40.5 percent. This same source indicates that Mexico City is by far the most progressive city in Mexico. However, hurdles remain in finding full inclusion, and violence remains an issue, with 81 percent of respondents considering discrimination exist towards gay community members. This is at Item 6.2.\n\n[23] With respect to the claimant\u2019s gender-based claim, I note that the single women are vulnerable to discrimination in various sectors, including social labour, family, and employment opportunities. Exhibit 3 Item 5.7 indicates that women who leave abusive partners face numerous difficulties in obtaining employment and are more likely to face discrimination in wages, working hours, and benefits. The claimants also testified to the agent of persecution being motivated and having the means to locate them in Cancun and Mexico City.\n\n[24] I find that the internal flight alternative fails, and a viable internal fight alternative does not exist for the claimants in Mexico.\n\n[25] Based on the totality of the evidence before me, I find that each of the claimants have established a subjective and objectively well-founded fear of persecution in Mexico on a forward-looking basis. They would have no adequate state protection or viable internal flight alternative. There is a serious possibility of being subjected to further persecution should they return, and I find them both to be Convention refugees. Both of their claims are therefore accepted.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

The principal claimant was appointed as designated representative for the minor claimant, her daughter.\n\n[3] I have considered and applied Chairperson\u2019s guideline 4, gender considerations in proceedings before the Immigration and Refugee Board in my analysis and reasons.\n\nDETERMINATION\n\n[4] I find that claimants are Convention refugees.\n\nALLEGATIONS\n\n[5] The facts advanced and alleged in support of the claim are set out in the claimants\u2019 Basis of Claim forms in Exhibits 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3, and the narratives attached to the principal and associate claimants\u2019 BOCs, upon which all relied.\n\n[6] To summarize, the claimants are from the Mexico City area. Principal claimant studied XXXX in university, and in 2016 started working in XXXX XXXX for a XXXX with operations in Mexico City, Quer\u00e9taro and elsewhere in the country. I will designate the XXXX as VR.\n\n[7] She was proficient in her position and soon began reporting directly to the company\u2019s owner, who I will call CB. In XXXX 2018, the principal claimant travelled to VR\u2019s operations in Quer\u00e9taro for an extended XXXX XXXX with CB. CB began to sexually harass her with unwanted casual touching, and she asked him to stop. He also attempted to pressure her into sharing a hotel room with him for the duration or in the alternative, staying in an adjoining room. But she refused and insisted on a fully separate one (1). As the month went on, CB escalated his sexual harassment, pressuring her to work late night overtime alone with him and asking her inappropriate personal questions. This continued after returning to Mexico City as well.\n\n[8] At the end of 2018, VR held an event at the Quer\u00e9taro XXXX that required the principal claimant to travel there again, and CB forced his way into her bedroom to attempt to sexually assault her. She was able to push him away and slept in a co-worker\u2019s room for safety. No longer wishing to tolerate CB\u2019s sexual harassment, the principal claimant decided to leave her job with VR in XXXX 2019. CB then began harassing her at the family home and became agitated when her parents said she was not in. In late XXXX 2019, she attempted to seek a restraining order against CB, but police refused on the basis there was insufficient evidence and further castigated her for \u201cprovoking him.\u201d\n\n[9] After being rebuffed by police, the principal claimant went to the fiscalia to speak with prosecutors. After being kept waiting for several hours, she was told that she could not file a complaint and must leave. The officials warned her to stop making accusations against CB, who they said was a friend of the XXXX XXXX XXXX, and threatened that if she would not keep quiet, she would \u201cface the consequences.\u201d After several months of no contact, during which the principal claimant hoped CB had been frightened off by her going to the authorities, he came to her home in mid-XXXX 2019. CB threatened that if she refused to be in a relationship with him, he would make certain that no man could have her and threatened that he had the resources to \u201cdisappear her.\u201d\n\n[10] The associate claimant, the principal claimant\u2019s mother, urged her to leave the country to flee CB after this. And the principal claimant traveled to Canada in XXXX 2019, leaving her daughter in the care of her mother. She extended her visitor status repeatedly in the hopes that CB would give up his harassment, but her parents told her that strangers had repeatedly come to the house on CB\u2019s behalf looking for her. She eventually raised a refugee claim in March 2021.\n\n[11] Back in Mexico, the associate claimant started noticing being followed by the same unknown vehicle over the span of several weeks in late 2019 and became nervous to go out. Previously working as a XXXX, providing services in her own home and the client\u2019s homes, she stopped taking out calls after this. With the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, she stopped working entirely. By XXXX 2021, with pandemic conditions improving, she began feeling comfortable to go out of the house from time to time.\n\n[12] In XXXX 2021, while walking home with the minor claimant, the associate claimant was accosted by two (2) armed men on a motorcycle. The men demanded to know the principal claimant\u2019s location and threatened to kill the two (2) if they refused to say. On being told the principal claimant was no longer in Mexico, the men threatened that if she did not return and voluntarily give herself up, they would kill the associate minor claimants. The associate claimant informed the principal claimant immediately, who told her to flee the country as police would not help. They made arrangements to travel as soon as they could and arrived in Canada on XXXX 2021, raising claims for refugee protection upon entry.\n\nANALYSIS\n\n[13] The claimants\u2019 identity. The claimants\u2019 personal identities in Mexican nationality were established based on their Mexican passports in evidence in Exhibit 1 and the principal and associate claimants\u2019 testimony. I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that they have credibly established their identities.\n\nNexus\n\n[14] The principal claimant describes in her narrative being sexually harassed and threatened by her former boss, who evidently has connections to politicians and law enforcement authorities in Mexico, and who has consistently harassed and pursued her, both herself and through allies, since she was employed with VR in 2018. I am satisfied this scenario would constitute being targeted for persecution as a member of a particular social group on the basis of gender. Further, on being unable to locate the principal claimant, CB\u2019s allies are reported to have threatened violence to the associate and minor claimants as well.\n\n[15] Per the courts in Asghar and Gonzalez, where the primary alleged victim of persecution has nexus to Convention, a derivative claim based on familial connection \u201crelated to discrimination or fundamental human rights\u201d, can have nexus on the basis of being membership in a particular social group. Accordingly, this scenario would constitute nexus to the Convention on that ground for the associate and minor claimants, even if they had not been personally threatened by these men.\n\n[16] I have, accordingly, assessed the allegations under both sections 96 and 97(1)(b) of the IRPA.\n\nCredibility\n\n[17] When a claimant swears a certain factor true per the case of Maldonado, this creates a presumption they are true unless there is a valid reason to doubt their truthfulness. As noted above, I have also considered and applied guideline 4 on gender considerations in proceedings before the IRB, which offers guidance with respect to the application of a trauma-informed approach to proceedings. The guidelines note that individuals who experienced trauma may have certain difficulties in presenting their case, including recalling specific times, dates, and locations. Recounting events in chronological order or even recalling certain events in full.\n\n[18] I drew on this guidance, for instance, to advise the principal claimant that I did not require her to go into any particularly upsetting details with regards to the various instances of sexual harassment and attempted sexual assault from CB, as well as with the associate claimant and the threats they reported after the principal claimant\u2019s departure. In any event, the principal and associate claimants\u2019 testimony was clear, straightforward, responsive to my questions. I considered that they were generally coherent, and their statements reflected their respective parts of the narrative, as reported, with no significant inconsistencies or contradictions. On a balance of probabilities, I find both to be credible witnesses as to their experiences.\n\n[19] The claimants also provided a number of items in personal disclosure in support of their allegations in Exhibits 5, 6, and 7. Many of these are support letters from friends and family members accompanied by their federal voter ID cards. None provide a great deal of detail but are generally reflective of the allegations. Highlights include letters from the principal claimant\u2019s father, attesting to the principal claimant telling her parents that her reason for quitting VR was due to CB\u2019s sexual harassment, as well as a letter from a former co-worker to confirm she observed CB\u2019s inappropriate touching and comments at the workplace, as well as another co-worker in his room the principal claimant slept after CB\u2019s attempted sexual assault after the company party. There is also a letter from the claimant\u2019s former neighbour who states that she witnessed the principal claimant being harassed at home. These are all dated throughout April 2022, with signatures similar to those appearing on the original Spanish language identity documents.\n\n[20] Exhibit 7 features also another letter from the same neighbour, dated May 2023, who states that she has observed unknown persons regularly watching the claimant\u2019s empty house. The evidence also contains the principal claimant\u2019s resignation letter from VR in which she very diplomatically indicates she has decided to leave, dated XXXX XXXX, as well as a selection of Instagram posts from the principal claimant\u2019s account in which she promotes and is identified as a XXXX XXXX for VR. There are also a number of detailed paystubs or tax receipts indicating the principal claimant\u2019s salary and deductions on a monthly basis for the position of VR\u2019s XXXX XXXX.\n\n[21] I observe no features of any of these documents which cause me to doubt their provenance or reliability. And taking all of this documentation and testimony into account, I am satisfied the principal claimant has credibly established on a balance of probabilities she formerly worked at VR and experienced persistent sexual harassment from CB. I am satisfied also that the claimants have similarly credibly established that CB and\/or persons in his employed (sic) have continued to harass herself and her family members in search of her after she left Mexico in 2019, including the incident of armed men threatening the associate and minor claimants in XXXX 2021, and that unknown persons are continuing to observe the claimant\u2019s old home in search of them. Accordingly, I find that the claimants have more likely than not established their well-founded, subjective fear of persecution from CB and his allies in Mexico.\n\nObjective Basis\n\n[22] The principal claimant described in her narrative and testimony of working for CB, that he relentlessly sought to corner her and pressure her into sex, both by physical force and with the financial and social power he held over her. When she continued to refuse him, he escalated to threatening to harm or kill her so that no other man could \u201chave her either.\u201d I note that, first of all, such been gender-based violence, what guideline 4 refers to as the cycle of violence and coercive control is very common in Mexico. Documents 5.10, 2.1, and 2.2 of the National Documentation Package all discuss thousands of killings of women reported every year throughout the country, many of which are investigated specifically as femicides.\n\n[23] Item 5.6 of the NDP blames the increasing level of arbitrary violence against women to the fact that men targeting women are often (inaudible) the effect of impunity by Mexico\u2019s judicial system. The likelihood of perpetrators being brought to justice is very low, regardless of circumstances or evidence. And it is reported municipal authorities have covered up and facilitated violence against women by refusing to conduct adequate investigations. Document 5.10 further indicates the inefficiency of judiciary institutions discourages many women from either making an initial complaint or going through the process. Sometimes this is due to the institutions having an overload of work. Other times, because of a lack of training and many other times, it is because the agents of the institution themselves share these traditional and macho values.\n\n[24] As a result, they hinder the processes, where victimizing women, or simply wear them down by asking them to devote time and resources, there lacking, in order to follow unnecessarily complicated procedures. This results in procedural failures that end up invalidating claims and complaints. And indeed, in many cases, even law enforcement authorities side with the attackers, particularly if they have political power influence which results in even further impunity. Further, within that same document, the New York Times is cited for a report that law enforcement officials and authorities can be passive, complicit, or in sometimes, even actively abusive towards women who try to report violence or harassment they experience.\n\n[25] In addition, in several prominent cases, authorities have first investigated women\u2019s killings as suicides, which places the blame on the victim and absolves her killers of responsibility even before investigation is conducted. Such attitudes are pervasive throughout Mexican society, with even President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, publicly known as AMLO, consistently denying the extent of the problem and declaring against all evidence per Document 4.6, that \u201cMexican women have never been as protected as now.\u201d He has similarly publicly claimed, per NDP Document 5.6 that 90 percent of all 911 calls concerning gender-based violence are false.\n\n[26] More broadly, according to a 2017 study cited in NDP Document 9.10, an overview of Mexico\u2019s ineffective National Anti-corruption System. An overwhelming majority of the population perceives all law enforcement institutions as corrupt. This document also discusses how, for instance, the local organization of the Los Zetas cartel in the state of Coahuila were able to subvert and control the entire state, pursuing their criminal activities with impunity, with the consent, and sometimes even direct assistance of government officials and police. NDP Document 10.10 indicates it is widely accepted that \u201cMexican police have been hobbled by corruption for decades\u201d, and there are numerous examples of police forces directly working alongside their local cartel organizations to protect criminals from scrutiny and to assist them in pursuing their targets. Because of the widespread perception that police are corrupt or otherwise ineffective, many victims of crime do not bother to report their experiences or seek justice.\n\n[27] NDP Document 9.18, a Response to Information Request prepared by the IRB Research Directorate NEX20 0740.a concerns access to databases of personal information. This states in all law enforcement institutions at every level of government can access national database systems. While there are safeguards against unauthorized access, these are obviously somewhat less relevant if a corrupt user such as one (1) of CB\u2019s allies in government or law enforcement, legitimately has access to sensitive information. Further, I accept as credible the principal claimant was refused assistance by prosecutors when she sought a restraining order and threatened not to make allegations against CB or defame him due to his political connections. It is more likely than not, given this experience, that CB does indeed have sufficient influence with authorities to assist him in carrying out his threats, including tracking down the claimants by consulting such databases.\n\n[28] Given the principal claimant\u2019s testimony in this country evidence regarding the effect of impunity men enjoy in Mexico when engaging in violence against women, including sexual violence and sexual harassment, I accept the claimants\u2019 fear of persecution from CB and his allies is also objectively well-founded. The claimants would face an ongoing, serious possibility of being targeted for harm by CB or his allies if returning to Mexico.\n\nState Protection\/Internal Flight Alternative\n\n[29] While there is a presumption that states can protect their own citizens, except in a state of complete breakdown, that presumption can be rebutted with clear and convincing evidence of the state\u2019s inability or unwillingness to protect the citizens. Given the principal claimant\u2019s personal experiences of being rebuffed by police and prosecutors, and the evidence I have cited above with regards to objective basis, I find on a balance of probabilities the claimants would not be able to avail themselves of adequate or effective state protection in Mexico. The presumption of state protection is thoroughly rebutted due to the demonstrated misogyny of officials and the corruption of law enforcement institutions.\n\n[30] I consider in this regard also whether the claimants would have a viable internal flight alternative. However, in light of having accept as credibly established that CB has high-level political connections to the \u2014 for instance, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and has the power to exercise some kind of corrupt influence on police and prosecutors, as well as the resources to retain a number of persons to seek the claimants and threaten violence on his behalf, as well as to confidently assert that he could \u201cdisappear the principal claimant\u201d, I find on a balance of probabilities the claimants would continue to face a serious possibility of persecution everywhere in Mexico. That would be the case unless the claimants were to entirely \u201cgo off the grid\u201d, which would be objectively unreasonable, per the case of Thirunavukkarasu.\n\n[31] Given this, the test in the case of Rasaratnam would fail at the first prong and the claimants would have no viable IFA.\n\n[32] Based on the totality \u2014 sorry.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[33] Based on the totality of evidence before me, I find the claimants have established a subjectively and objectively well-founded fear of persecution as member of particular social groups in Mexico, and there is a serious possibility of facing severe harm or death because of it. They would have no resort to state protection nor viable IFA.\n\n[34] These claims are, therefore, accepted.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

I am sorry if I have mispronounced your name at all. You are citizen of Mexico, and are claiming refugee protection, pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. For the following reasons, I find that you meet the definition of a Convention refugee, under Section 96 of the IRPA.\n\nALLEGATIONS\n\n[2] The specifics of your allegations are set out in your Basis of Claim forms, as amended. In summary, you allege that you have been harassed and sexually assaulted by a man named XXXX (ph), who is a member of the Jalisco Cartel, and has continued to inquire about your whereabouts since you left Mexico and threatened your family. You allege that if you return to Mexico, you will be persecution by XXXX.\n\nIdentity\n\n[3] Your personal identity is as a citizen of Mexico has been established by your testimony and supporting documents, files, Exhibits, specifically, your passport issued by the government of Mexico. I therefore find on a balance of probabilities that identity and country of reference have been established.\n\nNexus\n\n[4] I find that there is a link between what you fear on a Convention ground, specifically your membership in a particular social group, as a woman facing gender-related and sexual violence. I have therefore assessed your claim under section 96.\n\nCredibility\n\n[5] Overall, and found to be a credible witness, and believe what you have alleged on a balance of probabilities. You spoke about meeting XXXX where you worked XXXX XXXX XXXX, how he requested personal information about you, such as your cell phone number, which you refused to provide, and the events leading up to the assault, including how he became upset about XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, which you then went with him to investigate. You also spoke about your contact with him following the assault, including his presence outside your home in his car, and his attendance at your work, where he made threatening remarks, and informed you that he was part of the cartel. You also spoke about text messages that he sent to you on occasions when he would watch you from his car, and attempt to talk to you.\n\n[6] You also spoke about an instance after you left Mexico, that XXXX has continued to park outside of your house, and ask neighbours where you were, and when they had last seen you, including as recently as last year. You further testified that your sister was trying to collect evidence about XXXX for your hearing, and that as a result, an unknown man approached and threatened her, identifying himself as acting on XXXX\u2019s behalf. The man said that he knew who your sister was, and that they knew that she had been asking about XXXX in the Public Ministry, and stated that XXXX was a member of the cartel. Overall, I found your testimony to be spontaneous, detailed, and consistent with your Basis of Claim forms.\n\n[7] There was one incident where you mentioned that from XXXX or XXXX of 2022, where your family\u2019s tires were cut, and that they found a note from XXXX. This information was not included in your narrative. When asked about this, you said that you did not know why you did not include it, and that you did not think that you had enough proof of it. I find that this information is relevant to your claim, and should have been included in a BOC amendment, however, I know that this information is also included in a letter of support your mother. I therefore do not draw negative inference from this omission. There were no other inconsistencies or omissions going to the core of the claim. You also provided documentary evidence to support your claim, including letters of support from people in Mexico and police reports. I find these documents to be credible and support your allegations.\n\n[8] Based on the totality of the evidence, I find your subjective fear and established by your credible testimony, and I believe what you have alleged on a balance of probabilities. I found that you have been harassed and assaulted by XXXX, who has continued to inquire about your whereabouts and threatening your family.\n\nObjective Basis\n\n[9] The sexual assault and harassment that you have experienced in Mexico supports the objective basis of your fear of harm of forward-looking basis. The objective basis is further supported by evidence in the National Documentation Package from Mexico. 7.18 of the National Documentation Package from Mexico states that organized criminal groups play a large role in the country\u2019s violence, and are involved in a major portion of Mexico\u2019s homicides. Item 5.20 states that femicide rose 10 percent in 2019 from the previous year. Organized crime femicide occurs in areas where there is a presence of gang culture, within which women are considered disposable, may be used as drug mules, and violence committed against them represent gang cohesion and masculinity. Sources state that organized crime groups murder women for their sense of belonging, seeing them as an object owned by their rivals, and to cause damage, they kill their women.\n\n[10] Item 7.7 also states that the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, or CJNG, has the most operational capacity in the country, and is the only cartel with a national presence, along with the Sinaloa Cartel. The CJNG reportedly centers its rule on brutality, abrasiveness, and aggressiveness that is involved in homicides, kidnapping, and human trafficking.\n\n[11] Based on your credible testimony, and the objective evidence in the National Documentation Package, I find your subjective fear of persecution is well-founded. I am satisfied that you face a serious possibility of persecution if returned to Mexico, and that this risk would continue.\n\nState Protection\n\n[12] You indicated that you did seek state protection in Mexico, but that the authorities did not assist you. In these particular circumstances, I find that adequate state protection would not be reasonably forthcoming to you in Mexico. Item 7.18 reports that police forces in Mexico lack human and material resources to properly investigate crimes, and that for all murders registered between 2010 and 2016, 94.8 percent of cases had (inaudible) charges. Sources report that police officers colluded with organized crime, and that poor working conditions in law enforcement agencies leave police officers particularly vulnerable to bribes and infiltration by organized crime. Item 7.8 reports that 80 percent of police forces are controlled by criminals, the sources noting that criminal groups bribe the police, and that local police and politicians have been infiltrated by organized crime.\n\n[13] Item 5.20 states that there are deep rooted institutional, structural, and practical barriers, which continue to hinder access to justice for women, including that officials in the criminal justice system, including law enforcement, hold discriminatory stereotypes and limited knowledge of women\u2019s rights. Complicity, indifference, and mismanagement of cases by law enforcement perpetuates violence, and culprits often go unpunished.\n\n[14] In light of the objective country documentation, as well as your personal circumstances, I find that you have rebutted the presumption of state protection, and that adequate state protection would not be available to you in Mexico, on a balance of probabilities.\n\nInternal Flight Alternative\n\n[15] I have also considered whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for you in Mexico City. I find that in these particular circumstances, there is no viable internal flight alternative available to you. You testified about the assault and harassment that you have experienced, and how XXXX has continued to inquire about you and threaten your family. Item 7.8 states that organized crime groups track and retaliate against individuals, and could easily track and retaliate against relocated persons if they are interested and willing to do so. According to sources, criminal groups are motivated to track individuals because they steal or lose money, due to personal rivalries, personal vengeance, perceived betrayal, and cooperation with authorities, among other reasons.\n\n[16] Sources state that if any criminal organization is interested in harming an individual, no city will provide a safe haven, and any of these organizations has the capacity to commit violent acts against any person in the country. I find that XXXX has demonstrated a continued and ongoing motivation to target and harm you, and that as a member of the cartel, he has the ability to locate you throughout Mexico.\n\n[17] I therefore find that you do not have a viable internal flight alternative in Mexico City.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[18] Based on the totality of the evidence, I find you to be a Convention refugee, as per section 96 of Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. Therefore, I accept your claim.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

The claimants are citizens of Mexico and seek refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, or IRPA. The adult claimant is the mother of the minor claimant and was appointed as designated representative.\n\n[2] I have considered and applied Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 4, gender considerations in proceedings before the Immigration and Refugee Board, as well as Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9, proceedings before the IRB involving sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, and sex characteristics in my analysis and the reasons.\n\nDETERMINATION\n\n[3] I find the claimants are Convention refugees.\n\nALLEGATIONS\n\n[4] The facts and events alleged in support of the claim are certainly \u2014 are at the claimants\u2019 Basis of Claim form and attached narrative as amended upon which both relied, at Exhibits 2.1, 5, 8, and 11.\n\nOriginal Narrative\n\n[5] To summarize, the adult claimant appeared to be bisexual and originally raised the claim alongside her now former female partner, who I will call IB, whose claim was later disjoined from those of the present claimants. The adult claimant grew up in the states of Veracruz and Yucatan, surrounded by violence. Her mother, who I will call GB, was in a relationship with a former police officer and violent criminal, who I will call NR, who controlled a number of brothels and nightclubs in the city of M\u00e9rida, Yucatan. NR was rumored also to engage in narcotics and human trafficking.\n\n[6] The adult claimant was deprived of adequate schooling as GB left her to be watched by brothel clients while she worked. Finally, between the ages of 6 to 14, she was routinely sexually abused by NR, which GB denied or was too fearful of him to address at the time. The adult claimant\u2019s grandmother, GR, took custody of her, and believing her reports of sexual abuse attempted to help her seek XXXX treatment in Veracruz. NR initially repeatedly attempted to pressure GB to take back custody, but GR refused. Approximately a year later, GB fled him to rejoin her mother and daughter in Laredo (ph).\n\n[7] From the age of 20, the adult claimant threw herself into her work as a means of informal therapy for the fear of men caused by these experiences. She had a very \u2014 really brief relationship with the minor claimant\u2019s father in 2015. In XXXX 2017, she entered into a relationship with IB. IB affirmed the adult claimant early in the relationship that her own family were paying a regular extortion fee of XXXX XXXX XXXX pesos weekly to the local cell of the cartel Los Zetas. In early XXXX 2017, IB moved in with the claimants. Due to the expense of moving, she could not pay the full amount demanded by Los Zetas at the time and asked for lenience. The cartel operative collecting payments threatened, \u201cConsequences\u201d, which IB did not take seriously as he was a teenager.\n\n[8] On XXXX XXXX, 2017, the adult claimant was called by the minor claimant\u2019s school, verifying if her brother could, in fact, pick the minor claimant up. As she has no brother, she rushed to the school to find the unknown man had already left on his assertion being scrutinized. She attempted to report the incident to police who rebuffed her, saying they could do nothing because the minor claimant was not actually hurt, and there was insufficient evidence to investigate. The next day, two (2) men came to the claimant\u2019s business on a motorcycle, threatening them at gunpoint that they now owed an additional XXXX XXXX XXXX pesos weekly to the Zetas, swiftly warning IB the claimants would, \u201cPay the consequences if she did not comply.\u201d One (1) of the cartel members also demeaned IB for, \u201cActing like a man\u201d, calling her the slur matura, which is roughly analogous to pejorative use of the English term dyke, and said that she should be punished for it.\n\n[9] The claimants and IB moved a week later and gathered the demanded extortion fees, including seeking to borrow from IB\u2019s aunt, AB. When the cartel operators arrived, AB says she was unable to pay, and they shot her before leaving her with further threats and homophobic slurs, referring to IB. AB survived, but was hospitalized, and later said that the Zetas had probably mistaken her for IB, as they have a similar appearance.\n\n[10] The claimants and IB attempted to relocate but found circumstances very hostile to them, as a lesbian couple, experiencing a great deal of discrimination in seeking housing and employment. They travelled to Canada mid-2019 and raised claims of refugee protection in early 2020.\n\nFirst Amended Narrative\n\n[11] Following the disjoinder of IB from claimant\u2019s claims, the adult claimant submitted a revised narrative in May 2023. It is broadly similar in dimensions, and so I will note only material changes or additions. These include \u2014 for the benefit of transcriptionist, please format these as bullet points. A, the adult claimant\u2019s family was abandoned by her father, who was himself also a high-ranking member of an unnamed cartel. B, the adult claimant\u2019s stepfather, NR, was also a cartel member. C, the adult claimant witnessed GB being abused by NR. D, NR extensively bribed law enforcement and prison officials in Veracruz, resulting in GB feeling it was impossible to report his abuse to authorities. E, NR began sexually abusing the adult claimant at the age of eight (8), not six (6) , and threatened that he would harm GB if she resisted. F, GR was deceased in 2021 of XXXX XXXX. G, while with NR in a vehicle traveling through the Mexican-Guatemalan border in 2007, GB and the adult claimant\u2019s sister escaped him and were rescued by members of the Zapatista (ph) gang. H, the adult claimant\u2019s first relationship with another woman was started the age of 17, and lasted for approximately five (5) years. I, the adult claimant\u2019s relationship with IB was extremely difficult, as IB\u2019s family was not accepting of her being a lesbian. IB\u2019s family regularly harassed and threatened the adult claimant in a homophobic manner, demanding that she end the relationship. J, IB left Mexico for Canada in XXXX 2019. The adult claimant left Mexico on XXXX 2019, and briefly had to leave the minor claimant with GB because she could not afford his travel expenses. She returned to Mexico for a single day in XXXX 2019 to pick up the minor claimant, and both then departed for Canada.\n\n[12] There are also a number of allegations of inadequate representation on the part of the claimant\u2019s former Counsel, Marcela Gonzalez Rodriguez and her staff, which I will address in a following section of my decision.\n\nSecond Amended Narrative\n\n[13] In October 2023, the claimant submitted a second amended narrative. Material information out of this version includes. A, the adult claimant was targeted for harassment and violence by her peers as a team, including physical assault, which caused her become XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. B, the adult claimant\u2019s first relationship with a woman, who I will call TJ, was a surreptitious one (1) because her partner was not out to her family. That relationship ended when she learned that TJ was unfaithful to her. C, the adult claimant\u2019s second relationship with a woman, who I will call CD, lasted approximately one (1) year, and also ended due to extreme opposition from the partner\u2019s family, as well as, again, cheating on her. D, the adult claimant\u2019s relationship with IB started in 2018, not 2017. And IB\u2019s father once assaulted the adult claimant. The two (2) attempted to report this to authorities, who took no action. E, IB\u2019s aunt continues to stay \u2014 live in hiding. F, the adult claimant and IB did not experience discrimination while they were in M\u00e9rida as they were present there only temporarily for less than one (1) month. Rather, the experience of hostility towards them as a same-gender couple, such as regards to rental housing, occurred while they were residing in Veracruz.\n\nThird Amended Narrative\n\n[14] Immediately prior to the scheduled hearing date in November 2023, the adult claimant submitted another amended narrative. The only change made was to indicate that, upon reflection, since she has resided in Canada, she now identifies solely as a lesbian, and that she had not felt free or capable in Mexico to express lacking any attraction to men.\n\nAdministrative Issues\n\n[15] As noted above, the claimants and IB originally claimed together. All were represented by former Counsel Marcela Gonzalez Rodriguez, upon filing their claims in 2020. The adult claimant\u2019s and IB\u2019s relationship later broke down, in the manner of this \u2014 noted in correspondence to have result of a number of police visits to their home in Canada, and this disjoinder was granted upon application of Counsel in July 2023.\n\n[16] (inaudible) several paragraphs, the claimants made a narrative of May 2023, prepared with the assistance of second Counsel, Zulaikha Gonzalez Perez (ph), make a number of allegations about former Counsel Marcela Gonzalez Rodriguez. Specifically, A, the adult claimant was advised by a person, who I will call RB, who worked with the former Counsel, and to whom the claimants provided their narrative in Spanish. B, former Counsel made changes to this narrative without the claimants\u2019 knowledge, and this version was not read back to them. They learned only upon the English version being translated back into Spanish after retaining later Counsel what had been said. C, former Counsel provided the claimants with two (2), \u201cFalse addresses\u201d, at which to receive correspondence, for which they were charged 200 dollars Canadian, monthly. D, the claimants did not fill out the original BOCs themselves, but signed a blank version of former Counsel\u2019s direction, which former Counsel then filled with the assistance of her husband as translator, although the translator signature on the BOC is that of another person, who I will call AX.\n\n[17] The second Counsel was retained by the claimants on May 3rd, 2023, and wrote former Council, ceasing the division. Second Council advised former Council the number of items in the original narrative were incorrect. And further, she reported the adult claimant did not provide any of the incorrect information. She then requested further details of former Counsel\u2019s procedures in preparing refugee claims, as well as confirmation of whether the translator used was AX, or a family member of former Counsel.\n\n[18] Former Counsel replied on May 22nd, 2023, stating the following. A, the adult claimant informed former Counsel on July 14th, 2022, that she had retained new Counsel due to the breakdown of her relationship with IB. Former Counsel informed the claimants and IB that she could not represent any of them. B, during that Counsel \u2014 during that meeting, former Counsel gave the claimants their files, and they reviewed the documents with her, and agreed their file was complete, including, \u201cA translated version from English to Spanish of their narrative.\u201d C, former Counsel was, \u201cNot surprised\u201d, to receive these allegations as she asserts the adult claimant, \u201cThreatened to do so\u201d, if she did not have IB\u2019s claims severed and also withdrew from representing IB, but continued to represent herself and her son. Former Counsel also maintained the claimants and IB, at that time, that she could not have, \u201cHave preferences for any of the claimants\u201d, and that it was in everyone\u2019s best interest for her to withdraw. D, the former Counsel denied the claimants had been given blank BOCs to sign, arguing that since the contents of the pages prior to the signature page were obviously filled out by computer, that was \u201cImpossible\u201d. E, former Counsel maintained AX was the only translator used by her office in the claimants\u2019 files, that all translation was performed by AX, and that the adult claimant had wrongly assumed him to be former Counsel\u2019s husband. F, the claimants did not fill out the original BOC themselves, but signed a blank version at former Counsel discretion \u2014 direction, which former Counsel then filled out with the assistance \u2014 translator. G, former Counsel has provided IB\u2019s original handwritten Spanish narrative, as well as Spanish language print drafts and the adult claimant\u2019s narrative from (inaudible)\u2019s files. She pointed out that nothing was mentioned about the cartel Jalisco Nuevo Generacion, or CGNG (sic), and further questioned how NR could logically have been involved with CGNG, as was briefly mentioned at one (1) point in her narrative, when the adult claimant was a child in the late 1990s, as it did not exist until 2010.\n\n[19] I observed that in her reply, former Counsel did not provide a handwritten draft of the adult claimant\u2019s narrative on which she found her conclusion the adult claimant never mentioned the CGNG. She also did not reply to the adult claimant\u2019s allegations relating to RB, and the \u201cFalse addresses\u201d service, but cannot be faulted for that as those points were not raised by Ms. XXXX XXXX. I note other that \u2014 I note also that other administrative correspondence in the file includes a letter from former Counsel dated October 25th, 2022, in which she previously recounted the meeting of July 1422, in largely the same terms as her reply of May 22nd, 2023, but the description of her reason for recusal differs.\n\n[20] Specifically, former Counsel stated that, \u201cThere has been a breakdown in Counsel client confidence given the abuse of treatment over phone calls and messages\u201d by one (1) of the claimants, and indicated that at that time in October 2022, she had already decided to withdraw. I commend the second Counsel, Ms. XXXX XXXX, for proactively, comprehensively taking these steps specified in the practice notice allegations against former Counsel. In my experience as a Member of this Division, I have observed that very few Counsels are even aware of it, and others simply refuse to adhere to its very clearly stated mandatory requirements.\n\n[21] I have reviewed the previous drafts and narrative provided by former Counsel, and while I am not conversant with Spanish language, I am capable of scanning Spanish text for the phrases Los Zetas, or Cartel de Jalisco Nueva Generacion, or the acronym CGNG, and find no instances of those appearing.\n\n[22] I questioned the adult claimant on these points. She reiterated that Ms. XXXX XXXX had been unreachable and exploitative, and specifically testified that she had requested a copy of her file from former Counsel\u2019s office, which was refused, contrary to the reply letter. She also denied ever making threats against former Counsel, relating that she and IB were in fact treated very badly, yelled at, and thrown out of her office at one (1) point.\n\n[23] On a balance of probabilities, I believe it is likely that many of these points of conflict were the result of poor communication for Ms. XXXX XXXX. It is difficult for me to positively conclude on the evidence before me that she intentionally sought to harm the claimant. But at the same time, I consider more likely than not that her reply letter is not a reliable account of events. This is a consideration of its peculiarly defensive, and sometimes unprofessional tone, irrelevant invocations of other Counsel she has worked with in the past as assertions of her good character, and with regard to the reasons for and timing of her withdrawal from the file, conflicts with the information that Ms. XXXX regards herself provided in previous communications as division. As such, I do find on a balance of probabilities that former Counsel did not provide adequate representation to the claimants and IB during the period in which she represented them in their refugee claims.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nIdentity\n\n[24] I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities the claimants\u2019 personal identities and Mexican nationality were established based on copies of their passports, in Exhibit 1 in the adult claimant\u2019s testimony.\n\nNexus\n\n[25] As noted above, the adult claimant\u2019s narrative, as (inaudible) corrected after disjoinder from IB\u2019s claim, indicates that she fears persecution as a lesbian, particularly from cartel members with a history of targeting IB\u2019s family for threats and extortion. I am satisfied this scenario would clearly constitute being targeted as a member of particular social groups on the intersectional basis of both gender and sexual orientation. As for the minor claimant, per courts in Asghar and Gonzalez, where the primary alleged victim in persecution is a nexus to Convention, a derivative claim based on familial connection, \u201cRelated to discrimination of fundamental human rights\u201d, can have nexus on the basis of being a member of particular social group as immediate family.\n\n[26] Accordingly, this scenario would constitute a nexus to Convention on that ground for the minor claimant, who Claimant alleges would be similarly targeted for violent retribution or, for instance, kidnapping, as for some. I have therefore assessed the allegations under both sections 96 and 97(1)(b) of the IRPA.\n\nCredibility\n\n[27] Per the case of Maldonado, when a claimant swears that certain facts are true, this creates presumption they are true unless there is a valid reason to doubt their truthfulness. As noted above, I have also considered and applied Guideline 4 on gender considerations for submissions before the IRB, which offers guidance with respect to applying a trauma-informed approach to proceedings. The Guidelines note that an individual has experienced trauma may have certain difficulties in presenting their case, including recalling specific times, dates, and locations, recounting events in chronological order, and recalling certain events in full. I drew upon this to advise the claimant that she need not proactively volunteer particularly upsetting or traumatic information if I did not specifically question her on those points.\n\n[28] Guideline 9 similarly advises on the challenges of SOGIESC individuals and establishing their SOGIESC entity, noting that testimony may be the only evidence upon which they can draw where other forms of corroborative evidence are not reasonably available. However, in any event, I consider the adult claimant testified in a clear, straightforward, spontaneous manner, and that her testimony was consistent with the great deal of documentary evidence before me. She was able to speak candidly and coherently about her various relationships with women. Accordingly, on a balance of probabilities, I find the adult claimant was a credible witness as to her experiences of being a lesbian, and also being the repeated target of homophobic discrimination and violence because of her identity.\n\n[29] While I was initially concerned about some inconsistencies that appeared between the initial and subsequent versions of the adult claimant\u2019s narrative, I accept the inadequate representation she received from former Counsel and interpersonal conflicts with her former partner, IB, that resulted in the end of their relationship and disjoinder of their refugee claims, collectively, adequately, explain these factors. The claimants also provided personal documentation in support of the allegations as they were noted above, at Exhibit 8. These include civil documents, such as indicating the minor claimant has no legally reported father, and several items regarding the minor claimant\u2019s difficulties in school in Toronto.\n\n[30] Far more significantly, there are a large number of support letters. One (1) letter is dated October 17th, 2023, from a Toronto area interpreter, who I will call AA. AA reports that she has assisted the adult claimant a number of times in accessing services, and dealing with her landlord, and the minor claimant\u2019s school, as well as attesting to witnessing her previous relationship with IB, and membership in a Toronto area Latin LGBTQ2+ group, XXXX. Three (3) more letters dated in June And July 2023 come from organizers of that group, and a fellow member, who confirm the adult claimant\u2019s participation in activities, as well as giving generic statements about her good character. There are also attached a large number of photos of the adult claimant taking part in activities with other members of the group throughout 2020 to 2023.\n\n[31] Several other letters come from other Mexican nationals who \u2014 Mexican claim with the \u2014 who the adult claimant has assisted in Canada, likewise praising her character. Other letters originate in Mexico and are accompanied by copies of the author\u2019s Mexican electoral ID cards. Several of these are from transcribed \u2014 little specific information about the claimants\u2019 experiences, and so I will not delve into those in-depth.\n\n[32] Of the letters that are relevant, the first is from a friend, who I will call EY, in Veracruz, who is the minor claimant\u2019s godfather, dated May 31st, 2023. EY reports witnessing the adult claimant and IB being threatened by IB\u2019s, ex-partner and family, and as a gay man attests to his own experiences of discrimination and violence on that basis in Mexico. The second of these letters is from another friend, CC, from Veracruz, and dated May 28th, 2023. CC reports witnessing the adult claims relationship with TJ, and attests to TJ\u2019s family making threats and committing acts of violence against the adult claimant. The third letter is from the adult claimant\u2019s mother, GB, dated June 9th, 2023. GB recounts the events of her own very traumatic life and corroborates the adult claimant\u2019s allegations about NR in great detail, including specific information about NR\u2019s various criminal enterprises, dates of arrest, and imprisonment. She reiterates that NR\u2019s behaviour is erratic and violent, particularly when intoxicated, which he frequently is. Fourth letter is from TJ, and dated June 28th, 2023. While brief and somewhat vague, TJ concedes that their approximately four (4)-year relationship was a rocky one (1), and wishes the claimants well in Canada. The fifth letter is from CD, dated September 5th, 2023. She discusses in some detail how she and the adult claimant met and entered into their one (1)-year relationship, and admits and regrets her infidelity. Likewise, wishing the claimants well in Canada. Finally, Exhibit 10 includes also a XXXX\u2019s report from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX of North York, which discusses the XXXX the client has sought for her reported trauma and XXXX symptoms. It urges that I allow any accommodation request by the adult claimant during the hearing process.\n\n[33] I have no concerns with the credibility or reliability of any of these documents in particular. In conjunction with the claimant\u2019s testimony, I find it credibly established that she is a lesbian who has various \u2014 engaged in various relationships with men and women in the past, who has been abused by her stepfather, NR, who is a violent and potentially influential criminal, and targeted for homophobic harassment and violence by other persons in Mexico, including the families of her other partners, cartel operatives, and random persons on the street. Taking into account the advisories of Guideline 9 with regards to evidence in SOGIESC claims, I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities the adult claimant has credibly established subjectively well-founded fear of persecution on the basis of both gender and sexual orientation.\n\nObjective Basis\n\n[34] Under this heading, I turn first to NDP document 2.1, the Mexico human rights report, which notes that according to the Human Rights Commission, in the first eight (8) months of 2021, there were at least 50 hate crime homicides committed against the LGBTQIA+ community. There are reports the government did not always investigate and punish those complicit in the abuses. Polling in 2019 found that six (6) out of 10 LGBTIA respondents reported experiencing discrimination in the past 12 months, and more than half were subjected to hate speech and physical aggression. According to the Freedom in the World 2022 Index put out by the organization, Freedom House, and Item 2.8 of the NDP, Mexico putatively has strong legal protections for LGBTQ+ people, but these are not uniformly enforced, and may vary wildly depending on the attitudes of individual authorities.\n\n[35] Similarly, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, in a report on Mexico at Item 2.10 of the NDP, found that while 25 states have enacted discrimination protections for LGBTIA persons, and a number of states now permit equal marriage, over half of LGBTI persons surveyed reported they experience discrimination in schools, workplaces and 39 percent reported being the victim of aggression committed by agents of the state.\n\n[36] Item 6.2 was a response to information request concerning the situation of gender and sexual minorities in states of Yucatan and Nuevo Leon, and states that, according to sources, machismo is very much still embedded in Mexican culture, which increases homophobia and discrimination against sexual minorities. The same indicates that while there have \u2014 the document indicates that while there have been a number of changes in legislative-judicial health matters, the social situation in Mexico has changed very little, and violence discrimination are still very much present in society. Most sexual minorities have experienced acts of physical violence or harassment because of their orientation or gender identity.\n\n[37] Per Item 6.4, another Response to Information Request on the situation of sexual minorities in Mexico City, reporting by the UK\u2019s Guardian newspaper found rights of LGBTI people are still treated as exceptions to be granted at the discretion of local officials. According to United States country reports, cited in the same document, civil society groups claim that police routinely subjected LGBTI persons to mistreatment while in custody, even in supposedly, \u201cGay-friendly\u201d zones of the country and large cities. There may be gay clubs and bars, but there are also still, \u201cPolice officers that look for any way to intimidate and extort couples wherever they are.\u201d\n\n[38] With regards to being targeted for violence based on gender more broadly, NDP document 2.2 says that during 2023, 3,752 killings of women were reported, 969 of which were investigated as femicides. Calls to the 911 \u2014 emergency line report instances of violence against women rose during the year, with over 260,000 calls. Item 5.6 blames an increasing level of arbitrary violence, as well as the fact that men targeting women are often granted effective impunity by Mexico\u2019s judicial system. The likelihood of perpetrators being brought to justice is very low, regardless of circumstances or evidence, and it is reported that municipal authorities have often covered up and facilitated violence against women by refusing to conduct adequate investigations.\n\n[39] Document 5.10 further indicates that the inefficiency of the judiciary discourages many women from either making an initial complaint or going through the process. Sometimes these are due to institutions having an overload of work; other times, because of a lack of training; and many other times is because the institutional changes themselves share these traditional and macho values.\n\n[40] Further, within that document, The New York Times reports that law enforcement officials, authorities can be passive, complicit, or\u2013 and sometimes actively abusive towards women who try to report violence they experience. Such attitudes are pervasive throughout society, with even President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, popularly known as Amlo, consistently denying the extent of the problem and declaring against all evidence that \u201cMexican women have never been as protected as now\u201d, per document 4.6. He has similarly publicly claimed, per document 5.6, that 90 percent of all 911 calls concerning gender-based violence are false.\n\n[41] The claimants also disclosed several news items in their disclosure, which are reflective of these observations, reporting on police harassment of LGBTQ+ couples in public, and violence against women in the LGBTQ+ people, particularly lesbians and bisexual women, targeted private individuals, activists, leaders, and community institutions. I accept these as credibly reinforcing that such persecution is pervasive and widespread. Taking all this information into account, I am satisfied also that the claimants have established a well-founded, objective fear of persecution in Mexico on the basis of both gender and sexual orientation for the adult claimant, and as a member of her immediate family for the minor claimant.\n\nState Protection\/Internal State Alternative\n\n[42] While there is presumption that states can protect their own citizens except in a state of complete breakdown, that resumption has been rebutted with clear and convincing evidence, given the state\u2019s inability or unwillingness to protect its citizens. Taking into account the event evidence I have reviewed previously under the heading of objective basis, I considered credibly established that Mexican authorities are unwilling or unable to protect women or LGBTQ+ persons generally. I have also accepted as credible that, as the claimant reported, she and IB did attempt to report homophobic violence directed against her by IB\u2019s father, and authorities simply did nothing. Indeed, given the ponderance of the documentary evidence in the NDP regarding police corruption and the accountability in reforming of police officers, I find on a balance of probabilities that it was reasonable for the claimants to decide it would be pointless to further seek state protection. This is fully consistent with country conditions, suggesting that interactions between the LGBTQI+ individuals in police result in police portraying further violence or harassment.\n\n[43] Given this and the prevalence of attitudes towards LGBTQI+ persons from Mexico, I find similarly, on a balance of probabilities that the claimants would have no viable IFA. As I noted above, not even supposedly, \u201cGay-friendly\u201d neighborhoods of major cities are reliably safe to simply live one\u2019s life. The Rasaratnam test would thereby fail on the first prong, as a serious possibility of persecution would exist throughout the country.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[44] Based on the tally of evidence before me, I find the plaintiffs have established subjectively and objectively well-founded fear of persecution as a member of intersecting particular social groups in Mexico. On a forward-looking basis, there is a serious possibility they would face further violence and\/or discrimination amounting to persecution if they returned. Further, country conditions established they would have no resort to adequate state protection nor a viable IFA. These claims are therefore accepted.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

File number TC0-03751. Who claims to be a citizen of Mexico, and is claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n\n[4] In rendering my decisions, I have considered the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9, Proceedings Before the Immigration and Refugee Board Involving Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Expression, and Sex Characteristics.\n\n[5] The details of your allegations are fully set out in your Basis of Claim form. You identify as a transwoman. In Mexico, you face stigmatization, discrimination, social prejudice, physical and verbal abuse owing to your sexual identity.\n\n[6] I find that you are a Convention refugee (inaudible) to section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee (inaudible) Act, as there is a serious possibility of persecution here should you return to Mexico on account of your membership in a particular social group, mainly as a trans woman.\n\n[7] I find you are a citizen of Mexico in that your identity as a national of Mexico is established by the documents provided, including a certified true copy of your Mexican passport.\n\n[8] I find you to be a credible witness, and therefore, I believe what you have alleged in support of your claim. You have testified in a straightforward manner, and there were no relevant inconsistencies in your testimony or contradictions between your testimony and other evidence before me.\n\n[9] You and your Counsel have provided a plethora of supporting material, including a XXXX report, photographs and supporting letters from family and friends, the LGBTQ community and more, all of which corroborate your allegations.\n\n[10] The objective evidence indicates that while there has been legislative improvement, there continues to be harassment and discrimination of sexual minorities by society in Mexico. Whether you have submitted news articles and reports in support of your claim \u2014\n\n[11] INTERPRETER: Given the fact that he did not \u2014\n\n[12] MEMBER: Yes.\n\n[13] INTERPRETER: \u2014 supply?\n\n[14] MEMBER: You have submitted news articles and reports in support of your claim, which also highlights hate crimes, murders, mistreatment of sexual minorities in Mexico, including by the police.\n\n[15] The SOGIESC guideline states that individuals with diverse SOGIESC \u2014\n\n[16] INTERPRETER: What guideline? Sorry.\n\n[17] MEMBER: SOGIESC. S-O-G-I-E-S-C. May also face instances of harassment or discrimination \u2014\n\n[18] INTERPRETER: Sorry. SOGIESC guidelines? What? Sorry.\n\n[19] MEMBER: I will repeat that for you. The SOGIESC guideline states that individuals with diverse SOGIESC may also face instances of harassment or discrimination that cumulatively amount to persecution. The SOGIESC guideline goes further to provide a non-exhaustive list of factors to consider regarding cumulative discrimination amounting to persecution, including restrictions on employment, social services, health care, and harassment by police.\n\n[20] I find that you have established that you would face cumulative discrimination amounting to persecution if you return to Mexico, owing to being an individual who identifies as a transwoman.\n\n[21] The objective evidence indicates significant human rights issues, including reports of unlawful or arbitrary killings by police.\n\n[22] INTERPRETER: Sorry, madam, but I am not reading like you are. Sorry. And I am not even a simultaneous interpreter. I am just a consecutive interpreter, so \u2014\n\n[23] MEMBER: I will read shorter parts for you. Will that work?\n\n[24] INTERPRETER: Sometimes it loses sense if you read \u2014\n\n[25] MEMBER: Right. So, I will try and \u2014 okay.\n\n[26] The objective evidence indicates significant human rights issues, including reports of unlawful or arbitrary killings by police, military, and other government officials, forced disappearances by government agents, torture or degrading treatment by security forces, arbitrary arrest and detention, insufficient investigation of and accountability for gender-based violence, including crimes involving violence or threats of violence targeting lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and intersex persons.\n\n[27] INTERPRETER: Could you repeat all that sentence again, if you \u2014\n\n[28] MEMBER: You got it.\n\n[29] INTERPRETER: I have to take notes.\n\n[30] MEMBER: No problem. Crimes involving violence or threats targeting lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer or intersex persons. Impunity and extremely low rates of prosecution remains a problem for all crimes, including human rights abuses. This comes from the National Documentation Package for Mexico, July 31st, 2023 version, Item 2.1.\n\n[31] Based on the totality of the evidence, I find that although there is some mixed evidence and some evidence of efforts by the state to make improvements, there continues to be an absence of operationally effective state protection available to sexual minorities such as yourself.\n\n[32] Further, given the absence of operationally effective state protection and the presence of homophobia and violence against sexual minorities in Mexico, including by the police, I find that you would face a serious possibility of persecution throughout Mexico, and it is not objectively reasonable in all circumstances, including your particular circumstances, to relocate. Accordingly, I find that there is no viable internal flight alternative available to you.\n\n[33] I conclude that you are a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, and accordingly, I accept your claim.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",

The claimant is a citizen of Mexico and claims refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act or IRPA. I have considered and applied Guideline 4, Gender Considerations in Proceedings Before the Immigration and Refugee Board in my analysis and reasons.\n\nDETERMINATION\n\n[2] I find the claimant is a Convention refugee.\n\nAdministrative Issues\n\n[3] I note, first of all, the claimant\u2019s claim was originally joined to that of her mother, who I will call GR (ph), and her brother, who I will call AC (ph). GR and AC separately obtained permanent resident status in Canada via other means through the special (inaudible) application stream initiated during the COVID-19 pandemic, and they consequently withdrew their claims for refugee protection in late 2022. The claimant\u2019s claim was, however, and remains subsidiary to the allegations made by GR. GR attended the hearing as a witness. Given the consideration that the vast majority of events in the claimant\u2019s allegations occurred to GR and not the claimant herself, and GR was available to provide testimony, I proposed that I vary the order of questioning to question first GR, and then the claimant. Counsel agreed on behalf of the claimant that this was prudent. Accordingly, I have exercised my power under RPD Rule 70(b) to change the requirements of a rule after giving the party notice and opportunity to object, to vary the standard order of questioning indicated by RPD Rules 10(1)(5) and (6) and also limiting the questioning of the claimant herself.\n\nALLEGATIONS\n\n[4] The facts and events alleged in support of the claim are set out in the claimant\u2019s Basis of Claim form, attached narrative, and amended narrative set out at Exhibits 2 and 4. To summarize, GR and her family, meaning the claimant and AC, lived in Morelia, Michoac\u00e1n. GR began working for the XXXX XXXX XXXX in 2006 in various XXXX positions throughout the areas (inaudible). In the course of this employment, she observed irregularities and records that suggest widespread corruption and financial fraud. After a change of government in 2015, a new XXXX of (inaudible), who I will call VL (ph), and new XXXX XXXX, who I will call RO (ph), were appointed as GR\u2019s superiors. She found RO was particularly misogynistic towards her in the workplace.\n\n[5] From 2016, GR began having difficulties at work, particularly that her access to records she required to fulfill her requests from XXXX was revoked. Soon after that, she began receiving threatening anonymous calls warning her to cooperate and do as she was told, and consequently changed her phone number twice. GR soon gathered new management had been installed to assist in easing the new XXXX XXXX\u2019s plans for corruption by arranging for his own companies to be awarded XXXX XXXX.\n\n[6] GR\u2019s experiences worsened further in 2018, when RO and VL hid or kept necessary information from her and directed her to lie to XXXX. Additionally, RO had been consistently sexually harassing GR at work. In XXXX 2018, this worsened as well in an instant where RO summoned her to his office to grope her and complained that she did not, \u201cGet along\u201d with him like she did with other members of management. She complained to VL, who was similarly misogynistic and dismissed RO\u2019s behaviour as acceptable and expected. After this, the sexual harassment increased dramatically.\n\n[7] At the end of XXXX 2018, VL threatened to not renew GR\u2019s contract that had otherwise been done regularly without objection until that point if she did not, \u201cCooperate.\u201d In XXXX 2018, GR filed an official sexual harassment complaint. She was unable to attest \u2014 convince anyone to attest as a witness to RO\u2019s behaviour, as her coworkers were fearful to become involved. And to the best of her knowledge, nothing was done. After this, GR received an anonymous call falsely claiming to have kidnapped the claimant and threatening the family further if GR did not withdraw her complaint and allow the XXXX to be blocked, prompting her to again change her phone number.\n\n[8] In XXXX 2018, GR\u2019s contract was not renewed, and therefore she was terminated without cause or explanation and filed an unjust dismissal lawsuit. Following that, she began receiving further anonymous threat calls at her new phone number from persons claiming to be with the Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generaci\u00f3n, or CJNG. Indeed, in one (1) occasion XXXX 2018, she was visiting property out of town she inherited from her father in the community of XXXX XXXX XXXX, Michoac\u00e1n. She observed that she was being followed around in a vehicle. The friends accompanying her believed it was likely members of the local CJNG, and GR decided to quickly return to Morelia. While she was on that trip, the claimant and AC received a threatening call from persons who said they had kidnapped her and demanded a ransom. They only learned that GR was safe when she arrived home.\n\n[9] In XXXX \u2014 on XXXX XXXX, 2018, the claimant was walking home when she was attacked by two (2) men in a motorcycle. Punched her in the face and threatened that next time they would kill her if her mother did not shut up. There was also an instant where the claimant\u2019s brother, AC, was attempted to be kidnapped while working at his job at a XXXX in town. GR retained a lawyer who advised throughout late 2018 that she could file criminal complaints against persons involved at her old job, but the process would be lengthy and likely put the entire family in further danger due to official corruption and police collaboration with cartels. She again consulted the lawyer after the incident where the claimant was assaulted on the street but decided not to proceed with a complaint and, after the last time speaking with the lawyer, made arrangements to leave Mexico.\n\n[10] The family arrived in XXXX 2018 and initiated claims for protection several weeks later. As noted above, GR and AC then subsequently withdrew their claims in 2022 after obtaining permanent resident status in Canada by other means. The claimant herself continues to fear being targeted by the agents of persecution who threatened her mother, but also herself and AC as children.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nIdentity\n\n[11] The claimant\u2019s personal identity and Mexican nationality were established based on a copy of her Mexican passport and her testimony. I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the claimant has established her identity.\n\nNexus\n\n[12] As described in the claimant\u2019s narrative recounting GR\u2019s narrative, GR and her children were evidently targeted both because of GR\u2019s refusal to take part in corruption, and in retribution for GR pushing back against and filing an official complaint about ongoing sexual harassment in her workplace. The former has \u2014 reason and has no nexus to the Convention, as honest persons who decline to engage in criminal activity is not a particular social group with an changing or immutable characteristic. However, on the basis of the allegations, it is clear to me the harassment, threats, and violence experienced by GR and the claimant do have a gendered component.\n\n[13] Per the courts in the cases of Asghar \u2013 that is A-S-G-H-A-R \u2013 2005 FC 768, and Gonzalez, G-O-N-Z-A-L-E-Z, 2002 FCT 345, where the primary alleged victim of persecution does not have a nexus to the Convention, such as an \u2013 the target of a purely personal criminal vendetta, a derivative claim based on familial connection which is, \u201cIn no way related to discrimination or fundamental human rights\u201d, per Gonzalez, will not have nexus either. However, conversely, the family member of someone targeted in such a way can have access to the Convention. Notwithstanding, the claimant herself was not directly subjected to sexual harassment in the workplace or targeted for refusal to cooperate with corruption. She is a woman and her mother\u2019s immediate family member, and I am satisfied the allegations indicate that she was targeted for harm because of gender, at least in part. She therefore has nexus to the Convention as a member of a particular social group, and I accordingly assess the allegations under both sections 96 and 97(1)(b) of the IPRA.\n\nCredibility\n\n[14] Per the case of Maldonado, where the claimant swears that certain facts are true, this creates a presumption that they are true unless there is a valid reason to doubt their truthfulness. As noted above, I have also considered and applied Guideline 4 on Gender Considerations in Proceedings Before the Immigration and Refugee Board, which offers guidance with respect to the application of a trauma-informed approach to proceedings. The Guidelines note that an individual who has experienced trauma may have certain difficulties in presenting their case, including recalling specific times, dates, and locations, recounting events in chronological order, and even recalling certain events in full. I considered that the claimant and GR testified in a clear, straightforward, spontaneous manner and that the testimony was consistent with all the documentary evidence before me. Accordingly, on balance of probabilities, I find that the claimant and GR were credible witnesses as to their experiences, and therefore I believe that the accounts of being targeted for threats, harassment, and violence by unknown CJNG-affiliated persons were truthful and reliable.\n\n[15] I reviewed also the claimant\u2019s disclosure in Exhibit 4, much of which relates to establishing GR\u2019s employment in the circumstances. For instance, there is a reference letter from a former colleague attesting to her work with the XXXX XXXX, and the entire originating statement of claim in her wrongful dismissal action against the XXXX as prepared by her lawyer, who I will name MO (ph), here. MO has also provided two (2) letters from XXXX 2018 and XXXX 2023, recounting how GR sought legal advice on this matter, as well as even considering a criminal complaint. MO does, as indicated in the claimant\u2019s narrative, state that this would be a difficult and likely counter-productive effort that would put the family in more danger. The claimant has additionally provided documentation of the physical attack on her in XXXX 2018, including photographs, medical report, and XXXX report. And there was also a letter from AC, with his own account of the incident where he was targeted for kidnapping in 2018. I have no concerns with any of this documentary evidence and consider that it generally corroborates the claimant\u2019s narrative on this basis, as well as the testimony of both herself and her mother, GR. I find on a balance of probabilities the claimant has established a subjectively well-founded fear of persecution.\n\nObjective Basis\n\n[16] Gender-based violence is exceptionally common in Mexico. Documents 5.10, 2.1, and 2.2 of the National Documentation Package for Mexico all discuss the thousands of killings of women reported every year throughout the country, many of which are specifically investigated as femicides. Per Document 5.21, femicide, that is to say the intentional murder of women because they are women, is closely linked to traditional Mexican culture such as the notion of machismo, wherein men believe they are entitled and required to resort to physical violence to assert control over women. Indeed, \u201cMachismo culture increases the likelihood that Mexican women will become victims of physical abuse. The more a situation escalates, the more likely it is that the abuse will result in femicide.\u201d Similarly, Document 5.23 observes that a 2016 survey found that nearly 44 percent of women responding reported being physically, emotionally, and\/or sexually abused by a partner.\n\n[17] In Document 2.5, a 2018 report of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, concern is noted for the, \u201cVery high number of femicides done in Mexico and the level of impunity\u201d the country experiences. Indeed, Document 5.6 blames this increasing level of arbitrary violence against women to the fact that men targeting women are often granted effective impunity by Mexico\u2019s judicial system. The likelihood of perpetrators being brought to justice is very low, regardless of any context or evidence found. The evidence indicates also that municipal authorities have covered up and even facilitated violence against women by refusing to conduct adequate investigations.\n\n[18] With regards to the CJNG, per Document 7.2 of the NDP, that cartel is based in the State of Jalisco and were originally known as the, \u201cZeta Killers\u201d. In 2015, the Mexican Government designated the CJNG as one (1) of the most dangerous in the country, and one (1) with a national reach as they are known to have a presence in at least 27 out of 32 Mexican states. With regards to how women are treated by cartels, per NDP Item 5.20, gang culture is a significant factor in organized crime related femicide. Women are considered disposable, and violence committed against them represents gang cohesion and masculinity. The evidence describes the underworld of organized crime as very subject to that machismo I mentioned about, with patriarchal and sexist undertones.\n\n[19] Further, per NDP Document 7.8, cartels may be highly motivated to track and retaliate against individuals who they believe might have gone to authorities as cooperative informants or witnesses, or anyone with, \u201cPrivileged or sensitive information about their activities\u201d. I note in this regard that GR did indicate that she had a great deal of information with regards to the corrections she observed during her work with the XXXX XXXX. And again, per Document 7.8, if a cartel with national reach has the motivation to find a person, they generally can, including with the assistance of allied corrupt officials. Sources in that document are indicated to vary, but claim that somewhere between 60 to 80 percent of police forces are fully controlled or substantially influenced by organized crime in this manner.\n\n[20] The claimant\u2019s documentary disclosure in Exhibit 4 similarly reflects this context with a number of recent newspaper articles from 2022 and 2023 concerning femicides and other forms of violence against women in Mexico. It is indicated to be an ever-growing problem which has grown alongside official corruption. There are also several articles about the violence and reach of this CJNG. Given the claimant and her mother\u2019s credible testimony and this corroborative documentary evidence, I accept on the balance of probabilities that the fear of persecution on the basis of gender is both subjectively and objectively well-founded.\n\nState Protection\/Internal Flight Alternative\n\n[21] I consider that it is well-established with evidence from the National Documentation Package that there is no effective state protection with regards to violence against women in Mexico. According to Document 7.22, \u201cContinual corruption, weakness, and lack of confidence in Mexican law enforcement, particularly of local and state police forces but also the federal police, have created a bedrock climate of impunity.\u201d Per Document 2.4, no meaningful attempts have been made to protect local populations from the violence that occurs daily throughout the country, and per Document 2.3 it is indicated once again that Mexican authorities routinely fail to investigate crimes or provide justice for victims due to rampant corruption and complicity with criminals.\n\n[22] Item 5.10 indicates further that the inefficiency of judiciary institutions in this regard discourage many women from either making an initial complaint or going through the process. Sometimes, this is due to the institutions having an overload of work, other times because of a lack of training, and other \u2014 many other times it is because the institutional agents themselves share these traditional macho values. As a result, punishment reparation processes simply wear down complainants by asking them to devote time and resources (inaudible) unnecessarily complicated procedures, which then result in procedural failures (inaudible) invalidating the claimant\u2019s complaints. In many cases, even those who deliver justice side with the attackers. Even more so if the latter have political power or influence, which results in even more impunity. Further claimed in that document, the New York Times reports that the law enforcement officials can be passive, complicit, or sometimes even actively abusive towards women who try to report violence that they experience.\n\n[23] Such attitudes are pervasive throughout society with even President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, popularly known as AMLO, insistently denying the extent of the problem and declaring against all evidence that, \u201cMexican women have never been as protected as now\u201d, per Document 4.6. He has similarly publicly claimed, per Document 5.6, that 90 percent of all 911 calls concerning gender-based violence are false. I note also in this regard GR\u2019s reported experiences in attempting to pursue the, \u201cProper\u201d way of seeking justice through courts and other authorities. She reported that her sexual harassment complaint was ignored, and her refusal to participate in corruption resulted in her being targeted for threats and violence, including against her family. Further, after that point she sought legal advice and was told that it would be fruitless, and would even likely put the family in more danger, to make a criminal denunciation.\n\n[24] Given this and the extensive objective evidence I have cited above, I find on a balance of probabilities that the claimant would have no adequate state protection if she returned to Mexico. The presumption is thoroughly rebutted. The agents of persecution would have effective impunity to continue targeting the claimant, and did in fact indicate in their last encounter they intended to kill her.\n\n[25] I considered also the matter of internal flight alternative. In this respect, I note that the agents of persecutions include persons who were or \u2013 sorry, are or were more recently XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX who would more likely than not have access to some kind of confidential data, and who I have accepted as credibly established to be allied with one (1) of Mexico\u2019s most powerful cartels. As I have indicated above, the objective country conditions outlined in Document 7.8 suggest the CJNG would be motivated to continue pursuing the claimant with regards to GR impeding the free exercise of (inaudible) in the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and also having the audacity to object to her corrupt superior sexual harassment. And if they have that motivation, they would be able to track her down. On a balance of probabilities I therefore find the claimant would continue to face a serious possibility of persecution wherever she might relocate in Mexico. And given this, the Rasaratnam test would fail at the first prong. The claimant would have no viable IFA.\n\nCONCLUSION\n[26] Based on the totality of evidence before me, I find the claimant has established a subjectively and objectively well-founded fear of persecution on the basis of gender in Mexico. There is a serious possibility of harm on a forward-looking basis. Further, country conditions in the claimant\u2019s own evidence and testimony, as well as the evidence and testimony of her mother GR, lead me conclude that the claimant would have neither access to adequate or effective state protection, nor a viable IFA in Mexico. This claim is therefore accepted.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n",
